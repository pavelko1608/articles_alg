VThe current legal immigration system, where the United States admits more than one million low-skilled immigrants a year, is necessary \u201cas baby boomers retire,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 editors claim.\u000a\u000aIn a new piece in the Times, the newspaper\u2019s editors joined The Washington Post in their disdain for the RAISE Act by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), which could cut current legal immigration levels in half to relieve American wages, proponents argue.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Times\u2019 editors claim the RAISE Act\u2013 endorsed by President Trump last week\u2013would \u201cdo nothing\u201d to help Americans, despite a slew of research and reports indicating that a slowdown could benefit the current population:\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has endorsed legislation that would slash legal immigration by half, mainly by cutting the number of visas granted to relatives of citizens, while favoring people who speak English and have advanced degrees. The bill, which would do nothing to solve the country\u2019s immigration and economic challenges, is unlikely to become law. The only way to understand Mr. Trump\u2019s vocal support of an obvious turkey is as yet another attempt to energize his dwindling base of right-wing and nativist supporters.\u000a\u000aProponents of the bill argue that it could:\u000a\u000aReduce the number of Green Cards given out every year from about one million to 500,000;\u000a\u000aPrioritize immediate family households, thus ending extended family chain migration to the U.S.;\u000a\u000aCreate a visa program for U.S. citizens to bring elderly parents to U.S. for caretaking purposes;\u000a\u000aEliminate the diversity lottery, where 50,000 visas are \u201carbitrarily allocated\u201d every year; and\u000a\u000aCap permanent U.S. refugees resettlement to 50,000 migrants per year.\u000a\u000aBut, according to the Times\u2019 editors, the current levels of legal immigration are needed so that baby boomers can retire:\u000a\u000aMoreover, as studies have repeatedly shown, immigration boosts productivity and economic growth; restricting it would have the opposite effect. Growth is determined by the changes in productivity \u2014 how much each worker produces \u2014 and the size of the work force. Productivity in recent decades has been growing more slowly than in the past for reasons that economists do not fully understand. The labor force is also growing slowly as baby boomers retire. Restricting immigration would reinforce both trends.\u000a\u000aThe Times\u2019 editorial against the RAISE Act echoes the Post\u2019s, as Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aLike the Times\u2019 editorial, the Washington Post fixated on the necessity for mass immigration to continue a 2 percent gross domestic product growth rate.\u000a\u000aUnlike the Times, the Washington Post admitted what immigration hawks have said, which is that high levels of legal immigration depress the wages of domestic workers.\u000a\u000aJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

aVCongress still has the opportunity to repeal the long-delayed health insurance tax that will take effect in 2018, even with the Obamacare repeal stymied by moderate Republicans in the Senate.\u000a\u000aObamacare created the health insurance tax, which places a direct tax on insurance premiums. Democrats designed the tax to be calculated based on insurance premiums, meaning that the cost of the tax would pass directly to small businesses and middle-class families through higher premiums. The health insurance even impacts seniors through Medicare Advantage plans and low-income Americans that rely on Medicaid managed plans.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Heritage Foundation reported that if Republicans fail to repeal the health insurance tax (HIT), premiums would increase by an additional two to three percent.\u000a\u000aThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the HIT will cost $12.3 billion next year and collect over $145 billion in higher taxes over the next ten years.\u000a\u000aThe American Action Forum estimated that the tax will increase premiums by almost $5,000 over a decade and that Americans making less than $50,000 will pay half of the tax.\u000a\u000aThe National Federation of Independent Business contends that the tax could cost up to 286,000 in new jobs and cost small businesses $33 billion in lost sales in the next six year.\u000a\u000aNorth Carolina State Treasurer Dale Folwell noted that if Congress does not eliminate the health insurance tax, Medicare Advantage plans in the state would increase by 30 percent in 2018. In North Carolina, the state would save roughly $45 million if Congress eliminated the tax. In North Carolina alone, the HIT tax could impact 843,724 small businesses and 1,600,000 workers.\u000a\u000aAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) noted that more than 100 Democrats and 250 Republicans voted to delay the health insurance tax.\u000a\u000aAfter Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) halted the Obamacare repeal in the Senate, Sen. Lamar Alexander announced he would hold hearings on bipartisan solutions to stabilize the health care market. It remains possible that a revived Obamacare repeal effort or a bipartisan bill could include the repeal of the health insurance tax.\u000a\u000aModerate House lawmakers suggested that they could repeal the medical device tax and other taxes in their proposed bipartisan legislation.\u000a\u000aThe Stop the HIT Coalition, which represents millions of small business owners, urged the Senate for a repeal of the health insurance tax in any health care legislation. HIT said:\u000a\u000aWith small business owners and middle-class families facing a $14.3 billion tax hike in 2018 alone, Congress must take urgent action now to repeal the health insurance tax once and for all. There is already bipartisan consensus on the need for repeal, and now is the time for Congress to protect millions of small business owners and their employees from this harmful tax.\u000a\u000aGrover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, argued, \u201cPresident Trump and the Republican majority in Congress promised an agenda of lower taxes, more jobs, higher wages, and lower healthcare costs through reduced premiums. They can ensure that they are able to fully keep that promise by delaying the health insurance tax immediately.\u201d

aVWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A long-simmering dispute between two top White House aides has boiled into a public battle over the direction of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy, with a cadre of conservative groups pushing for the ouster of national security adviser H.R. McMaster.\u000a\u000aIn recent days, conservative groups and a website tied to Trump adviser Steve Bannon have targeted McMaster as insufficiently supportive of Israel and insufficiently tough toward Iran. They\u2019ve expressed outrage about the firings of several aides regarded as sympathetic to their views. An online campaign \u2014 under the hashtag #FireMcMaster \u2014 prompted Trump to declare his support for his adviser.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe dispute reflects the tensions at the heart of Trump\u2019s foreign policy coalition. McMaster is one of several powerful generals in Trump\u2019s orbit who hail from the Republican foreign policy establishment. But Trump is equally sympathetic to the views of firebrands like Bannon, who are trying to push the party in a new, isolationist direction embodied by his \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine.\u000a\u000aMcMaster and Bannon have clashed loudly and repeatedly during recent White House discussions over Afghanistan war strategy, according to four administration officials and outside advisers. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss private conversations.\u000a\u000aAfghanistan, however, represents only the latest dispute between McMaster and Bannon, who\u2019ve also fought over White House personnel.\u000a\u000aMcMaster, an Army general, recently purged three National Security Council officials who were viewed as close to Bannon or to Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s previous national security adviser. For people close to Bannon, the moves were seen as telling. The former chief of Breitbart News, who wants Trump to upend the Washington foreign policy establishment, has bitterly argued against further U.S. entanglement in global conflicts and believes McMaster is adhering to holdover Obama administration policies.\u000a\u000aBreitbart, which holds significant influence in Trump\u2019s White House, has promoted a series of anti-McMaster headlines on its website. The Zionist Organization of America on Monday announced it has undertaken a review of McMaster\u2019s views on Israel. Dozens of conservative and alt-right social media stars have hammered the national security adviser on Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe outcry grew so loud that Trump responded Friday: \u201cGeneral McMaster and I are working very well together. He is a good man and very pro-Israel. I am grateful for the work he continues to do serving our country.\u201d\u000a\u000aMonths earlier, Trump also defended his adviser, taking a printout of a story suggesting he might fire McMaster and scrawling on it with a Sharpie pen, \u201cThis is bull\u2014-. You\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d along with his signature. He had it delivered to McMaster, according to someone who speaks regularly with officials in the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aBut privately, Trump has at times expressed some dissatisfaction with McMaster and rued losing Flynn, according to people who have spoken with the president. The White House has said Flynn was dismissed because he did not tell White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the full extent of his contacts with Russian officials.\u000a\u000aTrump often vents about aides without making changes. And McMaster\u2019s position was strengthened by the recent appointment of ret. Gen. John Kelly as Trump\u2019s chief of staff.\u000a\u000aBannon\u2019s allies say the recent dismissals are evidence that McMaster is ridding the National Security Council of Trump supporters while deferring to career officials left over from former President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure. They also chafe at McMaster\u2019s involvement in removing Bannon from a prominent role on the NSC earlier this year.\u000a\u000aAmong those fired: White House intelligence adviser Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Flynn protégé who previously clashed with CIA leaders.\u000a\u000aThe Iran nuclear deal also has been a source of disagreement. That Obama-era pact is opposed by Israel and prominent GOP donor Sheldon Adelson, who backs the Zionist Organization of America group that attacked McMaster. Trump has repeatedly denounced the accord, even as he has granted Iran continued relief from U.S. sanctions under the arrangement. McMaster was among the Trump aides advocating for that course.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aLemire reported from New York.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Klapper at http://twitter.com/@BKlapperAP

aVAs municipalities in deep-blue Maryland continue to grant legal and illegal aliens access to the ballot box, one leftist is pushing for a larger movement to combat the \u201cmass disenfranchisement\u201d of non-U.S. citizens in the Trump era.\u000a\u000aCollege Park, Maryland, home to the main campus for the University of Maryland and roughly 20,000 residents overall, is currently reviewing a policy that would open regular ballot access to illegal aliens for municipal elections. While the town would be the largest to do so in the Mid-Atlantic, it would not be the first. The Baltimore Sun reports that College Park would be the eleventh city between Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties; both sharing boundaries with Washington, D.C.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe legality of such proposals and policies are not under question in Maryland, which is why the illegal alien voting rights movement sees consistent success. State law has allowed for townships to determine voter eligibility for municipal elections going back to the mid-1800s. The local paper notes that Barnesville in Montgomery County maintains the longest-running rule, dating back to 1918. The trend began picking up steam in the 1970s with larger jurisdictions joining in thereafter.\u000a\u000aThe Sun also adds that a certain foreign influence in elections has come into play: \u201csupport for noncitizen voting here has also been driven by the large numbers of diplomatic staff who work in Washington and live in the Maryland suburbs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJustifications for illegal alien voting rights tend to follow similar tracks in local and national debates. Perhaps the most common argument is the \u201cwe\u2019ve allowed them to vote before\u201d angle. While the United States has experimented with franchise eligibility over the ages, current federal law prohibits any non-U.S. citizen from participating in an election, much less registering to vote. Felony convictions, deportation, and barriers to naturalization are all intended deterrents\u2014despite the fact that no requirement rests on voter registrars to verify claims of citizenship during the process.\u000a\u000aOther liberal states show serious conversations on illegal alien voting increase recently. One activist in California is now dialing up the rhetoric well beyond historic claims and appeals to broadening \u201cdemocracy\u201d, favoring political overtones.\u000a\u000aJoe Matthews writes in the Sacramento Bee that it\u2019s time to \u201cgo on offense\u201d against President Donald Trump\u2019s larger concerns for election integrity by empowering noncitizens to vote.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven Trump\u2019s threats to both immigrants and democracy, this is the moment to give the franchise back to noncitizens,\u201d Matthews argues. He also compares California to an \u201capartheid\u201d state until it grants voting rights to all present:\u000a\u000aCalifornia is home to about five million adults (that\u2019s one-in-six adults) who can\u2019t vote because they\u2019re not citizens. This mass disenfranchisement is an affront to American principles. Taxation without representation? Noncitizens pay taxes, but are not represented. Consent of the governed? Noncitizens must follow our laws \u2013 but can\u2019t vote to consent. Home of the brave? Noncitizens serve in the military but can\u2019t vote for the government that sends them to war. We Californians tolerate this apartheid, even though the lesser status of noncitizens \u2013 especially the 2 million-plus undocumented Californians \u2013 makes them more vulnerable to abuse and removal from the country they\u2019ve helped build. To its credit, California has taken steps on behalf of noncitizens, who now enjoy in-state tuition to our public universities, driver\u2019s licenses, the ability to practice the law, and \u2013 if they are children \u2013 state-funded health care.\u000a\u000aRather than admitting that the referenced actions are pathways to naturalization, the activist contends that \u201cCalifornians won\u2019t be equal\u201d until all have ballots, only further blurring the distinctions between citizen and not. The column laments the fact, however, that Governor Jerry Brown (D) serves as a major impediment to statewide change, given his record of opposing such matters.\u000a\u000aWhile Maryland and select portions of New York, California, and Illinois struggle with granting voting rights to illegal aliens, Virginia was recently reported to be identifying and removing non-U.S. citizens from voter rolls at an alarming rate. The Public Interest Legal Foundation found more than 5,500 voters were canceled by the Commonwealth over citizenship concerns in May, Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aLocal clerks in Maryland report that steps are taken to keep illegal aliens from voting in races they are not eligible for, should elections be held on the same day. Takoma Park told the Baltimore paper that separate registration lists are kept to prevent ballot confusion.\u000a\u000aThe College Park City Council is slated to debate the measure on Tuesday, August 8.\u000a\u000aLogan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

aVMany in the NFL have begun to rally behind out of work San Francisco 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick, while decrying team owners as \u201ccowards,\u201d or \u201cracists,\u201d for not signing the anthem-protesting quarterback. However, some sources are now saying that Kaepernick actually turned down a team\u2019s offer in order to incite a racially driven media backlash that would yield the controversial quarterback more money.\u000a\u000aA source to the Daily Caller, \u201cclaims Kaep himself has turned down at least one contract in the hopes of stirring up a media frenzy that eventually leads to a more lucrative deal for the 27-year-old vet.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cKaepernick allegedly doesn\u2019t want to make \u201cbackup money\u201d and specifically instructed his representative team not to sign one contract offered at the league\u2019s minimum rate of $900,000 per year for a seventh-year player.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Daily Caller\u2019s source also claims that the controversial player fired the sports agency which has represented him since he came in the league. In their place, Kaepernick seems to be taking advice from his outspoken girlfriend, Nessa Diab.\u000a\u000aDiab recently sparked criticism herself when she posted a photo to Twitter that seemed to attack the owner of the only team currently considering Kaepernick. The photo compared Baltimore Ravens Owner Steve Bisciotti to the racist character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in Django Unchained. The photo also compared Raven legend Ray Lewis to the house slave character portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, in the same film.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Daily Caller\u2019s NFL source, this whole situation has gone to Kaepernick\u2019s head.\u000a\u000a\u201cColin thinks he\u2019s fighting a much higher battle than he is,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe views himself as a race messiah.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome race activists are hoping to use Colin Kaepernick\u2019s unemployment as a tool to raise more racism claims. For instance, activist Dr. Harry Edwards, who has consulted with Kaepernick, threatened that if Kaepernick didn\u2019t end up on a team this year, there would be trouble.\u000a\u000aIn an interview on Sirius XM, Edwards said, \u201c\u2026I fully expect one [team to sign him], because it\u2019s in the best interest of the league to have him on a team.\u201d But Edwards went on to warn that if Kaepernick did not get hired, the NFL would have a problem on its hands.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t just up and write off black protests as if this were 1950,\u201d Edwards said.\u000a\u000aBut if the sources are correct that Kaepernick has turned down at least one offer to use his status as a race protester to bargain for more money, that would certainly call into question the integrity of his protest. Making him less the put upon and aggrieved black NFL player standing up for racial justice, and more of a calculating and arrogant agitator using his status for personal gain.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.

All three previously received convictions for sexual crimes against children before being deported to their home countries.\u000a\u000aIn a three-day period ending on Monday, Border Patrol agents arrested three men from Guatemala, Mexico, and Honduras after they illegally crossed the Texas/Mexico Border. All three of the men had criminal records that include convictions for sexual crimes against young children, according to a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aOn Friday evening, agents working from the Rio Grande City Station arrested a Guatemalan man near the town of Roma, Texas. Roma is a small town located along the Mexican border west of Rio Grande City. Agents took the man to their station to process him for removal when they learned the Guatemalan national has a criminal history. A court in Palm Beach County, Florida, convicted the criminal alien on a charge of Sexual Assault on a Person Less Than 12 Years of Age. The court sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The date of the crime, his release, and subsequent deportation was not revealed.\u000a\u000aLess than 24 hours later, agents assigned to the McAllen Station arrested a Mexican national near the border town of Mission, Texas. After returning to their station, agents learned the man also has a sexual criminal history. Salt Lake City, Utah, police arrested the criminal alien and charged him with Sexual Abuse of a Child. A judge sentenced the man to 30 days in jail and 36 months probation. He also has an outstanding warrant on a drug charge from Arizona.\u000a\u000aAgents assigned to the Falfurrias Station arrested a Honduran national attempting to bypass the Border Patrol Checkpoint located in Brooks County, 80 miles north of the border. During processing, the agents learned this man also has a history of sexual crimes. The Plainfield, New Jersey, Police Department arrested the man on charges of Endangering the Welfare of a Child, Sexual Assault of a victim less than 13-years-old, and Aggravated Criminal Sexual Contact. The court convicted him on the charge of Criminal Sexual Contact and sentenced him to 63 months in prison.\u000a\u000aThe three criminal alien sex offenders will likely face charges in the Southern District of Texas federal court for illegal re-entry after removal as a sex offender, a felony charge.\u000a\u000aBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

aVCell phone video has emerged of an officer pointing a gun at a passenger for over nine minutes after pulling over the vehicle.\u000a\u000aThe incident occurred just outside of San Jose. The officer was with the Campbell Police Department and was on a police motorcycle.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to the Washington Post, the officer stopped the car after radar allegedly showed it traveling at 85 mph. The officer then asked the occupants for a driver\u2019s license and paperwork related to vehicle registration, leading the two occupants digging around inside the car for the requested materials.\u000a\u000aAt one point, the stories being told by the driver and the passenger \u201cdiverged,\u201d and the passenger allegedly reached under his seat. The officer responded by pointing a gun at him.\u000a\u000aCNN HLN posted a condensed video of the incident. In it, viewers can hear the passenger asking the officer to quit pointing a gun at him, but the officer is unfazed by the requests.\u000a\u000aThe couple was eventually allowed to go, and the Campbell Police Department released a statement in support of the officer. One portion of the statement says:\u000a\u000aThe officer informed the occupants to wait in the vehicle as he prepared to walk back to his motorcycle to write a citation. It was at that time that the passenger began reaching under his seat. It is not clear why the passenger chose to reach under the seat since the officer was not requesting any other paperwork. Unfortunately, the passenger\u2019s unexpected movement towards the bottom of the seat, caused the officer to perceive a threat and draw his handgun. The officer requested additional officers respond to assist him so that he could safely resolve the situation. The comments on the Facebook video bring up a lot of different viewpoints about how the officer could have responded differently or used different tactics. Our officers receive a tremendous amount of training on a consistent basis and that training is what dictates our response. This is intended to protect our officers as well as those they come in contact with. The unfortunate reality is sometimes people attack police officers, as tragically occurred in the City of Los Banos this morning when two officers were shot.\u000a\u000aHLN reports that the passenger apologized for his exchanges with the officer.\u000a\u000aAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

aVSen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) wants Republicans to embrace the foolish Republican National Committee\u2019s (RNC) \u201cautopsy\u201d report, which was released after Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 loss and recommended amnesty for illegal immigrants as its only policy solution.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Monday, Flake said Republicans had to be a \u201cmore welcoming party\u201d on immigration and said cutting legal immigration in half, as President Donald Trump proposed last week, is going in the \u201cwrong direction.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aFlake has been promoting his book in which he trashes Trump and his America-first nationalist and populist movement in order to adored by media elites as the \u201cenlightened\u201d and oh-so-intelligent \u201cRepublican.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe proudly embraces the \u201cglobalist\u201d moniker in his new book and has suggested that Congress should try again to pass the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d comprehensive amnesty bill. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Flake\u2019s fellow Gang of Eight teammate, told the Arizona Republic that he would like to work with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to pass the Gang of Eight\u2019s amnesty bill when he returns to Congress from his cancer treatments.\u000a\u000aFlake said he was \u201cvery heartened\u201d by the poorly-named and foolish \u201cautopsy\u201d report and said the party seems to \u201chave abandoned\u201d the autopsy report\u2019s sole policy recommendation\u2013amnesty for illegal immigrants. He added that Republicans needed to play a game of \u201caddition\u201d rather than subtraction even though Trump attracted millions of working-class voters from all backgrounds who had never been involved in politics before while doing better than Mitt Romney among \u201cpeople of color.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News has pointed out, \u201cbefore the dust was even settled after the 2012 presidential election,\u201d the RNC \u201cpublished its poorly-named autopsy report in which the only policy recommendation was amnesty for illegal immigrants. GOP establishment consultants also convinced [Senator Marco] Rubio to break his campaign promise and be the face of the \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 bill because they thought passing amnesty legislation was the only way back to the White House. Nearly every single Republican consultant and legacy media figure on television parroted the conventional wisdom: Republicans could not win the White House in 2016 if they did not pass amnesty legislation.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s win in 2016 showed how foolish this \u201cadvice\u201d was as he won states like Pennsylvania and Michigan that establishment Republicans had not been able to win in a generation. In addition, to add insult to injury to the GOP establishment\u2019s favorite talking point, Trump did better among people of color than Romney even though Trump opposed illegal immigration and promised to build a border wall.\u000a\u000aRevealing how clueless legacy media anchors still are about GOP politics and the country\u2019s voters, Blitzer did not ask the obvious follow-up question to Flake about whether adopting the \u201cautopsy\u201d report\u2019s policy recommendation on immigration would cause Republicans to lose elections.

aVKayleigh McEnany, formerly of CNN and now the Republican National Committee\u2019s new spokeswoman, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily to stress the importance that Republicans unify behind President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u000a\u000aMarlow praised the RNC\u2019s choice by praising McEnany for her ability to communicate with \u201csuper brainiacs,\u201d thanks to her Harvard Law education, and also \u201cspeak to the regular public,\u201d which is \u201cincreasingly skeptical of the establishment media.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to communicate directly with the American people. You know what that means? It means going out and actually talking to the people,\u201d said McEnany.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve traveled the country for the better part of the first half of this year, and man, I\u2019ve got to tell you \u2013 I came across someone in Nevada who is a Democrat voter, who didn\u2019t vote on President Trump in the election, but he told me, \u2018The negative coverage that I see day in and day out, not giving this president a chance, not giving the choice of the American people a chance, has compelled me to actually give him a chance despite not voting for him,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s encouraging. When you go talk to the people, you hear a very different story than what you\u2019re hearing on the mainstream media,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aMcEnany said one of her most difficult challenges at CNN was \u201ctrying to break through the narrative that was being sown.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s the narrative being sown? Look at Media Research Center and their reporting. Three hundred fifty three minutes on Russia in five weeks in the mainstream media. Seventeen minutes on health care,\u201d she noted. \u201cSo you\u2019re sitting there, oftentimes outnumbered, most of the time \u2013 it\u2019s not all the time \u2013 and you just want to speak to the issues the American people care about. You just want to talk about the economy and Obamacare and Neil Gorsuch and just some of the things going on. Breaking through that narrative, the negativity being sown, I think was the hardest part.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, we had some success at times,\u201d she reflected. \u201cThat is the key, I think, to this presidency winning a second term is just getting out there, what President Trump\u2019s doing, what Republicans are doing. That was the most challenging part, I think, of it all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think a big part of my year-and-a-half at CNN was just wanting to give the CNN viewer the other side of the story \u2013 wanting to give them a perspective that, in earnest, they probably hadn\u2019t heard,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn terms of moving forward, I want to be a part of this fight,\u201d said McEnany. \u201cI want to look my future kids in the eye and say, \u2018You know what? I was a part of President Trump\u2019s successful way forward, and putting conservative populist policies forward, and successfully making this country a better place for the American people or the American workers first. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be able to look my kids in the eye one day if I didn\u2019t take this opportunity and say, \u2018Your mom was part of the fight.\u2019 That, to me, was my driving force.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere can I serve? I think I served the better part of the year at CNN, giving that alternative perspective, but it was time to move forward and join arms with my fellow Republicans, and Republican populists really, out there \u2013 the new wave of people who have been brought into this party by President Trump \u2013 and fight for these policies,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aMcEnany said the Republican Party\u2019s new populist spirit flows from understanding that President Trump\u2019s election means \u201cthe American people want to be heard.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I say \u2018conservative populism,\u2019 it\u2019s not some new conservatism,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cReally, it\u2019s just listening when the American people say, \u2018Hey, maybe right there, maybe we need to re-evaluate that, maybe to re-evaluate free trade. NAFTA didn\u2019t work so well. Maybe we need to look at TPP. This isn\u2019t a great idea, even though doctrinal conservatism previously might have suggested TPP was the way to go.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Trump listened to the American people. President Trump listened, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s just hearing them out,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen a policy definitively is not working, and it\u2019s careless to the American worker, then you make a change. That\u2019s what you recognized over at Breitbart very early on. That\u2019s what President Trump recognized, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s sitting in 1600 Pennsylvania. The Republican Party recognizes he\u2019s the leader of our party.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcEnany said her reception at the Republican National Committee has been \u201cvery welcoming.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was so heartening to see that this party, that the RNC, is staunchly behind this president,\u201d she enthused. \u201cThey realize that for our party to succeed, that means the president must succeed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re very open to Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d she reported. \u201cThey are the tailwind behind it. I\u2019ve had nothing but a very welcome embrace. It\u2019s very encouraging to see that the party apparatus is fully behind the president. In order to win in 2018, in order to win four years from now, we all have to stick together. What I\u2019ve found is, going into the RNC, we are together. What \u201ctogether\u201d means is standing behind this president full throttle.\u201d\u000a\u000aMarlow noted that as RNC spokeswoman, McEnany will be called upon to mediate public disputes with such anti-Trump Republicans as Sens.

aVTEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran signed the country\u2019s biggest-ever car deal, worth several hundred million dollars, with French manufacturer Groupe Renault on Monday to produce 150,000 cars a year, the latest advance by a European company into Iran\u2019s sizable consumer market.\u000a\u000aThe \u20ac660 million \u2014 or $778 million \u2014 deal follows the lifting of the UN and European Union sanctions after Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers to curb its controversial uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIt also comes just days after new US sanctions on Iran were signed by US President Donald Trump, who spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend about ways to counter Iran\u2019s influence in Mideast conflicts. The US legislation, first passed by Congress, imposes penalties on people involved in Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.\u000a\u000aUnimpeded by US sanctions that apply to American businesses, Asian and European companies have raced for a share of Iran\u2019s market since international sanctions were lifted. Iran, with its population of 80 million people, sits atop the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil reserves and the second-biggest reserves of natural gas. It also has well-established manufacturing and agricultural industries.\u000a\u000aJust last month, France Total SA and a Chinese Oil Company signed a $5 billion agreement with Iran to develop the country\u2019s massive offshore natural gas field in the first such deal since the landmark nuclear deal was struck. Also, Washington granted permission to Chicago-based Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars\u2019 worth of aircraft to Iran in September 2016.\u000a\u000aRenault and other European companies are looking to rebuild their presence in Iran following the lifting of international sanctions. Renault says that in the first half of 2017, its sales in Iran increased by more than 100 percent to 68,365 vehicles \u2014 a nearly 10 percent market share.\u000a\u000aThe company has been operating in Iran since 2003, though operations were halted when Iran came under international sanctions over its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aDuring the signing ceremony in Tehran, Iran\u2019s Minister of Industry Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said the deal with multinational automobile manufacturer Renault would \u201cestablish a research and development center for designing\u201d in\u000a\u000athe country.\u000a\u000aA Renault executive, Thierry Bolloré, said it would help transfer technology to Iran and reinforce Groupe Renault\u2019s position there.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis joint venture will enable an acceleration of our growth in this country,\u201d he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe car deal is expected to create about 3,000 jobs for the two Iranian companies involved: IDRO, or the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran, and the privately-owned Negin Group, which imports Renault products to Iran.\u000a\u000aThe plant, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) outside Tehran, will produce Duster and Symbol cars starting in 2018, adding 150,000 vehicles a year to the Iranian market above Renault\u2019s already existing capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year in Iran. Renault, a majority shareholder with a 60 percent share in the deal, will have its own distribution network in Iran for the first time. The deal was first reached with Iran\u2019s government last September.\u000a\u000aAlso last year, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen reached a deal to open a plant producing 200,000 vehicles annually in Iran. Peugeot was a major player in Iran\u2019s car market before international sanctions were imposed.\u000a\u000aIran produces about 1,350,000 vehicles a year, though authorities hope that number will reach 3 million annually by 2025. There are around 30 car manufacturers in Iran, most of which assemble Chinese and Korean cars in Iran.

aVCell phone video has emerged of an officer pointing a gun at a passenger for over nine minutes after pulling over the vehicle.\u000a\u000aThe incident occurred just outside of San Jose. The officer was with the Campbell Police Department and was on a police motorcycle.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to the Washington Post, the officer stopped the car after radar allegedly showed it traveling at 85 mph. The officer then asked the occupants for a driver\u2019s license and paperwork related to vehicle registration, leading the two occupants digging around inside the car for the requested materials.\u000a\u000aAt one point, the stories being told by the driver and the passenger \u201cdiverged,\u201d and the passenger allegedly reached under his seat. The officer responded by pointing a gun at him.\u000a\u000aCNN HLN posted a condensed video of the incident. In it, viewers can hear the passenger asking the officer to quit pointing a gun at him, but the officer is unfazed by the requests.\u000a\u000aThe couple was eventually allowed to go, and the Campbell Police Department released a statement in support of the officer. One portion of the statement says:\u000a\u000aThe officer informed the occupants to wait in the vehicle as he prepared to walk back to his motorcycle to write a citation. It was at that time that the passenger began reaching under his seat. It is not clear why the passenger chose to reach under the seat since the officer was not requesting any other paperwork. Unfortunately, the passenger\u2019s unexpected movement towards the bottom of the seat, caused the officer to perceive a threat and draw his handgun. The officer requested additional officers respond to assist him so that he could safely resolve the situation. The comments on the Facebook video bring up a lot of different viewpoints about how the officer could have responded differently or used different tactics. Our officers receive a tremendous amount of training on a consistent basis and that training is what dictates our response. This is intended to protect our officers as well as those they come in contact with. The unfortunate reality is sometimes people attack police officers, as tragically occurred in the City of Los Banos this morning when two officers were shot.\u000a\u000aHLN reports that the passenger apologized for his exchanges with the officer.\u000a\u000aAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

aVEmails from a reporter for the New York Times to government employees obtained exclusively by Breitbart News demonstrate that the newspaper\u2019s employees are not just on the receiving end of leaks, but are actually soliciting government employees to become leakers. What\u2019s more, the emails demonstrate the Times colluded with the president of government union to encourage and solicit these leaks\u2014something that may become highly problematic for both institutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThanks again for taking the time to speak today,\u201d Coral Davenport, an \u201cEnergy and Environment Correspondent\u201d for the New York Times, writes in an email to John J. O\u2019Grady of the EPA workers\u2019 union. O\u2019Grady is the president of the AFGE Council 238 in Chicago\u2014which represents EPA workers.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cAs I mentioned, I\u2019m working on a story looking specifically at concrete examples of unusual secretary at E.P.A.,\u201d Davenport states, continuing:\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve heard a lot of second-hand rumors, but in order to report these incidents, I\u2019d need to have first-hand or eyewitness accounts. I\u2019m looking for examples of things like, information being communicated only verbally when it would historically have been put in writing, people being told not to bring phones, laptops or even take notes in meetings where they would in the past typically have done so, eyewitness accounts of things like the administrator or top political appointees refusing to use official email, phones or computers, or any other specific, first-hand examples of practices that appear to demonstrate unprecedented secrecy or transparency.\u000a\u000aThe revelation of these emails comes as President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions crack down on leakers. It also comes as EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, has emerged as one of the most successful cabinet-level officials in the Trump administration, and Trump\u2019s political enemies throughout the left and media aim at targeting Pruitt.\u000a\u000aThe Times has come under significant scrutiny for a piece in late July by Lisa Friedman, one of Davenport\u2019s colleagues, for bashing Pruitt for traveling home regularly to Oklahoma.\u000a\u000a\u201cScott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, traveled to his home state, Oklahoma, 10 times over three months this year, largely at taxpayer expense, according to a report released Monday,\u201d Friedman wrote, adding:\u000a\u000aThe findings from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit group founded by former E.P.A. officials, are drawn from Mr. Pruitt\u2019s calendar and the travel expenses he has submitted for reimbursement. Obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the documents show Mr. Pruitt spent 43 out of 92 days from March through May in Oklahoma or traveling to or from the state.\u000a\u000aBut, as she buries in the story several paragraphs in, the report she cites \u201cdoes not assert\u201d that anything about Pruitt\u2019s travels back to Oklahoma as EPA administrator is at all \u201cimproper.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an editorial after the questionable Times piece on Pruitt, the Tulsa World newspaper in Oklahoma mocked the Gray Lady for making a mountain of a mole hill.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we were supposed to be shocked to learn that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is going home on weekends, we\u2019re not,\u201d the Tulsa World\u2019s editorial board wrote under a headline: \u201cHeaven Forfend! Scott Pruitt is going home on weekends!\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, Trump himself has ripped the New York Times in recent days via his Twitter account\u2014calling the newspaper \u201ctotally inept\u201d:\u000a\u000aThe failing @nytimes, which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized), is totally inept! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000aA Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades-Ha, told Breitbart News there is nothing abnormal about these emails.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe email demonstrates the process of reporting and gathering facts,\u201d Rhoades-Ha said in an email early Tuesday when seeking comment.\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady, the union official with whom Davenport was colluding per these emails to solicit government leakers, has not responded to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aDavenport continues in her written plea to O\u2019Grady in the email by noting that if he successfully delivers her the government leakers she is soliciting, she will protect their identities.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile I\u2019d like to speak to staff about these examples, I DON\u2019T need to quote them by name or with any sort of identifying details that could in any way reveal the source of the information,\u201d Davenport writes. She continues:\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re VERY sensitive to the need to protect career folks who speak to us, and we DO NOT want to endanger anyone\u2019s employment. But, in order to ensure that our reporting is based on facts rather than rumors, we do need to feel sure that the examples we give are based on first-hand or eyewitness experiences rather than second and third-hand rumors.\u000a\u000aDavenport then provides her contact information and encourages people to text, call, email, or contact her on the encrypted phone apps Signal or WhatsApp. She provides both her personal email address and her Times email address. Breitbart News has redacted that information from the emails published herein, as well as all personal contact information in the emails.\u000a\u000aShe then continues her plea for leaks and explains the nuts and bolts of how she would go about consolidating leaks into becoming key revelations in a New York Times article down the road.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnother way to do this might be through a combination of your interviews and my reporting,\u201d Davenport writes, adding:\u000a\u000aIf you gave put together multiple eyewitness accounts of a specific example of behavior that demonstrates an unprecedented lack of transparency, we could cite that. Or, if I speak to multiple people who describe, firsthand, such an example, I could cite that without needing any quotations. In general, the more folks I speak to who can offer specific, first-hand accounts of similar phenomena, the more I can write with authority in a broad way with no quotations or identifying details.\u000a\u000aFrom there, she moves on to describe how she has already done this.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve already done this in a number of other stories this year,\u201d Davenport writes. \u201cBelow are four stories that I reported with the help of multiple interviews with current EPA employees. Since the employees gave multiple firsthand accounts but could not be quoted, I was able to describe what was going on without naming, quoting, or identifying any of them. The only employees quoted in these stories are those who specifically gave permission to do so \u2014 generally the union leaders. However, the accounts of employees who were not quoted helped to deeply inform the story and allowed me to write with more authority. So looking to do the same this time.\u201d\u000a\u000aDavenport ends her note by telling O\u2019Grady to \u201cfeel free to send this note around to folks who might be willing to chat,\u201d and then includes the links to the four aforementioned Times pieces built on leaks she solicited from inside the EPA.\u000a\u000aThe four pieces that Davenport links in the email are all critical of Pruitt and the Trump administration\u2019s using leakers she admittedly solicited from inside the federal bureaucracy to do so. The headlines of the four pieces she links to are:\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady then forwarded the email from Davenport to a large list of EPA employees. With Davenport\u2019s full message, O\u2019Grady added a note of his own for EPA officials he was encouraging to leak to the New York Times.\u000a\u000a\u201cBelow is an e-mail I received from Coral Davenport of the New York Times,\u201d O\u2019Grady wrote to his colleagues. \u201cShe needs our assistance in verifying some information she has heard.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt includes two bullet points that use wording to describe what Davenport is looking for that is identical to her original email O\u2019Grady. First, O\u2019Grady wrote that Davenport is \u201clooking for examples of things like, information being communicated only verbally when it would historically have been put in writing, people being told not to bring phones, laptops or even take notes in meetings where they would in the past typically have done so.\u201d Second, O\u2019Grady wrote that Davenport was looking for \u201ceyewitness accounts of things like the administrator or top political appointees refusing to use official email, phones or computers, or any other specific, first-hand examples of practices that appear to demonstrate unprecedented secrecy or transparency.\u201d\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady wrapped up his email to EPA employees by encouraging them to reach out to Davenport.\u000a\u000a\u201cPlease feel free to contact Coral directly,\u201d he wrote.\u000a\u000aIronically, the list of email addresses to which O\u2019Grady forwarded Davenport\u2019s message included a number of personal email addresses of EPA employees\u2014particularly rich since Davenport was seeking evidence of Trump administration EPA politically appointed officials mishandling government email protocol. Again, Breitbart News has redacted, in the images of the emails obtained, personal contact information, including the email addresses in the list of names to which O\u2019Grady forwarded Davenport\u2019s email.\u000a\u000aThe email chain obtained by Breitbart News chops off the original date and time that Davenport sent her email to O\u2019Grady. But it does include the time and date that O\u2019Grady forwarded the email to EPA career officials. The email O\u2019Grady sent to a number of EPA officials was forwarded on Thursday, August 3, at 2:33 p.m.\u000a\u000aThe government employees to whom O\u2019Grady forwarded this email\u2014whose email addresses Breitbart News has redacted from this email chain published via PDFs here\u2014include: Antony Tseng, Bethany Dreyfus, Britta Copt, Clovis Steib, Dennis Miller, Priscilla Oliver, Gary Morton, Lucretia Myers, Mark Coryell, Michael Mikulka, Natasha Greaves, Nate James, Shane Nelson, Silvia Saracco, Steve Calder, Thelma Estrada, Denise Morrison, Jeanne Schulze, Keith Fusinski, Russell Wiener, Sarah Perham, Steve Hopkins, Amer Al-Mudallal, Brent Maier, Destinee Cooper, Diane Lynne, Stephanie Doolan, Leah Oliver, Lesley Mills, Mark Sims, William McBride, Michael Ottlinger, Patrick Chan, and Ann Pitchford.\u000a\u000aApproximately half of those\u2014including O\u2019Grady himself\u2014were on personal email addresses, and many of them were fellow union officials.

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Flake\u2019s fellow Gang of Eight teammate, told the Arizona Republic that he would like to work with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to pass the Gang of Eight\u2019s amnesty bill when he returns to Congress from his cancer treatments.\u000a\u000aFlake said he was \u201cvery heartened\u201d by the poorly-named and foolish \u201cautopsy\u201d report and said the party seems to \u201chave abandoned\u201d the autopsy report\u2019s sole policy recommendation\u2013amnesty for illegal immigrants. He added that Republicans needed to play a game of \u201caddition\u201d rather than subtraction even though Trump attracted millions of working-class voters from all backgrounds who had never been involved in politics before while doing better than Mitt Romney among \u201cpeople of color.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News has pointed out, \u201cbefore the dust was even settled after the 2012 presidential election,\u201d the RNC \u201cpublished its poorly-named autopsy report in which the only policy recommendation was amnesty for illegal immigrants. GOP establishment consultants also convinced [Senator Marco] Rubio to break his campaign promise and be the face of the \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 bill because they thought passing amnesty legislation was the only way back to the White House. Nearly every single Republican consultant and legacy media figure on television parroted the conventional wisdom: Republicans could not win the White House in 2016 if they did not pass amnesty legislation.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s win in 2016 showed how foolish this \u201cadvice\u201d was as he won states like Pennsylvania and Michigan that establishment Republicans had not been able to win in a generation. In addition, to add insult to injury to the GOP establishment\u2019s favorite talking point, Trump did better among people of color than Romney even though Trump opposed illegal immigration and promised to build a border wall.\u000a\u000aRevealing how clueless legacy media anchors still are about GOP politics and the country\u2019s voters, Blitzer did not ask the obvious follow-up question to Flake about whether adopting the \u201cautopsy\u201d report\u2019s policy recommendation on immigration would cause Republicans to lose elections.

aVIn her first interview since becoming the spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee (RNC), former CNN contributor Kayleigh McEnany talked to Sirius XM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily on Tuesday, during which she stressed the importance of Republicans unifying behind President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u000a\u000aMarlow pointed out that, unfortunately, most of the key items from Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign are stalled in Congress. He asked what the RNC can do to clear away these legislative jams.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aMcEnany replied that disappointed Republican voters should \u201cstay tuned.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTax reform is coming,\u201d she promised. \u201cA family making $55,000, you\u2019re going to see close to $5,000 back in your pocket each year. That\u2019s coming. That\u2019s right around the corner.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cObamacare was a blip. We need to revisit it,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt needs to happen. We need to make good on that promise. But tax reform is coming.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe RAISE Act, which we know American wages have suffered, we\u2019ve had this vast influx of immigration over time \u2013 well, we\u2019re going to help those wages,\u201d she promised. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come in the form of the RAISE Act.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, it\u2019s been six months. There isn\u2019t a major repeal of Obamacare yet, a replacement, but all of that\u2019s coming,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep in mind that for President Obama, it took more than a year \u2013 nearly a year-and-a-half \u2013 to pass Obamacare to begin with. Let\u2019s give President Trump that time,\u201d she urged.\u000a\u000aMcEnany said President Trump has \u201cdone a great job already,\u201d referencing his executive actions and recent good economic news.\u000a\u000a\u201cGive him some time because I guarantee you in the next few months, going into next year, we\u2019re going to see tax reform. We\u2019re going to see the RAISE Act. We will see major legislative victories. But it takes time,\u201d she noted.\u000a\u000aMarlow responded by noting that influential Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) has already declared that \u201cthe RAISE Act doesn\u2019t have a chance in hell\u201d of passing Congress.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s something that a lot of us find, even if he\u2019s right, we find it very counterproductive that you have Republicans going out and taking shots at key pieces of legislation,\u201d he told the new RNC spokeswoman.\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to have a different opinion,\u201d McEnany conceded. \u201cYou will have people who publicly dismiss it. We\u2019ve seen that from the beginning, going back to Obamacare. But we have a president who, behind the scenes, is going to get the job done. He\u2019s picking up the phone. He\u2019s making calls.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, President Obama was in many ways an absentee president,\u201d she contended. \u201cHe was not good at picking up the phone and negotiating. But we have a president who is an expert negotiator, and we have a president who is going to pick up the phone and put the pressure on some of those Republicans who are pushing back on the RAISE Act.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s what it takes because publicly you might have some people who speak out against it, but we have a president who, behind the scenes, will make a difference,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aMarlow asked McEnany about her new \u201cTrump TV\u201d project, a series of videos designed to bypass the mainstream media and bring President Trump\u2019s message directly to the American people. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a lot of hostile response from the media, which I think is fantastic,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s rather interesting to me. You have a lot of media pushback on this, and really what it was are sharing facts \u2013 actual, hard facts,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice in the pushback very little of it is the facts or the substance of what this broadcast said.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an effort to put forth what the president is doing and the positive successes in his administration,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never hear about ISIS being on the run or the Veteran Accountability Act or MS-13. You might hear an inkling here or there in the media, but these are things the American people want to hear. They want to hear what their elected leader is doing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and all too often, you hear about Russia, but not about border crossings being down.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an effort to offer another set of facts that supplement what\u2019s being said in the media, which is oftentimes falsehoods,\u201d she charged. \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to put out there what\u2019s going on and give the American people the substance that they want to hear, but you don\u2019t hear in the media. It\u2019s been lambasted, but what I find interesting is that no one is attacking the factual substance of it. They\u2019re just attacking the fact that someone is getting through and telling the American people what\u2019s happening in their White House.\u201d\u000a\u000aMarlow also noted that charges of \u201cpropaganda\u201d leveled at McEnany\u2019s videos are foolish because her perspective and biases are clearly stated in advance, and there is nothing illusory or deceptive about the productions.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not propaganda at all,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that that was a news broadcast coming from Trump Tower. It had Trump behind it in the background. It is being marginalized as propaganda, which it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just an effort to give the people facts.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHave the American people heard that President Trump has rescinded more regulations than any president in American history?\u201d she wondered. \u201cI believe the number is something like 860. He has had 40 pieces of legislation signed. He has 40 executive orders. Are these things you hear in the mainstream media? No, you don\u2019t. They\u2019re facts that aren\u2019t offered because they don\u2019t supplement the mainstream media narrative of negativity.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo it\u2019s an effort to give the American people those facts. Ultimately, at the end of the day, they have a vote. They decide which way they want to cast it. But they deserve to hear both sides of the story,\u201d she contended.\u000a\u000aMcEnany anticipated \u201cmore successes\u201d throughout the rest of 2017.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook at the economy alone. One million jobs created, consumer confidence a 16-year high, unemployment a 16-year low. You\u2019re going to see robust economic activity, more factories moving back,\u201d she forecast.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re going to see, I hope, more conservative appointments of judges because, to me, that\u2019s the best achievement we\u2019ve had so far, is Neil Gorsuch. You\u2019re going to see more the successes we\u2019ve seen already. You\u2019re going to see more of that,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I really do believe that you\u2019re going to see a major legislative victory,\u201d McEnany added. \u201cPresident Trump already has had some. The Veteran Accountability Act, I would argue, is a very big one. But you\u2019re going to see a major legislative success. If it\u2019s tax reform, this economy is going to absolutely take off \u2013 in a way that it is already, but it\u2019s going to be robust.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.

aVA grim milestone appears to be passing, as both U.S. and Japanese intelligence analysts believe North Korea has developed the technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads and fit them inside long-range missiles, years ahead of schedule.\u000a\u000aJapan\u2019s annual defense review, released on Tuesday morning, described the threat from North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile program as \u201cacute.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is conceivable that North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program has already considerably advanced and it is possible that North Korea has already achieved the miniaturization of nuclear weapons and has acquired nuclear warheads,\u201d the white paper warned. \u201cSince last year, when it forcibly implemented two nuclear tests and more than 20 ballistic missile launches, the security threats have entered a new stage.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccordingly, the BBC reported that Japan has begun its first civilian air-raid drills since the end of World War II, evidently stepping up a program revealed earlier this year which taught civilians in certain towns how to deal with an errant North Korean test missile (or perhaps a weapon fired at American military installations in Japan) falling in a populated area.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re told to hit the ground or hide behind the wall, but will that really help? Will that really protect us if a missile really falls here, I wonder?\u201d asked one Japanese citizen interviewed by the BBC.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported on Tuesday afternoon that U.S. analysts at the Defense Intelligence Agency reached similar conclusions about North Korea\u2019s capabilities in a confidential assessment prepared last month.\u000a\u000aThe DIA report also raised the official estimate of North Korea\u2019s nuclear inventory considerably, from the handful of bombs hypothesized by most earlier analyses to almost 60 nuclear devices.\u000a\u000aThe report\u2019s authors believe some of these devices are small enough to be delivered by intercontinental ballistic missile. As the Washington Post notes, North Korea claims it has successfully tested such miniaturized devices, although their claims were greeted with widespread skepticism at the time. The missing piece of the ICBM puzzle for North Korea would appear to be reliable heat shielding to protect the warheads from re-entry, a technology Pyongyang is clearly working hard to develop.\u000a\u000aA new poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs released on Monday found 90 percent of Americans \u201creject the idea that North Korea should be allowed to produce nuclear weapons,\u201d 75 percent see the North Korean nuclear program as a \u201ccritical threat facing the United States,\u201d and 62 percent would support using American troops to defend South Korea from a North Korean attack.

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster served at a UK-based think tank financed by a controversial, George Soros-funded group identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.\u000a\u000aFrom September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow. The IISS describes itself as a \u201cworld-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe IISS has been supportive of the Obama administration-brokered 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, and the group has repeatedly hit back against charges that Tehran has violated the agreement.\u000a\u000aMcMaster himself has been accused of purging the National Security Council of hardliners on Iran, and he is seen as a leading proponent of the Iran nuclear accord within the Trump administration. He has reportedly urged the White House to recertify Iran\u2019s compliance with the Iran nuclear deal.\u000a\u000aIISS\u2019s website contains a list of groups, corporations and government entities that provide funding to the think tank, including during the period of McMaster\u2019s work there. Curiously missing from the page of donors, however, is the controversial Ploughshares Fund, a grantmaking group identified last year by the Obama White House as central in helping to market the Iran nuclear deal to the news media.\u000a\u000aAn archived version of IISS\u2019s donors page lists Ploughshares as a donor.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News has found that IISS is listed as a grantee for Iran issues in Ploughshares Fund\u2019s budget report for 2016.\u000a\u000aThat report spotlights IISS as a grantee for Iran work done by Michael Elleman, IISS senior fellow for missile defense.\u000a\u000aIn a recent IISS analysis, Elleman cast doubt on charges that Iran and North Korea are working together on ballistic-missile development, claiming \u201cthere is little evidence to indicate the two regimes are engaged in deep missile-related collaboration, or pursuing joint-development programs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, is listed as a member of IISS in his Georgetown University bio.\u000a\u000aIISS has not returned Breitbart News requests seeking clarification on the Ploughshares funding and inquiring about McMaster\u2019s work at IISS, including any salary that he may have received.\u000a\u000aSoros-Funded Ploughshares Part of \u2018Echo Chamber\u2019 to Sell Obama\u2019s Iran Deal\u000a\u000aPloughshares Fund is financed by Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute.\u000a\u000aThe involvement of Ploughshares in selling the Iran agreement to the public was revealed in an extensive New York Times Magazine profile of Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, titled, \u201cThe Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru.\u201d The article contains interviews with Rhodes and scores of top Obama administration officials.\u000a\u000aRobert Malley, then a senior director at the National Security Council, expounded on the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal.\u000a\u000aMalley explained to the Times that \u201cexperts\u201d were utilized to create an \u201cecho chamber\u201d that disseminated administration claims about Iran to \u201chundreds of often-clueless reporters\u201d in the news media.\u000a\u000aTimes author David Samuels wrote:\u000a\u000aIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aRhodes told Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the \u201cabsence of rational discourse\u201d and utilized outside groups, including Ploughshares.\u000a\u000aWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents. Ploughshares says it has awarded hundreds of grants \u201cwhose aggregate value exceeded $60 million.\u201d\u000a\u000aA previous investigation by this reporter showed Ploughshares has partnered with a who\u2019s-who of the radical left, including Code Pink, the pro-Palestinian J Street, United for Peace & Justice, the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and Demos, a progressive economic advisory group where Obama\u2019s controversial former green jobs czar, Van Jones, has served on the board.\u000a\u000aThe group says its mission is to support the \u201csmartest minds and most effective organizations to reduce nuclear stockpiles, prevent new nuclear states, and increase global security.\u201d\u000a\u000aPloughshares is in turn financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute, the Buffett Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Foundation.\u000a\u000aAnother Ploughshares donor is the Tides Foundation, which is one of the largest funders of the radical left. Tides is funded by Soros.\u000a\u000aPloughshares has donated to the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls for massive slashes in the U.S. defense budget.\u000a\u000aIt has also financed the International Crisis Group, a small organization that boasts George Soros and his son, Alexander, on its board and where Malley now works as vice president for public policy.\u000a\u000aPloughshares, McMaster and John Kerry\u000a\u000aLast week, McMaster removed Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Trump aide and Iran deal opponent, from the National Security Council in what the Jerusalem Post reported was a possible \u201csweep of Iran hard-liners.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Post reported on two other McMaster purges of Iran hardliners:\u000a\u000aCohen-Watnick\u2019s removal comes after the revelation by The Atlantic on Wednesday of the dismissal of Rich Higgins, another Iran hawk who was the NSC\u2019s director of strategic planning. Higgins was sacked for circulating a memo in which he alleged that there was a \u201cMaoist\u201d insurgency within and without the government of \u201cglobalists and Islamists.\u201d Also gone is Derek Harvey, who held the Middle East portfolio at the NSC, and who also was an Iran hawk, and who may assume another role in the administration. McMaster tapped Michael Bell, a retired army colonel who has a conventional career portfolio, to replace Harvey.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a recent event held by Ploughshares Fund, former Secretary of State John Kerry implied that McMaster is the best bet at keeping the nuclear agreement alive, according to a Ploughshares Fund description of the June 5, 2017 event.\u000a\u000aIISS, meanwhile, has supported the Iran nuclear agreement and has defended Tehran against reports it has violated tenets of the deal.\u000a\u000aLast month, IISS featured a piece by Mark Fitzpatrick, chief of the think tank\u2019s non-proliferation and nuclear policy program, titled, \u201cThree strikes against claims that Iran is violating the nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IISS piece argued that \u201ccriticism of Iran\u2019s conduct in relation to the 2015 nuclear deal does not withstand scrutiny,\u201d and that the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement \u201cwould not convince other parties to re-impose sanctions, but could trigger a global crisis.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn June, the IISS\u2019s Fitzpatrick opined that \u201cCritics are wrong: Iran remains in compliance with nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn IISS strategic comment paper, titled, \u201cTrump\u2019s erratic Middle East policy,\u201d argued that Trump\u2019s confrontational approach toward Iran is \u201cunlikely to lend needed stability to the region.\u201d\u000a\u000aAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

aVLeft-wing \u201cresistance\u201d activists flooded a town hall meeting Monday held by Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) in Chico, California, with one attendee taunting the congressman: \u201cMay you die in pain!\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the Los Angeles Times, that attendee was an \u201colder man\u201d upset by LaMalfa\u2019s vote for the House\u2019s version of legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, the American Health Care Act. Others present were also opposed to repealing Obamacare.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Times reports that most other comments and questions were \u201ccordial,\u201d though LaMalfa was often interrupted. It is not clear what proportion of people in attendance at the Chico Elks Lodge were actually from California\u2019s 1st congressional district, which encompasses a large swath of the northeast part of the state, and which LaMalfa has represented since 2013, winning re-eleciton by wide margins.\u000a\u000aThe 1st district also includes a large portion of the proposed \u201cState of Jefferson,\u201d where many residents feel alienated from the Democrat-dominated state government, and where Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, contrary to the rest of the state.\u000a\u000aStill, activists from the so-called \u201cresistance\u201d have been known to organize attendance at town hall meetings in the conservative interior of the Golden State, where they target Republican representatives for vociferous protest.\u000a\u000aIn some Republican-held districts, Democrats are crafting their messages more carefully. The Times notes a new campaign ad from Democrat Dave Min, one of several challengers hoping to take on Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA) in Orange County. The ad, \u201cCountry of Immigrants,\u201d touts Min\u2019s \u201cprogressive values\u201d and attacks Trump\u2019s policies on illegal immigration. \u201cI\u2019m profoundly concerned about my kids growing up in Donald Trump\u2019s America,\u201d Min says.\u000a\u000aDemocrats hope to flip several Republican-held seats in California, particularly in districts where Clinton defeated Trump. LaMalfa\u2019s is not one of them \u2014 though LaMalfa declined to support Trump in the 2016 Republican primary.\u000a\u000aJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

aVBreitbart London has profiled the quartet of North America-based Islamic preachers who serve on the advisory board of The Muslim Vibe; the online magazine and digital media network demanding Raheem Kassam\u2019s forthcoming book on No Go Zones is banned from Amazon.\u000a\u000aThe board \u201cacts as a guiding body to make sure The Muslim Vibe stays in line with Islamic values and principles \u2026 and is made up of highly respected and learned individuals \u2013 who help us make certain editorial decisions\u201d, according to its website.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIf Muslims could stop condemning the Westminster attack, that\u2019d be great! https://t.co/IKLGNFAqbW pic.twitter.com/V1NIqMWnud \u2014 The Muslim Vibe (@themuslimvibe) March 28, 2017\u000a\u000aDawud Walid, Syed Abbas Ayleya, Zafar Bangash, and Sayed Asad Jafri are all hard-line figures, with links and sympathies to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Nation of Islam, and \u2014 perhaps most dangerously \u2014 the Islamic revolutionary theocracy which governs Iran.\u000a\u000aIran issued a fatwa against author Salman Rushdie \u2014 like Kassam, a Brit of Indian heritage \u2014 after his book The Satanic Verses was deemed \u201cblasphemous\u201d by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the country\u2019s late Supreme Leader.\u000a\u000aDawud Walid\u000a\u000aDawud Walid is the Executive Director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and a leading Muslim in Dearborn \u2014 a city which was being described as a \u201cShariah enclave\u201d as long ago as 2011, and will be featured in Kassam\u2019s book.\u000a\u000aCAIR has been declared a a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates, and was named by U.S. federal prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in a Hamas terror-funding operation.\u000a\u000aWalid himself has spoken at length on how Islam sanctions violence \u2014 specifically, by defending the mass execution of Jewish men and the selling of their women and children into slavery during the time of Mohammed in a speech he uploaded to YouTube.\u000a\u000aHe explained that the murdered Jews had broken an agreement with the prophet, and that \u201ccommitting treason during a time of war is punishable by death.\u201d\u000a\u000aJewish law \u201csays an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life, and a breach for a breach\u201d itself, Walid explained, adding: \u201c[Muslims] shouldn\u2019t be shy about defending this\u201d.\u000a\u000aSpeaking frequently on race politics and \u201cwhite privilege\u201d, Walid has indicated that his father was \u201cexposed\u201d to the teaching of the black supremacist Nation of Islam movement as a young man.\u000a\u000aThe group\u2019s leader is Louis Farrakhan, a controversial figure with a long record of anti-white and anti-Semitic public pronouncements.\u000a\u000aThese include such straightforwardly racist remarks as, \u201cWhite people deserve to die,\u201d \u201cWhite people are potential humans [who] haven\u2019t evolved yet,\u201d and \u201cThe Satanic Jews \u2026 control everything and mostly everybody\u201d.\u000a\u000aFarrakhan has also flirted with Holocaust revisionism, with the Jewish Virtual Library reporting a speech in which he claimed: \u201cInternational bankers financed Hitler and poor Jews died while big Jews were at the root of what you call the Holocaust \u2026 Little Jews died while big Jews made money. Little Jews [were] being turned into soap while big Jews washed themselves with it.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile differing from the 84-year-old on religious doctrine, Walid has gone out of his way to praise the controversial figure as \u201c[one] of the few black leaders that HAS credibility among many black folk on both domestic & international issues\u201d and tweeted that his \u201cpreaching [and] work is more relevant to the mass of Blackamericans [sic] than what imams \u2018on the Sunnah\u2019 are preaching\u201d.\u000a\u000aOn still another occasion, the CAIR-MI director wrote: \u201cFarrakhan isnt beyond critique but give credit where it\u2019s due. He\u2019s [one] of few national Black leaders who isnt Uncle Tommin these days. [sic]\u201d\u000a\u000aSyed Abbas Ayleya\u000a\u000aSyed Abbas Ayleya is, like Dawud Walid, a frequent speaker at Al Quds Day events \u2014 an annual call for the destruction of Israel first instituted by Iran\u2019s late Supreme Leader, Ruhollah Khomeini.\u000a\u000aA native of Pakistan with fifteen years of Iranian clerical training under his belt, Ayleya teaches at the Zainab Center in Seattle, Washington, and local media reports him as sharing a platform with Muslims deriding \u201cthe shaytani [Satanic] character of the U.S. government\u201d and branding it \u201cZionist occupied\u201d in Dearborn.\u000a\u000aHe is himself is reported to have said that \u201cThere is no room for pluralism in Islam. It is un-Qu\u2019ranic\u201d.\u000a\u000aAt an English-language Khomeini lecture in London in 2014, he railed against \u201cpeople who [are] separating religion from politics, as if it\u2019s not even part of Islam.\u201d\u000a\u000aA proponent of Iranian-style Islamic revolutions worldwide, Ayleya demanded: \u201cAre you trying to reinvent the wheel? Are you here to make a new religion? The religion [of Islam] is the religion where Islam and politics is one! \u2026 Islam and government are twins \u2014 that means inseparable!\u201d\u000a\u000aZafar Bangash\u000a\u000aZafar Bangash, also born in Pakistan, is an imam based in Toronto, Canada.\u000a\u000aHe co-founded the Muslim Institute in London, England, and serves as Director of the Institute of Contemporary Islamic Thought (ICIT) \u2014 which describes itself as a hub for \u201cactivists, journalists and academics in all parts of the world who share a common commitment to developing the social and political ideas of the Islamic movement, and promoting them as an alternative worldview to that of Western civilisation\u201d.\u000a\u000aLike U.S.-based Syed Abbas Ayleya, Bangash is a fierce partisan for the Iranian regime, and has urged Muslims to emulate Ayatollah Khomeini and \u201cstrive to overthrow the oppressive systems in their societies through Islamic revolutions, and not by participating in fraudulent elections\u201d, according to reports in the Toronto Star.\u000a\u000aDescribed as the \u201cunofficial spokesperson for the Iranian regime in Canada\u201d by detractors, the imam has denounced the United States in a Crescent International article, writing that Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s description of the country as \u201cShaytan-e Buzurg (the Great Satan) \u2026 was not an emotional outburst but an accurate understanding of the true nature of the U.S.\u201d\u000a\u000aBangash also told Iranian state radio to remember that Ramadan is a month for jihad as well as fasting in an interview in 2010, citing Qu\u2019ranic battles and asking Muslims to observe Al Quds Day events \u2014 at which, like Dawud Walid and Syed Abbas Ayleya, he is a frequent speaker.\u000a\u000aSyed Asad Jafri\u000a\u000aSyed Asad Jafri was born in Canada and remains based there, but received a technical education in the United States and a religious education at an Islamic seminary in Qom, Iran.\u000a\u000aLike his rest of the quartet, Jafri is a regular at Al Quds Day demonstrations, telling attendees at a Toronto rally that Israel is led by a \u201cZionist regime that sucks the resources, the blood, and everything that belongs to the people all across the world [to use] for themselves\u201d in 2011.\u000a\u000aLecturing at the Saba Islamic Center in San Jose, California, Jafri branded women in same-sex relationships and women who decline to wear the hijab willfully as leading a \u201cdisgusting lifestyle\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe Muslim Vibe has not yet responded to a series of questions from Breitbart London.\u000a\u000aYou can pre-order No Go Zones: How Sharia Law is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You on Amazon.

aVSteve Thomma, the veteran White House reporter and current executive director of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, pointed out on Sunday evening that President Barack Obama\u2019s White House actually started the trend of creating \u201creal news\u201d videos to go around the traditional media\u2019s filters to get its message out more directly to voters\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s critics erupted on Sunday after Kayleigh McEnany hosted a \u201creal news\u201d segment that Trump\u2019s reelection campaign tweeted out. McEnany announced last week that she was leaving CNN, where she was one of two pro-Trump voices along with Jeffrey Lord, and the Republican National Committee (RNC) revealed on Monday that she would come on board as an official spokesperson.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Trump campaign\u2019s \u201creal news\u201d video did not try to trick voters into thinking it was an \u201cobjective\u201d PBS-type newscast. It had Trump\u2019s website address and the Trump/Pence campaign logo in the background, making it obvious, as even CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski pointed out, that it was not really that different from the types of videos most campaigns produce in the digital age. McEnany just pointed out some positive news from last week for Trump and the video was funded with campaign funds. Obama\u2019s videos, in contrast, were slick productions funded with taxpayer dollars. Team Obama put out his \u201cWhite House Week\u201d videos even though the legacy media did all they could to put Obama in a favorable light and ask him leading questions like what \u201cenchanted\u201d Obama most about being in the White House.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s good to have someone like Thomma with some semblance of institutional knowledge, but it did not prevent the usual band of Trump haters from piling on McEnany.\u000a\u000aTrend started with Obama team's weekly video recap of what it saw as the "news," called White House Week. https://t.co/fKzJG2ptBO \u2014 Steve Thomma (@stevethomma) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000ameh.

The video, with trump\u2019s website address and the Trump/Pence logo in the background, is not trying to fool anybody as it is clearly, as Kaczynski noted, not \u201cdifferent from stuff campaigns/groups\u201d do.\u000a\u000aThis is the type of propaganda you'd see in North Korea.

Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s national security hack who reportedly bragged about creating a \u201cpropaganda machine\u201d and \u201cecho chamber\u201d for the Iran Deal, richly criticized McEnany\u2019s non-deceptive video as well\u2013McEnany is not pretending to be objective like many \u201cpundits\u201d and legacy media reporters so often do.\u000a\u000aKayleigh McEnany, now appearing on actual state-run media, lines up pretty perfectly with North Korean propaganda. pic.twitter.com/5WMjVaDazD \u2014 Matt Ortega (@MattOrtega) August 6, 2017\u000a\u000aI feel like Fox should just go straight to this backdrop https://t.co/mp2tITAyMP \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 6, 2017\u000a\u000aSo, in essence, because Trump\u2019s campaign did not use taxpayer funds to slickly produce videos like Obama\u2019s White House team did, the Trump campaign\u2019s weekly \u201creal news\u201d videos were, to his critics, state-run propaganda clips that North Koreans would air. This line of thinking also reveals that these elitists think American voters are so stupid that they cannot tell the difference between a purportedly objective newscast and a \u201creal news\u201d show that the Trump campaign is producing. The legacy press, even in the digital age, try to fool viewers into believing they are \u201cobjective.\u201d At least viewers know that the Trump\u2019s campaign \u201creal news\u201d segments are biased in favor of Trump.\u000a\u000aHere are some of Obama\u2019s \u201cWest Wing Week\u201d videos that legacy media reporters and those who purportedly are on the center right never found oh-so-offensive.

aVOn August 7, the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) issued its first ever travel advisory warning American gun owners not to go to California unless they are willing to enter the state disarmed or risk going to jail.\u000a\u000aThe gun rights group is \u201cwarning law-abiding armed citizens that their civil rights could be in jeopardy due to that state\u2019s restrictive gun control laws.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aSAF founder and executive vice president Alan Gottlieb observed:\u000a\u000aThe California Legislature has been out of control for years when it comes to placing restrictions on the Second Amendment rights of honest citizens. Right now, I wouldn\u2019t suggest to any gun owner that they even travel through the state, much less to it as their final destination. Lawmakers in Sacramento either ignored or have forgotten that in 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court incorporated the Second Amendment to the states via the 14th Amendment in SAF\u2019s landmark case of McDonald v. City of Chicago. The Second Amendment\u2019s protection of the right to keep and bear arms applies to state and local governments, but they seem rather oblivious to that fact in the halls of California\u2019s Legislature.\u000a\u000aHe added:\u000a\u000aIf you are licensed to carry in your home state, that license is not recognized in California. It doesn\u2019t matter how many background checks you\u2019ve gone through or whether you took a gun safety course. Your license is no good in the Golden State, which suggests that your safety and the safety of your family are of no concern to state lawmakers or city administrators. You could be prosecuted for having a gun for personal protection, or you might get killed because you didn\u2019t.\u000a\u000aGottlieb is spot on. California refuses to recognize any concealed carry permit other the one they issue. This is an expression of Democratic hegemony whereby they have made concealed carry licenses extremely difficult for Californians to acquire \u2014 fewer than 100,000 Californians have a license \u2014 and they do not want to provide a means for additional law-abiding citizens to be armed via reciprocity.\u000a\u000aWhat does this mean? It means that when a visitor from another state drives into California, he is not supposed to be armed, regardless of the number of out-of-state concealed permits he possesses or the risks associated with being defenseless. None of these things matter because the Democrats have spoken.\u000a\u000aGottlieb\u2019s verdict: \u201cBy not going to California, the life you save may be your own.\u201d\u000a\u000aAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

aVCongress still has the opportunity to repeal the long-delayed health insurance tax that will take effect in 2018, even with the Obamacare repeal stymied by moderate Republicans in the Senate.\u000a\u000aObamacare created the health insurance tax, which places a direct tax on insurance premiums. Democrats designed the tax to be calculated based on insurance premiums, meaning that the cost of the tax would pass directly to small businesses and middle-class families through higher premiums. The health insurance even impacts seniors through Medicare Advantage plans and low-income Americans that rely on Medicaid managed plans.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Heritage Foundation reported that if Republicans fail to repeal the health insurance tax (HIT), premiums would increase by an additional two to three percent.\u000a\u000aThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the HIT will cost $12.3 billion next year and collect over $145 billion in higher taxes over the next ten years.\u000a\u000aThe American Action Forum estimated that the tax will increase premiums by almost $5,000 over a decade and that Americans making less than $50,000 will pay half of the tax.\u000a\u000aThe National Federation of Independent Business contends that the tax could cost up to 286,000 in new jobs and cost small businesses $33 billion in lost sales in the next six year.\u000a\u000aNorth Carolina State Treasurer Dale Folwell noted that if Congress does not eliminate the health insurance tax, Medicare Advantage plans in the state would increase by 30 percent in 2018. In North Carolina, the state would save roughly $45 million if Congress eliminated the tax. In North Carolina alone, the HIT tax could impact 843,724 small businesses and 1,600,000 workers.\u000a\u000aAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) noted that more than 100 Democrats and 250 Republicans voted to delay the health insurance tax.\u000a\u000aAfter Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) halted the Obamacare repeal in the Senate, Sen. Lamar Alexander announced he would hold hearings on bipartisan solutions to stabilize the health care market. It remains possible that a revived Obamacare repeal effort or a bipartisan bill could include the repeal of the health insurance tax.\u000a\u000aModerate House lawmakers suggested that they could repeal the medical device tax and other taxes in their proposed bipartisan legislation.\u000a\u000aThe Stop the HIT Coalition, which represents millions of small business owners, urged the Senate for a repeal of the health insurance tax in any health care legislation. HIT said:\u000a\u000aWith small business owners and middle-class families facing a $14.3 billion tax hike in 2018 alone, Congress must take urgent action now to repeal the health insurance tax once and for all. There is already bipartisan consensus on the need for repeal, and now is the time for Congress to protect millions of small business owners and their employees from this harmful tax.\u000a\u000aGrover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, argued, \u201cPresident Trump and the Republican majority in Congress promised an agenda of lower taxes, more jobs, higher wages, and lower healthcare costs through reduced premiums. They can ensure that they are able to fully keep that promise by delaying the health insurance tax immediately.\u201d

A new branch is also expected to open in Colorado next summer, with interest in additional camps coming from other areas in the United States as well.\u000a\u000aMolly Maxwell\u2019s child attends Rainbow Day Camp. The mother of a six-year-old boy who believes he is a girl, Maxwell reportedly told AP, \u201cOnce she could talk, I don\u2019t remember a time when she didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m a girl.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen it grew in intensity: \u2018I\u2019m a sister. I\u2019m a daughter. I\u2019m a princess,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cWe would argue with her. She was confused. We were confused.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe boy\u2019s parents eventually found a transgender play group in the Bay Area and allowed their child, who is called Gracie, grow his hair, dress in female clothing, and change his name.\u000a\u000a\u201cI see her now, compared to before,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cI watch her strut around and dance and sing and the way she talks about herself. If she was forced to be someone else. I don\u2019t even want to think about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe report continues:\u000a\u000aGender specialists say the camp\u2019s growth reflects what they are seeing in gender clinics nationwide: increasing numbers of children coming out as transgender at young ages. They credit the rise to greater openness and awareness of LGBT issues and parents tuning in earlier when a child shows signs of gender dysphoria, or distress about their gender.\u000a\u000aThe founder of the Rainbow Day Camp, Sandra Collins, said her own daughter was transgender at two years old.\u000a\u000a\u201cA decade ago, this camp wouldn\u2019t have existed,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually, I do believe, it won\u2019t be so innovative.\u201d\u000a\u000aCollins has also launched another camp for 13- to 17-year-old transgender teens called Camp Kickin\u2019 It.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of these kids have been bullied and had trauma at school,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a world where none of that exists and they\u2019re in the majority. That\u2019s a new experience for kids who are used to hiding and feeling small.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen the young campers arrive each day, they are asked to make a nametag with their pronoun of choice for the day, some choosing simply \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d while others opt for \u201cshe/he,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or none of the above. Children are encouraged to change their pronoun of choice each day, according to \u201cwhat feels right,\u201d says the report.\u000a\u000aAP observes:\u000a\u000aThe favored protocol today is known as the \u2018gender affirmative\u2019 approach, which focuses on identifying and helping transgender children to \u2018socially transition\u2019 \u2013 to live as the gender they identify with rather than the one they were born with until they\u2019re old enough to decide on medical options like puberty blockers and later, hormone treatments.\u000a\u000a\u201cI just think there\u2019s a lot more openness to the understanding that trans adults start as trans kids,\u201d said Johanna Olson-Kennedy, medical director of the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children\u2019s Hospital in Los Angeles. \u201cWhen people say, \u2018Isn\u2019t this too young?\u2019 my question back to them is, \u2018Too young for what? How young do people know their gender?\u2019 The answer to that is some people know it at 3 and some people know it at 30.\u201d\u000a\u000aDiane Ehrensaft, director of mental health at the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s Child and Adolescent Gender Center, told AP enrollment at her facility has tripled over the last several years with a \u201csea change \u2013 maybe we can even call it a tsunami \u2013 in the number of little kids showing up with their families.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany parents of gender confused children are eager to affirm their children\u2019s confusion as a result of the fear of high rates of depression in suicide that have been reported by pro-transgender rights groups.\u000a\u000aHowever, the reported high rates of suicide among transgender individuals could be related to the underlying mental illness of gender dysphoria \u2013 recognized by the American Psychological Association \u2013 that remains masked due to the rush to affirm the confusion, even by professional medical organizations.\u000a\u000a\u201cOver 90 percent of people who commit suicide have a diagnosed mental disorder, and there is no evidence that gender-dysphoric children who commit suicide are any different,\u201d writes Dr. Michelle Cretella, president of the American College of Pediatricians, at the Daily Signal. \u201cMany gender dysphoric children simply need therapy to get to the root of their depression, which very well may be the same problem triggering the gender dysphoria.\u201d\u000a\u000aCretella points to research that demonstrates that, even in Sweden, which is among the countries most accepting of LGBT individuals, adults who undergo sex change surgeries have a suicide rate nearly 20 times greater than that of the general population.\u000a\u000a\u201cClearly, sex reassignment is not the solution to gender dysphoria,\u201d she states.\u000a\u000a\u201cAccording to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty,\u201d observes the College. \u201cConditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe AP report notes: \u201cThere is little comprehensive data on young children who identify as transgender, but experts say as the number of young people coming to their clinics increases, the prevailing medical guidance has shifted.\u201d\u000a\u000aCretella agrees, noting the drive to affirm transgenders is \u201cintruding into the lives of the most innocent among us \u2013 children \u2013 and with the apparent growing support of the professional medical community,\u201d even though there is no evidence gender transition procedures are safe.\u000a\u000a\u201cTwo leading pediatric associations\u2014the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Endocrine Society\u2014have followed in lockstep, endorsing the transition affirmation approach even as the latter organization concedes within its own guidelines that the transition-affirming protocol is based on low evidence,\u201d she asserts. \u201cThey even admit that the only strong evidence regarding this approach is its potential health risks to children.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlong with Cretella\u2019s group, the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, the Catholic Medical Association, and the self-described \u201cleft-leaning\u201d pro-LGBT rights association, Youth Gender Professionals \u2013 all have weighed in with concerns about forced gender ideology being propagated as a civil rights issue without concern for the well-being of children.\u000a\u000aYouth Gender Professionals asserts it is risky to affirm young people who claim to be transgender and provide them with options for hormonal and surgical treatments to change their bodies since these procedures have not been proven safe in the long term.\u000a\u000a\u201cPolicies that encourage \u2014 either directly or indirectly \u2014 such medical treatment for young people who may not be able to evaluate the risks and benefits are highly suspect, in our opinion,\u201d says the group, which is composed of psychologists, social workers, doctors, and other professionals.\u000a\u000aThe organization\u2019s members say they are alarmed that many immature teenagers are deciding they are a member of the opposite sex simply as a result of \u201cbinges\u201d on social media sites.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is evidence that vulnerable young people are being actively recruited and coached on such sites to believe that they are trans,\u201d the professionals say.\u000a\u000aDespite such potential mental health problems associated with gender confusion, children in some states are no longer legally permitted to see a therapist who does not affirm a request for gender transition. Youth Gender Professionals sees such state prohibitions as dangerous since they may block the process of critical thinking and evaluation of the young person regarding the reasons why he or she desires to become a transgender member of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans,\u201d argue the professionals. \u201cThis would mean we can\u2019t ask why; we can\u2019t explore underlying mental health issues; we can\u2019t consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can\u2019t look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, more medical and research professionals are drawing attention to the serious problems inherent in a phenomenon in which media hype and political debate are overshadowing actual questions about the health and psychological well-being of children, such as concerns about puberty-blocking drugs which often used to delay children\u2019s\u2019 development into adults. Such drugs sterilize children even before they can understand how the deep biological impact of puberty will change their feelings about their awkwardly emerging adult male or female body.\u000a\u000aResearchers Paul Hruz, Lawrence Mayer, and Paul McHugh address the problem in a new paper titled \u201cGrowing Pains,\u201d published at The New Atlantis.\u000a\u000aThe authors write:\u000a\u000aThere is strikingly little scientific understanding of important questions underlying the debates over gender identity \u2014 for instance, there is very little scientific evidence explaining why some people identify as the opposite sex, or why childhood expressions of cross-gender identification persist for some individuals and not for others. Yet notwithstanding the limited data, physicians and mental health care providers have arrived at a number of methods for treating children, adolescents, and adults with gender dysphoria.\u000a\u000aThe researchers observe the dangers of \u201cgender-affirming\u201d therapy in which the therapist accepts, without challenge, the patient\u2019s self-perception as the opposite sex:\u000a\u000aGender-affirming models of treatment are sometimes applied even to very young children. Often, the gender-affirming approach is followed in later youth and adulthood by hormonal and surgical interventions intended to make patients\u2019 appearances align more closely with their gender identity than their biological sex. In order to improve the success of the physical changes, interventions at younger ages are increasingly being recommended.\u000a\u000aThe authors warn of decisions made to help \u201caffirm\u201d a gender-confused child\u2019s perceived identity, without any connection to scientific fact or research.\u000a\u000a\u201cThough there is little systematically collected data on the number of young people (or even the number of adults) who identify as transgender or who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery, there is some evidence that the number of people receiving medical and psychotherapeutic care for gender identity issues is on the rise,\u201d they write.\u000a\u000aThey explore the use of puberty suppression or blocking, in which a child or young adolescent with gender dysphoria is treated with hormones that prevent the normal progression of puberty.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor parents of children with gender dysphoria, puberty suppression can appear very attractive,\u201d they observe. \u201cIt seems like it might offer a medical solution for the anticipated confusion, anxiety, and distress by holding back the development of the most conspicuous features of their children\u2019s biological sex.\u201d\u000a\u000aNevertheless, the authors conclude the scientific evidence for puberty suppression as treatment for gender dysphoria is \u201cthin,\u201d and \u201cbased more on the subjective judgments of clinicians than on rigorous empirical evidence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is, in this sense, still experimental \u2014 yet it is an experiment being conducted in an uncontrolled and unsystematic manner,\u201d they warn.\u000a\u000aWalt Heyer is a former transgender who now helps others who have undergone gender transition and now regret their decision. In a column at The Federalist, Heyer takes to task the LGBTQ political lobby who insist on transgender affirmation to prevent suicide of gender-confused young people:\u000a\u000aChildren are encouraged, affirmed and assisted in \u201ccoming out\u201d as transgendered without one word about the consequences of the dangerous game of \u201cgender make-believe.\u201d Today, the politically correct response expected from adults, especially parents, is to affirm the child in the desired gender. But affirmation gives young people false hope that they can really become a different gender. It\u2019s a lie\u2014a lie told with compassionate motives, but a lie nonetheless. Lying is not compassion.\u000a\u000aIconic social and political critic Camille Paglia, a professor who describes herself as \u201ctransgender,\u201d also provides her customary bold perspective on the topic of gender ideology in a recent interview with the Weekly Standard:\u000a\u000aAlthough I describe myself as transgender (I was donning flamboyant male costumes from early childhood on), I am highly skeptical about the current transgender wave, which I think has been produced by far more complicated psychological and sociological factors than current gender discourse allows. Furthermore, I condemn the escalating prescription of puberty blockers (whose long-term effects are unknown) for children. I regard this practice as a criminal violation of human rights.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is certainly ironic how liberals who posture as defenders of science when it comes to global warming (a sentimental myth unsupported by evidence) flee all reference to biology when it comes to gender,\u201d Paglia adds. \u201cThe cold biological truth is that sex changes are impossible. Every single cell of the human body remains coded with one\u2019s birth gender for life. Intersex ambiguities can occur, but they are developmental anomalies that represent a tiny proportion of all human births.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Americans have built their laws and civic rules around this biological fact because they want to help balance the competing and complementary needs of the two equal, but different, sexes, \u201cgender fluid ideology\u201d insists that a person\u2019s biological sex is legally less important than their unverifiable \u201cgender identity.\u201d Additionally, the ideology insists that other Americans must agree that men can be women, and women can be men, depending on their hidden \u201cgender identity.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to a study of the 2010 census, a very small proportion of Americans attempts to live as members of the opposite sex. Only about 1-in-2,400 Americans, for example, have changed their names from one sex to the other.

A new branch is also expected to open in Colorado next summer, with interest in additional camps coming from other areas in the United States as well.\u000a\u000aMolly Maxwell\u2019s child attends Rainbow Day Camp. The mother of a six-year-old boy who believes he is a girl, Maxwell reportedly told AP, \u201cOnce she could talk, I don\u2019t remember a time when she didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m a girl.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen it grew in intensity: \u2018I\u2019m a sister. I\u2019m a daughter. I\u2019m a princess,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cWe would argue with her. She was confused. We were confused.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe boy\u2019s parents eventually found a transgender play group in the Bay Area and allowed their child, who is called Gracie, grow his hair, dress in female clothing, and change his name.\u000a\u000a\u201cI see her now, compared to before,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cI watch her strut around and dance and sing and the way she talks about herself. If she was forced to be someone else. I don\u2019t even want to think about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe report continues:\u000a\u000aGender specialists say the camp\u2019s growth reflects what they are seeing in gender clinics nationwide: increasing numbers of children coming out as transgender at young ages. They credit the rise to greater openness and awareness of LGBT issues and parents tuning in earlier when a child shows signs of gender dysphoria, or distress about their gender.\u000a\u000aThe founder of the Rainbow Day Camp, Sandra Collins, said her own daughter was transgender at two years old.\u000a\u000a\u201cA decade ago, this camp wouldn\u2019t have existed,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually, I do believe, it won\u2019t be so innovative.\u201d\u000a\u000aCollins has also launched another camp for 13- to 17-year-old transgender teens called Camp Kickin\u2019 It.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of these kids have been bullied and had trauma at school,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a world where none of that exists and they\u2019re in the majority. That\u2019s a new experience for kids who are used to hiding and feeling small.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen the young campers arrive each day, they are asked to make a nametag with their pronoun of choice for the day, some choosing simply \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d while others opt for \u201cshe/he,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or none of the above. Children are encouraged to change their pronoun of choice each day, according to \u201cwhat feels right,\u201d says the report.\u000a\u000aAP observes:\u000a\u000aThe favored protocol today is known as the \u2018gender affirmative\u2019 approach, which focuses on identifying and helping transgender children to \u2018socially transition\u2019 \u2013 to live as the gender they identify with rather than the one they were born with until they\u2019re old enough to decide on medical options like puberty blockers and later, hormone treatments.\u000a\u000a\u201cI just think there\u2019s a lot more openness to the understanding that trans adults start as trans kids,\u201d said Johanna Olson-Kennedy, medical director of the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children\u2019s Hospital in Los Angeles. \u201cWhen people say, \u2018Isn\u2019t this too young?\u2019 my question back to them is, \u2018Too young for what? How young do people know their gender?\u2019 The answer to that is some people know it at 3 and some people know it at 30.\u201d\u000a\u000aDiane Ehrensaft, director of mental health at the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s Child and Adolescent Gender Center, told AP enrollment at her facility has tripled over the last several years with a \u201csea change \u2013 maybe we can even call it a tsunami \u2013 in the number of little kids showing up with their families.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany parents of gender confused children are eager to affirm their children\u2019s confusion as a result of the fear of high rates of depression in suicide that have been reported by pro-transgender rights groups.\u000a\u000aHowever, the reported high rates of suicide among transgender individuals could be related to the underlying mental illness of gender dysphoria \u2013 recognized by the American Psychological Association \u2013 that remains masked due to the rush to affirm the confusion, even by professional medical organizations.\u000a\u000a\u201cOver 90 percent of people who commit suicide have a diagnosed mental disorder, and there is no evidence that gender-dysphoric children who commit suicide are any different,\u201d writes Dr. Michelle Cretella, president of the American College of Pediatricians, at the Daily Signal. \u201cMany gender dysphoric children simply need therapy to get to the root of their depression, which very well may be the same problem triggering the gender dysphoria.\u201d\u000a\u000aCretella points to research that demonstrates that, even in Sweden, which is among the countries most accepting of LGBT individuals, adults who undergo sex change surgeries have a suicide rate nearly 20 times greater than that of the general population.\u000a\u000a\u201cClearly, sex reassignment is not the solution to gender dysphoria,\u201d she states.\u000a\u000a\u201cAccording to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty,\u201d observes the College. \u201cConditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe AP report notes: \u201cThere is little comprehensive data on young children who identify as transgender, but experts say as the number of young people coming to their clinics increases, the prevailing medical guidance has shifted.\u201d\u000a\u000aCretella agrees, noting the drive to affirm transgenders is \u201cintruding into the lives of the most innocent among us \u2013 children \u2013 and with the apparent growing support of the professional medical community,\u201d even though there is no evidence gender transition procedures are safe.\u000a\u000a\u201cTwo leading pediatric associations\u2014the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Endocrine Society\u2014have followed in lockstep, endorsing the transition affirmation approach even as the latter organization concedes within its own guidelines that the transition-affirming protocol is based on low evidence,\u201d she asserts. \u201cThey even admit that the only strong evidence regarding this approach is its potential health risks to children.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlong with Cretella\u2019s group, the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, the Catholic Medical Association, and the self-described \u201cleft-leaning\u201d pro-LGBT rights association, Youth Gender Professionals \u2013 all have weighed in with concerns about forced gender ideology being propagated as a civil rights issue without concern for the well-being of children.\u000a\u000aYouth Gender Professionals asserts it is risky to affirm young people who claim to be transgender and provide them with options for hormonal and surgical treatments to change their bodies since these procedures have not been proven safe in the long term.\u000a\u000a\u201cPolicies that encourage \u2014 either directly or indirectly \u2014 such medical treatment for young people who may not be able to evaluate the risks and benefits are highly suspect, in our opinion,\u201d says the group, which is composed of psychologists, social workers, doctors, and other professionals.\u000a\u000aThe organization\u2019s members say they are alarmed that many immature teenagers are deciding they are a member of the opposite sex simply as a result of \u201cbinges\u201d on social media sites.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is evidence that vulnerable young people are being actively recruited and coached on such sites to believe that they are trans,\u201d the professionals say.\u000a\u000aDespite such potential mental health problems associated with gender confusion, children in some states are no longer legally permitted to see a therapist who does not affirm a request for gender transition. Youth Gender Professionals sees such state prohibitions as dangerous since they may block the process of critical thinking and evaluation of the young person regarding the reasons why he or she desires to become a transgender member of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans,\u201d argue the professionals. \u201cThis would mean we can\u2019t ask why; we can\u2019t explore underlying mental health issues; we can\u2019t consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can\u2019t look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, more medical and research professionals are drawing attention to the serious problems inherent in a phenomenon in which media hype and political debate are overshadowing actual questions about the health and psychological well-being of children, such as concerns about puberty-blocking drugs which often used to delay children\u2019s\u2019 development into adults. Such drugs sterilize children even before they can understand how the deep biological impact of puberty will change their feelings about their awkwardly emerging adult male or female body.\u000a\u000aResearchers Paul Hruz, Lawrence Mayer, and Paul McHugh address the problem in a new paper titled \u201cGrowing Pains,\u201d published at The New Atlantis.\u000a\u000aThe authors write:\u000a\u000aThere is strikingly little scientific understanding of important questions underlying the debates over gender identity \u2014 for instance, there is very little scientific evidence explaining why some people identify as the opposite sex, or why childhood expressions of cross-gender identification persist for some individuals and not for others. Yet notwithstanding the limited data, physicians and mental health care providers have arrived at a number of methods for treating children, adolescents, and adults with gender dysphoria.\u000a\u000aThe researchers observe the dangers of \u201cgender-affirming\u201d therapy in which the therapist accepts, without challenge, the patient\u2019s self-perception as the opposite sex:\u000a\u000aGender-affirming models of treatment are sometimes applied even to very young children. Often, the gender-affirming approach is followed in later youth and adulthood by hormonal and surgical interventions intended to make patients\u2019 appearances align more closely with their gender identity than their biological sex. In order to improve the success of the physical changes, interventions at younger ages are increasingly being recommended.\u000a\u000aThe authors warn of decisions made to help \u201caffirm\u201d a gender-confused child\u2019s perceived identity, without any connection to scientific fact or research.\u000a\u000a\u201cThough there is little systematically collected data on the number of young people (or even the number of adults) who identify as transgender or who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery, there is some evidence that the number of people receiving medical and psychotherapeutic care for gender identity issues is on the rise,\u201d they write.\u000a\u000aThey explore the use of puberty suppression or blocking, in which a child or young adolescent with gender dysphoria is treated with hormones that prevent the normal progression of puberty.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor parents of children with gender dysphoria, puberty suppression can appear very attractive,\u201d they observe. \u201cIt seems like it might offer a medical solution for the anticipated confusion, anxiety, and distress by holding back the development of the most conspicuous features of their children\u2019s biological sex.\u201d\u000a\u000aNevertheless, the authors conclude the scientific evidence for puberty suppression as treatment for gender dysphoria is \u201cthin,\u201d and \u201cbased more on the subjective judgments of clinicians than on rigorous empirical evidence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is, in this sense, still experimental \u2014 yet it is an experiment being conducted in an uncontrolled and unsystematic manner,\u201d they warn.\u000a\u000aWalt Heyer is a former transgender who now helps others who have undergone gender transition and now regret their decision. In a column at The Federalist, Heyer takes to task the LGBTQ political lobby who insist on transgender affirmation to prevent suicide of gender-confused young people:\u000a\u000aChildren are encouraged, affirmed and assisted in \u201ccoming out\u201d as transgendered without one word about the consequences of the dangerous game of \u201cgender make-believe.\u201d Today, the politically correct response expected from adults, especially parents, is to affirm the child in the desired gender. But affirmation gives young people false hope that they can really become a different gender. It\u2019s a lie\u2014a lie told with compassionate motives, but a lie nonetheless. Lying is not compassion.\u000a\u000aIconic social and political critic Camille Paglia, a professor who describes herself as \u201ctransgender,\u201d also provides her customary bold perspective on the topic of gender ideology in a recent interview with the Weekly Standard:\u000a\u000aAlthough I describe myself as transgender (I was donning flamboyant male costumes from early childhood on), I am highly skeptical about the current transgender wave, which I think has been produced by far more complicated psychological and sociological factors than current gender discourse allows. Furthermore, I condemn the escalating prescription of puberty blockers (whose long-term effects are unknown) for children. I regard this practice as a criminal violation of human rights.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is certainly ironic how liberals who posture as defenders of science when it comes to global warming (a sentimental myth unsupported by evidence) flee all reference to biology when it comes to gender,\u201d Paglia adds. \u201cThe cold biological truth is that sex changes are impossible. Every single cell of the human body remains coded with one\u2019s birth gender for life. Intersex ambiguities can occur, but they are developmental anomalies that represent a tiny proportion of all human births.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Americans have built their laws and civic rules around this biological fact because they want to help balance the competing and complementary needs of the two equal, but different, sexes, \u201cgender fluid ideology\u201d insists that a person\u2019s biological sex is legally less important than their unverifiable \u201cgender identity.\u201d Additionally, the ideology insists that other Americans must agree that men can be women, and women can be men, depending on their hidden \u201cgender identity.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to a study of the 2010 census, a very small proportion of Americans attempts to live as members of the opposite sex. Only about 1-in-2,400 Americans, for example, have changed their names from one sex to the other.

McMaster to run U.S. foreign policy. Actually, the winner of the 2016 election was a man who opposed virtually every aspect of the McMaster agenda \u2013 and that of the president who made its architect a three-star general, Barack Obama,\u201d Gaffney said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt every turn, the Army general has been insubordinate to his Commander-in-Chief. For example, he has openly opposed Mr. Trump on \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,\u2019 Syria, Qatar, Iran, Russia and the Muslim Brotherhood. Of late, McMaster has taken to purging Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal staff members,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMcMaster last week fired Ezra Cohen-Watnik, the senior intelligence adviser at the NSC.

aVEmails from a reporter for the New York Times to government employees obtained exclusively by Breitbart News demonstrate that the newspaper\u2019s employees are not just on the receiving end of leaks, but are actually soliciting government employees to become leakers. What\u2019s more, the emails demonstrate the Times colluded with the president of government union to encourage and solicit these leaks\u2014something that may become highly problematic for both institutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThanks again for taking the time to speak today,\u201d Coral Davenport, an \u201cEnergy and Environment Correspondent\u201d for the New York Times, writes in an email to John J. O\u2019Grady of the EPA workers\u2019 union. O\u2019Grady is the president of the AFGE Council 238 in Chicago\u2014which represents EPA workers.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cAs I mentioned, I\u2019m working on a story looking specifically at concrete examples of unusual secretary at E.P.A.,\u201d Davenport states, continuing:\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve heard a lot of second-hand rumors, but in order to report these incidents, I\u2019d need to have first-hand or eyewitness accounts. I\u2019m looking for examples of things like, information being communicated only verbally when it would historically have been put in writing, people being told not to bring phones, laptops or even take notes in meetings where they would in the past typically have done so, eyewitness accounts of things like the administrator or top political appointees refusing to use official email, phones or computers, or any other specific, first-hand examples of practices that appear to demonstrate unprecedented secrecy or transparency.\u000a\u000aThe revelation of these emails comes as President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions crack down on leakers. It also comes as EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, has emerged as one of the most successful cabinet-level officials in the Trump administration, and Trump\u2019s political enemies throughout the left and media aim at targeting Pruitt.\u000a\u000aThe Times has come under significant scrutiny for a piece in late July by Lisa Friedman, one of Davenport\u2019s colleagues, for bashing Pruitt for traveling home regularly to Oklahoma.\u000a\u000a\u201cScott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, traveled to his home state, Oklahoma, 10 times over three months this year, largely at taxpayer expense, according to a report released Monday,\u201d Friedman wrote, adding:\u000a\u000aThe findings from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit group founded by former E.P.A. officials, are drawn from Mr. Pruitt\u2019s calendar and the travel expenses he has submitted for reimbursement. Obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the documents show Mr. Pruitt spent 43 out of 92 days from March through May in Oklahoma or traveling to or from the state.\u000a\u000aBut, as she buries in the story several paragraphs in, the report she cites \u201cdoes not assert\u201d that anything about Pruitt\u2019s travels back to Oklahoma as EPA administrator is at all \u201cimproper.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an editorial after the questionable Times piece on Pruitt, the Tulsa World newspaper in Oklahoma mocked the Gray Lady for making a mountain of a mole hill.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we were supposed to be shocked to learn that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is going home on weekends, we\u2019re not,\u201d the Tulsa World\u2019s editorial board wrote under a headline: \u201cHeaven Forfend! Scott Pruitt is going home on weekends!\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, Trump himself has ripped the New York Times in recent days via his Twitter account\u2014calling the newspaper \u201ctotally inept\u201d:\u000a\u000aThe failing @nytimes, which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized), is totally inept! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000aA Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades-Ha, told Breitbart News there is nothing abnormal about these emails.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe email demonstrates the process of reporting and gathering facts,\u201d Rhoades-Ha said in an email early Tuesday when seeking comment.\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady, the union official with whom Davenport was colluding per these emails to solicit government leakers, has not responded to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aDavenport continues in her written plea to O\u2019Grady in the email by noting that if he successfully delivers her the government leakers she is soliciting, she will protect their identities.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile I\u2019d like to speak to staff about these examples, I DON\u2019T need to quote them by name or with any sort of identifying details that could in any way reveal the source of the information,\u201d Davenport writes. She continues:\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re VERY sensitive to the need to protect career folks who speak to us, and we DO NOT want to endanger anyone\u2019s employment. But, in order to ensure that our reporting is based on facts rather than rumors, we do need to feel sure that the examples we give are based on first-hand or eyewitness experiences rather than second and third-hand rumors.\u000a\u000aDavenport then provides her contact information and encourages people to text, call, email, or contact her on the encrypted phone apps Signal or WhatsApp. She provides both her personal email address and her Times email address. Breitbart News has redacted that information from the emails published herein, as well as all personal contact information in the emails.\u000a\u000aShe then continues her plea for leaks and explains the nuts and bolts of how she would go about consolidating leaks into becoming key revelations in a New York Times article down the road.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnother way to do this might be through a combination of your interviews and my reporting,\u201d Davenport writes, adding:\u000a\u000aIf you gave put together multiple eyewitness accounts of a specific example of behavior that demonstrates an unprecedented lack of transparency, we could cite that. Or, if I speak to multiple people who describe, firsthand, such an example, I could cite that without needing any quotations. In general, the more folks I speak to who can offer specific, first-hand accounts of similar phenomena, the more I can write with authority in a broad way with no quotations or identifying details.\u000a\u000aFrom there, she moves on to describe how she has already done this.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve already done this in a number of other stories this year,\u201d Davenport writes. \u201cBelow are four stories that I reported with the help of multiple interviews with current EPA employees. Since the employees gave multiple firsthand accounts but could not be quoted, I was able to describe what was going on without naming, quoting, or identifying any of them. The only employees quoted in these stories are those who specifically gave permission to do so \u2014 generally the union leaders. However, the accounts of employees who were not quoted helped to deeply inform the story and allowed me to write with more authority. So looking to do the same this time.\u201d\u000a\u000aDavenport ends her note by telling O\u2019Grady to \u201cfeel free to send this note around to folks who might be willing to chat,\u201d and then includes the links to the four aforementioned Times pieces built on leaks she solicited from inside the EPA.\u000a\u000aThe four pieces that Davenport links in the email are all critical of Pruitt and the Trump administration\u2019s using leakers she admittedly solicited from inside the federal bureaucracy to do so. The headlines of the four pieces she links to are:\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady then forwarded the email from Davenport to a large list of EPA employees. With Davenport\u2019s full message, O\u2019Grady added a note of his own for EPA officials he was encouraging to leak to the New York Times.\u000a\u000a\u201cBelow is an e-mail I received from Coral Davenport of the New York Times,\u201d O\u2019Grady wrote to his colleagues. \u201cShe needs our assistance in verifying some information she has heard.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt includes two bullet points that use wording to describe what Davenport is looking for that is identical to her original email O\u2019Grady. First, O\u2019Grady wrote that Davenport is \u201clooking for examples of things like, information being communicated only verbally when it would historically have been put in writing, people being told not to bring phones, laptops or even take notes in meetings where they would in the past typically have done so.\u201d Second, O\u2019Grady wrote that Davenport was looking for \u201ceyewitness accounts of things like the administrator or top political appointees refusing to use official email, phones or computers, or any other specific, first-hand examples of practices that appear to demonstrate unprecedented secrecy or transparency.\u201d\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady wrapped up his email to EPA employees by encouraging them to reach out to Davenport.\u000a\u000a\u201cPlease feel free to contact Coral directly,\u201d he wrote.\u000a\u000aIronically, the list of email addresses to which O\u2019Grady forwarded Davenport\u2019s message included a number of personal email addresses of EPA employees\u2014particularly rich since Davenport was seeking evidence of Trump administration EPA politically appointed officials mishandling government email protocol. Again, Breitbart News has redacted, in the images of the emails obtained, personal contact information, including the email addresses in the list of names to which O\u2019Grady forwarded Davenport\u2019s email.\u000a\u000aThe email chain obtained by Breitbart News chops off the original date and time that Davenport sent her email to O\u2019Grady. But it does include the time and date that O\u2019Grady forwarded the email to EPA career officials. The email O\u2019Grady sent to a number of EPA officials was forwarded on Thursday, August 3, at 2:33 p.m.\u000a\u000aThe government employees to whom O\u2019Grady forwarded this email\u2014whose email addresses Breitbart News has redacted from this email chain published via PDFs here\u2014include: Antony Tseng, Bethany Dreyfus, Britta Copt, Clovis Steib, Dennis Miller, Priscilla Oliver, Gary Morton, Lucretia Myers, Mark Coryell, Michael Mikulka, Natasha Greaves, Nate James, Shane Nelson, Silvia Saracco, Steve Calder, Thelma Estrada, Denise Morrison, Jeanne Schulze, Keith Fusinski, Russell Wiener, Sarah Perham, Steve Hopkins, Amer Al-Mudallal, Brent Maier, Destinee Cooper, Diane Lynne, Stephanie Doolan, Leah Oliver, Lesley Mills, Mark Sims, William McBride, Michael Ottlinger, Patrick Chan, and Ann Pitchford.\u000a\u000aApproximately half of those\u2014including O\u2019Grady himself\u2014were on personal email addresses, and many of them were fellow union officials.

Others present were also opposed to repealing Obamacare.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Times reports that most other comments and questions were \u201ccordial,\u201d though LaMalfa was often interrupted.

Inspectors from Waverly Council, which was tasked with the initial approval process, agreed.

aVOver the weekend, Google was rocked by the publication of an internal manifesto that alleged wide-ranging political bias within the company. In exclusive interviews with Breitbart News, more Google employees are now speaking out.\u000a\u000aThe 10-page manifesto, which was met by an immediate backlash, described a climate of fear at the company, in which employees who challenged prevailing leftist narratives on diversity were faced with immediate threats to their career.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBreitbart News is now exclusively publishing a series of interviews with Google employees who contacted us in the wake of the manifesto\u2019s publication to confirm its allegations.\u000a\u000aThe interview series, entitled \u201cRebels of Google,\u201d will be published in full over the coming days. Because every employee who spoke to us fears for their job if their identities were made public, we have provided aliases in place of their real names.\u000a\u000aIn the first interview of the series, a Google employee (alias \u201cHal\u201d) speaks of witch-hunts and intolerance at Google, as well as dysfunction at the company\u2019s upper echelons.\u000a\u000aHal began the interview with a statement about Google:\u000a\u000aHal: Witch hunts are a well-known cultural problem at Google. The company is currently facing a Federal complaint filed by the National Labor Relations Board in April for interfering with employees\u2019 legal right to discuss \u201cworkplace diversity and social justice initiatives.\u201d The complaint alleges that Senior Vice President Urs Holzle and numerous managers in his organization actively stoked up witch hunts in 2015 and 2016 intended to muzzle low-level employees who raised concerns about the company\u2019s practices. The trial is set for November.\u000a\u000aSeveral managers have openly admitted to keeping blacklists of the employees in question, and preventing them from seeking work at other companies. There have been numerous cases in which social justice activists coordinated attempts to sabotage other employees\u2019 performance reviews for expressing a different opinion. These have been raised to the Senior VP level, with no action taken whatsoever.\u000a\u000aAllum Bokhari: What\u2019s it like to work in such an environment? Do you think it damages employee output?\u000a\u000aHal: A lot of social justice activists essentially spend all day fighting the culture war, and get nothing done. The company has made it a point to hire more people like this. The diversity gospel has been woven into nearly everything the company does, to the point where senior leaders focus on diversity first and technology second. The companywide \u201cGoogle Insider\u201d emails used to talk about cool new tech, but now they\u2019re entirely about social justice initiatives. Likewise, the weekly all-hands \u201cTGIF\u201d meetings used to focus on tech, but now they\u2019re split about 50/50 between tech and identity politics signaling.\u000a\u000aFor conservative employees, this is obviously demoralizing, but it is also dangerous. Several have been driven out of the company or fired outright for sharing a dissenting view. Others have had their promotions denied or suffered other forms of deniable retaliation. Most of us just keep our heads down because we can\u2019t afford to lose our jobs.\u000a\u000aAB: Have there been any stand-out moments of intolerance at Google? Anything that particularly sticks in your memory?\u000a\u000aHal: There have been a number of massive witch hunts where hundreds of SJWs mobilize across the corporate intranet to punish somebody who defied the Narrative. The first one I remember is when Kelly Ellis made unfounded allegations of sexual harassment against her former manager, and Google terminated the manager in response to the internal SJW outrage. This was similar in intensity to the current witch hunt. Anyone who sympathized with the manager\u2019s plight or asked for any sort of due process was \u201ccounseled\u201d by HR and told that they were creating a hostile workplace for women and minorities by sticking up for a harasser.\u000a\u000aIn another witch hunt, an employee raised concerns that the affirmative action policy (which gives strong preference to women and minorities) could be seen as discriminating against white males. SJWs trawled through his ancient posting history from four years prior, found a stray comment to take out of context, and burned him at the stake for it.\u000a\u000aAB: Have you heard similar stories from people in other tech companies?\u000a\u000aHal: I have heard two similar stories from Facebook.\u000a\u000aAB: Do you fear for your job?\u000a\u000aHal: I didn\u2019t even write the document, but I always fear for my job and operate with the expectation that I will be purged unless something changes. Talking to reporters is incredibly dangerous on its own, much less talking to Breitbart. And the tolerance for \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d keeps getting lower, to the point where everybody is walking on eggshells because they don\u2019t want to be publicly shamed in next week\u2019s Yes-At-Google.\u000a\u000aAB: Your concerns about intolerance towards employees at Google mirror the concerns of ordinary web users about intolerance towards them. Many people now fear that Google, Facebook, and other companies are moving to control and censor their content. Are these fears justified?\u000a\u000aHal: That is absolutely what Google is trying to do. The pro-censorship voices are very loud, and they have the management\u2019s ear. The anti-censorship people are afraid of retaliation, and people are afraid to openly support them because everyone in their management chain is constantly signaling their allegiance to far-left ideology. Our leadership (Sundar in particular) is weak, so he capitulates to the meanest bullies on the block.\u000a\u000aThis article is part of the \u201cRebels of Google\u201d series.\u000a\u000aYou can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, Gab.ai and add him on Facebook.

aVThe Illinois legislature just created a new state commemorative holiday to celebrate the birthday of \u201cfavorite son\u201d Barack Obama.\u000a\u000aThis week, Illinois Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a bill to honor the 44th president\u2019s August 4 birthday. It won\u2019t be a paid holiday for state employees, but Rauner signed the bill saying he hoped the recognition would \u201cbridges across communities,\u201d Fox News reported.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aSenate Bill 55 says the day will be \u201cobserved throughout the State as a day set apart to honor the 44th President of the United States of America who began his career serving the People of Illinois in both the Illinois State Senate and the United States Senate, and dedicated his life to protecting the rights of Americans and building bridges across communities.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was absolutely no resistance to the bill, even from Republicans, in the state legislature in Springfield, Illinois. Several lawmakers abstained from voting to implement the new holiday, but none voted against it.\u000a\u000aGov. Rauner, though, did oppose an earlier version of the bill that made Obama\u2019s birthday a paid holiday. In opposition to the idea of giving employees a paid day off, Rauner said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be a formal holiday with paid, forced time off, but I think it should be a day of acknowledgment and celebration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe state of Illinois has the worst budget and pension crisis in the nation and many of the state\u2019s vendors haven\u2019t been paid for years.\u000a\u000aBarack Obama took up permanent residence in Illinois in 1995 and lived there until he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004, after which he moved to Washington and rarely returned to the state that gave him his political start. He lived in Illinois for about ten years full time.\u000a\u000aTwo other presidents made Illinois their home: Ronald Reagan and Abraham Lincoln. Unlike Barack Obama, who only used Illinois as a political stepping stone, Ronald Reagan was born in the state and spent the first 21 years of his life there.\u000a\u000aThe deeply Democratic state never made Ronald Reagan\u2019s birthday an official holiday, and this lapse is one reason some lawmakers balked at making Barack Obama\u2019s birthday a paid state holiday.\u000a\u000aBorn in Kentucky, but spending most of his life in Illinois, Abe Lincoln\u2019s birthday has been a paid state holiday for many years.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.

aVSteve Thomma, the veteran White House reporter and current executive director of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, pointed out on Sunday evening that President Barack Obama\u2019s White House actually started the trend of creating \u201creal news\u201d videos to go around the traditional media\u2019s filters to get its message out more directly to voters\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s critics erupted on Sunday after Kayleigh McEnany hosted a \u201creal news\u201d segment that Trump\u2019s reelection campaign tweeted out. McEnany announced last week that she was leaving CNN, where she was one of two pro-Trump voices along with Jeffrey Lord, and the Republican National Committee (RNC) revealed on Monday that she would come on board as an official spokesperson.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Trump campaign\u2019s \u201creal news\u201d video did not try to trick voters into thinking it was an \u201cobjective\u201d PBS-type newscast. It had Trump\u2019s website address and the Trump/Pence campaign logo in the background, making it obvious, as even CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski pointed out, that it was not really that different from the types of videos most campaigns produce in the digital age. McEnany just pointed out some positive news from last week for Trump and the video was funded with campaign funds. Obama\u2019s videos, in contrast, were slick productions funded with taxpayer dollars. Team Obama put out his \u201cWhite House Week\u201d videos even though the legacy media did all they could to put Obama in a favorable light and ask him leading questions like what \u201cenchanted\u201d Obama most about being in the White House.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s good to have someone like Thomma with some semblance of institutional knowledge, but it did not prevent the usual band of Trump haters from piling on McEnany.\u000a\u000aTrend started with Obama team's weekly video recap of what it saw as the "news," called White House Week. https://t.co/fKzJG2ptBO \u2014 Steve Thomma (@stevethomma) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000ameh.

The video, with trump\u2019s website address and the Trump/Pence logo in the background, is not trying to fool anybody as it is clearly, as Kaczynski noted, not \u201cdifferent from stuff campaigns/groups\u201d do.\u000a\u000aThis is the type of propaganda you'd see in North Korea.

Terrible idea. \u2014 Jedediah Bila (@JedediahBila) August 6, 2017\u000a\u000aHillary Clinton\u2019s digital director Matt Ortega piled on, which was rich given how the legacy media has essentially produced propaganda interviews for Clinton for most of her political career as they have tried to break the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d for the robotic candidate who voters have felt never stood for anything except for doing whatever it took to get elected. Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s national security hack who reportedly bragged about creating a \u201cpropaganda machine\u201d and \u201cecho chamber\u201d for the Iran Deal, richly criticized McEnany\u2019s non-deceptive video as well\u2013McEnany is not pretending to be objective like many \u201cpundits\u201d and legacy media reporters so often do.\u000a\u000aKayleigh McEnany, now appearing on actual state-run media, lines up pretty perfectly with North Korean propaganda. pic.twitter.com/5WMjVaDazD \u2014 Matt Ortega (@MattOrtega) August 6, 2017\u000a\u000aI feel like Fox should just go straight to this backdrop https://t.co/mp2tITAyMP \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 6, 2017\u000a\u000aSo, in essence, because Trump\u2019s campaign did not use taxpayer funds to slickly produce videos like Obama\u2019s White House team did, the Trump campaign\u2019s weekly \u201creal news\u201d videos were, to his critics, state-run propaganda clips that North Koreans would air. This line of thinking also reveals that these elitists think American voters are so stupid that they cannot tell the difference between a purportedly objective newscast and a \u201creal news\u201d show that the Trump campaign is producing. The legacy press, even in the digital age, try to fool viewers into believing they are \u201cobjective.\u201d At least viewers know that the Trump\u2019s campaign \u201creal news\u201d segments are biased in favor of Trump.\u000a\u000aHere are some of Obama\u2019s \u201cWest Wing Week\u201d videos that legacy media reporters and those who purportedly are on the center right never found oh-so-offensive.

aVAugust 7 marks President Donald Trump\u2019s second 100 days in office. They were just as intense as the first 100, if not more so.\u000a\u000aAnd while there were some disappointments, such as the Republican Senate\u2019s failure to repeal and replace Obamacare; and some challenges, such as the expanding Russia investigation; Trump also scored a variety of big achievements, from economics to special elections to foreign policy.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHere are 15 highlights (and lowlights):\u000a\u000aJobs. Trump enjoyed better-than-expected jobs reports from April through July, at the same time that the stock market set new record highs. Though he did not make much progress toward a major infrastructure program, he secured new foreign investment in Rust Belt states and continued to roll back regulations, raising prospects for rapid economic growth. The prospect of tax reform \u2014 albeit delayed \u2014 also contributed to buoyant expectations.\u000a\u000aBudget. Congress made little progress on budget reform, as Republicans continued to cave to Democrat threats and objections. The White House claimed it had won concessions from Democrats on defense spending, but the overall budget remained bloated, thanks in part to Republican fears of being punished by the media for any failure to reach a deal. Trump called for a \u201cgood \u2018shutdown'\u201d in September, when the next federal budget agreement would be due.\u000a\u000aHealth Care. The U.S. House passed the American Health Care Act to repeal and replace Obamacare. But the GOP-controlled Senate would not pass similar legislation, nor would it offer a straightforward repeal of Obamacare, or even part of Obamacare, thanks to the defection of three GOP moderates, including John McCain (R-AZ). Trump continued to press the GOP to honor its promises to the American electorate, though the prospects are dim for now.\u000a\u000aParis Climate Accords Pullout. In perhaps the boldest move of his young presidency, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the global climate agreement that had been a centerpiece of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy, second only to the Iran nuclear deal. Conservatives cheered Trump\u2019s decision, which was made over objections from inside the administration itself. Democrat-controlled cities and states pledged a symbolic commitment to the Paris deal.\u000a\u000aOverseas Trips. Trump made several overseas trips, two of particular importance: the first to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican; and the second to Poland, followed by the G-20 summit in Germany. Each trip included a major speech. In Riyadh, Trump demanded the Islamic world do more to stop terrorism; in Warsaw, he mounted a stirring defense of western civilization. He also visited the Western Wall, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.\u000a\u000aMelania Trump. The First Lady fulfilled her pledge to move to Washington following the end of the school year for Trump\u2019s youngest son, Barron. She made a splash as she accompanied the president on his overseas trips, with stylish yet culturally relevant outfits in the Middle East, and elegant yet modest attire at the Vatican. She also began to carry out diplomatic duties on these visits, visiting hospitals and other charitable projects, as she fit into the role.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea. Kim Jong-un continued to ratchet up his provocations, eventually testing several inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) theoretical capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Trump\u2019s previous diplomatic efforts to urge China to take action against its rogue client state seemed to have gone nowhere, until the UN Security Council passed unanimous new sanctions against the North Korean regime, denting one-third of the country\u2019s exports.\u000a\u000aTerror. As Trump continued to accelerate the campaign against the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East, there were several terror attacks in Europe linked to the group. At home, domestic terror struck at a Republican baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia on June 14, as a left-wing gunman wounded five, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), before being shot by Capitol police on the scene and Alexandria officers who arrived later.\u000a\u000aImmigration. Enforcement brought illegal border crossings down by roughly two-thirds from the year before. The Supreme Court lifted an injunction against Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel from six terror-prone countries \u2014 a major victory. The House passed \u201cKate\u2019s Law\u201d to crack down on criminal illegal aliens, and the administration threatened \u201csanctuary cities\u201d with cuts to federal law enforcement grants. But the border \u201cwall\u201d was still delayed.\u000a\u000aComey and Russia. Trump\u2019s sudden decision to fire FBI director James Comey triggered a serious escalation of the Russia probe, including the appointment of a Special Counsel, Robert Mueller. No evidence of collusion surfaced, but Donald Trump, Jr. was found to have met with a Russian lawyer who he hoped would have opposition research on Hillary Clinton. Mueller\u2019s investigation began to expand beyond the election to the Trump business empire.\u000a\u000aVoter Fraud. Trump launched his voter fraud commission, officially the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. Many states refused to cooperate with its requests for data to investigate the accuracy of voter rolls. The left continued to attack the commission as a political attempt at voter suppression, but Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the vice chairman of the commission, vowed to press ahead with his investigations.\u000a\u000aTransgender Ban. Trump announced on Twitter on July 26: \u201cAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\u201d The decision was cheered by social conservatives, and jeered by the LGBT community, amidst some opposition within the military, and confusion about how to implement the order.\u000a\u000aStaff Shakeup. Feuds within the White House continued among rival factions, amidst a torrent of media leaks. Trump openly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Twitter. He brought businessman Anthony Scaramucci on as communications director, prompting Press Secretary Sean Spicer to resign. Ten days later, \u201cThe Mooch\u201d was out. So, too, was Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who was replaced by Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly.\u000a\u000aMeme Wars. Hollywood\u2019s assault on Trump continued, with the L.A. gay pride parade officially devoted to the \u201cResistance.\u201d Comedian Kathy Griffin went too far even for some on the left when she posed for photos holding aloft a decapitated Trump head. Trump shocked the media by re-tweeting an edited World Wrestling Entertainment video that featured the CNN logo on the head of WWE CEO Vince McMahon as Trump beat him to the ground.\u000a\u000aSpecial Elections. Trump continued to shut Democrats out in special elections, which the media expected them to win on a supposed wave of anti-Trump sentiment. In Montana, Republican Greg Gianforte won even after being arrested for assaulting a Guardian reporter, and in Georgia, Karen Handel won the most expensive congressional race in history after her Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, had looked like a heavy favorite just days before.\u000a\u000aJoel B.

aVMATAMOROS, Tamaulipas \u2014 Mexico\u2019s Gulf Cartel managed to build a training camp in this border city with guard towers, walls, drill areas, and a garage for outfitting vehicles with armor plating.\u000a\u000aThe camp was discovered by the Mexican Army during an enforcement operation in the rural areas southwest of Matamoros.

Matamoros is a border city immediately south of Brownsville, Texas.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aCartel forces in Matamoros set up a series of blockades throughout the city to keep soldiers from reaching the camp. By the time that the Mexican army reached the walled facility, cartel gunmen managed to flee leaving behind weapons, tactical gear, armored vehicles, and other items.\u000a\u000aThe compound was surrounded by a wall and had a concrete guard tower used by lookouts to warn about any approaching rival forces. Inside, authorities found multiple structures including garages, workshops, and target ranges.\u000a\u000aInside the garages, authorities found more than a dozen vehicles including white SUVs outfitted with makeshift armor. The troops also found some SUVs that were being cloned to look like police and military vehicles typically to fool authorities.\u000a\u000aDuring a search six tactical rifles, a belt-fed machine gun, 15 helmets, 86 ammunition magazines, several tactical vests, and various other items were found.

David Perdue (R-GA), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK), and Trump introduced the bill last week called the RAISE Act, which would overhaul our current legal immigration system into a \u201cmerit-based\u201d points system, not unlike systems already in place in countries such as Canada and Australia.\u000a\u000aThe system prioritizes prospective legal immigrants with sought-after skills, education, or English language proficiency and would curb the number of green cards issued each year.\u000a\u000aDespite Trump\u2019s promise to reform immigration and polls that show public support for a merit-based immigration system, the measure needs 60 votes to pass the Senate without a filibuster.\u000a\u000aRubio, who led the fight for amnesty for DREAMers, or children of illegal aliens allowed to come to the U.S. under the DREAM Act, said he opposes the cap on the number of people who can come to the U.S. with a green card.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere I probably have a big difference of opinion with this bill is that it sets an arbitrary cap on the number of people that are able to come through with a green card.

aVUNITED NATIONS\u2014President Trump\u2019s tough stance on China was vindicated Saturday when the U.N. Security Council voted to slap significant sanctions on North Korea, with China voting in favor of the tough sanctions\u2014a major win for Trump\u2019s hard edged stance toward the geopolitical foe.\u000a\u000aAlthough the resolution includes token nods to the resumption of the Six Party Talks and expresses hope that the sanctions do not target the North Korean people, China came away from the negotiating table mostly empty handed.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThere is no pro-China way of spinning this: The Chinese, seen in some circles as an unstoppable behemoth, proved to be a paper tiger on the issue of the North Korea in the face of the tough stance shown by Trump and his administration.\u000a\u000aTrump made getting tough on China one of his central campaign promises, mainly in terms of trade but also with China\u2019s inaction on the rogue regime of North Korea. On North Korea, China has continually pushed back on any efforts to clamp down on the regime, even after the launch of two intercontinental ballistic missiles by North Korea in July, during which time China held the presidency of the Security Council.\u000a\u000aDespite the obvious escalation by North Korea\u2019s launching of a missile that could reach American cities, China appeared to dismiss the launches. At an emergency Security Council session at the beginning of July, Russia expressed doubt that the missile launched was, in fact, an ICBM, while both China and Russia rejected the idea of sanctions or military escalation.\u000a\u000aChina went with its standard line of calling on parties to \u201cexercise restraint\u201d and avoid \u201cbelligerent rhetoric.\u201d It seemed like business as usual from the Chinese.\u000a\u000aWhile both the U.S. and China told reporters they were negotiating a resolution, with China and Russia\u2019s business interests dominating their respective agendas there seemed no reason for them to change their approach. But U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley\u2014who, while not a Trump ally during the campaign, has been in lockstep with the president\u2019s foreign policy goals at the U.N.\u2014gave China a warning of what was to come. In the unusually tense session, she warned China that America was willing to go it alone.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you are happy with North Korea\u2019s actions, veto it. If you want to be a friend of North Korea, veto it. But if you see this as a threat, if you see this for what it is\u2014North Korea showing its muscle\u2014then you need to stand strong and vote with the international community to strengthen sanctions on North Korea and if you choose not to, we will go our own path,\u201d she growled.\u000a\u000aTrump, who had given Beijing a chance when he met with President Xi Jinping in April and expressed optimism about U.S.-Sino relations, also expressed his anger at China\u2019s stubbornness, saying \u201cso much for China working with us\u201d:\u000a\u000aTrade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us \u2013 but we had to give it a try! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2017\u000a\u000aHe followed this up explicitly after the second test, blasting China for being \u201cjust talk\u201d and warning \u201cwe will no longer allow this to continue\u201d:\u000a\u000aI am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet\u2026 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017\u000a\u000a\u2026they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017\u000a\u000aHaley, instead of playing the good cop to Trump\u2019s bad cop, shocked the U.N. by implying a day later that if China did not want to cooperate, the U.S. was done with China and the U.N.\u2014announcing that the U.S. had no intention of requesting an emergency session of the Security Council as was widely expected.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no point in having an emergency session if it produces nothing of consequence,\u201d she said, before putting the ball firmly in China\u2019s court, saying, \u201cChina must decide whether it is finally willing to take this vital step. The time for talk is over.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe one-two diplomatic punch from a hardline Trump administration apparently staggered China, who were used to the Obama administration\u2019s gentle approach to diplomacy.\u000a\u000aA jittery-looking Ambassador Liu Jieyi held a press conference Monday and did not mention North Korea in his remarks, except to list it at the bottom of a broad list of things the Security Council had to deal with. Only when pressed on the issue by the press did he respond.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have been urging DPRK and indeed other relevant countries not to exacerbate the situation in the Korean peninsula by avoiding language and action that heightens tension on the Korean peninsula because that runs counter to the objectives sought to be achieved through Security Council resolutions,\u201d he said. He later noted that he was deliberately not mentioning specific countries, although it was not clear why.\u000a\u000aWhen Liu did finally mention the U.S., he chose not to attack the U.S. directly, but instead only reduced China\u2019s role in the conflict.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are two principal parties \u2026 the DPRK and the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile people talk about China a lot, if the two principal parties refuse to move towards what is required by Security Council resolutions, the de-escalation of tension, negotiation to achieve denuclearization and peace and stability, and also to resume dialogue then no matter how capable China is, China\u2019s efforts will not yield practical results.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut despite saying China was firmly against an \u201ceconomic blockade\u201d and arguing that only dialogue and negotiation could save the day, within days China crumbled under Trump\u2019s pressure.\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, in a unanimous vote, the Council passed a resolution hitting North Korea with fresh sanctions. China and Russia, both countries that could have vetoed the resolution, voted for it.\u000a\u000aAnd the resolution was no hodge-podge compromise either, like some resolutions that China and Russia signed off on during the Obama years. The bill places draconian limits on North Korea\u2019s exports of coal, lead, iron, lead ore, iron ore, and seafood. The resolution is estimated to wipe a third off the value of North Korea\u2019s exports\u2014at the tune of $1 billion a year.\u000a\u000aThe question of to what extent the resolution will be enforced remains unanswered. Haley was not exaggerating when she called it \u201cthe single largest economic sanctions package\u201d ever leveled against the regime, while U.K. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft called the package \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump is justified in his annoyance at the media coverage the resolution has received. While even the New York Times conceded it was a \u201cmajor victory\u201d for the U.S., the win hasn\u2019t received the kind of fanfare even the mildest of Obama\u2019s diplomatic successes were met with by the media:\u000a\u000aThe Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000aThe media, for all its elitist snorting at Trump\u2019s \u201cTwitter diplomacy\u201d and his shunning of Obama\u2019s \u201cnuance,\u201d are now facing an awkward conclusion for their editorial boards\u2014Trump\u2019s tough line on China just gained him an enormous victory on the world\u2019s stage, and handed China a humiliating defeat.\u000a\u000aAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

They took the Swastika, rotated it by 45 degrees, and turned it into hatred, and turned it into fear, and turned it into war, and turned it into racism, and turned it into power. They stigmatized the Swastika forever. They won. They limited our freedom. Or maybe not? The Swastika is coming back together with peace, together with love, together with respect, together with freedom.\u000a\u000aBefore it was used as a symbol by the Nazis and Adolf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich, the swastika (svastika) \u2014 which means \u201cgood fortune\u201d or \u201cwell being\u201d in Sanskrit \u2014 was, and still is, a sacred symbol in India among Hindus, Buddhists and Jains.

aVA grim milestone appears to be passing, as both U.S. and Japanese intelligence analysts believe North Korea has developed the technology to miniaturize nuclear warheads and fit them inside long-range missiles, years ahead of schedule.\u000a\u000aJapan\u2019s annual defense review, released on Tuesday morning, described the threat from North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile program as \u201cacute.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is conceivable that North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program has already considerably advanced and it is possible that North Korea has already achieved the miniaturization of nuclear weapons and has acquired nuclear warheads,\u201d the white paper warned. \u201cSince last year, when it forcibly implemented two nuclear tests and more than 20 ballistic missile launches, the security threats have entered a new stage.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccordingly, the BBC reported that Japan has begun its first civilian air-raid drills since the end of World War II, evidently stepping up a program revealed earlier this year which taught civilians in certain towns how to deal with an errant North Korean test missile (or perhaps a weapon fired at American military installations in Japan) falling in a populated area.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re told to hit the ground or hide behind the wall, but will that really help? Will that really protect us if a missile really falls here, I wonder?\u201d asked one Japanese citizen interviewed by the BBC.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported on Tuesday afternoon that U.S. analysts at the Defense Intelligence Agency reached similar conclusions about North Korea\u2019s capabilities in a confidential assessment prepared last month.\u000a\u000aThe DIA report also raised the official estimate of North Korea\u2019s nuclear inventory considerably, from the handful of bombs hypothesized by most earlier analyses to almost 60 nuclear devices.\u000a\u000aThe report\u2019s authors believe some of these devices are small enough to be delivered by intercontinental ballistic missile. As the Washington Post notes, North Korea claims it has successfully tested such miniaturized devices, although their claims were greeted with widespread skepticism at the time. The missing piece of the ICBM puzzle for North Korea would appear to be reliable heat shielding to protect the warheads from re-entry, a technology Pyongyang is clearly working hard to develop.\u000a\u000aA new poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs released on Monday found 90 percent of Americans \u201creject the idea that North Korea should be allowed to produce nuclear weapons,\u201d 75 percent see the North Korean nuclear program as a \u201ccritical threat facing the United States,\u201d and 62 percent would support using American troops to defend South Korea from a North Korean attack.

aVLawsuits by Chicago and California against President Donald Trump\u2019s sanctuary city executive order and Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 federal funding conditions are almost certain to end up at the Supreme Court within two years, raising profound constitutional questions about immigration, state sovereignty, and the rule of law.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump signed Executive Order 13768 on January 25, 2017, including Section 2(c), which codifies the policy of the federal government to \u201censure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAttorney General Sessions is faithfully carrying out the president\u2019s order, announcing that the U.S. Department of Justice will deny federal law enforcement grants from the Byrne JAG program to cities that defy federal immigration law by harboring illegal aliens or refusing to honor federal detainer requests to hand over for deportation illegal aliens within the city\u2019s jail system.\u000a\u000aChicago responded by filing a six-count lawsuit in federal court, represented by a massive team from global powerhouse law firm WilmerHale, spearheaded by some of the top lawyers from the Clinton and Obama administrations.\u000a\u000aThese top-tier Democratic lawyers argue a host of statutory and constitutional issues. These include arguing that no federal statute empowers the attorney general to withhold these funds, that the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers permits only Congress to impose conditions on eligibility for federal money, and that withholding these funds would exceed Congress\u2019 power under the Constitution\u2019s Spending Clause, coercing state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.\u000a\u000aThe 45-page civil complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, which tends to be a more liberal district court. It will then go up to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\u000a\u000aCalifornia has announced it will bring a lawsuit raising similar arguments, joined by over 300 cities and counties. After federal district court, that case will eventually go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\u000a\u000aThese cases may create a \u201ccircuit split\u201d of conflicting appellate decisions between the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, which, under these circumstances, would essentially guarantee that the Supreme Court would take the case. But even if the appeals courts all rule against the president and the attorney general, it is extremely unlikely that the High Court would refuse to grant the U.S. solicitor general\u2019s subsequent petition to review the cases and establish a uniform rule of law on these issues.\u000a\u000aThese two cases will likely go up on appeal for decisions in 2018, possibly leading to a historic Supreme Court decision in 2019.\u000a\u000aAdditional, less prominent lawsuits have been filed elsewhere in the country against the executive order or the new Justice Department policy, and still more suits are possible.\u000a\u000aThe case already filed and docketed is City of Chicago v.

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster served at a UK-based think tank financed by a controversial, George Soros-funded group identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.\u000a\u000aFrom September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow. The IISS describes itself as a \u201cworld-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe IISS has been supportive of the Obama administration-brokered 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, and the group has repeatedly hit back against charges that Tehran has violated the agreement.\u000a\u000aMcMaster himself has been accused of purging the National Security Council of hardliners on Iran, and he is seen as a leading proponent of the Iran nuclear accord within the Trump administration. He has reportedly urged the White House to recertify Iran\u2019s compliance with the Iran nuclear deal.\u000a\u000aIISS\u2019s website contains a list of groups, corporations and government entities that provide funding to the think tank, including during the period of McMaster\u2019s work there. Curiously missing from the page of donors, however, is the controversial Ploughshares Fund, a grantmaking group identified last year by the Obama White House as central in helping to market the Iran nuclear deal to the news media.\u000a\u000aAn archived version of IISS\u2019s donors page lists Ploughshares as a donor.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News has found that IISS is listed as a grantee for Iran issues in Ploughshares Fund\u2019s budget report for 2016.\u000a\u000aThat report spotlights IISS as a grantee for Iran work done by Michael Elleman, IISS senior fellow for missile defense.\u000a\u000aIn a recent IISS analysis, Elleman cast doubt on charges that Iran and North Korea are working together on ballistic-missile development, claiming \u201cthere is little evidence to indicate the two regimes are engaged in deep missile-related collaboration, or pursuing joint-development programs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, is listed as a member of IISS in his Georgetown University bio.\u000a\u000aIISS has not returned Breitbart News requests seeking clarification on the Ploughshares funding and inquiring about McMaster\u2019s work at IISS, including any salary that he may have received.\u000a\u000aSoros-Funded Ploughshares Part of \u2018Echo Chamber\u2019 to Sell Obama\u2019s Iran Deal\u000a\u000aPloughshares Fund is financed by Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute.\u000a\u000aThe involvement of Ploughshares in selling the Iran agreement to the public was revealed in an extensive New York Times Magazine profile of Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, titled, \u201cThe Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru.\u201d The article contains interviews with Rhodes and scores of top Obama administration officials.\u000a\u000aRobert Malley, then a senior director at the National Security Council, expounded on the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal.\u000a\u000aMalley explained to the Times that \u201cexperts\u201d were utilized to create an \u201cecho chamber\u201d that disseminated administration claims about Iran to \u201chundreds of often-clueless reporters\u201d in the news media.\u000a\u000aTimes author David Samuels wrote:\u000a\u000aIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aRhodes told Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the \u201cabsence of rational discourse\u201d and utilized outside groups, including Ploughshares.\u000a\u000aWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else.

aVTEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran signed the country\u2019s biggest-ever car deal, worth several hundred million dollars, with French manufacturer Groupe Renault on Monday to produce 150,000 cars a year, the latest advance by a European company into Iran\u2019s sizable consumer market.\u000a\u000aThe \u20ac660 million \u2014 or $778 million \u2014 deal follows the lifting of the UN and European Union sanctions after Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers to curb its controversial uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIt also comes just days after new US sanctions on Iran were signed by US President Donald Trump, who spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend about ways to counter Iran\u2019s influence in Mideast conflicts. The US legislation, first passed by Congress, imposes penalties on people involved in Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.\u000a\u000aUnimpeded by US sanctions that apply to American businesses, Asian and European companies have raced for a share of Iran\u2019s market since international sanctions were lifted. Iran, with its population of 80 million people, sits atop the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil reserves and the second-biggest reserves of natural gas. It also has well-established manufacturing and agricultural industries.\u000a\u000aJust last month, France Total SA and a Chinese Oil Company signed a $5 billion agreement with Iran to develop the country\u2019s massive offshore natural gas field in the first such deal since the landmark nuclear deal was struck. Also, Washington granted permission to Chicago-based Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars\u2019 worth of aircraft to Iran in September 2016.\u000a\u000aRenault and other European companies are looking to rebuild their presence in Iran following the lifting of international sanctions. Renault says that in the first half of 2017, its sales in Iran increased by more than 100 percent to 68,365 vehicles \u2014 a nearly 10 percent market share.\u000a\u000aThe company has been operating in Iran since 2003, though operations were halted when Iran came under international sanctions over its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aDuring the signing ceremony in Tehran, Iran\u2019s Minister of Industry Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said the deal with multinational automobile manufacturer Renault would \u201cestablish a research and development center for designing\u201d in\u000a\u000athe country.\u000a\u000aA Renault executive, Thierry Bolloré, said it would help transfer technology to Iran and reinforce Groupe Renault\u2019s position there.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis joint venture will enable an acceleration of our growth in this country,\u201d he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe car deal is expected to create about 3,000 jobs for the two Iranian companies involved: IDRO, or the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran, and the privately-owned Negin Group, which imports Renault products to Iran.\u000a\u000aThe plant, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) outside Tehran, will produce Duster and Symbol cars starting in 2018, adding 150,000 vehicles a year to the Iranian market above Renault\u2019s already existing capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year in Iran. Renault, a majority shareholder with a 60 percent share in the deal, will have its own distribution network in Iran for the first time. The deal was first reached with Iran\u2019s government last September.\u000a\u000aAlso last year, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen reached a deal to open a plant producing 200,000 vehicles annually in Iran. Peugeot was a major player in Iran\u2019s car market before international sanctions were imposed.\u000a\u000aIran produces about 1,350,000 vehicles a year, though authorities hope that number will reach 3 million annually by 2025. There are around 30 car manufacturers in Iran, most of which assemble Chinese and Korean cars in Iran.

aVFour scientists have claimed that James Damore\u2019s Google manifesto is scientifically accurate, as reported by Quillette.\u000a\u000aResponding to the viewpoint diversity manifesto, which called for more ideological diversity in Google\u2019s workplace and pointed out not only the biological differences between men and women but also how these can apply to work, the four scientists deemed the ten-page document to be scientifically accurate.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cThe author of the Google essay on issues related to diversity gets nearly all of the science and its implications exactly right,\u201d declared Rutgers University Professor Lee Jussim. \u201cIts main points are that: 1. Neither the left nor the right gets diversity completely right; 2. The social science evidence on implicit and explicit bias has been wildly oversold and is far weaker than most people seem to realize; 3. Google has, perhaps unintentionally, created an authoritarian atmosphere that has stifled discussion of these issues by stigmatizing anyone who disagrees as a bigot and instituted authoritarian policies of reverse discrimination; 4. The policies and atmosphere systematically ignore biological, cognitive, educational, and social science research on the nature and sources of individual and group differences.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot speak to the atmosphere at Google, but: 1. Give that the author gets everything else right, I am pretty confident he is right about that too; 2. It is a painfully familiar atmosphere, one that is a lot like academia,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aThis view was mirrored by Professor David P. Schmitt.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to discuss this topic scientifically, keeping an open mind and using informed skepticism when evaluating claims about evidence,\u201d Schmitt proclaimed in the article. \u201cIn the case of personality traits, evidence that men and women may have different average levels of certain traits is rather strong.\u201d\u000a\u000aUniversity of New Mexico Professor Geoffrey Miller also agreed, claiming that critics of the manifesto \u201cignored the memo\u2019s evidence-based arguments.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAmong commentators who claim the memo\u2019s empirical facts are wrong, I haven\u2019t read a single one who understands sexual selection theory, animal behavior, and sex differences research,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think that almost all of the Google memo\u2019s empirical claims are scientifically accurate. Moreover, they are stated quite carefully and dispassionately. Its key claims about sex differences are especially well-supported by large volumes of research across species, cultures, and history.\u201d\u000a\u000aDebra W. Soh, Ph.D., a Canadian science writer, also deemed the manifesto to be scientifically accurate, declaring, \u201cAs a woman who\u2019s worked in academia and within STEM, I didn\u2019t find the memo offensive or sexist in the least.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI found it to be a well thought out document, asking for greater tolerance for differences in opinion, and treating people as individuals instead of based on group membership,\u201d Soh explained. \u201cWithin the field of neuroscience, sex differences between women and men\u2014when it comes to brain structure and function and associated differences in personality and occupational preferences\u2014are understood to be true, because the evidence for them (thousands of studies) is strong. This is not information that\u2019s considered controversial or up for debate; if you tried to argue otherwise, or for purely social influences, you\u2019d be laughed at.\u201d\u000a\u000aGoogle employee James Damore, who authored the manifesto, has since been fired from Google, with the company claiming he had advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.\u201d\u000a\u000aRead the full article at Quillette.\u000a\u000aCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

aVUNITED NATIONS\u2014President Trump\u2019s tough stance on China was vindicated Saturday when the U.N. Security Council voted to slap significant sanctions on North Korea, with China voting in favor of the tough sanctions\u2014a major win for Trump\u2019s hard edged stance toward the geopolitical foe.\u000a\u000aAlthough the resolution includes token nods to the resumption of the Six Party Talks and expresses hope that the sanctions do not target the North Korean people, China came away from the negotiating table mostly empty handed.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThere is no pro-China way of spinning this: The Chinese, seen in some circles as an unstoppable behemoth, proved to be a paper tiger on the issue of the North Korea in the face of the tough stance shown by Trump and his administration.\u000a\u000aTrump made getting tough on China one of his central campaign promises, mainly in terms of trade but also with China\u2019s inaction on the rogue regime of North Korea. On North Korea, China has continually pushed back on any efforts to clamp down on the regime, even after the launch of two intercontinental ballistic missiles by North Korea in July, during which time China held the presidency of the Security Council.\u000a\u000aDespite the obvious escalation by North Korea\u2019s launching of a missile that could reach American cities, China appeared to dismiss the launches. At an emergency Security Council session at the beginning of July, Russia expressed doubt that the missile launched was, in fact, an ICBM, while both China and Russia rejected the idea of sanctions or military escalation.\u000a\u000aChina went with its standard line of calling on parties to \u201cexercise restraint\u201d and avoid \u201cbelligerent rhetoric.\u201d It seemed like business as usual from the Chinese.\u000a\u000aWhile both the U.S. and China told reporters they were negotiating a resolution, with China and Russia\u2019s business interests dominating their respective agendas there seemed no reason for them to change their approach. But U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley\u2014who, while not a Trump ally during the campaign, has been in lockstep with the president\u2019s foreign policy goals at the U.N.\u2014gave China a warning of what was to come. In the unusually tense session, she warned China that America was willing to go it alone.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you are happy with North Korea\u2019s actions, veto it. If you want to be a friend of North Korea, veto it. But if you see this as a threat, if you see this for what it is\u2014North Korea showing its muscle\u2014then you need to stand strong and vote with the international community to strengthen sanctions on North Korea and if you choose not to, we will go our own path,\u201d she growled.\u000a\u000aTrump, who had given Beijing a chance when he met with President Xi Jinping in April and expressed optimism about U.S.-Sino relations, also expressed his anger at China\u2019s stubbornness, saying \u201cso much for China working with us\u201d:\u000a\u000aTrade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us \u2013 but we had to give it a try! \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017\u000a\u000aHaley, instead of playing the good cop to Trump\u2019s bad cop, shocked the U.N. by implying a day later that if China did not want to cooperate, the U.S. was done with China and the U.N.\u2014announcing that the U.S. had no intention of requesting an emergency session of the Security Council as was widely expected.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no point in having an emergency session if it produces nothing of consequence,\u201d she said, before putting the ball firmly in China\u2019s court, saying, \u201cChina must decide whether it is finally willing to take this vital step. The time for talk is over.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe one-two diplomatic punch from a hardline Trump administration apparently staggered China, who were used to the Obama administration\u2019s gentle approach to diplomacy.\u000a\u000aA jittery-looking Ambassador Liu Jieyi held a press conference Monday and did not mention North Korea in his remarks, except to list it at the bottom of a broad list of things the Security Council had to deal with. Only when pressed on the issue by the press did he respond.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have been urging DPRK and indeed other relevant countries not to exacerbate the situation in the Korean peninsula by avoiding language and action that heightens tension on the Korean peninsula because that runs counter to the objectives sought to be achieved through Security Council resolutions,\u201d he said. He later noted that he was deliberately not mentioning specific countries, although it was not clear why.\u000a\u000aWhen Liu did finally mention the U.S., he chose not to attack the U.S. directly, but instead only reduced China\u2019s role in the conflict.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are two principal parties \u2026 the DPRK and the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile people talk about China a lot, if the two principal parties refuse to move towards what is required by Security Council resolutions, the de-escalation of tension, negotiation to achieve denuclearization and peace and stability, and also to resume dialogue then no matter how capable China is, China\u2019s efforts will not yield practical results.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut despite saying China was firmly against an \u201ceconomic blockade\u201d and arguing that only dialogue and negotiation could save the day, within days China crumbled under Trump\u2019s pressure.\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, in a unanimous vote, the Council passed a resolution hitting North Korea with fresh sanctions. China and Russia, both countries that could have vetoed the resolution, voted for it.\u000a\u000aAnd the resolution was no hodge-podge compromise either, like some resolutions that China and Russia signed off on during the Obama years. The bill places draconian limits on North Korea\u2019s exports of coal, lead, iron, lead ore, iron ore, and seafood. The resolution is estimated to wipe a third off the value of North Korea\u2019s exports\u2014at the tune of $1 billion a year.\u000a\u000aThe question of to what extent the resolution will be enforced remains unanswered. Haley was not exaggerating when she called it \u201cthe single largest economic sanctions package\u201d ever leveled against the regime, while U.K. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft called the package \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump is justified in his annoyance at the media coverage the resolution has received. While even the New York Times conceded it was a \u201cmajor victory\u201d for the U.S., the win hasn\u2019t received the kind of fanfare even the mildest of Obama\u2019s diplomatic successes were met with by the media:\u000a\u000aThe Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea! \u2014 Donald J.

Another 3.7 percent of Guatemalans entered the U.S. in order to reunite with family members.\u000a\u000aA tiny 0.1 percent said they came to the U.S. to open a businesses, confirming immigration hawks\u2019 shared skepticism that the current immigration system does not give preference to high-skilled or business-oriented newcomers.\u000a\u000aThe study apparently debunks longtime claims by the mainstream media, politicians, and open borders lobby that mass immigration from Central America to the U.S. is necessary because most migrants are fleeing gang violence.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, the New York Times extensively claimed that mass\u2013legal and illegal\u2013immigration to the U.S. from countries like Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador was largely due to gangs and violence.\u000a\u000aAn official with the United Nations at the time even proclaimed \u201cIt\u2019s really a refugee crisis,\u201d when referring to the migration, not mentioning how the primary reason for migrants coming to the U.S. through the southern border is for economic motive.\u000a\u000aJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

aVInterior Minister Morgan Johansson has ruled out the possibility of stripping Islamic State fighters of their Swedish citizenship, saying the government refuses to make anyone stateless.\u000a\u000aInterior Minister Johansson made the comments after a statement in late July by the Chief of the Police in Greater Gothenburg Erik Nord who said the government should be able to strip Islamic State fighters of their Swedish citizenship.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can not make people stateless,\u201d Johansson said, adding: \u201cIf you have become a citizen in Sweden, that is governed by the legislation we have,\u201d Svenska Dagbladet reports.\u000a\u000aPolice chief Nord argued that Sweden should follow the British example in dealing with citizens who have gone to the Middle East to fight for Islamic State.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the terrorist attacks continue, my view is that Sweden and other Western European countries must take the same actions they are now practising in Britain,\u201d he told Göteborgs-Posten.\u000a\u000aUS Embassy: 'Avoid Crowded Places In Sweden' Amid ISIS Terror Threat https://t.co/qpNnIjdf5U pic.twitter.com/5WZizBSvks \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 28, 2016\u000a\u000a\u201cEngland has suffered from the Islamic terror several times this year, and therefore action is being taken,\u201d Nord said. So far, the UK government has stipped 40 Islamic radicals of their passports this year so far, most coming after the terror attack that occurred in London in March.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have had a terrorist attack this year, but much has changed since then. I do not think it will be long before we can remove citizenship as well as residence permits from people trying to break the liberal democracy we have here in Western Europe,\u201d Nord said.\u000a\u000aThe number of radical Islamists in Sweden has soared in recent years with the Swedish Security Service (SAPO) claiming there are at least 2,000 violent jihadists in the country. Less than a decade ago, the number amounted to only 200.\u000a\u000aNord said that Islamic State is not like previous terror groups like the IRA who could be negotiated with.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think we will still live with the threat of jihadism in the future. If the terrorist attacks continue to target us in Western Europe, more people will think about doing things like what England does. We can not have people here who propagate to overthrow democracy in a society that has been so generous and welcoming,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aSwedish security expert Magnus Ranstorp has also been critical of the government\u2019s response to radical Islamic terrorism saying that officials do not take the threat seriously enough. He has also slammed the government for lack of funding for police in migrant populated no go zones saying that the closure of the last police station in Järva is a \u201cdisaster\u201d.

aVMUKWONAGO, Wis. (AP) \u2014 With a dysfunctional Congress on recess, House Speaker Paul Ryan has turned his focus back home, touring flood-damaged areas and visiting local businesses in Wisconsin. But he can\u2019t escape the questions about why Republicans in charge of Washington aren\u2019t delivering.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAnd though he\u2019s won re-election easily for years, Ryan faces the prospect of challenges from left and right and an energized Democratic base in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a majority in the House and Senate and it feels like nothing\u2019s getting done,\u201d 32-year-old James Hulsey said just before Ryan recently toured his workplace.\u000a\u000aSensing the angst, Ryan has been much more visible in his southeast Wisconsin district as Republicans failed to deliver on their yearslong promise to scrap the health care law and new polling numbers show the speaker is less popular among Republicans in Wisconsin than President Donald Trump. Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point, but he carried Ryan\u2019s district by 10 points.\u000a\u000aIn the remaining months of the year, Ryan and the Republican-led Congress are determined to deliver major legislation, elusive so far due to GOP infighting, and the top priority is overhauling the nation\u2019s tax code. Failure to produce could cost Republicans their House majority in the 2018 midterms and, for Ryan, his job as speaker and Republican leader.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the third time in 100 years we\u2019ve had this alignment of government that we\u2019ve got to get it done or else I really worried our country will continue down a bad path,\u201d Ryan said after his tour of the wire manufacturer Banker Wire, in Mukwonago, Wisconsin.\u000a\u000aHe later told the Wisconsin State Journal, \u201cIf we don\u2019t do our job, we will depress turnout. I am frustrated as well.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublican Keith Ketzler, 62, worries that the GOP will pay politically next year. Democrats need to flip 24 seats to regain control.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody that voted Republican is getting very frustrated,\u201d Ketzler said, after prodding Ryan about why Congress hasn\u2019t achieved more. \u201cPeople crossed the line last time, but they\u2019re not going to stay crossed if they don\u2019t get things done.\u201d\u000a\u000aRyan angered some conservatives during the campaign with comments critical of then-candidate Trump. But in the first six months of Trump\u2019s term, Ryan has been far less critical of the president than other Republican lawmakers who have challenged a number of Trump moves, including his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator.\u000a\u000aRyan\u2019s Republican primary challenger last year, Paul Nehlen, initially won the backing of then-candidate Trump, who later switched to Ryan. Ryan beat Nehlen by 70 percentage points in the primary. But Nehlen, who is running again, thinks 2018 will be more difficult for Ryan, arguing that he hasn\u2019t done enough to appease Republican Trump supporters.\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Trump has given Paul Ryan way more opportunities to stand up and back him and what he has done is really undermine him,\u201d Nehlen said.\u000a\u000aBeating Ryan will not be easy.\u000a\u000aNo Democrat has represented the district since 1995. Ryan has cruised to re-election ever since he joined Congress in 1999 \u2014 winning by 35 percentage points last year. He has $11.5 million in the bank and is a familiar face in Janesville where he was born and raised and still lives with his wife and three children.\u000a\u000aDemocrats are pinning their hopes on Randy Bryce, an Army veteran and union iron worker with the nickname \u201cIron Stache.\u201d He appears to have walked out of Hollywood central casting \u2014 complete with a dark mustache, thick biceps, faded blue jeans and a promise to fight for the working man. Bryce is trying to capitalize on disenchantment over Ryan\u2019s role in the health care bill as he mounts a long-shot campaign.\u000a\u000aBryce generated excitement among Democrats both in Wisconsin and nationally for his announcement video in June that has now been viewed more than 550,000 times. It begins with a clip of Trump praising Ryan\u2019s attempts to undo Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and then shows Bryce getting emotional as his mother details her struggle with multiple sclerosis.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can come work the iron,\u201d the hardhat-wearing Bryce challenges Ryan, \u201cand I\u2019ll go to D.C.\u201d\u000a\u000aBryce raised $430,000 in the first two weeks after the spot ran.\u000a\u000aRyan has tried to shift the conversation from the collapse of the GOP health care effort and toward tax reform and the news that Taiwanese iPhone manufacturer Foxconn plans to invest $10 billion on a factory in his congressional district that could employ 13,000 people. Ryan launched a series of campaign-style online ads highlighting the news that the plant was coming near abandoned automobile factories in his hometown of Janesville and nearby Kenosha.\u000a\u000aBut Ryan\u2019s involvement doesn\u2019t seem to be resonating quite yet with voters in his district.\u000a\u000a\u201cPaul Ryan? I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s done for it,\u201d said Republican voter Jeff Lunde of Ryan\u2019s role in the Foxconn deal. \u201cThey\u2019re all working on this stupid health-care crap.\u201d\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sbauerAP

aVKayleigh McEnany, formerly of CNN and now the Republican National Committee\u2019s new spokeswoman, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily to stress the importance that Republicans unify behind President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u000a\u000aMarlow praised the RNC\u2019s choice by praising McEnany for her ability to communicate with \u201csuper brainiacs,\u201d thanks to her Harvard Law education, and also \u201cspeak to the regular public,\u201d which is \u201cincreasingly skeptical of the establishment media.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to communicate directly with the American people. You know what that means? It means going out and actually talking to the people,\u201d said McEnany.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve traveled the country for the better part of the first half of this year, and man, I\u2019ve got to tell you \u2013 I came across someone in Nevada who is a Democrat voter, who didn\u2019t vote on President Trump in the election, but he told me, \u2018The negative coverage that I see day in and day out, not giving this president a chance, not giving the choice of the American people a chance, has compelled me to actually give him a chance despite not voting for him,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s encouraging. When you go talk to the people, you hear a very different story than what you\u2019re hearing on the mainstream media,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aMcEnany said one of her most difficult challenges at CNN was \u201ctrying to break through the narrative that was being sown.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s the narrative being sown? Look at Media Research Center and their reporting. Three hundred fifty three minutes on Russia in five weeks in the mainstream media. Seventeen minutes on health care,\u201d she noted. \u201cSo you\u2019re sitting there, oftentimes outnumbered, most of the time \u2013 it\u2019s not all the time \u2013 and you just want to speak to the issues the American people care about. You just want to talk about the economy and Obamacare and Neil Gorsuch and just some of the things going on. Breaking through that narrative, the negativity being sown, I think was the hardest part.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, we had some success at times,\u201d she reflected. \u201cThat is the key, I think, to this presidency winning a second term is just getting out there, what President Trump\u2019s doing, what Republicans are doing. That was the most challenging part, I think, of it all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think a big part of my year-and-a-half at CNN was just wanting to give the CNN viewer the other side of the story \u2013 wanting to give them a perspective that, in earnest, they probably hadn\u2019t heard,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn terms of moving forward, I want to be a part of this fight,\u201d said McEnany. \u201cI want to look my future kids in the eye and say, \u2018You know what? I was a part of President Trump\u2019s successful way forward, and putting conservative populist policies forward, and successfully making this country a better place for the American people or the American workers first. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be able to look my kids in the eye one day if I didn\u2019t take this opportunity and say, \u2018Your mom was part of the fight.\u2019 That, to me, was my driving force.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere can I serve? I think I served the better part of the year at CNN, giving that alternative perspective, but it was time to move forward and join arms with my fellow Republicans, and Republican populists really, out there \u2013 the new wave of people who have been brought into this party by President Trump \u2013 and fight for these policies,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aMcEnany said the Republican Party\u2019s new populist spirit flows from understanding that President Trump\u2019s election means \u201cthe American people want to be heard.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I say \u2018conservative populism,\u2019 it\u2019s not some new conservatism,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cReally, it\u2019s just listening when the American people say, \u2018Hey, maybe right there, maybe we need to re-evaluate that, maybe to re-evaluate free trade. NAFTA didn\u2019t work so well. Maybe we need to look at TPP. This isn\u2019t a great idea, even though doctrinal conservatism previously might have suggested TPP was the way to go.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Trump listened to the American people. President Trump listened, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s just hearing them out,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen a policy definitively is not working, and it\u2019s careless to the American worker, then you make a change. That\u2019s what you recognized over at Breitbart very early on. That\u2019s what President Trump recognized, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s sitting in 1600 Pennsylvania. The Republican Party recognizes he\u2019s the leader of our party.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcEnany said her reception at the Republican National Committee has been \u201cvery welcoming.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was so heartening to see that this party, that the RNC, is staunchly behind this president,\u201d she enthused. \u201cThey realize that for our party to succeed, that means the president must succeed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re very open to Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d she reported. \u201cThey are the tailwind behind it. I\u2019ve had nothing but a very welcome embrace. It\u2019s very encouraging to see that the party apparatus is fully behind the president. In order to win in 2018, in order to win four years from now, we all have to stick together. What I\u2019ve found is, going into the RNC, we are together. What \u201ctogether\u201d means is standing behind this president full throttle.\u201d\u000a\u000aMarlow noted that as RNC spokeswoman, McEnany will be called upon to mediate public disputes with such anti-Trump Republicans as Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Ben Sasse (R-NE). He pointed out that some factions within the GOP are \u201cquite bitter and hostile towards the president.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a wealth of voices in the Republican Party,\u201d McEnany replied. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that. That\u2019s kind of one of the things that\u2019s the beauty of the Republican Party: we welcome everyone\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLook, we have to stand behind this president,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cLook at Obamacare. We made a promise to the American people. We have to come together. Especially, you know, you see Aetna has already announced they\u2019re going to drop out of the Obamacare exchanges in 2018. As this law crumbles, it means we have to come together.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI welcome alternative voices, but look, these Republicans and the senators who have stood against Obamacare, at least publicly but then in their votes did not, they\u2019ve got to come around,\u201d she argued. \u201cThis law is crumbling, and, to me, that\u2019s a microcosm of the diversity of viewpoints within the Republican Party, which we welcome, but that need to come together because, at the end of the day, when you make a promise, it must materialize into results and successes and better outcomes for the American people.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcEnany predicted that \u201cultimately, the election will be determined by having successes on behalf of the American people,\u201d and that can only happen if congressional Republicans and the White House work together.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster served at a UK-based think tank that is heavily bankrolled by multinational corporate firms doing billions of dollars in business in Iran.\u000a\u000aThe business deals are up for regulation by the U.S. government and the transactions are in direct jeopardy by the possibility of the Trump administration further sanctioning Iran or declaring Tehran in violation of the international nuclear accord.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe past affiliation may raise conflict-of-interest issues for McMaster, who is serving in a position of direct influence over U.S. policy with regard to Iran. Already, McMaster has been accused of purging the National Security Council of hardliners on Iran, and he is seen as a leading proponent of the Iran nuclear accord within the Trump administration. McMaster has reportedly urged the Trump administration to recertify Iran\u2019s compliance with the Iran nuclear deal.\u000a\u000aFrom September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow. The IISS describes itself as a \u201cworld-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aIISS has not returned repeated requests from Breitbart News seeking clarification about McMaster\u2019s work at the think tank, including any salary that he may have received. The organization also did not reply to an inquiry about its funding.\u000a\u000aWhile IISS says it produces \u201cobjective information\u201d on geopolitical developments, the think tank is funded by multinational firms doing major business deals with Iranian companies.\u000a\u000aHere is a list of some IISS corporate sponsors doing business with firms in Iran:\u000a\u000aAirbus (provided between $130,350 and $651,748 to IISS)\u000a\u000aIn June, two Iranian airlines made prospective deals with Europe-based Airbus \u2014 described as memorandums of understanding \u2014 to purchase 73 jetliners in deals reportedly worth as much as $2.5 billion. The deals are permissible because of the easing of sanctions under the Obama administration-brokered 2015 nuclear accord with Iran.\u000a\u000aThe New York Times reported that aspects of the Iranian firms\u2019 purchases of Airbus planes are subject to U.S. government regulation.\u000a\u000aThe Times reported:\u000a\u000aIran\u2019s Airtour Airline intends to buy 45 upgraded versions of the A320 jet, and Zagros Airlines intends to buy 20 upgraded A320s and eight upgraded A330s. \u2026The deals are permitted under the 2015 nuclear agreement Iran reached with six major powers, which relaxed sanctions in return for Iran\u2019s verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work. But the deals \u2014 even for the Airbuses \u2014 still must be licensed by the United States government because many components and technology in the aircraft are made in the United States and are subject to export control regulations.\u000a\u000aThe agreements with two Iranian companies to purchase 73 Airbus jets follows another purchase by IranAir of 180 Airbus jets that was downgraded to 100 jets last December at an estimated value of about $10 billion.\u000a\u000aBoeing Company (provided between $130,350 and $651,748 to IISS)\u000a\u000aAnother top IISS donor, Boeing Company, the world\u2019s largest aerospace company, inked a $3 billion contract last December to sell 30 737 Max jets to Aseman Airlines, a firm whose largest owner is the government-run Iran National Pension Fund.\u000a\u000aThat deal was made possible by the 2015 Iran nuclear accord.

Last month, Total SA and a Chinese oil firm signed a $5 billion agreement with Iran to develop a massive offshore natural gas field.\u000a\u000aIranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh singled out the energy agreement as \u201cone of the outcomes of the nuclear deal and recent presidential election,\u201d and he said the agreement would lead to \u201cmore than $5 billion in foreign investments.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe AP reported on the deal:\u000a\u000aIran on Monday signed a $5 billion agreement with France\u2019s Total SA and a Chinese oil company to develop its massive offshore natural gas field, the first such deal with foreign companies since the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Officials met in Tehran and signed the agreement, which will see the firms develop a portion of the massive South Pars offshore field that Iran shares with Qatar. Qatar calls the same area the North Field and it provides the small country, now in the middle of a diplomatic crisis with four other Arab states, its incredible wealth. Total has a 50.1-percent share in the new Iran deal. The state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. has 30-percent stake and Iran\u2019s Petropars has 19.9 percent.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a major agreement for Total, which officially marks our return to Iran to open a new page in the history of our partnership with the country,\u201d Total Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement. \u201cTotal will develop the project in strict compliance with applicable national and international laws.\u201d\u000a\u000aForeign Policy magazine reported that Total\u2019s approval of the $5 billion deal was heavily influenced by the Trump administration\u2019s decision in April to certify Iran as complying with the nuclear deal:\u000a\u000aBut several developments this spring apparently gave Total reason to suspect that Trump\u2019s bark might be worse than his bite. One was the administration\u2019s decision in April to certify to Congress that Iran remained in compliance with all its obligations under the JCPOA \u2014 despite repeated violations of some of the deal\u2019s key constraints regarding things like stocks of heavy water (begrudgingly, the Trump team issued its second report certifying Iran\u2019s JCPOA compliance Tuesday night). That was followed by the decision in late May, in response to another congressional deadline, to continue the Obama administration\u2019s policy of granting certain sanctions relief to Iran, as called for in the JCPOA.\u000a\u000aBP International Ltd (provided between $32,591 and $130,349 to IISS)\u000a\u000aLast year, BP International, another IISS donor, was granted a license by the U.S. Treasury Department to operate a joint gas field in the North Sea following the removal of European Union and United Nations sanctions on Iran.\u000a\u000aWhile BP earlier this year decided not to take part in first wave agreements to develop oil and gas reserves in Iran, the firm reportedly opened a representative office in Iran. And last November, BP created an executive committee to explore business in Iran. BP also purchased condensate from the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company last year following the sanctions removal.\u000a\u000aShell International Ltd. (provided between $32,591 and $130,349 to IISS)\u000a\u000aShell International Ltd., which donated to IISS, operates as a subsidiary of oil giant Royal Dutch Shell.\u000a\u000aReuters reported that while Shell has been cautious about Iranian oil buys, it has done some deals in Iran since the sanctions were relieved.\u000a\u000aThe news agency reported:\u000a\u000aShell said in its annual report it had bought only three cargoes of Iranian oil over the past year. These were a $45 million cargo in May, on which it made a profit of $1.1 million, followed by 2 cargoes in December costing $103 million and $106 million respectively. Those are still in transit so no profit or loss has been yet made on them, Shell said. During the course of 2016, Shell also repaid $1.942 billion in debts to Iran for oil purchases it made before stricter EU sanctions were imposed on Iran in 2012.\u000a\u000aThink Tank Backed by Soros-Funded Group that Helped Obama Sell Iran Nuclear Deal\u000a\u000aIISS\u2019s corporate donors are not the only controversial financing to the group where McMaster previously served. Breitbart News reported Sunday that another IISS donor is a George Soros-funded nonprofit identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.\u000a\u000aIISS\u2019s website contains a list of groups, corporations and government entities that provide funding to the think tank, including during the period of McMaster\u2019s work there. Curiously missing from the page of donors, however, is the controversial Ploughshares Fund, a grantmaking group identified last year by the Obama White House as central in helping to market the Iran nuclear deal to the news media.\u000a\u000aAn archived version of IISS\u2019s donors page lists Ploughshares as a donor.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News has found that IISS is listed as a grantee for Iran issues in Ploughshares Fund\u2019s budget report for 2016.\u000a\u000aThat report spotlights IISS as a grantee for Iran work done by Michael Elleman, IISS senior fellow for missile defense.\u000a\u000aIn a recent IISS analysis, Elleman cast doubt on charges that Iran and North Korea are working together on ballistic-missile development, claiming \u201cthere is little evidence to indicate the two regimes are engaged in deep missile-related collaboration, or pursuing joint-development programs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, is listed as a member of IISS in his Georgetown University bio.\u000a\u000aPloughshares Fund is financed by Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute.\u000a\u000aThe involvement of Ploughshares in selling the Iran agreement to the public was revealed in an extensive New York Times Magazine profile of Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, titled, \u201cThe Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru.\u201d The article contains interviews with Rhodes and scores of top Obama administration officials.\u000a\u000aRobert Malley, then a senior director at the National Security Council, expounded on the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal.\u000a\u000aMalley explained to the Times that \u201cexperts\u201d were utilized to create an \u201cecho chamber\u201d that disseminated administration claims about Iran to \u201chundreds of often-clueless reporters\u201d in the news media.\u000a\u000aTimes author David Samuels wrote:\u000a\u000aIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aRhodes told Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the \u201cabsence of rational discourse\u201d and utilized outside groups, including Ploughshares.\u000a\u000aWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents. Ploughshares says it has awarded hundreds of grants \u201cwhose aggregate value exceeded $60 million.\u201d\u000a\u000aA previous investigation by this reporter showed Ploughshares has partnered with a who\u2019s-who of the radical left, including Code Pink, the pro-Palestinian J Street, United for Peace & Justice, the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and Demos, a progressive economic advisory group where Obama\u2019s controversial former green jobs czar, Van Jones, has served on the board.\u000a\u000aThe group says its mission is to support the \u201csmartest minds and most effective organizations to reduce nuclear stockpiles, prevent new nuclear states, and increase global security.\u201d\u000a\u000aPloughshares is in turn financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute, the Buffett Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Foundation.\u000a\u000aAnother Ploughshares donor is the Tides Foundation, which is one of the largest funders of the radical left. Tides is funded by Soros.\u000a\u000aPloughshares has donated to the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls for massive slashes in the U.S. defense budget.\u000a\u000aIt has also financed the International Crisis Group, a small organization that boasts George Soros and his son, Alexander, on its board and where Malley now works as vice president for public policy.\u000a\u000aPloughshares, McMaster and John Kerry\u000a\u000aLast week, McMaster removed Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Trump aide and Iran deal opponent, from the National Security Council in what the Jerusalem Post reported was a possible \u201csweep of Iran hard-liners.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Post reported on two other McMaster purges of Iran hardliners:\u000a\u000aCohen-Watnick\u2019s removal comes after the revelation by The Atlantic on Wednesday of the dismissal of Rich Higgins, another Iran hawk who was the NSC\u2019s director of strategic planning. Higgins was sacked for circulating a memo in which he alleged that there was a \u201cMaoist\u201d insurgency within and without the government of \u201cglobalists and Islamists.\u201d Also gone is Derek Harvey, who held the Middle East portfolio at the NSC, and who also was an Iran hawk, and who may assume another role in the administration. McMaster tapped Michael Bell, a retired army colonel who has a conventional career portfolio, to replace Harvey.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a recent event held by Ploughshares Fund, former Secretary of State John Kerry implied that McMaster is the best bet at keeping the nuclear agreement alive, according to a Ploughshares Fund description of the June 5, 2017 event.\u000a\u000aMcMaster and IISS\u000a\u000aMcMaster is listed on IISS\u2019s website as serving as a former consulting senior fellow on the following issues: Military history; civil-military relations; development and security; and conflict and conflict prevention.\u000a\u000aIISS, meanwhile, has supported the Iran nuclear agreement and has defended Tehran against reports it has violated tenets of the deal.\u000a\u000aLast month, IISS featured a piece by Mark Fitzpatrick, chief of the think tank\u2019s non-proliferation and nuclear policy program, titled, \u201cThree strikes against claims that Iran is violating the nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IISS piece argued that \u201ccriticism of Iran\u2019s conduct in relation to the 2015 nuclear deal does not withstand scrutiny,\u201d and that the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement \u201cwould not convince other parties to re-impose sanctions, but could trigger a global crisis.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn June, the IISS\u2019s Fitzpatrick opined that \u201cCritics are wrong: Iran remains in compliance with nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn IISS strategic comment paper, titled, \u201cTrump\u2019s erratic Middle East policy,\u201d argued that Trump\u2019s confrontational approach toward Iran is \u201cunlikely to lend needed stability to the region.\u201d\u000a\u000aAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

aVWhilst the British media focused on the potential future of food imports from the U.S. after Brexit, a real food scandal has been developing in Europe in which Belgian and Dutch authorities failed to inform their neighbours about millions of pesticide-infected eggs being exported through the continent.\u000a\u000aAfter reports of the possibility that an early trade deal agreement with the U.S. could allow the importation of chlorine-washed chicken, the media rushed to herald the death of food safety standards as another Brexit bad news story \u2013 and yet more evidence that the cost of exiting Europe is too high for Brits to bear.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cChicken in the Coalmine\u201d, blared a headline in HuffPost UK, while the Mirror screamed: \u201cFirst Chlorine Chicken, Now HORMONE BEEF Could Be on the Menu after Brexit.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn article in the Irish Times sneered over \u2018Brexit-Flavoured Chlorination Chicken\u2019, and in the Metro, Oliver Wheaton moaned: \u201cWe Might Start Getting Chlorinated Chicken Thanks to (You Guessed It) Brexit,\u201d claiming that \u201cthe EU bans this practice on health grounds\u201d.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the European Food Safety Agency has passed chlorinated-washed chicken for safe consumption.\u000a\u000aBut who will protect us from these health risks outside the EU!? \U0001f60e \U0001f60e \U0001f60e https://t.co/AdsgO5Dd6N \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 6, 2017\u000a\u000aYet the Food Standards Agency\u2019s announcement on Monday that contaminated eggs imported from Europe have been distributed in Britain failed to elicit much concern from Remain-supporting media which implied only EU regulations can stop toxic food entering the UK\u2019s supply chain.\u000a\u000aMillions of Dutch eggs were declared unfit for consumption as they were found to contained large amounts of fipronil \u2014 an insecticide the World Health Organization (WHO) warns can have dangerous effects on people\u2019s kidney, liver, and thyroid gland function.\u000a\u000aBelgium\u2019s food safety agency admitted it has been aware of a potential problem with fipronil in the poultry sector since June, but kept the information secret, Euractiv reported.\u000a\u000aMillions of laying hens in the Netherlands may now have to be killed.\u000a\u000aIn May, a top doctor revealed that a potentially deadly disease that causes 60,000 people in Britain to fall ill each year could be traced to Europe.\u000a\u000aDr. Harry Dalton said the strain of Hepatitis E (HEV) \u2014 which causes a flu-like illness and can cause death in people with weakened immune systems \u2014 can be traced back to imported European pork products in 80 per cent of cases.\u000a\u000a'Brexit virus': an EU-plot to sabotage the great British breakfast https://t.co/0jxUwnPXcl \u2014 The Guardian (@guardian) May 22, 2017\u000a\u000aThe doctor, a gastroenterologist at Exeter University, told a conference on neurological infectious diseases that HEV had become a major threat.\u000a\u000a\u201cI call it the Brexit virus.

aVLawsuits by Chicago and California against President Donald Trump\u2019s sanctuary city executive order and Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 federal funding conditions are almost certain to end up at the Supreme Court within two years, raising profound constitutional questions about immigration, state sovereignty, and the rule of law.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump signed Executive Order 13768 on January 25, 2017, including Section 2(c), which codifies the policy of the federal government to \u201censure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAttorney General Sessions is faithfully carrying out the president\u2019s order, announcing that the U.S. Department of Justice will deny federal law enforcement grants from the Byrne JAG program to cities that defy federal immigration law by harboring illegal aliens or refusing to honor federal detainer requests to hand over for deportation illegal aliens within the city\u2019s jail system.\u000a\u000aChicago responded by filing a six-count lawsuit in federal court, represented by a massive team from global powerhouse law firm WilmerHale, spearheaded by some of the top lawyers from the Clinton and Obama administrations.\u000a\u000aThese top-tier Democratic lawyers argue a host of statutory and constitutional issues. These include arguing that no federal statute empowers the attorney general to withhold these funds, that the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers permits only Congress to impose conditions on eligibility for federal money, and that withholding these funds would exceed Congress\u2019 power under the Constitution\u2019s Spending Clause, coercing state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.\u000a\u000aThe 45-page civil complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, which tends to be a more liberal district court. It will then go up to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\u000a\u000aCalifornia has announced it will bring a lawsuit raising similar arguments, joined by over 300 cities and counties. After federal district court, that case will eventually go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\u000a\u000aThese cases may create a \u201ccircuit split\u201d of conflicting appellate decisions between the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, which, under these circumstances, would essentially guarantee that the Supreme Court would take the case. But even if the appeals courts all rule against the president and the attorney general, it is extremely unlikely that the High Court would refuse to grant the U.S. solicitor general\u2019s subsequent petition to review the cases and establish a uniform rule of law on these issues.\u000a\u000aThese two cases will likely go up on appeal for decisions in 2018, possibly leading to a historic Supreme Court decision in 2019.\u000a\u000aAdditional, less prominent lawsuits have been filed elsewhere in the country against the executive order or the new Justice Department policy, and still more suits are possible.\u000a\u000aThe case already filed and docketed is City of Chicago v.

aVOn August 7, the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) issued its first ever travel advisory warning American gun owners not to go to California unless they are willing to enter the state disarmed or risk going to jail.\u000a\u000aThe gun rights group is \u201cwarning law-abiding armed citizens that their civil rights could be in jeopardy due to that state\u2019s restrictive gun control laws.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aSAF founder and executive vice president Alan Gottlieb observed:\u000a\u000aThe California Legislature has been out of control for years when it comes to placing restrictions on the Second Amendment rights of honest citizens. Right now, I wouldn\u2019t suggest to any gun owner that they even travel through the state, much less to it as their final destination. Lawmakers in Sacramento either ignored or have forgotten that in 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court incorporated the Second Amendment to the states via the 14th Amendment in SAF\u2019s landmark case of McDonald v. City of Chicago. The Second Amendment\u2019s protection of the right to keep and bear arms applies to state and local governments, but they seem rather oblivious to that fact in the halls of California\u2019s Legislature.\u000a\u000aHe added:\u000a\u000aIf you are licensed to carry in your home state, that license is not recognized in California. It doesn\u2019t matter how many background checks you\u2019ve gone through or whether you took a gun safety course. Your license is no good in the Golden State, which suggests that your safety and the safety of your family are of no concern to state lawmakers or city administrators. You could be prosecuted for having a gun for personal protection, or you might get killed because you didn\u2019t.\u000a\u000aGottlieb is spot on. California refuses to recognize any concealed carry permit other the one they issue. This is an expression of Democratic hegemony whereby they have made concealed carry licenses extremely difficult for Californians to acquire \u2014 fewer than 100,000 Californians have a license \u2014 and they do not want to provide a means for additional law-abiding citizens to be armed via reciprocity.\u000a\u000aWhat does this mean? It means that when a visitor from another state drives into California, he is not supposed to be armed, regardless of the number of out-of-state concealed permits he possesses or the risks associated with being defenseless. None of these things matter because the Democrats have spoken.\u000a\u000aGottlieb\u2019s verdict: \u201cBy not going to California, the life you save may be your own.\u201d\u000a\u000aAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

aVSilicon Valley\u2019s tech elites are spoiling for a fight against a legal immigration overhaul backed by President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aLast week, President Donald Trump endorsed a pro-American immigration plan by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) called the RAISE Act, which would cut legal immigration from current levels from more than one million a year to 500,000.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTech elites, who benefit from the continued mass immigration of low-skilled, low-wage foreign nationals, are railing against the RAISE Act, claiming that any cuts to legal immigration to help Americans will hurt giant tech corporations.\u000a\u000aFormer Twitter CEO Dick Costolo told CNBC that the immigration overhaul would \u201cmake it harder\u201d for Silicon Valley elites to find qualified candidates to take U.S. jobs.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe go through ridiculous interview processes to try to find precisely the right people,\u201d Costolo said. \u201cThey take a long time. We talk to tons of candidates, generally speaking, to find the one or two we want.\u201d\u000a\u000aCostolo complained that there are not enough high-skilled Americans to take engineering jobs, therefore they must be imported.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe competition for engineers in Silicon Valley and around the world right now is extraordinary,\u201d Costolo continued. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough of them, everybody\u2019s fighting for them, we all want more. And the notion that someone else will be ahead of us in line, screening those people, and not letting us screen who we want to come work for us, is just going to make it harder for us to compete. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the same time, open borders activist and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pro-immigration lobbying group, FWD.us, has come out against the RAISE Act, claiming that by lowering the number of low-skilled immigrants coming to the U.S. to compete with Americans for jobs would depress U.S. wages.\u000a\u000aFWD.us President Todd Schulte said in a statement:\u000a\u000aThis bill slashes overall legal immigration by 50% \u2013 the biggest reductions in a century \u2013 which would severely harm the economy and actually depress wages for Americans. In the past, President Trump has always been correct when he repeatedly said he does NOT want to cut legal immigration. Not only do immigrants help grow the economy overall, but immigrants drive up wages for the overwhelming majority of Americans, and significantly so in areas and industries with more immigrants, where wage growth has outpaced the country overall. We call on Congress to fix those parts of our broken immigration system that clearly need reform \u2013 but we should create a modern legal visa system for the 21st century, not enact the largest cuts to legal immigration in modern history.\u000a\u000aFWD.us is not only funded by Zuckberg, but also by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to lobby Congress to keep the flow of cheap, foreign labor coming to the U.S.\u000a\u000aThere are four pipelines to importing low-skilled foreign nationals. Those include immigrants who come to the U.S. legally; non-immigrants who come to the U.S. on any of the employment-based visa programs available; foreign nationals who are allowed to work legally on Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) \u2013 like those given amnesty through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and illegal aliens who enter the U.S. mostly through the southern border.\u000a\u000aAny disruption to these pipelines of low-skilled immigration has been opposed by not only the open borders lobby, but by Silicon Valley and big business interest.\u000a\u000aJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

aVMATAMOROS, Tamaulipas \u2014 Mexico\u2019s Gulf Cartel managed to build a training camp in this border city with guard towers, walls, drill areas, and a garage for outfitting vehicles with armor plating.\u000a\u000aThe camp was discovered by the Mexican Army during an enforcement operation in the rural areas southwest of Matamoros. Military personnel received anonymous information about a cartel camp and carried out a series of efforts to locate the training facility, information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Mexican Army revealed. Matamoros is a border city immediately south of Brownsville, Texas.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aCartel forces in Matamoros set up a series of blockades throughout the city to keep soldiers from reaching the camp. By the time that the Mexican army reached the walled facility, cartel gunmen managed to flee leaving behind weapons, tactical gear, armored vehicles, and other items.\u000a\u000aThe compound was surrounded by a wall and had a concrete guard tower used by lookouts to warn about any approaching rival forces. Inside, authorities found multiple structures including garages, workshops, and target ranges.\u000a\u000aInside the garages, authorities found more than a dozen vehicles including white SUVs outfitted with makeshift armor. The troops also found some SUVs that were being cloned to look like police and military vehicles typically to fool authorities.\u000a\u000aDuring a search six tactical rifles, a belt-fed machine gun, 15 helmets, 86 ammunition magazines, several tactical vests, and various other items were found. Authorities also discovered a makeshift target range.\u000a\u000aEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

The religion [of Islam] is the religion where Islam and politics is one! \u2026 Islam and government are twins \u2014 that means inseparable!\u201d\u000a\u000aZafar Bangash\u000a\u000aZafar Bangash, also born in Pakistan, is an imam based in Toronto, Canada.\u000a\u000aHe co-founded the Muslim Institute in London, England, and serves as Director of the Institute of Contemporary Islamic Thought (ICIT) \u2014 which describes itself as a hub for \u201cactivists, journalists and academics in all parts of the world who share a common commitment to developing the social and political ideas of the Islamic movement, and promoting them as an alternative worldview to that of Western civilisation\u201d.\u000a\u000aLike U.S.-based Syed Abbas Ayleya, Bangash is a fierce partisan for the Iranian regime, and has urged Muslims to emulate Ayatollah Khomeini and \u201cstrive to overthrow the oppressive systems in their societies through Islamic revolutions, and not by participating in fraudulent elections\u201d, according to reports in the Toronto Star.\u000a\u000aDescribed as the \u201cunofficial spokesperson for the Iranian regime in Canada\u201d by detractors, the imam has denounced the United States in a Crescent International article, writing that Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s description of the country as \u201cShaytan-e Buzurg (the Great Satan) \u2026 was not an emotional outburst but an accurate understanding of the true nature of the U.S.\u201d\u000a\u000aBangash also told Iranian state radio to remember that Ramadan is a month for jihad as well as fasting in an interview in 2010, citing Qu\u2019ranic battles and asking Muslims to observe Al Quds Day events \u2014 at which, like Dawud Walid and Syed Abbas Ayleya, he is a frequent speaker.\u000a\u000aSyed Asad Jafri\u000a\u000aSyed Asad Jafri was born in Canada and remains based there, but received a technical education in the United States and a religious education at an Islamic seminary in Qom, Iran.\u000a\u000aLike his rest of the quartet, Jafri is a regular at Al Quds Day demonstrations, telling attendees at a Toronto rally that Israel is led by a \u201cZionist regime that sucks the resources, the blood, and everything that belongs to the people all across the world [to use] for themselves\u201d in 2011.\u000a\u000aLecturing at the Saba Islamic Center in San Jose, California, Jafri branded women in same-sex relationships and women who decline to wear the hijab willfully as leading a \u201cdisgusting lifestyle\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe Muslim Vibe has not yet responded to a series of questions from Breitbart London.\u000a\u000aYou can pre-order No Go Zones: How Sharia Law is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You on Amazon.

aVWhy do men assign themselves starring roles in battles they never even witnessed? Because the rewards for such tall tales remain high and the consequences minimal.\u000a\u000aTake Senator Richard Blumenthal, whose prestigious prefix arriving after The New York Times exposed him for making false boasts about serving in Vietnam affirms this truth about liars. His mendacity not only did not preclude him from winning a seat in the United States Senate, it now works as a boomerang against anyone who dares criticize Blumenthal for lying to veterans about his own service. Brian Dennehy lost no roles over propagating a false war record and Brian Williams reads the news on MSNBC despite inventing a story of his helicopter grounded by enemy fire while covering the Iraq war. We incentivize their sin.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aDonald Trump calls out the Connecticut Democrat for inventing nonexistent service in Vietnam this week in response to the senator criticizing the president over Russia. It may be a bit of a non sequitur on the president\u2019s part but anyone following his modus operandi knows by now that Trump always counterpunches by bringing up his critic\u2019s most embarrassing moments, however dated or irrelevant.\u000a\u000a\u201cNever in U.S. history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe told stories about his Vietnam battles and conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?\u201d\u000a\u000aA cheapshot? Maybe. Untrue? No.\u000a\u000aThe senator calls the criticism \u201cslurs.\u201d The media appears to agree.\u000a\u000aThe Los Angeles Times attacked the president in a headline: \u201cPresident Trump, Who Got 5 Draft Deferments, Again Attacks Sen. Blumenthal\u2019s Military Record.\u201d The Boston Globe op-ed writer Joan Vennochi\u2019s headline similarly blared, \u201cFor Someone Who Never Served, Trump Sure Loves to Criticize Those Who Have.\u201d\u000a\u000aBlumenthal, like Trump, received at least five deferments. He served as a Marine reservist from 1970 to 1976 but never went to Vietnam, which, of course, puts no shame in his game if not for the fact that, when he became a politician, he repeatedly insinuated or outright claimed Vietnam veteran status.\u000a\u000aVeterans don\u2019t despise civilians who never served. They loathe men who lied that they did.\u000a\u000aBut exposed stolen valor cases do not become pariahs to the public as they do to veterans. I learned this earlier this year when writing about another Connecticut Marine, historian William Manchester, who, in addition to writing the bestselling nonfiction book of 1967 in The Death of a President, penned a fictitious war memoir called Goodbye, Darkness in which he pawned off fibs as fact.\u000a\u000aAlong with R. Emmett Tyrrell of the American Spectator, I examined Manchester\u2019s wartime letters to his mom housed at the University of Massachusetts, his papers kept at Wesleyan University, and his 199-page war record obtained from the United States Marine Corps. They clashed with his claims made over several decades, particularly ones in his 1980 memoir Goodbye, Darkness.\u000a\u000aUnlike Blumenthal, Manchester did serve in combat (in Okinawa). But he attributed acts of heroism to himself that he never performed and diagnosed himself with war wounds that he never suffered. Manchester did endure a serious shrapnel wound in World War II. But he never got shot in the knee, the head, or the heart as he claimed later in life. He did not win a Navy Cross or a Silver Star or a second Purple Heart as he claimed (Manchester\u2019s papers donated by the popular historian to Wesleyan University contain at least two forged Marine citations). He did not fireman-carry a man off the battlefield after getting shot himself, did not commandeer a machine gun to repel a Japanese advance up an Okinawa hill, and did not flee a field hospital after getting shot to courageously rejoin his unit only to get wounded again. But he did win a $350,000 advance for Goodbye, Darkness and hit #5 on the New York Times bestseller list during Christmas week in 1980.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not quite parlaying a lie into a seat in the U.S. senate. But it\u2019s a pretty big payoff for a very low move. One suspects, though, more complex reasons found in a deeper, darker place in the psyche than the simple explanation of tall tales told for power or profit.\u000a\u000aThe media reaction to outlining the contradictions in Manchester\u2019s claims vis-a-vis Manchester\u2019s record came as quite different to what greets Trump. Listen to the crickets at The Los Angeles Times and The Boston Globe. They and other media outlets who spilt much ink on Manchester during his life kept paper dry when news came that he made up so much that his readers believed true about him. They once acted as stenographers repeating the false boasts of William Manchester (read the Times and Globe obits linked above). Now they blast Trump for daring to speak a truth about a man who told a lie. The indecency occurs to them as not when one shouts a fantastic falsehood but when one rebuts it with an unpleasant truth.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam,\u201d Blumenthal told a group of veterans in 2008. Unfortunately, the more we learn about stolen-valor cases, the more we understand why so many make fake boasts. The same newspapers that reprint without question the lies of phony war heroes whitewash revelations of hogwash and bash those who lay bare braggarts.\u000a\u000aStolen valor pays.

aVAs municipalities in deep-blue Maryland continue to grant legal and illegal aliens access to the ballot box, one leftist is pushing for a larger movement to combat the \u201cmass disenfranchisement\u201d of non-U.S. citizens in the Trump era.\u000a\u000aCollege Park, Maryland, home to the main campus for the University of Maryland and roughly 20,000 residents overall, is currently reviewing a policy that would open regular ballot access to illegal aliens for municipal elections. While the town would be the largest to do so in the Mid-Atlantic, it would not be the first. The Baltimore Sun reports that College Park would be the eleventh city between Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties; both sharing boundaries with Washington, D.C.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe legality of such proposals and policies are not under question in Maryland, which is why the illegal alien voting rights movement sees consistent success. State law has allowed for townships to determine voter eligibility for municipal elections going back to the mid-1800s. The local paper notes that Barnesville in Montgomery County maintains the longest-running rule, dating back to 1918. The trend began picking up steam in the 1970s with larger jurisdictions joining in thereafter.\u000a\u000aThe Sun also adds that a certain foreign influence in elections has come into play: \u201csupport for noncitizen voting here has also been driven by the large numbers of diplomatic staff who work in Washington and live in the Maryland suburbs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJustifications for illegal alien voting rights tend to follow similar tracks in local and national debates. Perhaps the most common argument is the \u201cwe\u2019ve allowed them to vote before\u201d angle. While the United States has experimented with franchise eligibility over the ages, current federal law prohibits any non-U.S. citizen from participating in an election, much less registering to vote. Felony convictions, deportation, and barriers to naturalization are all intended deterrents\u2014despite the fact that no requirement rests on voter registrars to verify claims of citizenship during the process.\u000a\u000aOther liberal states show serious conversations on illegal alien voting increase recently. One activist in California is now dialing up the rhetoric well beyond historic claims and appeals to broadening \u201cdemocracy\u201d, favoring political overtones.\u000a\u000aJoe Matthews writes in the Sacramento Bee that it\u2019s time to \u201cgo on offense\u201d against President Donald Trump\u2019s larger concerns for election integrity by empowering noncitizens to vote.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven Trump\u2019s threats to both immigrants and democracy, this is the moment to give the franchise back to noncitizens,\u201d Matthews argues. He also compares California to an \u201capartheid\u201d state until it grants voting rights to all present:\u000a\u000aCalifornia is home to about five million adults (that\u2019s one-in-six adults) who can\u2019t vote because they\u2019re not citizens. This mass disenfranchisement is an affront to American principles. Taxation without representation? Noncitizens pay taxes, but are not represented. Consent of the governed? Noncitizens must follow our laws \u2013 but can\u2019t vote to consent. Home of the brave? Noncitizens serve in the military but can\u2019t vote for the government that sends them to war. We Californians tolerate this apartheid, even though the lesser status of noncitizens \u2013 especially the 2 million-plus undocumented Californians \u2013 makes them more vulnerable to abuse and removal from the country they\u2019ve helped build. To its credit, California has taken steps on behalf of noncitizens, who now enjoy in-state tuition to our public universities, driver\u2019s licenses, the ability to practice the law, and \u2013 if they are children \u2013 state-funded health care.\u000a\u000aRather than admitting that the referenced actions are pathways to naturalization, the activist contends that \u201cCalifornians won\u2019t be equal\u201d until all have ballots, only further blurring the distinctions between citizen and not. The column laments the fact, however, that Governor Jerry Brown (D) serves as a major impediment to statewide change, given his record of opposing such matters.\u000a\u000aWhile Maryland and select portions of New York, California, and Illinois struggle with granting voting rights to illegal aliens, Virginia was recently reported to be identifying and removing non-U.S. citizens from voter rolls at an alarming rate. The Public Interest Legal Foundation found more than 5,500 voters were canceled by the Commonwealth over citizenship concerns in May, Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aLocal clerks in Maryland report that steps are taken to keep illegal aliens from voting in races they are not eligible for, should elections be held on the same day. Takoma Park told the Baltimore paper that separate registration lists are kept to prevent ballot confusion.\u000a\u000aThe College Park City Council is slated to debate the measure on Tuesday, August 8.\u000a\u000aLogan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

aVMany in the NFL have begun to rally behind out of work San Francisco 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick, while decrying team owners as \u201ccowards,\u201d or \u201cracists,\u201d for not signing the anthem-protesting quarterback. However, some sources are now saying that Kaepernick actually turned down a team\u2019s offer in order to incite a racially driven media backlash that would yield the controversial quarterback more money.\u000a\u000aA source to the Daily Caller, \u201cclaims Kaep himself has turned down at least one contract in the hopes of stirring up a media frenzy that eventually leads to a more lucrative deal for the 27-year-old vet.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cKaepernick allegedly doesn\u2019t want to make \u201cbackup money\u201d and specifically instructed his representative team not to sign one contract offered at the league\u2019s minimum rate of $900,000 per year for a seventh-year player.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Daily Caller\u2019s source also claims that the controversial player fired the sports agency which has represented him since he came in the league. In their place, Kaepernick seems to be taking advice from his outspoken girlfriend, Nessa Diab.\u000a\u000aDiab recently sparked criticism herself when she posted a photo to Twitter that seemed to attack the owner of the only team currently considering Kaepernick. The photo compared Baltimore Ravens Owner Steve Bisciotti to the racist character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in Django Unchained. The photo also compared Raven legend Ray Lewis to the house slave character portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, in the same film.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Daily Caller\u2019s NFL source, this whole situation has gone to Kaepernick\u2019s head.\u000a\u000a\u201cColin thinks he\u2019s fighting a much higher battle than he is,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe views himself as a race messiah.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome race activists are hoping to use Colin Kaepernick\u2019s unemployment as a tool to raise more racism claims. For instance, activist Dr. Harry Edwards, who has consulted with Kaepernick, threatened that if Kaepernick didn\u2019t end up on a team this year, there would be trouble.\u000a\u000aIn an interview on Sirius XM, Edwards said, \u201c\u2026I fully expect one [team to sign him], because it\u2019s in the best interest of the league to have him on a team.\u201d But Edwards went on to warn that if Kaepernick did not get hired, the NFL would have a problem on its hands.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t just up and write off black protests as if this were 1950,\u201d Edwards said.\u000a\u000aBut if the sources are correct that Kaepernick has turned down at least one offer to use his status as a race protester to bargain for more money, that would certainly call into question the integrity of his protest. Making him less the put upon and aggrieved black NFL player standing up for racial justice, and more of a calculating and arrogant agitator using his status for personal gain.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.

aVAugust 7 marks President Donald Trump\u2019s second 100 days in office. They were just as intense as the first 100, if not more so.\u000a\u000aAnd while there were some disappointments, such as the Republican Senate\u2019s failure to repeal and replace Obamacare; and some challenges, such as the expanding Russia investigation; Trump also scored a variety of big achievements, from economics to special elections to foreign policy.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHere are 15 highlights (and lowlights):\u000a\u000aJobs. Trump enjoyed better-than-expected jobs reports from April through July, at the same time that the stock market set new record highs. Though he did not make much progress toward a major infrastructure program, he secured new foreign investment in Rust Belt states and continued to roll back regulations, raising prospects for rapid economic growth. The prospect of tax reform \u2014 albeit delayed \u2014 also contributed to buoyant expectations.\u000a\u000aBudget. Congress made little progress on budget reform, as Republicans continued to cave to Democrat threats and objections. The White House claimed it had won concessions from Democrats on defense spending, but the overall budget remained bloated, thanks in part to Republican fears of being punished by the media for any failure to reach a deal. Trump called for a \u201cgood \u2018shutdown'\u201d in September, when the next federal budget agreement would be due.\u000a\u000aHealth Care. The U.S. House passed the American Health Care Act to repeal and replace Obamacare. But the GOP-controlled Senate would not pass similar legislation, nor would it offer a straightforward repeal of Obamacare, or even part of Obamacare, thanks to the defection of three GOP moderates, including John McCain (R-AZ). Trump continued to press the GOP to honor its promises to the American electorate, though the prospects are dim for now.\u000a\u000aParis Climate Accords Pullout. In perhaps the boldest move of his young presidency, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the global climate agreement that had been a centerpiece of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy, second only to the Iran nuclear deal. Conservatives cheered Trump\u2019s decision, which was made over objections from inside the administration itself. Democrat-controlled cities and states pledged a symbolic commitment to the Paris deal.\u000a\u000aOverseas Trips. Trump made several overseas trips, two of particular importance: the first to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican; and the second to Poland, followed by the G-20 summit in Germany. Each trip included a major speech. In Riyadh, Trump demanded the Islamic world do more to stop terrorism; in Warsaw, he mounted a stirring defense of western civilization. He also visited the Western Wall, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.\u000a\u000aMelania Trump. The First Lady fulfilled her pledge to move to Washington following the end of the school year for Trump\u2019s youngest son, Barron. She made a splash as she accompanied the president on his overseas trips, with stylish yet culturally relevant outfits in the Middle East, and elegant yet modest attire at the Vatican. She also began to carry out diplomatic duties on these visits, visiting hospitals and other charitable projects, as she fit into the role.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea. Kim Jong-un continued to ratchet up his provocations, eventually testing several inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) theoretical capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Trump\u2019s previous diplomatic efforts to urge China to take action against its rogue client state seemed to have gone nowhere, until the UN Security Council passed unanimous new sanctions against the North Korean regime, denting one-third of the country\u2019s exports.\u000a\u000aTerror. As Trump continued to accelerate the campaign against the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East, there were several terror attacks in Europe linked to the group. At home, domestic terror struck at a Republican baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia on June 14, as a left-wing gunman wounded five, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), before being shot by Capitol police on the scene and Alexandria officers who arrived later.\u000a\u000aImmigration. Enforcement brought illegal border crossings down by roughly two-thirds from the year before. The Supreme Court lifted an injunction against Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel from six terror-prone countries \u2014 a major victory. The House passed \u201cKate\u2019s Law\u201d to crack down on criminal illegal aliens, and the administration threatened \u201csanctuary cities\u201d with cuts to federal law enforcement grants. But the border \u201cwall\u201d was still delayed.\u000a\u000aComey and Russia. Trump\u2019s sudden decision to fire FBI director James Comey triggered a serious escalation of the Russia probe, including the appointment of a Special Counsel, Robert Mueller. No evidence of collusion surfaced, but Donald Trump, Jr. was found to have met with a Russian lawyer who he hoped would have opposition research on Hillary Clinton. Mueller\u2019s investigation began to expand beyond the election to the Trump business empire.\u000a\u000aVoter Fraud. Trump launched his voter fraud commission, officially the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. Many states refused to cooperate with its requests for data to investigate the accuracy of voter rolls. The left continued to attack the commission as a political attempt at voter suppression, but Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the vice chairman of the commission, vowed to press ahead with his investigations.\u000a\u000aTransgender Ban. Trump announced on Twitter on July 26: \u201cAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\u201d The decision was cheered by social conservatives, and jeered by the LGBT community, amidst some opposition within the military, and confusion about how to implement the order.\u000a\u000aStaff Shakeup. Feuds within the White House continued among rival factions, amidst a torrent of media leaks. Trump openly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Twitter. He brought businessman Anthony Scaramucci on as communications director, prompting Press Secretary Sean Spicer to resign. Ten days later, \u201cThe Mooch\u201d was out. So, too, was Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who was replaced by Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly.\u000a\u000aMeme Wars. Hollywood\u2019s assault on Trump continued, with the L.A. gay pride parade officially devoted to the \u201cResistance.\u201d Comedian Kathy Griffin went too far even for some on the left when she posed for photos holding aloft a decapitated Trump head. Trump shocked the media by re-tweeting an edited World Wrestling Entertainment video that featured the CNN logo on the head of WWE CEO Vince McMahon as Trump beat him to the ground.\u000a\u000aSpecial Elections. Trump continued to shut Democrats out in special elections, which the media expected them to win on a supposed wave of anti-Trump sentiment. In Montana, Republican Greg Gianforte won even after being arrested for assaulting a Guardian reporter, and in Georgia, Karen Handel won the most expensive congressional race in history after her Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, had looked like a heavy favorite just days before.\u000a\u000aJoel B.

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster is listed as being a member for eleven years, this week added George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and another Soros-financed group to the list of donors on its website in response to a Breitbart News request on the matter.\u000a\u000aFrom September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow. The IISS describes itself as a \u201cworld-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aA page on the IISS website titled \u201cOur Funding\u201d lists groups, corporations, and government entities that provide funding to the think tank, including during the period of McMaster\u2019s work there.\u000a\u000aFrom at least last week, when Breitbart News started an investigation of the organization, the active donor page on IISS\u2019s website did not mention the Open Society Foundation among the list of contributors, even though an archived version of the IISS funders\u2019 page listed the Open Society Foundations. And IISS has been listed on the Open Society\u2019s website as a grantee of the Global Drug Policy Program of the Open Society Foundations.\u000a\u000aAlso missing from the website from at least last week was any mention of the controversial, Soros-funded Ploughshares Fund as a donor, even though Ploughshares\u2019 own financial reports listed a donation to IISS. Like the Open Society Foundations, Ploughshares was listed on the archived version of IISS\u2019s donor page.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, Breitbart News sent IISS an email inquiry about the discrepancies regarding the removal of the Open Society Foundations and Ploughshares Fund from its website. IISS did not reply to the request for comment at the time.\u000a\u000aOn late Sunday night, Breitbart News released a story by this reporter documenting Ploughshares Fund\u2019s financing of IISS.\u000a\u000aAs of Tuesday, the Open Society Foundations was again added to the website\u2019s list of donors, and the Ploughshares Fund was added, as well. The website now relates that Open Society provided between £100,000 to £499,999 ($130078.50 to $650,436.20). Ploughshares is now listed as a donor that provided between £25,000 to £99,999 ($32,510 and $130038).\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, Breitbart News sent a request for comment about the additions to the website and received the following reply:\u000a\u000aAs well as the Open Society Foundation, we also accidentally removed the Carnegie, McArthur, and James Foundations, as well as a number of governments and corporate supporters, when we updated the page ten days ago. Your question brought this to our attention and the listing has now been corrected.\u000a\u000aThink Tank Backed by Soros-Funded Group That Helped Obama Sell Iran Nuclear Deal\u000a\u000aBreitbart News reported Sunday that a major IISS donor is the Soros-funded Ploughshares Fund, identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News has found that IISS is listed as a grantee for Iran issues in Ploughshares Fund\u2019s budget report for 2016.\u000a\u000aThat report spotlights IISS as a grantee for Iran work done by Michael Elleman, IISS senior fellow for missile defense.\u000a\u000aIn a recent IISS analysis, Elleman cast doubt on charges that Iran and North Korea are working together on ballistic-missile development, claiming \u201cthere is little evidence to indicate the two regimes are engaged in deep missile-related collaboration, or pursuing joint-development programs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, is listed as a member of IISS in his Georgetown University bio.\u000a\u000aPloughshares Fund is financed by Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute.\u000a\u000aThe involvement of Ploughshares in selling the Iran agreement to the public was revealed in an extensive New York Times Magazine profile of Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, titled, \u201cThe Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru.\u201d The article contains interviews with Rhodes and scores of top Obama administration officials.\u000a\u000aRobert Malley, then a senior director at the National Security Council, expounded on the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal.\u000a\u000aMalley explained to the Times that \u201cexperts\u201d were utilized to create an \u201cecho chamber\u201d that disseminated administration claims about Iran to \u201chundreds of often-clueless reporters\u201d in the news media.\u000a\u000aTimes author David Samuels wrote:\u000a\u000aIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aRhodes told Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the \u201cabsence of rational discourse\u201d and utilized outside groups, including Ploughshares.\u000a\u000aWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents. Ploughshares says it has awarded hundreds of grants \u201cwhose aggregate value exceeded $60 million.\u201d\u000a\u000aA previous investigation by this reporter showed Ploughshares has partnered with a who\u2019s-who of the radical left, including Code Pink, the pro-Palestinian J Street, United for Peace & Justice, the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and Demos, a progressive economic advisory group where Obama\u2019s controversial former green jobs czar, Van Jones, has served on the board.\u000a\u000aThe group says its mission is to support the \u201csmartest minds and most effective organizations to reduce nuclear stockpiles, prevent new nuclear states, and increase global security.\u201d\u000a\u000aPloughshares is in turn financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute, the Buffett Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Foundation.\u000a\u000aAnother Ploughshares donor is the Tides Foundation, which is one of the largest funders of the radical left. Tides is funded by Soros.\u000a\u000aPloughshares has donated to the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls for massive slashes in the U.S. defense budget.\u000a\u000aIt has also financed the International Crisis Group, a small organization that boasts George Soros and his son, Alexander, on its board and where Malley now works as vice president for public policy.\u000a\u000aPloughshares, McMaster and John Kerry\u000a\u000aLast week, McMaster removed Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Trump aide and Iran deal opponent, from the National Security Council in what the Jerusalem Post reported was a possible \u201csweep of Iran hard-liners.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Post reported on two other McMaster purges of Iran hardliners:\u000a\u000aCohen-Watnick\u2019s removal comes after the revelation by The Atlantic on Wednesday of the dismissal of Rich Higgins, another Iran hawk who was the NSC\u2019s director of strategic planning. Higgins was sacked for circulating a memo in which he alleged that there was a \u201cMaoist\u201d insurgency within and without the government of \u201cglobalists and Islamists.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso gone is Derek Harvey, who held the Middle East portfolio at the NSC, and who also was an Iran hawk, and who may assume another role in the administration. McMaster tapped Michael Bell, a retired army colonel who has a conventional career portfolio, to replace Harvey.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a recent event held by Ploughshares Fund, former Secretary of State John Kerry implied that McMaster is the best bet at keeping the nuclear agreement alive, according to a Ploughshares Fund description of the June 5, 2017 event.\u000a\u000aMcMaster and IISS\u000a\u000aMcMaster is listed on IISS\u2019s website as serving as a former consulting senior fellow on the following issues: Military history; civil-military relations; development and security; and conflict and conflict prevention.\u000a\u000aIISS, meanwhile, has supported the Iran nuclear agreement and has defended Tehran against reports it has violated tenets of the deal.\u000a\u000aLast month, IISS featured a piece by Mark Fitzpatrick, chief of the think tank\u2019s non-proliferation and nuclear policy program, titled, \u201cThree strikes against claims that Iran is violating the nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IISS piece argued that \u201ccriticism of Iran\u2019s conduct in relation to the 2015 nuclear deal does not withstand scrutiny,\u201d and that the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement \u201cwould not convince other parties to re-impose sanctions, but could trigger a global crisis.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn June, the IISS\u2019s Fitzpatrick opined that \u201cCritics are wrong: Iran remains in compliance with nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn IISS strategic comment paper, titled, \u201cTrump\u2019s erratic Middle East policy,\u201d argued that Trump\u2019s confrontational approach toward Iran is \u201cunlikely to lend needed stability to the region.\u201d\u000a\u000aAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country\u2019s lawful immigration system. They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement \u2014 Federal, state, and local \u2014 and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents. This is astounding given the unprecedented violent crime surge in Chicago, with the number of murders in 2016 surpassing both New York and Los Angeles combined.\u000a\u000aSessions also said that a complaint about the effect the federal policy has on local law enforcement operations is exactly as it should be.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Mayor complains that the federal government\u2019s focus on enforcing the law would require a \u2018reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago,\u2019\u201d Sessions said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that rollback the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.\u201d

aVA Crime Prevention Research Center study shows that black women are surging as a concealed carry demographic in the state of Texas.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the issuance of concealed permits for blacks in general is leading the state, and black women are increasingly the ones getting those permits.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to the Houston Press, \u201cWhite residents still represent the majority of owners, but since 2000, African American women have grown from 1 percent of total permit holders to 11 percent.\u201d This is a seismic shift which the National African American Gun Association\u2019s Philip Smith attributes to common sense.\u000a\u000aSmith said, \u201cMore and more people are no longer taking the quote-unquote standard perspective: \u2018Black folks shouldn\u2019t have guns, they\u2019re dangerous, blah blah blah.\u2019 It\u2019s OK to have a gun.

aVWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A long-simmering dispute between two top White House aides has boiled into a public battle over the direction of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy, with a cadre of conservative groups pushing for the ouster of national security adviser H.R. McMaster.\u000a\u000aIn recent days, conservative groups and a website tied to Trump adviser Steve Bannon have targeted McMaster as insufficiently supportive of Israel and insufficiently tough toward Iran. They\u2019ve expressed outrage about the firings of several aides regarded as sympathetic to their views. An online campaign \u2014 under the hashtag #FireMcMaster \u2014 prompted Trump to declare his support for his adviser.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe dispute reflects the tensions at the heart of Trump\u2019s foreign policy coalition. McMaster is one of several powerful generals in Trump\u2019s orbit who hail from the Republican foreign policy establishment. But Trump is equally sympathetic to the views of firebrands like Bannon, who are trying to push the party in a new, isolationist direction embodied by his \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine.\u000a\u000aMcMaster and Bannon have clashed loudly and repeatedly during recent White House discussions over Afghanistan war strategy, according to four administration officials and outside advisers. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss private conversations.\u000a\u000aAfghanistan, however, represents only the latest dispute between McMaster and Bannon, who\u2019ve also fought over White House personnel.\u000a\u000aMcMaster, an Army general, recently purged three National Security Council officials who were viewed as close to Bannon or to Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s previous national security adviser. For people close to Bannon, the moves were seen as telling. The former chief of Breitbart News, who wants Trump to upend the Washington foreign policy establishment, has bitterly argued against further U.S. entanglement in global conflicts and believes McMaster is adhering to holdover Obama administration policies.\u000a\u000aBreitbart, which holds significant influence in Trump\u2019s White House, has promoted a series of anti-McMaster headlines on its website. The Zionist Organization of America on Monday announced it has undertaken a review of McMaster\u2019s views on Israel. Dozens of conservative and alt-right social media stars have hammered the national security adviser on Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe outcry grew so loud that Trump responded Friday: \u201cGeneral McMaster and I are working very well together. He is a good man and very pro-Israel. I am grateful for the work he continues to do serving our country.\u201d\u000a\u000aMonths earlier, Trump also defended his adviser, taking a printout of a story suggesting he might fire McMaster and scrawling on it with a Sharpie pen, \u201cThis is bull\u2014-. You\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d along with his signature. He had it delivered to McMaster, according to someone who speaks regularly with officials in the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aBut privately, Trump has at times expressed some dissatisfaction with McMaster and rued losing Flynn, according to people who have spoken with the president. The White House has said Flynn was dismissed because he did not tell White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the full extent of his contacts with Russian officials.\u000a\u000aTrump often vents about aides without making changes. And McMaster\u2019s position was strengthened by the recent appointment of ret. Gen. John Kelly as Trump\u2019s chief of staff.\u000a\u000aBannon\u2019s allies say the recent dismissals are evidence that McMaster is ridding the National Security Council of Trump supporters while deferring to career officials left over from former President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure. They also chafe at McMaster\u2019s involvement in removing Bannon from a prominent role on the NSC earlier this year.\u000a\u000aAmong those fired: White House intelligence adviser Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Flynn protégé who previously clashed with CIA leaders.\u000a\u000aThe Iran nuclear deal also has been a source of disagreement. That Obama-era pact is opposed by Israel and prominent GOP donor Sheldon Adelson, who backs the Zionist Organization of America group that attacked McMaster. Trump has repeatedly denounced the accord, even as he has granted Iran continued relief from U.S. sanctions under the arrangement. McMaster was among the Trump aides advocating for that course.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aLemire reported from New York.\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Klapper at http://twitter.com/@BKlapperAP

aVThe City of Chicago is suing the federal government for its efforts to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws, calling the Department of Justice (DOJ) announcement that cities who harbor illegal aliens won\u2019t be eligible for federal grant funding an assault on their \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not let our police officers become political pawns in a debate,\u201d Emanuel, a Democrat, said at a news conference on Sunday, according to Reuters.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not let our residents have their fundamental rights isolated and violated,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cAnd Chicago will never relinquish our status as a welcoming city.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe federal lawsuit comes less than two weeks after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the U.S. Justice Department would bar cities from a certain grant program unless they allow immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and provide 48 hours\u2019 notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations,\u201d Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aOn July 25, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that state and local law enforcement would be notified about new requirements for receiving Byrne JAG grants to fund law enforcement-related programs.\u000a\u000a\u201cRecipients for FY 2017 will be notified of new conditions of their grants that will increase information sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement, ensuring that federal immigration authorities have the information they need to enforce immigration laws and keep our communities safe,\u201d the DOJ announcement said.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo-called \u2018sanctuary\u2019 policies make all of us less safe because they intentionally undermine our laws and protect illegal aliens who have committed crimes,\u201d Sessions said on the occasion of the notice.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese policies also encourage illegal immigration and even human trafficking by perpetuating the lie that in certain cities, illegal aliens can live outside the law,\u201d Sessions said.\u000a\u000aSessions said the policy \u201cis consistent with long-established cooperative principles among law enforcement agencies.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is what the American people should be able to expect from their cities and states, and these long overdue requirements will help us take down MS-13 and other violent transnational gangs, and make our country safer,\u201d Sessions said.\u000a\u000aIn March, Sessions announced the policy directed at states and cities that have adopted policies \u201cdesigned to frustrate the enforcement of our immigration laws.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis includes refusing to detain known felons under federal detainer requests, or otherwise failing to comply with these laws,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cFor example, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued a report showing that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe charges and convictions against these aliens include drug trafficking, hit and run, rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder,\u201d Sessions said, urging state and local jurisdictions to comply with federal law, specifically 8 U.S.C. Section 1373, in order to receive grants.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration\u2019s proposed budget requests $380 million in that funding for 2018, with Chicago slated to receive $3.2 million for equipment for law enforcement operations, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aJustice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement issued to the Associated Press on Sunday that the mayor should be focused on the \u201cstaggering\u201d statistics on homicide in Chicago.

(AP) \u2014 Mike Trout got his 1,000th career hit and also homered on his 26th birthday Monday night.\u000a\u000aThe Los Angeles Angels\u2019 two-time AL MVP hit the first milestone when he doubled down the left-field line in the fourth inning against Dylan Bundy and the Baltimore Orioles.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTrout then added his 23rd homer of the season in the sixth, driving it high off the left-field pole. The slugger homered on his birthday for the fourth time already in his six-year career, also doing it in 2012, 2013 and 2015.\u000a\u000aTrout joined Mel Ott, Jimmie Foxx and and Mickey Mantle as the only players to compile 1,000 hits, 500 runs and 500 walks by their age-25 season. Trout already was the only player to get 150 homers, 400 extra-base hits and 150 stolen bases before his 26th birthday.\u000a\u000aHe is the 11th player to get 1,000 hits in an Angels uniform.\u000a\u000aThe Big A crowd sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Trout in center field earlier in the inning. The fans gave him a standing ovation after his 1,000th hit.

aVThe hackers who breached HBO this month posted a cache of stolen corporate emails online Monday belonging to a senior executive at the network and have threatened to leak more material if a ransom payment is not made.\u000a\u000aThe Hollywood Reporter reported Monday that it had received an email containing nine files, one labeled \u201cConfidential\u201d and the another, \u201cScript GOT7,\u201d the latter possibly containing a script from a seventh season episode of the HBO series Game of Thrones.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe hackers also reportedly stole marketing materials and delivered a video letter to HBO CEO Richard Plepler that said: \u201cWe successfully breached into your huge network\u2026HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded (it took about 6 months).\u201d\u000a\u000aThe document dump came one week after Plepler publicly assured the network\u2019s staff that their private and professional email accounts were likely not comprised.\u000a\u000aHBO acknowledged last week that hackers had breached its cyber security systems and stolen \u201cproprietary information.\u201d The hackers reportedly stole 1.5 terabytes of data, and has at the time only reportedly published scripts for upcoming Game of Thrones episodes.\u000a\u000aThe pay cable channel wasted no time to respond to the most recent data breach.\u000a\u000a\u201cHBO believed that further leaks might emerge from this cyber incident when we confirmed it last week. As we said, the forensic review is ongoing,\u201d an HBO spokesperson said in a statement to THR. \u201cWhile it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our e-mail system as a whole has been compromised.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe continue to work around the clock with outside cybersecurity firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident. Meanwhile, our dedicated employees continue to focus on delivering the high quality of entertainment and service for which we are known.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe FBI is reportedly working with HBO to determine the extent of the data breach. It was unclear if other news outlets received the same email containing HBO documents.\u000a\u000aThis week, the fourth episode from the seventh season of Game of Thrones was leaked online ahead of its Sunday premiere on torrent websites. However, the leak was reported to be unrelated to the cyber attack.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not the first time a hacker or group of hackers has demanded ransom after hacking an entertainment network.\u000a\u000aIn April, a group of hackers known as The Dark Overlord (TDO) leaked all ten unaired episodes of the fifth season of the Netflix hit series Orange Is the New Black after the streaming giant refused to meet the group\u2019s ransom demands.\u000a\u000aFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson

aVMUKWONAGO, Wis. (AP) \u2014 With a dysfunctional Congress on recess, House Speaker Paul Ryan has turned his focus back home, touring flood-damaged areas and visiting local businesses in Wisconsin. But he can\u2019t escape the questions about why Republicans in charge of Washington aren\u2019t delivering.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAnd though he\u2019s won re-election easily for years, Ryan faces the prospect of challenges from left and right and an energized Democratic base in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a majority in the House and Senate and it feels like nothing\u2019s getting done,\u201d 32-year-old James Hulsey said just before Ryan recently toured his workplace.\u000a\u000aSensing the angst, Ryan has been much more visible in his southeast Wisconsin district as Republicans failed to deliver on their yearslong promise to scrap the health care law and new polling numbers show the speaker is less popular among Republicans in Wisconsin than President Donald Trump. Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point, but he carried Ryan\u2019s district by 10 points.\u000a\u000aIn the remaining months of the year, Ryan and the Republican-led Congress are determined to deliver major legislation, elusive so far due to GOP infighting, and the top priority is overhauling the nation\u2019s tax code. Failure to produce could cost Republicans their House majority in the 2018 midterms and, for Ryan, his job as speaker and Republican leader.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the third time in 100 years we\u2019ve had this alignment of government that we\u2019ve got to get it done or else I really worried our country will continue down a bad path,\u201d Ryan said after his tour of the wire manufacturer Banker Wire, in Mukwonago, Wisconsin.\u000a\u000aHe later told the Wisconsin State Journal, \u201cIf we don\u2019t do our job, we will depress turnout. I am frustrated as well.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublican Keith Ketzler, 62, worries that the GOP will pay politically next year. Democrats need to flip 24 seats to regain control.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody that voted Republican is getting very frustrated,\u201d Ketzler said, after prodding Ryan about why Congress hasn\u2019t achieved more. \u201cPeople crossed the line last time, but they\u2019re not going to stay crossed if they don\u2019t get things done.\u201d\u000a\u000aRyan angered some conservatives during the campaign with comments critical of then-candidate Trump. But in the first six months of Trump\u2019s term, Ryan has been far less critical of the president than other Republican lawmakers who have challenged a number of Trump moves, including his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator.\u000a\u000aRyan\u2019s Republican primary challenger last year, Paul Nehlen, initially won the backing of then-candidate Trump, who later switched to Ryan. Ryan beat Nehlen by 70 percentage points in the primary. But Nehlen, who is running again, thinks 2018 will be more difficult for Ryan, arguing that he hasn\u2019t done enough to appease Republican Trump supporters.\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Trump has given Paul Ryan way more opportunities to stand up and back him and what he has done is really undermine him,\u201d Nehlen said.\u000a\u000aBeating Ryan will not be easy.\u000a\u000aNo Democrat has represented the district since 1995. Ryan has cruised to re-election ever since he joined Congress in 1999 \u2014 winning by 35 percentage points last year. He has $11.5 million in the bank and is a familiar face in Janesville where he was born and raised and still lives with his wife and three children.\u000a\u000aDemocrats are pinning their hopes on Randy Bryce, an Army veteran and union iron worker with the nickname \u201cIron Stache.\u201d He appears to have walked out of Hollywood central casting \u2014 complete with a dark mustache, thick biceps, faded blue jeans and a promise to fight for the working man. Bryce is trying to capitalize on disenchantment over Ryan\u2019s role in the health care bill as he mounts a long-shot campaign.\u000a\u000aBryce generated excitement among Democrats both in Wisconsin and nationally for his announcement video in June that has now been viewed more than 550,000 times. It begins with a clip of Trump praising Ryan\u2019s attempts to undo Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and then shows Bryce getting emotional as his mother details her struggle with multiple sclerosis.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can come work the iron,\u201d the hardhat-wearing Bryce challenges Ryan, \u201cand I\u2019ll go to D.C.\u201d\u000a\u000aBryce raised $430,000 in the first two weeks after the spot ran.\u000a\u000aRyan has tried to shift the conversation from the collapse of the GOP health care effort and toward tax reform and the news that Taiwanese iPhone manufacturer Foxconn plans to invest $10 billion on a factory in his congressional district that could employ 13,000 people. Ryan launched a series of campaign-style online ads highlighting the news that the plant was coming near abandoned automobile factories in his hometown of Janesville and nearby Kenosha.\u000a\u000aBut Ryan\u2019s involvement doesn\u2019t seem to be resonating quite yet with voters in his district.\u000a\u000a\u201cPaul Ryan? I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s done for it,\u201d said Republican voter Jeff Lunde of Ryan\u2019s role in the Foxconn deal. \u201cThey\u2019re all working on this stupid health-care crap.\u201d\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sbauerAP

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster is listed as being a member for eleven years, this week added George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and another Soros-financed group to the list of donors on its website in response to a Breitbart News request on the matter.\u000a\u000aFrom September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow. The IISS describes itself as a \u201cworld-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aA page on the IISS website titled \u201cOur Funding\u201d lists groups, corporations, and government entities that provide funding to the think tank, including during the period of McMaster\u2019s work there.\u000a\u000aFrom at least last week, when Breitbart News started an investigation of the organization, the active donor page on IISS\u2019s website did not mention the Open Society Foundation among the list of contributors, even though an archived version of the IISS funders\u2019 page listed the Open Society Foundations. And IISS has been listed on the Open Society\u2019s website as a grantee of the Global Drug Policy Program of the Open Society Foundations.\u000a\u000aAlso missing from the website from at least last week was any mention of the controversial, Soros-funded Ploughshares Fund as a donor, even though Ploughshares\u2019 own financial reports listed a donation to IISS. Like the Open Society Foundations, Ploughshares was listed on the archived version of IISS\u2019s donor page.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, Breitbart News sent IISS an email inquiry about the discrepancies regarding the removal of the Open Society Foundations and Ploughshares Fund from its website. IISS did not reply to the request for comment at the time.\u000a\u000aOn late Sunday night, Breitbart News released a story by this reporter documenting Ploughshares Fund\u2019s financing of IISS.\u000a\u000aAs of Tuesday, the Open Society Foundations was again added to the website\u2019s list of donors, and the Ploughshares Fund was added, as well. The website now relates that Open Society provided between £100,000 to £499,999 ($130078.50 to $650,436.20). Ploughshares is now listed as a donor that provided between £25,000 to £99,999 ($32,510 and $130038).\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, Breitbart News sent a request for comment about the additions to the website and received the following reply:\u000a\u000aAs well as the Open Society Foundation, we also accidentally removed the Carnegie, McArthur, and James Foundations, as well as a number of governments and corporate supporters, when we updated the page ten days ago. Your question brought this to our attention and the listing has now been corrected.\u000a\u000aThink Tank Backed by Soros-Funded Group That Helped Obama Sell Iran Nuclear Deal\u000a\u000aBreitbart News reported Sunday that a major IISS donor is the Soros-funded Ploughshares Fund, identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News has found that IISS is listed as a grantee for Iran issues in Ploughshares Fund\u2019s budget report for 2016.\u000a\u000aThat report spotlights IISS as a grantee for Iran work done by Michael Elleman, IISS senior fellow for missile defense.\u000a\u000aIn a recent IISS analysis, Elleman cast doubt on charges that Iran and North Korea are working together on ballistic-missile development, claiming \u201cthere is little evidence to indicate the two regimes are engaged in deep missile-related collaboration, or pursuing joint-development programs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, is listed as a member of IISS in his Georgetown University bio.\u000a\u000aPloughshares Fund is financed by Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute.\u000a\u000aThe involvement of Ploughshares in selling the Iran agreement to the public was revealed in an extensive New York Times Magazine profile of Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, titled, \u201cThe Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru.\u201d The article contains interviews with Rhodes and scores of top Obama administration officials.\u000a\u000aRobert Malley, then a senior director at the National Security Council, expounded on the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal.\u000a\u000aMalley explained to the Times that \u201cexperts\u201d were utilized to create an \u201cecho chamber\u201d that disseminated administration claims about Iran to \u201chundreds of often-clueless reporters\u201d in the news media.\u000a\u000aTimes author David Samuels wrote:\u000a\u000aIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aRhodes told Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the \u201cabsence of rational discourse\u201d and utilized outside groups, including Ploughshares.\u000a\u000aWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents. Ploughshares says it has awarded hundreds of grants \u201cwhose aggregate value exceeded $60 million.\u201d\u000a\u000aA previous investigation by this reporter showed Ploughshares has partnered with a who\u2019s-who of the radical left, including Code Pink, the pro-Palestinian J Street, United for Peace & Justice, the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and Demos, a progressive economic advisory group where Obama\u2019s controversial former green jobs czar, Van Jones, has served on the board.\u000a\u000aThe group says its mission is to support the \u201csmartest minds and most effective organizations to reduce nuclear stockpiles, prevent new nuclear states, and increase global security.\u201d\u000a\u000aPloughshares is in turn financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute, the Buffett Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Foundation.\u000a\u000aAnother Ploughshares donor is the Tides Foundation, which is one of the largest funders of the radical left. Tides is funded by Soros.\u000a\u000aPloughshares has donated to the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls for massive slashes in the U.S. defense budget.\u000a\u000aIt has also financed the International Crisis Group, a small organization that boasts George Soros and his son, Alexander, on its board and where Malley now works as vice president for public policy.\u000a\u000aPloughshares, McMaster and John Kerry\u000a\u000aLast week, McMaster removed Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Trump aide and Iran deal opponent, from the National Security Council in what the Jerusalem Post reported was a possible \u201csweep of Iran hard-liners.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Post reported on two other McMaster purges of Iran hardliners:\u000a\u000aCohen-Watnick\u2019s removal comes after the revelation by The Atlantic on Wednesday of the dismissal of Rich Higgins, another Iran hawk who was the NSC\u2019s director of strategic planning. Higgins was sacked for circulating a memo in which he alleged that there was a \u201cMaoist\u201d insurgency within and without the government of \u201cglobalists and Islamists.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso gone is Derek Harvey, who held the Middle East portfolio at the NSC, and who also was an Iran hawk, and who may assume another role in the administration. McMaster tapped Michael Bell, a retired army colonel who has a conventional career portfolio, to replace Harvey.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a recent event held by Ploughshares Fund, former Secretary of State John Kerry implied that McMaster is the best bet at keeping the nuclear agreement alive, according to a Ploughshares Fund description of the June 5, 2017 event.\u000a\u000aMcMaster and IISS\u000a\u000aMcMaster is listed on IISS\u2019s website as serving as a former consulting senior fellow on the following issues: Military history; civil-military relations; development and security; and conflict and conflict prevention.\u000a\u000aIISS, meanwhile, has supported the Iran nuclear agreement and has defended Tehran against reports it has violated tenets of the deal.\u000a\u000aLast month, IISS featured a piece by Mark Fitzpatrick, chief of the think tank\u2019s non-proliferation and nuclear policy program, titled, \u201cThree strikes against claims that Iran is violating the nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IISS piece argued that \u201ccriticism of Iran\u2019s conduct in relation to the 2015 nuclear deal does not withstand scrutiny,\u201d and that the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement \u201cwould not convince other parties to re-impose sanctions, but could trigger a global crisis.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn June, the IISS\u2019s Fitzpatrick opined that \u201cCritics are wrong: Iran remains in compliance with nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn IISS strategic comment paper, titled, \u201cTrump\u2019s erratic Middle East policy,\u201d argued that Trump\u2019s confrontational approach toward Iran is \u201cunlikely to lend needed stability to the region.\u201d\u000a\u000aAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

aVFour scientists have claimed that James Damore\u2019s Google manifesto is scientifically accurate, as reported by Quillette.\u000a\u000aResponding to the viewpoint diversity manifesto, which called for more ideological diversity in Google\u2019s workplace and pointed out not only the biological differences between men and women but also how these can apply to work, the four scientists deemed the ten-page document to be scientifically accurate.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cThe author of the Google essay on issues related to diversity gets nearly all of the science and its implications exactly right,\u201d declared Rutgers University Professor Lee Jussim. \u201cIts main points are that: 1. Neither the left nor the right gets diversity completely right; 2. The social science evidence on implicit and explicit bias has been wildly oversold and is far weaker than most people seem to realize; 3. Google has, perhaps unintentionally, created an authoritarian atmosphere that has stifled discussion of these issues by stigmatizing anyone who disagrees as a bigot and instituted authoritarian policies of reverse discrimination; 4. The policies and atmosphere systematically ignore biological, cognitive, educational, and social science research on the nature and sources of individual and group differences.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot speak to the atmosphere at Google, but: 1. Give that the author gets everything else right, I am pretty confident he is right about that too; 2. It is a painfully familiar atmosphere, one that is a lot like academia,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aThis view was mirrored by Professor David P. Schmitt.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to discuss this topic scientifically, keeping an open mind and using informed skepticism when evaluating claims about evidence,\u201d Schmitt proclaimed in the article. \u201cIn the case of personality traits, evidence that men and women may have different average levels of certain traits is rather strong.\u201d\u000a\u000aUniversity of New Mexico Professor Geoffrey Miller also agreed, claiming that critics of the manifesto \u201cignored the memo\u2019s evidence-based arguments.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAmong commentators who claim the memo\u2019s empirical facts are wrong, I haven\u2019t read a single one who understands sexual selection theory, animal behavior, and sex differences research,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think that almost all of the Google memo\u2019s empirical claims are scientifically accurate.

aVWhy do men assign themselves starring roles in battles they never even witnessed? Because the rewards for such tall tales remain high and the consequences minimal.\u000a\u000aTake Senator Richard Blumenthal, whose prestigious prefix arriving after The New York Times exposed him for making false boasts about serving in Vietnam affirms this truth about liars. His mendacity not only did not preclude him from winning a seat in the United States Senate, it now works as a boomerang against anyone who dares criticize Blumenthal for lying to veterans about his own service. Brian Dennehy lost no roles over propagating a false war record and Brian Williams reads the news on MSNBC despite inventing a story of his helicopter grounded by enemy fire while covering the Iraq war. We incentivize their sin.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aDonald Trump calls out the Connecticut Democrat for inventing nonexistent service in Vietnam this week in response to the senator criticizing the president over Russia. It may be a bit of a non sequitur on the president\u2019s part but anyone following his modus operandi knows by now that Trump always counterpunches by bringing up his critic\u2019s most embarrassing moments, however dated or irrelevant.\u000a\u000a\u201cNever in U.S. history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe told stories about his Vietnam battles and conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?\u201d\u000a\u000aA cheapshot? Maybe. Untrue? No.\u000a\u000aThe senator calls the criticism \u201cslurs.\u201d The media appears to agree.\u000a\u000aThe Los Angeles Times attacked the president in a headline: \u201cPresident Trump, Who Got 5 Draft Deferments, Again Attacks Sen. Blumenthal\u2019s Military Record.\u201d The Boston Globe op-ed writer Joan Vennochi\u2019s headline similarly blared, \u201cFor Someone Who Never Served, Trump Sure Loves to Criticize Those Who Have.\u201d\u000a\u000aBlumenthal, like Trump, received at least five deferments. He served as a Marine reservist from 1970 to 1976 but never went to Vietnam, which, of course, puts no shame in his game if not for the fact that, when he became a politician, he repeatedly insinuated or outright claimed Vietnam veteran status.\u000a\u000aVeterans don\u2019t despise civilians who never served. They loathe men who lied that they did.\u000a\u000aBut exposed stolen valor cases do not become pariahs to the public as they do to veterans. I learned this earlier this year when writing about another Connecticut Marine, historian William Manchester, who, in addition to writing the bestselling nonfiction book of 1967 in The Death of a President, penned a fictitious war memoir called Goodbye, Darkness in which he pawned off fibs as fact.\u000a\u000aAlong with R. Emmett Tyrrell of the American Spectator, I examined Manchester\u2019s wartime letters to his mom housed at the University of Massachusetts, his papers kept at Wesleyan University, and his 199-page war record obtained from the United States Marine Corps. They clashed with his claims made over several decades, particularly ones in his 1980 memoir Goodbye, Darkness.\u000a\u000aUnlike Blumenthal, Manchester did serve in combat (in Okinawa). But he attributed acts of heroism to himself that he never performed and diagnosed himself with war wounds that he never suffered. Manchester did endure a serious shrapnel wound in World War II. But he never got shot in the knee, the head, or the heart as he claimed later in life. He did not win a Navy Cross or a Silver Star or a second Purple Heart as he claimed (Manchester\u2019s papers donated by the popular historian to Wesleyan University contain at least two forged Marine citations). He did not fireman-carry a man off the battlefield after getting shot himself, did not commandeer a machine gun to repel a Japanese advance up an Okinawa hill, and did not flee a field hospital after getting shot to courageously rejoin his unit only to get wounded again. But he did win a $350,000 advance for Goodbye, Darkness and hit #5 on the New York Times bestseller list during Christmas week in 1980.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not quite parlaying a lie into a seat in the U.S. senate. But it\u2019s a pretty big payoff for a very low move. One suspects, though, more complex reasons found in a deeper, darker place in the psyche than the simple explanation of tall tales told for power or profit.\u000a\u000aThe media reaction to outlining the contradictions in Manchester\u2019s claims vis-a-vis Manchester\u2019s record came as quite different to what greets Trump. Listen to the crickets at The Los Angeles Times and The Boston Globe. They and other media outlets who spilt much ink on Manchester during his life kept paper dry when news came that he made up so much that his readers believed true about him. They once acted as stenographers repeating the false boasts of William Manchester (read the Times and Globe obits linked above). Now they blast Trump for daring to speak a truth about a man who told a lie. The indecency occurs to them as not when one shouts a fantastic falsehood but when one rebuts it with an unpleasant truth.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam,\u201d Blumenthal told a group of veterans in 2008. Unfortunately, the more we learn about stolen-valor cases, the more we understand why so many make fake boasts. The same newspapers that reprint without question the lies of phony war heroes whitewash revelations of hogwash and bash those who lay bare braggarts.\u000a\u000aStolen valor pays.

aVSilicon Valley\u2019s tech elites are spoiling for a fight against a legal immigration overhaul backed by President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aLast week, President Donald Trump endorsed a pro-American immigration plan by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) called the RAISE Act, which would cut legal immigration from current levels from more than one million a year to 500,000.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTech elites, who benefit from the continued mass immigration of low-skilled, low-wage foreign nationals, are railing against the RAISE Act, claiming that any cuts to legal immigration to help Americans will hurt giant tech corporations.\u000a\u000aFormer Twitter CEO Dick Costolo told CNBC that the immigration overhaul would \u201cmake it harder\u201d for Silicon Valley elites to find qualified candidates to take U.S. jobs.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe go through ridiculous interview processes to try to find precisely the right people,\u201d Costolo said. \u201cThey take a long time. We talk to tons of candidates, generally speaking, to find the one or two we want.\u201d\u000a\u000aCostolo complained that there are not enough high-skilled Americans to take engineering jobs, therefore they must be imported.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe competition for engineers in Silicon Valley and around the world right now is extraordinary,\u201d Costolo continued. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough of them, everybody\u2019s fighting for them, we all want more. And the notion that someone else will be ahead of us in line, screening those people, and not letting us screen who we want to come work for us, is just going to make it harder for us to compete. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the same time, open borders activist and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pro-immigration lobbying group, FWD.us, has come out against the RAISE Act, claiming that by lowering the number of low-skilled immigrants coming to the U.S. to compete with Americans for jobs would depress U.S. wages.\u000a\u000aFWD.us President Todd Schulte said in a statement:\u000a\u000aThis bill slashes overall legal immigration by 50% \u2013 the biggest reductions in a century \u2013 which would severely harm the economy and actually depress wages for Americans. In the past, President Trump has always been correct when he repeatedly said he does NOT want to cut legal immigration. Not only do immigrants help grow the economy overall, but immigrants drive up wages for the overwhelming majority of Americans, and significantly so in areas and industries with more immigrants, where wage growth has outpaced the country overall. We call on Congress to fix those parts of our broken immigration system that clearly need reform \u2013 but we should create a modern legal visa system for the 21st century, not enact the largest cuts to legal immigration in modern history.\u000a\u000aFWD.us is not only funded by Zuckberg, but also by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to lobby Congress to keep the flow of cheap, foreign labor coming to the U.S.\u000a\u000aThere are four pipelines to importing low-skilled foreign nationals. Those include immigrants who come to the U.S. legally; non-immigrants who come to the U.S. on any of the employment-based visa programs available; foreign nationals who are allowed to work legally on Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) \u2013 like those given amnesty through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and illegal aliens who enter the U.S. mostly through the southern border.\u000a\u000aAny disruption to these pipelines of low-skilled immigration has been opposed by not only the open borders lobby, but by Silicon Valley and big business interest.\u000a\u000aJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

Several lawmakers abstained from voting to implement the new holiday, but none voted against it.\u000a\u000aGov. Rauner, though, did oppose an earlier version of the bill that made Obama\u2019s birthday a paid holiday. In opposition to the idea of giving employees a paid day off, Rauner said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be a formal holiday with paid, forced time off, but I think it should be a day of acknowledgment and celebration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe state of Illinois has the worst budget and pension crisis in the nation and many of the state\u2019s vendors haven\u2019t been paid for years.\u000a\u000aBarack Obama took up permanent residence in Illinois in 1995 and lived there until he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004, after which he moved to Washington and rarely returned to the state that gave him his political start.

aVThe current legal immigration system, where the United States admits more than one million low-skilled immigrants a year, is necessary \u201cas baby boomers retire,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 editors claim.\u000a\u000aIn a new piece in the Times, the newspaper\u2019s editors joined The Washington Post in their disdain for the RAISE Act by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), which could cut current legal immigration levels in half to relieve American wages, proponents argue.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Times\u2019 editors claim the RAISE Act\u2013 endorsed by President Trump last week\u2013would \u201cdo nothing\u201d to help Americans, despite a slew of research and reports indicating that a slowdown could benefit the current population:\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has endorsed legislation that would slash legal immigration by half, mainly by cutting the number of visas granted to relatives of citizens, while favoring people who speak English and have advanced degrees. The bill, which would do nothing to solve the country\u2019s immigration and economic challenges, is unlikely to become law. The only way to understand Mr. Trump\u2019s vocal support of an obvious turkey is as yet another attempt to energize his dwindling base of right-wing and nativist supporters.\u000a\u000aProponents of the bill argue that it could:\u000a\u000aReduce the number of Green Cards given out every year from about one million to 500,000;\u000a\u000aPrioritize immediate family households, thus ending extended family chain migration to the U.S.;\u000a\u000aCreate a visa program for U.S. citizens to bring elderly parents to U.S. for caretaking purposes;\u000a\u000aEliminate the diversity lottery, where 50,000 visas are \u201carbitrarily allocated\u201d every year; and\u000a\u000aCap permanent U.S. refugees resettlement to 50,000 migrants per year.\u000a\u000aBut, according to the Times\u2019 editors, the current levels of legal immigration are needed so that baby boomers can retire:\u000a\u000aMoreover, as studies have repeatedly shown, immigration boosts productivity and economic growth; restricting it would have the opposite effect. Growth is determined by the changes in productivity \u2014 how much each worker produces \u2014 and the size of the work force. Productivity in recent decades has been growing more slowly than in the past for reasons that economists do not fully understand. The labor force is also growing slowly as baby boomers retire. Restricting immigration would reinforce both trends.\u000a\u000aThe Times\u2019 editorial against the RAISE Act echoes the Post\u2019s, as Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aLike the Times\u2019 editorial, the Washington Post fixated on the necessity for mass immigration to continue a 2 percent gross domestic product growth rate.\u000a\u000aUnlike the Times, the Washington Post admitted what immigration hawks have said, which is that high levels of legal immigration depress the wages of domestic workers.\u000a\u000aJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

aVThe Center for Security Policy on Monday called for the firing of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster for \u201cdisloyal and subversive behavior.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf such misconduct is tolerated, Trump voters will have unknowingly elected President McMaster,\u201d the Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney said in the statement.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe organization said McMaster was undermining President Trump\u2019s policies on \u201cvirtually every important foreign and defense policy issue,\u201d and they commented on his recent purge of staff members who support the president\u2019s agenda while keeping \u201clarge numbers of Obama holdovers\u201d at the National Security Council.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo voter in this country \u2013 not one \u2013 elected H.R. McMaster to run U.S. foreign policy. Actually, the winner of the 2016 election was a man who opposed virtually every aspect of the McMaster agenda \u2013 and that of the president who made its architect a three-star general, Barack Obama,\u201d Gaffney said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt every turn, the Army general has been insubordinate to his Commander-in-Chief. For example, he has openly opposed Mr. Trump on \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,\u2019 Syria, Qatar, Iran, Russia and the Muslim Brotherhood. Of late, McMaster has taken to purging Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal staff members,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMcMaster last week fired Ezra Cohen-Watnik, the senior intelligence adviser at the NSC. The week before, he fired Derek Harvey, the NSC\u2019s Middle East adviser. In July, he fired Rich Higgins, the director of strategic planning at the NSC.\u000a\u000aAll three men were brought on board by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and were fired because they were part of the \u201cnationalist\u201d camp that supported the president, versus McMaster\u2019s \u201cglobalist\u201d camp, according to a former White House official.\u000a\u000aThe statement also noted that McMaster had personally granted former National Security Adviser Susan Rice continued access to top secret information in April, despite the president\u2019s concerns over Rice\u2019s unmasking of Trump campaign and transition team members.\u000a\u000aIn light of the administration\u2019s crackdown on leaks that compromise national security, McMaster\u2019s office should \u201creceive close scrutiny,\u201d it said.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven Ms. Rice\u2019s record of playing fast-and-loose with sensitive information for partisan political purposes, this action speaks volumes about Gen.

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster served at a UK-based think tank that is heavily bankrolled by multinational corporate firms doing billions of dollars in business in Iran.\u000a\u000aThe business deals are up for regulation by the U.S. government and the transactions are in direct jeopardy by the possibility of the Trump administration further sanctioning Iran or declaring Tehran in violation of the international nuclear accord.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe past affiliation may raise conflict-of-interest issues for McMaster, who is serving in a position of direct influence over U.S. policy with regard to Iran. Already, McMaster has been accused of purging the National Security Council of hardliners on Iran, and he is seen as a leading proponent of the Iran nuclear accord within the Trump administration. McMaster has reportedly urged the Trump administration to recertify Iran\u2019s compliance with the Iran nuclear deal.\u000a\u000aFrom September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow. The IISS describes itself as a \u201cworld-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aIISS has not returned repeated requests from Breitbart News seeking clarification about McMaster\u2019s work at the think tank, including any salary that he may have received. The organization also did not reply to an inquiry about its funding.\u000a\u000aWhile IISS says it produces \u201cobjective information\u201d on geopolitical developments, the think tank is funded by multinational firms doing major business deals with Iranian companies.\u000a\u000aHere is a list of some IISS corporate sponsors doing business with firms in Iran:\u000a\u000aAirbus (provided between $130,350 and $651,748 to IISS)\u000a\u000aIn June, two Iranian airlines made prospective deals with Europe-based Airbus \u2014 described as memorandums of understanding \u2014 to purchase 73 jetliners in deals reportedly worth as much as $2.5 billion. The deals are permissible because of the easing of sanctions under the Obama administration-brokered 2015 nuclear accord with Iran.\u000a\u000aThe New York Times reported that aspects of the Iranian firms\u2019 purchases of Airbus planes are subject to U.S. government regulation.\u000a\u000aThe Times reported:\u000a\u000aIran\u2019s Airtour Airline intends to buy 45 upgraded versions of the A320 jet, and Zagros Airlines intends to buy 20 upgraded A320s and eight upgraded A330s. \u2026The deals are permitted under the 2015 nuclear agreement Iran reached with six major powers, which relaxed sanctions in return for Iran\u2019s verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work. But the deals \u2014 even for the Airbuses \u2014 still must be licensed by the United States government because many components and technology in the aircraft are made in the United States and are subject to export control regulations.\u000a\u000aThe agreements with two Iranian companies to purchase 73 Airbus jets follows another purchase by IranAir of 180 Airbus jets that was downgraded to 100 jets last December at an estimated value of about $10 billion.\u000a\u000aBoeing Company (provided between $130,350 and $651,748 to IISS)\u000a\u000aAnother top IISS donor, Boeing Company, the world\u2019s largest aerospace company, inked a $3 billion contract last December to sell 30 737 Max jets to Aseman Airlines, a firm whose largest owner is the government-run Iran National Pension Fund.\u000a\u000aThat deal was made possible by the 2015 Iran nuclear accord. And like other deals with Iranian companies, it is subject to U.S. government approval.\u000a\u000a\u201cBoeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran\u2019s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran\u2019s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval,\u201d a Boeing spokeswoman told Reuters in response to reports that the U.S. Treasury has been reviewing licenses for the Boeing deal with Iran.\u000a\u000aTotal SA (provided between $32,591 and $130,349 to IISS)\u000a\u000aTotal SA, the French multinational oil and gas company, is a donor to IISS. Last month, Total SA and a Chinese oil firm signed a $5 billion agreement with Iran to develop a massive offshore natural gas field.\u000a\u000aIranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh singled out the energy agreement as \u201cone of the outcomes of the nuclear deal and recent presidential election,\u201d and he said the agreement would lead to \u201cmore than $5 billion in foreign investments.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe AP reported on the deal:\u000a\u000aIran on Monday signed a $5 billion agreement with France\u2019s Total SA and a Chinese oil company to develop its massive offshore natural gas field, the first such deal with foreign companies since the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Officials met in Tehran and signed the agreement, which will see the firms develop a portion of the massive South Pars offshore field that Iran shares with Qatar. Qatar calls the same area the North Field and it provides the small country, now in the middle of a diplomatic crisis with four other Arab states, its incredible wealth. Total has a 50.1-percent share in the new Iran deal. The state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. has 30-percent stake and Iran\u2019s Petropars has 19.9 percent.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a major agreement for Total, which officially marks our return to Iran to open a new page in the history of our partnership with the country,\u201d Total Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement. \u201cTotal will develop the project in strict compliance with applicable national and international laws.\u201d\u000a\u000aForeign Policy magazine reported that Total\u2019s approval of the $5 billion deal was heavily influenced by the Trump administration\u2019s decision in April to certify Iran as complying with the nuclear deal:\u000a\u000aBut several developments this spring apparently gave Total reason to suspect that Trump\u2019s bark might be worse than his bite. One was the administration\u2019s decision in April to certify to Congress that Iran remained in compliance with all its obligations under the JCPOA \u2014 despite repeated violations of some of the deal\u2019s key constraints regarding things like stocks of heavy water (begrudgingly, the Trump team issued its second report certifying Iran\u2019s JCPOA compliance Tuesday night). That was followed by the decision in late May, in response to another congressional deadline, to continue the Obama administration\u2019s policy of granting certain sanctions relief to Iran, as called for in the JCPOA.\u000a\u000aBP International Ltd (provided between $32,591 and $130,349 to IISS)\u000a\u000aLast year, BP International, another IISS donor, was granted a license by the U.S. Treasury Department to operate a joint gas field in the North Sea following the removal of European Union and United Nations sanctions on Iran.\u000a\u000aWhile BP earlier this year decided not to take part in first wave agreements to develop oil and gas reserves in Iran, the firm reportedly opened a representative office in Iran. And last November, BP created an executive committee to explore business in Iran. BP also purchased condensate from the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company last year following the sanctions removal.\u000a\u000aShell International Ltd. (provided between $32,591 and $130,349 to IISS)\u000a\u000aShell International Ltd., which donated to IISS, operates as a subsidiary of oil giant Royal Dutch Shell.\u000a\u000aReuters reported that while Shell has been cautious about Iranian oil buys, it has done some deals in Iran since the sanctions were relieved.\u000a\u000aThe news agency reported:\u000a\u000aShell said in its annual report it had bought only three cargoes of Iranian oil over the past year. These were a $45 million cargo in May, on which it made a profit of $1.1 million, followed by 2 cargoes in December costing $103 million and $106 million respectively. Those are still in transit so no profit or loss has been yet made on them, Shell said. During the course of 2016, Shell also repaid $1.942 billion in debts to Iran for oil purchases it made before stricter EU sanctions were imposed on Iran in 2012.\u000a\u000aThink Tank Backed by Soros-Funded Group that Helped Obama Sell Iran Nuclear Deal\u000a\u000aIISS\u2019s corporate donors are not the only controversial financing to the group where McMaster previously served. Breitbart News reported Sunday that another IISS donor is a George Soros-funded nonprofit identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.\u000a\u000aIISS\u2019s website contains a list of groups, corporations and government entities that provide funding to the think tank, including during the period of McMaster\u2019s work there. Curiously missing from the page of donors, however, is the controversial Ploughshares Fund, a grantmaking group identified last year by the Obama White House as central in helping to market the Iran nuclear deal to the news media.\u000a\u000aAn archived version of IISS\u2019s donors page lists Ploughshares as a donor.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News has found that IISS is listed as a grantee for Iran issues in Ploughshares Fund\u2019s budget report for 2016.\u000a\u000aThat report spotlights IISS as a grantee for Iran work done by Michael Elleman, IISS senior fellow for missile defense.\u000a\u000aIn a recent IISS analysis, Elleman cast doubt on charges that Iran and North Korea are working together on ballistic-missile development, claiming \u201cthere is little evidence to indicate the two regimes are engaged in deep missile-related collaboration, or pursuing joint-development programs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, is listed as a member of IISS in his Georgetown University bio.\u000a\u000aPloughshares Fund is financed by Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute.\u000a\u000aThe involvement of Ploughshares in selling the Iran agreement to the public was revealed in an extensive New York Times Magazine profile of Obama\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, titled, \u201cThe Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru.\u201d The article contains interviews with Rhodes and scores of top Obama administration officials.\u000a\u000aRobert Malley, then a senior director at the National Security Council, expounded on the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal.\u000a\u000aMalley explained to the Times that \u201cexperts\u201d were utilized to create an \u201cecho chamber\u201d that disseminated administration claims about Iran to \u201chundreds of often-clueless reporters\u201d in the news media.\u000a\u000aTimes author David Samuels wrote:\u000a\u000aIn the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aRhodes told Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the \u201cabsence of rational discourse\u201d and utilized outside groups, including Ploughshares.\u000a\u000aWhen I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents. Ploughshares says it has awarded hundreds of grants \u201cwhose aggregate value exceeded $60 million.\u201d\u000a\u000aA previous investigation by this reporter showed Ploughshares has partnered with a who\u2019s-who of the radical left, including Code Pink, the pro-Palestinian J Street, United for Peace & Justice, the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and Demos, a progressive economic advisory group where Obama\u2019s controversial former green jobs czar, Van Jones, has served on the board.\u000a\u000aThe group says its mission is to support the \u201csmartest minds and most effective organizations to reduce nuclear stockpiles, prevent new nuclear states, and increase global security.\u201d\u000a\u000aPloughshares is in turn financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute, the Buffett Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Foundation.\u000a\u000aAnother Ploughshares donor is the Tides Foundation, which is one of the largest funders of the radical left. Tides is funded by Soros.\u000a\u000aPloughshares has donated to the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls for massive slashes in the U.S. defense budget.\u000a\u000aIt has also financed the International Crisis Group, a small organization that boasts George Soros and his son, Alexander, on its board and where Malley now works as vice president for public policy.\u000a\u000aPloughshares, McMaster and John Kerry\u000a\u000aLast week, McMaster removed Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Trump aide and Iran deal opponent, from the National Security Council in what the Jerusalem Post reported was a possible \u201csweep of Iran hard-liners.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Post reported on two other McMaster purges of Iran hardliners:\u000a\u000aCohen-Watnick\u2019s removal comes after the revelation by The Atlantic on Wednesday of the dismissal of Rich Higgins, another Iran hawk who was the NSC\u2019s director of strategic planning. Higgins was sacked for circulating a memo in which he alleged that there was a \u201cMaoist\u201d insurgency within and without the government of \u201cglobalists and Islamists.\u201d Also gone is Derek Harvey, who held the Middle East portfolio at the NSC, and who also was an Iran hawk, and who may assume another role in the administration. McMaster tapped Michael Bell, a retired army colonel who has a conventional career portfolio, to replace Harvey.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a recent event held by Ploughshares Fund, former Secretary of State John Kerry implied that McMaster is the best bet at keeping the nuclear agreement alive, according to a Ploughshares Fund description of the June 5, 2017 event.\u000a\u000aMcMaster and IISS\u000a\u000aMcMaster is listed on IISS\u2019s website as serving as a former consulting senior fellow on the following issues: Military history; civil-military relations; development and security; and conflict and conflict prevention.\u000a\u000aIISS, meanwhile, has supported the Iran nuclear agreement and has defended Tehran against reports it has violated tenets of the deal.\u000a\u000aLast month, IISS featured a piece by Mark Fitzpatrick, chief of the think tank\u2019s non-proliferation and nuclear policy program, titled, \u201cThree strikes against claims that Iran is violating the nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IISS piece argued that \u201ccriticism of Iran\u2019s conduct in relation to the 2015 nuclear deal does not withstand scrutiny,\u201d and that the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement \u201cwould not convince other parties to re-impose sanctions, but could trigger a global crisis.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn June, the IISS\u2019s Fitzpatrick opined that \u201cCritics are wrong: Iran remains in compliance with nuclear accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn IISS strategic comment paper, titled, \u201cTrump\u2019s erratic Middle East policy,\u201d argued that Trump\u2019s confrontational approach toward Iran is \u201cunlikely to lend needed stability to the region.\u201d\u000a\u000aAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

aVIn her first interview since becoming the spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee (RNC), former CNN contributor Kayleigh McEnany talked to Sirius XM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily on Tuesday, during which she stressed the importance of Republicans unifying behind President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u000a\u000aMarlow pointed out that, unfortunately, most of the key items from Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign are stalled in Congress. He asked what the RNC can do to clear away these legislative jams.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aMcEnany replied that disappointed Republican voters should \u201cstay tuned.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTax reform is coming,\u201d she promised. \u201cA family making $55,000, you\u2019re going to see close to $5,000 back in your pocket each year. That\u2019s coming. That\u2019s right around the corner.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cObamacare was a blip. We need to revisit it,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt needs to happen.

There isn\u2019t a major repeal of Obamacare yet, a replacement, but all of that\u2019s coming,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep in mind that for President Obama, it took more than a year \u2013 nearly a year-and-a-half \u2013 to pass Obamacare to begin with. Let\u2019s give President Trump that time,\u201d she urged.\u000a\u000aMcEnany said President Trump has \u201cdone a great job already,\u201d referencing his executive actions and recent good economic news.\u000a\u000a\u201cGive him some time because I guarantee you in the next few months, going into next year, we\u2019re going to see tax reform. We\u2019re going to see the RAISE Act. We will see major legislative victories. But it takes time,\u201d she noted.\u000a\u000aMarlow responded by noting that influential Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) has already declared that \u201cthe RAISE Act doesn\u2019t have a chance in hell\u201d of passing Congress.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s something that a lot of us find, even if he\u2019s right, we find it very counterproductive that you have Republicans going out and taking shots at key pieces of legislation,\u201d he told the new RNC spokeswoman.\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to have a different opinion,\u201d McEnany conceded. \u201cYou will have people who publicly dismiss it. We\u2019ve seen that from the beginning, going back to Obamacare. But we have a president who, behind the scenes, is going to get the job done. He\u2019s picking up the phone. He\u2019s making calls.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, President Obama was in many ways an absentee president,\u201d she contended. \u201cHe was not good at picking up the phone and negotiating. But we have a president who is an expert negotiator, and we have a president who is going to pick up the phone and put the pressure on some of those Republicans who are pushing back on the RAISE Act.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s what it takes because publicly you might have some people who speak out against it, but we have a president who, behind the scenes, will make a difference,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aMarlow asked McEnany about her new \u201cTrump TV\u201d project, a series of videos designed to bypass the mainstream media and bring President Trump\u2019s message directly to the American people. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a lot of hostile response from the media, which I think is fantastic,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s rather interesting to me. You have a lot of media pushback on this, and really what it was are sharing facts \u2013 actual, hard facts,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice in the pushback very little of it is the facts or the substance of what this broadcast said.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an effort to put forth what the president is doing and the positive successes in his administration,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never hear about ISIS being on the run or the Veteran Accountability Act or MS-13. You might hear an inkling here or there in the media, but these are things the American people want to hear. They want to hear what their elected leader is doing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and all too often, you hear about Russia, but not about border crossings being down.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an effort to offer another set of facts that supplement what\u2019s being said in the media, which is oftentimes falsehoods,\u201d she charged. \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to put out there what\u2019s going on and give the American people the substance that they want to hear, but you don\u2019t hear in the media. It\u2019s been lambasted, but what I find interesting is that no one is attacking the factual substance of it. They\u2019re just attacking the fact that someone is getting through and telling the American people what\u2019s happening in their White House.\u201d\u000a\u000aMarlow also noted that charges of \u201cpropaganda\u201d leveled at McEnany\u2019s videos are foolish because her perspective and biases are clearly stated in advance, and there is nothing illusory or deceptive about the productions.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not propaganda at all,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that that was a news broadcast coming from Trump Tower. It had Trump behind it in the background. It is being marginalized as propaganda, which it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just an effort to give the people facts.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHave the American people heard that President Trump has rescinded more regulations than any president in American history?\u201d she wondered. \u201cI believe the number is something like 860. He has had 40 pieces of legislation signed. He has 40 executive orders. Are these things you hear in the mainstream media? No, you don\u2019t. They\u2019re facts that aren\u2019t offered because they don\u2019t supplement the mainstream media narrative of negativity.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo it\u2019s an effort to give the American people those facts. Ultimately, at the end of the day, they have a vote. They decide which way they want to cast it. But they deserve to hear both sides of the story,\u201d she contended.\u000a\u000aMcEnany anticipated \u201cmore successes\u201d throughout the rest of 2017.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook at the economy alone. One million jobs created, consumer confidence a 16-year high, unemployment a 16-year low. You\u2019re going to see robust economic activity, more factories moving back,\u201d she forecast.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re going to see, I hope, more conservative appointments of judges because, to me, that\u2019s the best achievement we\u2019ve had so far, is Neil Gorsuch. You\u2019re going to see more the successes we\u2019ve seen already. You\u2019re going to see more of that,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I really do believe that you\u2019re going to see a major legislative victory,\u201d McEnany added. \u201cPresident Trump already has had some. The Veteran Accountability Act, I would argue, is a very big one. But you\u2019re going to see a major legislative success. If it\u2019s tax reform, this economy is going to absolutely take off \u2013 in a way that it is already, but it\u2019s going to be robust.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.

aVAmerican health insurance giant Anthem announced on Monday that it will exit the Obamacare exchange in Nevada and will stop offering plans in roughly half of Georgia\u2019s counties next year.\u000a\u000aAnthem announced their withdrawals after Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and two other Republican senators tanked Obamacare repeal and as Obamacare continues to implode.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe health insurer stated that it will offer \u201ccatastrophic plans\u201d in which Americans under 30-years-old or low-income citizens can purchase outside of Nevada\u2019s exchange.\u000a\u000aAnthem said that the individual market remains \u201cvolatile.\u201d Anthem suggested in a statement that a deteriorating marketplace and uncertainty regarding the future of Obamacare fueled their exit from the state exchange.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday, planning and pricing for ACA-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance, including cost sharing reduction subsidies and the restoration of taxes on fully insured coverage,\u201d Anthem said.\u000a\u000aAnthem also revealed that they will only offer Obamacare plans in 85 of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties and also stated that they will continue to offer plans in rural counties that otherwise would not have health insurance.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month Anthem revealed that they will pull out of 16 of 19 regions in California in 2018.\u000a\u000aThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reported recently that next year 1,332 counties will only have one health insurer on the Obamacare exchanges. The CMS also reported that 40 counties currently do not have any health insurers on the Obamacare marketplaces.\u000a\u000aThe CMS estimated that average Obamacare marketplace insurance premiums increased by 21.6 percent between 2016 and 2017. The agency also suggested that the health insurer participation dropped by more than a third since its peak in 2015, two years after the Obamacare exchanges opened.\u000a\u000aAfter Sen. John McCain voted to keep Obamacare last week, President Donald Trump suggested that he should let Obamacare implode to force Democrats and Republicans to compromise on repealing and replacing Obamacare.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump took a populist turn recently, threatening to remove health insurance companies\u2019 subsidies and the congressional exemption from Obamacare.

aVOver the weekend, Google was rocked by the publication of an internal manifesto that alleged wide-ranging political bias within the company. In exclusive interviews with Breitbart News, more Google employees are now speaking out.\u000a\u000aThe 10-page manifesto, which was met by an immediate backlash, described a climate of fear at the company, in which employees who challenged prevailing leftist narratives on diversity were faced with immediate threats to their career.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBreitbart News is now exclusively publishing a series of interviews with Google employees who contacted us in the wake of the manifesto\u2019s publication to confirm its allegations.\u000a\u000aThe interview series, entitled \u201cRebels of Google,\u201d will be published in full over the coming days. Because every employee who spoke to us fears for their job if their identities were made public, we have provided aliases in place of their real names.\u000a\u000aIn the first interview of the series, a Google employee (alias \u201cHal\u201d) speaks of witch-hunts and intolerance at Google, as well as dysfunction at the company\u2019s upper echelons.\u000a\u000aHal began the interview with a statement about Google:\u000a\u000aHal: Witch hunts are a well-known cultural problem at Google. The company is currently facing a Federal complaint filed by the National Labor Relations Board in April for interfering with employees\u2019 legal right to discuss \u201cworkplace diversity and social justice initiatives.\u201d The complaint alleges that Senior Vice President Urs Holzle and numerous managers in his organization actively stoked up witch hunts in 2015 and 2016 intended to muzzle low-level employees who raised concerns about the company\u2019s practices. The trial is set for November.\u000a\u000aSeveral managers have openly admitted to keeping blacklists of the employees in question, and preventing them from seeking work at other companies. There have been numerous cases in which social justice activists coordinated attempts to sabotage other employees\u2019 performance reviews for expressing a different opinion. These have been raised to the Senior VP level, with no action taken whatsoever.\u000a\u000aAllum Bokhari: What\u2019s it like to work in such an environment? Do you think it damages employee output?\u000a\u000aHal: A lot of social justice activists essentially spend all day fighting the culture war, and get nothing done. The company has made it a point to hire more people like this. The diversity gospel has been woven into nearly everything the company does, to the point where senior leaders focus on diversity first and technology second. The companywide \u201cGoogle Insider\u201d emails used to talk about cool new tech, but now they\u2019re entirely about social justice initiatives. Likewise, the weekly all-hands \u201cTGIF\u201d meetings used to focus on tech, but now they\u2019re split about 50/50 between tech and identity politics signaling.\u000a\u000aFor conservative employees, this is obviously demoralizing, but it is also dangerous. Several have been driven out of the company or fired outright for sharing a dissenting view. Others have had their promotions denied or suffered other forms of deniable retaliation. Most of us just keep our heads down because we can\u2019t afford to lose our jobs.\u000a\u000aAB: Have there been any stand-out moments of intolerance at Google? Anything that particularly sticks in your memory?\u000a\u000aHal: There have been a number of massive witch hunts where hundreds of SJWs mobilize across the corporate intranet to punish somebody who defied the Narrative. The first one I remember is when Kelly Ellis made unfounded allegations of sexual harassment against her former manager, and Google terminated the manager in response to the internal SJW outrage. This was similar in intensity to the current witch hunt. Anyone who sympathized with the manager\u2019s plight or asked for any sort of due process was \u201ccounseled\u201d by HR and told that they were creating a hostile workplace for women and minorities by sticking up for a harasser.\u000a\u000aIn another witch hunt, an employee raised concerns that the affirmative action policy (which gives strong preference to women and minorities) could be seen as discriminating against white males. SJWs trawled through his ancient posting history from four years prior, found a stray comment to take out of context, and burned him at the stake for it.\u000a\u000aAB: Have you heard similar stories from people in other tech companies?\u000a\u000aHal: I have heard two similar stories from Facebook.\u000a\u000aAB: Do you fear for your job?\u000a\u000aHal: I didn\u2019t even write the document, but I always fear for my job and operate with the expectation that I will be purged unless something changes. Talking to reporters is incredibly dangerous on its own, much less talking to Breitbart. And the tolerance for \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d keeps getting lower, to the point where everybody is walking on eggshells because they don\u2019t want to be publicly shamed in next week\u2019s Yes-At-Google.\u000a\u000aAB: Your concerns about intolerance towards employees at Google mirror the concerns of ordinary web users about intolerance towards them. Many people now fear that Google, Facebook, and other companies are moving to control and censor their content. Are these fears justified?\u000a\u000aHal: That is absolutely what Google is trying to do. The pro-censorship voices are very loud, and they have the management\u2019s ear. The anti-censorship people are afraid of retaliation, and people are afraid to openly support them because everyone in their management chain is constantly signaling their allegiance to far-left ideology. Our leadership (Sundar in particular) is weak, so he capitulates to the meanest bullies on the block.\u000a\u000aThis article is part of the \u201cRebels of Google\u201d series.\u000a\u000aYou can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter, Gab.ai and add him on Facebook.

aVA South Bay couple bought a street in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in San Francisco lined with $5 million mansions \u2014 for a mere $90,000 at a tax lien auction two years ago.\u000a\u000aThe San Francisco Chronicle reports that the couple may have scored San Francisco\u2019s best real estate bargain of the century:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTina Lam and Michael Cheng snatched up Presidio Terrace \u2014 the block-long, private oval street lined by 35 megamillion-dollar mansions \u2014 for $90,000 and change in a city-run auction stemming from an unpaid tax bill. They outlasted several other bidders. Now they\u2019re looking to cash in \u2014 maybe by charging the residents of those mansions to park on their own private street. Those residents value their privacy \u2014 and their exclusivity. Past homeowners have included Sen. Dianne Feinstein and\u2026House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi\u2026\u000a\u000aThe couple now owns and controls not only the street itself, but also the sidewalks and all the common areas, which include the lawn between the sidewalk and street, all the little \u201cgarden islands,\u201dand palm trees.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe just got lucky,\u201d Cheng, a real estate investor, told the Chronicle.\u000a\u000aThe homeowners have made it clear they aren\u2019t going to accept their new \u201clandlord\u201d without a fight.\u000a\u000aThe UK Daily Mail reports that the city is unlikely to act short of a court order, and insists it is not at fault for the taxpayers\u2019 negligence.\u000a\u000aAfter the homeowners \u2018association for Presidio Terrace failed to pay a $14-a-year property tax for three decades, the \u201ccity\u2019s tax office finally put the property up for sale at the cost of $994 in an online auction to regain unpaid back taxes, penalties and interest,\u201d Fox News reports.\u000a\u000aNow the association is suing the couple and the city, seeking an injunction on any future sale before the matter can be adjudicated \u2014 and they want the Board of Supervisors to reverse the sale.\u000a\u000aA number of news reports have noted that the tony neighborhood, which Sen.

aVThe City of Chicago is suing the federal government for its efforts to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws, calling the Department of Justice (DOJ) announcement that cities who harbor illegal aliens won\u2019t be eligible for federal grant funding an assault on their \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not let our police officers become political pawns in a debate,\u201d Emanuel, a Democrat, said at a news conference on Sunday, according to Reuters.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not let our residents have their fundamental rights isolated and violated,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cAnd Chicago will never relinquish our status as a welcoming city.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe federal lawsuit comes less than two weeks after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the U.S. Justice Department would bar cities from a certain grant program unless they allow immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and provide 48 hours\u2019 notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations,\u201d Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aOn July 25, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that state and local law enforcement would be notified about new requirements for receiving Byrne JAG grants to fund law enforcement-related programs.\u000a\u000a\u201cRecipients for FY 2017 will be notified of new conditions of their grants that will increase information sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement, ensuring that federal immigration authorities have the information they need to enforce immigration laws and keep our communities safe,\u201d the DOJ announcement said.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo-called \u2018sanctuary\u2019 policies make all of us less safe because they intentionally undermine our laws and protect illegal aliens who have committed crimes,\u201d Sessions said on the occasion of the notice.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese policies also encourage illegal immigration and even human trafficking by perpetuating the lie that in certain cities, illegal aliens can live outside the law,\u201d Sessions said.\u000a\u000aSessions said the policy \u201cis consistent with long-established cooperative principles among law enforcement agencies.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is what the American people should be able to expect from their cities and states, and these long overdue requirements will help us take down MS-13 and other violent transnational gangs, and make our country safer,\u201d Sessions said.\u000a\u000aIn March, Sessions announced the policy directed at states and cities that have adopted policies \u201cdesigned to frustrate the enforcement of our immigration laws.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis includes refusing to detain known felons under federal detainer requests, or otherwise failing to comply with these laws,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cFor example, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued a report showing that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe charges and convictions against these aliens include drug trafficking, hit and run, rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder,\u201d Sessions said, urging state and local jurisdictions to comply with federal law, specifically 8 U.S.C. Section 1373, in order to receive grants.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration\u2019s proposed budget requests $380 million in that funding for 2018, with Chicago slated to receive $3.2 million for equipment for law enforcement operations, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aJustice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement issued to the Associated Press on Sunday that the mayor should be focused on the \u201cstaggering\u201d statistics on homicide in Chicago.
