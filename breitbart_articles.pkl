VThe \u201cnegative heat\u201d that the legacy media and Hollywood continually direct at President Donald Trump may be helping him, according to MSNBC analyst Steve Kornacki, who pointed out that Trump is \u201ccentral\u201d to all of American popular culture unlike any other president before him.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you look on paper, the poll numbers are terrible. But the position Donald Trump occupies not just in the media landscape but in all of culture \u2026 he is central to all \u2026 of American popular culture\u2014he has been since before the election and he\u2019s gonna be as far out as we can see,\u201d he said on Thursday\u2019s MTP Daily. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had that with other presidents before.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHe added that there is \u201cso much negative heat coming in \u2026 from the media, from popular culture\u201d that \u201cit raises the question\u201d whether those who voted for Trump in 2016 even though they had low opinions of him did so as a reaction to the media and \u201call of culture pushing so hard against Trump.\u201d\u000a\u000aKornacki, the numbers-cruncher who is one of the left-wing network\u2019s more underrated personalities, added that Trump was so successful in the 2016 GOP primary because he was not a \u201cfactional\u201d candidate. He noted that Trump got \u201cbroad\u201d support from various \u201canti-establishment\u201d parts of the GOP coalition and not just from one narrow corner.\u000a\u000aLike Breitbart News has noted many times, guest-host Katy Tur wondered if Trump actually has \u201call the right enemies.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart News recently pointed out that Axios criticized Trump for having alienated in just seven months \u201cMitch McConnell (voters hate Congress), Democrats (the rudderless party is having a tough time winning elections at all levels), the media (their approval ratings are at near-record lows\u2014so why should virtue-signaling Republicans take their cues from an institution everyday Americans do not trust?), CEOs, world leaders (doesn\u2019t hurt Trump to be disliked by the \u201cParty of Davos\u201d), Europe, [radical] Muslims, [\u201csalad-bowl\u201d] Hispanics, [self-appointed leaders of] black Americans, military leaders and intelligence officials [many of whom support former President Barack Obama or the nation-building foreign policy of Allen\u2019s favored neoconservatives in the GOP establishment], his own staff [of globalists, Democrats, and establishment Republicans].\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt turns out Trump may be alienating mostly all of the right types of groups and people,\u201d Breitbart News wrote.\u000a\u000aKornacki and the panel also did not discuss that these polls may be off because of strong \u201csocial desirability bias,\u201d which is something Breitbart News, unlike nearly every other media outlet, thoroughly discussed during the 2016 election and was one of the reasons why Breitbart News covered the 2016 election better than any other outlet.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News has also pointed out how Trump\u2019s celebrity helped him during the 2016 campaign and was the reason why the Access Hollywood tape, which \u201cwould have been devastating for a conventional politician,\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cfatal\u201d for Trump:\u000a\u000aBecause of his success on reality television, Trump understood how to be a politician in the reality-tv era just like Ronald Reagan\u2019s past as an actor allowed Reagan, with Michael Deaver\u2019s help, to master being a candidate and president in the broadcast television era. In addition, because Trump played everybody\u2019s favorite boardroom executive on The Apprentice, regular Americans already envisioned him as president just like 24\u2019s fictional black American president David Palmer allowed voters to see a black man as president. \u2026 Trump\u2019s over-the-top reality star personality may have ameliorated the fallout from his infamous Access Hollywood tape in which he talked about grabbing women by their private parts. What would have been devastating for a conventional politician wasn\u2019t fatal for Trump because the \u201coutrageous factor\u201d was already baked into the cake when voters were considering whether to vote for him.\u000a\u000a(Photo Credit: Joel Pollak/Breitbart News)

aVFacebook is hosting people smuggling advertisements, with gangs offering to take migrants to Europe and America, make them fake passports, and traffic them across the European Union (EU).\u000a\u000aA large number of public posts exist on the platform, often in Arabic, offering to take migrants across the Mediterranean by boat for up to $5,000 per person.

Conversations where potential migrants negotiate with people smugglers were clearly visible.\u000a\u000aOne page, called \u201cImmigration\u201d in Arabic, offers passports and \u201cdirect flights from Turkey to Germany\u201d for as little as $250, claiming their option is \u201caway from smuggling, fraud, fraud, and risking your life\u201d.\u000a\u000aThey even have a \u201cshop\u201d section, offering package deals to Canada and Greece with a passport. \u201cYou can travel to any European country you want and you will not have a fingerprint meaning you can offer asylum\u201d, the admin added in a comment.\u000a\u000aIn other groups, potential migrants share tips and advice on how to be \u201csmuggled\u201d into Europe, Canada and the U.S., apply for asylum, and obtain papers there.\u000a\u000aIn the \u201cWays to migrate to Europe\u201d group, one man enquired: \u201cPeace be upon you. Can I get a tourist visa for Germany or France from Baghdad?\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother man offered advice on how to enter the Spanish enclave of Melilla (\u201ctry to enter the ships by hiding in trucks and buses\u201d) as well as Jet Ski rides to Spain from Africa. \u201cFor more send friend request,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aA video was even posted of men dropping migrants off in Spain on a Jet Ski, with people responding and asking for prices.\u000a\u000aAnother man advertised trips all over Europe, including from Ukraine to Sweden, offering discount prices and his phone number. \u201cPossible price from Turkey to Italy?\u201d asked one man. \u201cDetails of the wild road link between Athens and Turkey if possible?\u201d replied another.\u000a\u000aAnother Facebook page, a group called \u201cImmigration and seeking asylum without using smugglers\u201d, also features multiple adverts from smugglers despite the name.\u000a\u000aChildren aged from 2 to 11 are frequently offered half-price deals for the cheaper but dangerous inflatable rubber boat options, with infants sometimes traveling for free.\u000a\u000aOther post advise migrants to attempt to obtain bogus student visas or Argentinian and South American passports, as they claim it is easier to migrate to Europe from these parts of the world.\u000a\u000aEconomic migrants crossing the Mediterranean, who have no right to be in the EU, have a 73 per cent chance they will be permitted to stay, official figure show.\u000a\u000aSince the beginning of the migrant crisis, there has been a surge of migrants from relatively safe nations, overtaking those from war-torn nations such as Syria.\u000a\u000aNorth Africa, and Libya, in particular, is now the main departure point after the EU agreed on a deal with Turkey to send migrants arriving in Greece back to Turkey.\u000a\u000aItaly has become the main arrival point, with Spain becoming increasingly popular, such that is likely to attract more sea-arrivals this year than Greece.

aVDespite the chaos that consumed Evergreen State College earlier this year, administrators are refusing to properly arm campus law enforcement.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have handguns; we do not have rifles\u2026We are the only state university that does not have rifles for active shooter situations,\u201d then-Chief Officer of Evergreen State College Stacy Brown said during a hearing on June 20.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBrown resigned at the beginning of August, citing concerns over the administration\u2019s refusal to allow campus officers to carry rifles for active shooter situations. Brown maintains that the administration\u2019s refusal to properly arm campus officers was not a matter of funding, but due to a \u201cphilosophical discrepancy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am really just trying to move on with my life in a positive manner, after having gone through such a rough period for the last 10 months,\u201d Brown told The College Fix, expressing her frustrations with the Evergreen administration.\u000a\u000aIn a 2013 interview, current interim police chief Ed Sorger argued that the Evergreen department could greatly benefit from assault rifles. \u201cYour chances of stopping that kind of event are much greater [with assault rifles]. We want to give the best service we can to the community,\u201d Sorger said at the time.\u000a\u000aOther universities in the state of Washington equip their campus police forces with rifles for the very purpose of handling active shooter situations.

Lee\u2019s statue were all white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK.\u000a\u000a\u201cCitizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aCohn defended his decision to stay in his job, despite pressure from his friends and colleagues to resign in protest.\u000a\u000a\u201cI feel a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also feel compelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohn insisted that by staying in his job in the White House, he was fighting white supremacists.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 to cause this Jew to leave his job,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aCohn \u201cseriously considered resigning,\u201d according to the New York Times, in response to Trump\u2019s Charlottesville comments and drafted a letter of resignation. \u201cSources close to\u201d Cohn floated quotes on background to the media noting that he was \u201cdisgusted and deeply upset\u201d with the president.

aVThe Inspector General for Tax Administration has discovered that under Commissioner John Koskinen, the Internal Revenue Service re-hired 212 employees it had previously fired for offenses including tax evasion, theft, and abuse of taxpayer data.\u000a\u000aThe title of the report makes it clear that the IRS \u201ccontinues to rehire former employees with conduct and performance issues.\u201d The inspection was requested by a U.S. Senator, who is not named in the report, although Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) introduced legislation to block the agency from rehiring such employees shortly after the report was released.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether it is the rehiring of previously terminated employees or continuing to give bonuses to poorly performing executives who can\u2019t be fired \u2013 the delinquency at the IRS must end,\u201d Burr declared. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly actions like this that erode the public\u2019s trust in their government. The American people are sick and tired of Washington at its worst. We have Americans paying the salaries of IRS workers who have repeatedly cheated the very government they took an oath to serve, and a Commissioner who won\u2019t fire bad actors. The time to put a stop to these atrocious practices is now.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs noted in a FedSmith report on Burr\u2019s legislation, this is actually the second time he has attempted to block the IRS from restoring employees it fired for serious offenses. His effort last year was prompted by an Inspector General report very similar to this one. On that previous occasion, Burr noted that one of the employees re-hired by IRS literally had \u201cDO NOT REHIRE\u201d stamped on his or her personnel file.\u000a\u000aThe office of the Inspector General (TIGTA) is painfully aware that little improvement has occurred since last year\u2019s report. In fact, the new publication notes with dismay that \u201cnearly 300 of the 824 employees identified in the prior report were still employed by the IRS as of May 2016.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso, TIGTA notes that IRS is already required by federal law to consider prior conduct issues when rehiring terminated employees, under the IRS Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. Evidently that law is simply ignored, or rendered null and void by inept employment procedures.\u000a\u000aThe new report describes bureaucratic buffoonery that would be amusing, if the money and sensitive data of American taxpayers were not on the line. For example, IRS has an extensive \u201cALERTS\u201d database filled with records of employee misconduct\u2026 but the people who actually make hiring decisions do not have access to it. A few dozen of the problematic rehired personnel were able to evade IRS employment screening by simply forgetting to mention they were previously terminated for cause by the agency.\u000a\u000aTwo employees who couldn\u2019t make the grade as tax examining technicians were rehired for the same position less than six months later, on the grounds that the job requirements had changed.\u000a\u000aRobert Wood at Forbes tallies up the other offenses: \u201cFour of the more than 200 employees had been terminated or resigned for willful failure to properly file their Federal tax returns; four separated while under investigation for unauthorized accesses to taxpayer information; and 86 separated while under investigation for absences and leave, workplace disruption, or failure to follow instructions.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne rehired employee had a legal record that included misdemeanor theft and felony possession of a forgery device. The Treasury Department normally frowns on that sort of thing.\u000a\u000aThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s Daily Signal chalks up the report as more evidence that President Trump should fire IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who has been strongly criticized by Republicans ever since the dawn of the Tea Party targeting scandal.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe average American is not happy with the way the IRS behaves on a good day. It\u2019s disappointing that they are rehiring people who were fired for very bad behavior,\u201d Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist told the Daily Signal. He complained that the difficulty of getting past civil service and union protections to fire bad federal employees \u201cmakes my head hurt.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorquist threw in a little free advice for President Trump, noting that if he doesn\u2019t fire Koskinen soon, the IRS Commissioner might make some public statement about Trump\u2019s taxes that would make it politically impossible for the president to fire him a repeat performance of the James Comey fiasco.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know why President Trump hasn\u2019t fired John Koskinen since there is more evidence the agency is mismanaged,\u201d agreed Peter Flaherty of the National Legal and Policy Center. \u201cKoskinen is a very typical Washington creature and is very at home in the swamp. It\u2019s a puzzle to me why Trump hasn\u2019t acted.\u201d\u000a\u000aThus far the response from the IRS has consisted of boilerplate assurances that it will \u201ctake all steps allowable to prevent the rehiring of former employees with conduct and performance issues,\u201d which would sound less risible if the same problem had not been identified in last year\u2019s TIGTA report. Internal Revenue Service spokespeople should at least do taxpayers the courtesy of pinky-swearing that they\u2019ll do better this time.

aVOn Friday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In,\u201d Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell argued President Trump\u2019s pardon of former Maricopa County, AZ Sheriff Joe Arpaio (R) is an attack on the Constitution and the independence of the judiciary.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aRampell said, \u201cIf there was any doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that law and order was code for making it easier to harass people of color, this is confirmation. I would also point out that this is a direct attack on our Constitution and on the independence of our federal judiciary. You remember, there was a lot of concern during the campaign about the fact that he attacked a judge of Mexican descent, Judge Curiel, right? \u2026 This is so much worse. Because the crime that he is being pardoned for is effectively not following the Constitution. Because a judge determined what his officers were doing was harassment, was discrimination. He refused the court\u2019s order. And this is Trump saying to the public, \u2018You know what, I agree. We shouldn\u2019t listen to what judges say.'\u201d\u000a\u000aFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

aVU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s strategy to end the war in Afghanistan is \u201cdetermined\u201d to pressure the Taliban into reconciliation and a political settlement with the Kabul government by making the jihadists realize they cannot win, declared the top American commander in the war-ravaged country, echoing the State Department and the Pentagon.\u000a\u000aDespite Afghan President Ashraf Ghani saying peace talks between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Taliban were within reach in early 2015, there has been no discernible progress in negotiations with the terrorist group, which has refused to participate in talks with Kabul because it is winning the war.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aNevertheless, the U.S. military, State, and the Pentagon as a whole have recently indicated that Trump\u2019s new Afghanistan strategy is focused on bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table to discuss peace and reconciliation with the Afghan government.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are determined to pursue the goal of a political settlement. As these terrorist groups realize that they cannot win, they will see that their best option is to pursue peace,\u201d American Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, told reporters in Afghanistan during a joint press conference with the U.S. ambassador in the country.\u000a\u000aGen. Nicholson urged the Taliban to \u201cstop fighting against your countrymen. Stop killing innocent civilians. Stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis remarks are consistent with how U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has described Trump\u2019s newly unveiled Afghan strategy \u2014 as an effort to convince the Taliban to negotiate peace with the Afghan government.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are there to facilitate and ensure that there is a pathway for reconciliation and peace talks,\u201d declared Tillerson. \u201cAs the pressure begins to take hold, we believe we already know there are certain moderate elements of the Taliban who we think will be ready and develop a way forward.\u201d\u000a\u000aTillerson acknowledged that the negotiation effort would take time.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is time to begin a process, a lengthy process, of reconciliation and a peace accord in Afghanistan,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cHow long that will take will be based on conditions on the ground.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s South Asia strategy is intended to pressure the Taliban to accept that they \u201cwill not win a battlefield victory,\u201d also said the secretary of state, directly addressing the jihadists and saying, \u201cWe may not win one, but neither will you.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Pentagon recently indicated that Trump\u2019s plan would push for a peace agreement with the Taliban.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur main objective is to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a safe haven for terrorists to attack the United States and our allies,\u201d Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman, recently told Breitbart News. \u201cThe United States will support the Afghan government and security forces in their fight against Taliban, al-Qaeda, ISIS [Islamic State], and other insurgents and prevent re-establishment of international terrorist safe havens in the country. We will maintain pressure on the Taliban to join a peace process with the Afghan government to end the war in Afghanistan.\u201d\u000a\u000aTaliban jihadists are believed to control or contest about 40 percent of Afghanistan, according to a watchdog agency.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Gen. Nicholson argued that peace negotiations are in the best interest of the Taliban.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the rank and file, the Taliban\u2019s losses are even greater than the losses of the Afghan Security Forces. This is unsustainable. The Taliban are a criminal organization, more interested in the profits they find in drugs, kidnapping, and murder for hire than offering anything better to the Afghan people,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe U.S.-backed Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP), considered the only institutional mechanism within the Afghan government with the capability to pursue both high-level reconciliation negotiations and provincial-level reintegration of terrorists, closed its doors last year due to a lack of progress, despite the tens of millions the United States wasted on the effort.\u000a\u000aBetween the program\u2019s creation in 2010 and 2014, over 9,000 terrorists were reintegrated into Afghan society, at a cost of about $35,000 each, with the United States bearing most of the burden.\u000a\u000aCurrently, the Trump administration is preparing to launch a successor to the APRP \u2014 a five-year Afghanistan National Peace and Reconciliation (ANPR) strategy, reported the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency.\u000a\u000a\u201cAccording to [the] State [Department], the ANPR is expected to shift from the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration focus of the APRP to negotiating political settlements with armed opposition groups, forging national and international consensus on a peace process, and promoting and institutionalizing a culture of peace,\u201d explained SIGAR.\u000a\u000aIn announcing his Afghan strategy Monday, President Trump promised a military \u201cvictory\u201d to the American people.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge,\u201d said the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not nation-building again,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are killing terrorists.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe United States has invested about $714 billion in Afghanistan since the war started in October 2001, including an estimated $120 billion on reconstruction efforts alone, dubbed \u201cnation-building\u201d by some critics.\u000a\u000aNicholson \u201crejected criticism that the new military strategy would echo previous U.S. policies that did not make significant headway, even with more than 100,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan at one time,\u201d reports the Washington Post (WaPo).\u000a\u000aHe praised the shift from U.S. strategy of support based on \u201carbitrary timelines\u201d to one \u201cguided by conditions\u201d on the ground, noting, \u201cYou can believe it will be different because we removed the calendar from the equation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military and the Trump administration have been silent about how many additional American troops will deploy to Afghanistan as part of the new strategy.

Wachter replaces Risa Heller Communications and his firm specializes in crisis management, litigation, and government investigations as well as other matters, according to Bloomberg. As of Thursday, Wachter\u2019s name is listed as the press contact on the firm\u2019s official website.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aKushner has stepped down from the business and sold his personal stake in the company, but the firm has remained in the spotlight due to its connection to the president\u2019s senior adviser.\u000a\u000aBloomberg noted that the move comes shortly after Kushner testified behind closed doors to Senate and House committees about alleged ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Senate Democrats have asked about a meeting Kushner had during the transition with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov, and whether the business was discussed in that meeting.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported in June that Kushner\u2019s business dealings were a topic of interest for FBI special counsel Robert Mueller as he investigates allegations of Russian interference.\u000a\u000aHowever, Politico reported that it was Risa Heller, a Democratic operative who used to work for Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who made the decision to drop the firm as the work became increasingly related to politics. The outlet reported that the decision arose amid the outrage surrounding Trump\u2019s response to the protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aKushner Companies has also come under heavy scrutiny for its use of an immigration-for-investment scheme and for promoting the scheme to Chinese investors earlier this year.\u000a\u000aThe business was reportedly subpoenaed in May in relation to a development, One Journal Square, that was financed by a visa program known as EB-5. That program offers green cards to potential immigrants as long as they \u201cMake the necessary investment in a commercial enterprise in the United States; and plan to create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for qualified U.S. workers.\u201d\u000a\u000aKushner\u2019s sister, Nicole Kushner Meyer, made a pitch to Chinese investors in May for the project and an ad for the event said, \u201cInvest $500,000 and immigrate to the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Kushner family later apologized for mentioning its connection to the Trump administration in the pitch.\u000a\u000aAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

aVPARIS (AP) \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office has confirmed a report that the French leader spent 26,000 euros ($30,695) on makeup during his first three months in power, and says it\u2019s trying to find a cheaper alternative.\u000a\u000aThe report in Le Point news magazine prompted harsh criticism of the president from French social media users. It said the cost includes the pay of a freelance makeup artist following Macron during television appearances and trips abroad.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s office confirmed the amount Friday. The report comes at a bad time for Macron, with polls showing his popularity plunging in recent weeks following the announcement of budget cuts and divisive labor reform.\u000a\u000aLe Point said Macron\u2019s makeup expenses are lower than those of predecessor Francois Hollande, who paid a full-time employee about 10,000 euros monthly.

aV\u201cAmerican liberalism in the twenty-first century is in crisis,\u201d writes Columbia University Professor Mark Lilla, due in no small part to its embrace of a \u201cdisastrous\u201d identity politics that divides instead of uniting.\u000a\u000aIn his newly released book, The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics, Lilla, a self-described \u201cfrustrated American liberal,\u201d decries the implosion of the Democratic Party and liberalism itself, brought on by a growing disconnect from middle America and the inability to paint a compelling vision for the future.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLilla\u2019s new work expands upon \u201cThe End of Identity Liberalism,\u201d an essay he wrote shortly after last November\u2019s Presidential election. In it, he urged fellow liberals to face up to their party\u2019s share in responsibility for Trump\u2019s victory, which Lilla attributed to the rise \u201cidentity liberalism.\u201d\u000a\u000aLiberalism, Lilla contends in his book, is rightly considered by many \u201cas a creed professed mainly by educated urban elites cut off from the rest of the country who see the issues of the day principally through the lens of identities.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe core of their error, Lilla suggests, is that Democrats have thrown themselves headlong into identity politics, focusing on what divides rather than what unites. As a result, many feel alienated from a party that once knew how to bring people together.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe majority of Americans have made it abundantly clear that they no longer respond to whatever larger message we have been conveying over the past decades,\u201d he writes.\u000a\u000aContra the opinion of many of his colleagues, Lilla says that the source of conservatives\u2019 strength has been \u201cnot money, not false advertising, not fear-mongering, not racism\u201d but rather a shared image for America\u2019s future, which\u2014he claims\u2014the Democrats have been unable to produce.\u000a\u000aThe liberal vision, on the other hand, which earlier centered on shared values that bind the nation together, eventually gave way to \u201ca pseudo-politics of self-regard and increasingly narrow and exclusionary self-definition that is now cultivated in our colleges and universities,\u201d he writes.\u000a\u000aSo rather than expounding a common vision for the future, Democrats have embraced a divisive vision of fragmentation, trying desperately to please an unending series of special interest groups who see themselves as victims requiring special attention.\u000a\u000aDemocrats therefore no longer appeal to Americans, he argues, but rather to \u201cwomen, Hispanics, \u2018ethnic Americans,\u2019 the LGBT community, Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe reaction of liberals to Lilla\u2019s book has been overwhelmingly negative, which may simply suggest how deeply the rot of identity politics has penetrated his political comrades in arms.\u000a\u000aPredictably, the New York Times finds Lilla\u2019s analysis thoroughly distasteful, and published a review by Yale University History Professor Beverly Gage that dismissed Lilla\u2019s critique as \u201ctrolling disguised as erudition.\u201d\u000a\u000aWriting in The Los Angeles Review of Books, Columbia law professor Katherine Franke went further still, comparing Lilla to David Duke, the former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.\u000a\u000aWhile Lilla may have effectively put his finger on the key problem undermining the modern Democrat project, there is little sign that his message will garner any support from the guardians of liberal orthodoxy.\u000a\u000aFollow Thomas D.

aVThe West Wing is leaking like a sieve again, this time with details pouring out of the White House into the press about how the new command and control structure is attempting to contain and manage President Donald Trump. But it does not appear they will be successful.\u000a\u000aThe main goal, per many White House leaks across the media, appears to be senior staff controlling what information and reports make it to President Trump\u2014and tamping down who the president talks to and who has access to the president.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs and Margaret Talev wrote on Thursday:\u000a\u000aSince retired Marine Corps General John Kelly started as White House chief of staff last month, President Donald Trump has added a routine caveat before approving proposals advisers place before him: Check with \u2018The General\u2019 before moving ahead. It\u2019s a marked departure from Trump\u2019s instinct to manage around Kelly\u2019s predecessor, Reince Priebus. When making a decision, one aide recalls, Trump often would caution, \u2018Don\u2019t tell Reince.\u2019 Trump\u2019s appointment of Kelly has imposed new order on a White House that had been riven with infighting among warring camps. But it hasn\u2019t been the political lifeline Republican allies had hoped for, as Kelly has so far been unable to perform one of the chief of staff\u2019s most basic duties: to stop a president from following his worst instincts.\u000a\u000aThe Bloomberg piece is hardly the only one in media about new structures in the latest round of West Wing leaks pouring out of the White House.\u000a\u000aAug. 16, the Washington Post\u2019s Ashley Parker and Bob Costa reported that Kelly has instituted a new structure for communication with the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly routes all calls to and from President Trump through the White House switchboard, where he can sign off on them,\u201d Parker and Costa wrote. \u201cHe stanches the flow of information reaching the president\u2019s desk. And he requires that all staff members \u2014 including Trump\u2019s relatives \u2014 go through him to reach the president.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver at Politico on Thursday, Eliana Johnson and Nancy Cook got even more leaked details about the new structure Kelly is implementing. Johnson and Cook wrote:\u000a\u000aConfronted with a West Wing that treated policymaking as a free-for-all, President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John Kelly, is instituting a system used by previous administrations to limit internal competition \u2014 and to make himself the last word on the material that crosses the president\u2019s deskIt\u2019s a quiet effort to make Trump conform to White House decision-making norms he\u2019s flouted without making him feel shackled or out of the loop. In a conference call last week, Kelly initiated a new policymaking process in which just he and one other aide \u2014 White House staff secretary Rob Porter, a little-known but highly regarded Rhodes scholar who overlapped with Jared Kushner as an undergraduate at Harvard \u2014 will review all documents that cross the Resolute desk.\u000a\u000aAll of this comes amid a Democrat takeover of the West Wing, with Republicans being pushed out of the White House. National Security Adviser and three-star Army Gen. H.R. McMaster purged a number of Trump-backing Republicans from the National Security Council, while ex-Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman and now former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus was replaced by retired four-star Marine Gen. John Kelly, the old Secretary of Homeland Security. Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, and his wife Ivanka Trump\u2014as well as National Economic Council director Gary Cohn\u2014have all seen a rise in prominence in the West Wing. They\u2014McMaster, Kelly, Ivanka Trump, Kushner, and Cohn\u2014are all Democrats.\u000a\u000aIn addition to controlling information flow to and from the president\u2014and who communicates with him\u2014the West Wing Democrats have aimed to force Trump to stick to pre-scripted remarks on the TelePrompTer whenever he gives speeches. They have not succeeded on that front, as Trump went on a 45-minute off-script tirade against the media, the left, the GOP establishment, and more during a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, this week.\u000a\u000aSeveral people close to the president tell Breitbart News that while he is for now mostly following along with what Kelly and the others want him to do, people should not expect this to last.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose in the Administration who think they can shackle the President are in for a rude awakening,\u201d one White House aide told Breitbart News. \u201cUnlike so many other political \u2018plastic men,\u2019 he\u2019s not a pre-programmed bot, he thinks for himself and makes his own decisions.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe White House communications office did not comment for this piece to Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aBut, the crackdown in process by the West Wing Democrats is much broader than just what happens with the president. \u201cSince taking over for Priebus last month, Kelly has sought to crack down not just on sneakiness and backbiting but also to impose order more broadly,\u201d Johnson and Cook wrote in Politico. \u201cHe has tasked deputy chiefs of staff Rick Dearborn and Joe Hagin with bringing some order to the president\u2019s schedule, pushing them to plan events further in advance and to include one public-facing event each day and one travel event each week, according to a senior White House aide. He is also reworking what were once free-flowing White House meetings. Each one now includes a list of attendees to prevent aides from inserting themselves gratuitously where Kelly does not want them.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Bloomberg, Jacobs and Talev quoted, \u201cinterviews with 14 current and former administration officials, congressional Republicans and people close to Trump and Kelly\u201d most of whom, they say, \u201ccredited Kelly with imposing new processes and restrictions that have limited freelancing, drama, leaking and backbiting among staff.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cKelly has implored Trump repeatedly to stay on script, emphasizing the importance of being precise and sensitive to the constituencies hearing his words,\u201d Talev and Jacobs wrote. \u201cThe president did stick to the text in his speech Monday night on his approach to Afghanistan. Beforehand, Kelly had emphasized the magnitude and somber nature of sending more young men and women into war.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Trump has pushed off script many times too, something that tests the patience of his staff. His decision to re-litigate his Charlottesville response at a press conference in Trump Tower in New York City last week sparked Cohn to write a resignation letter, and go on record in the press bashing President Trump and the administration in an interview with the Financial Times.\u000a\u000aCohn met w Trump Friday in NJ, per multiple sources. He had even drafted a resignation letter, per those sources https://t.co/GYGhilRf5X \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aAccording to Politico\u2019s Anne Karni and Ben White, McMaster and Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell\u2014who worked with Cohn at Goldman Sachs\u2014leaked that they were upset with the president\u2019s Charlottesville response too. But Politico wrote that McMaster and Powell, unlike Cohn, were not thinking about resigning as of yet.\u000a\u000a\u201cNational security adviser H.R. McMaster and his deputy, Dina Powell, have been unhappy with Trump\u2019s rhetoric on race over the past week, according to a White House official,\u201d Karni and White wrote. \u201cBut neither of them is considering resigning \u2014 they have told people it is too serious and dangerous a moment in the world for them to simply walk away.\u201d\u000a\u000aSimilarly, leaks came out that West Wing aides were not happy with Trump\u2019s Phoenix speech\u2014to the point the president even tweeted out his explanation for different styles of speeches.\u000a\u000aOverall, efforts to contain and control Trump are likely to fail, said one source close with the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery person who is trying to control Donald Trump and not let him be the person that he is has failed in their roles,\u201d an associate of many senior White House officials and a close friend of the president told Breitbart News. \u201cThe establishment and elitists continue to think they are smarter than Trump. However, he has proven them wrong time and time again.\u201d

aV\u201cScience Guy\u201d Bill Nye filed a lawsuit against the Walt Disney Company and several of its subsidiaries Thursday over claims the House of Mouse withheld millions of dollars in profits from his popular 1990s children\u2019s television show.\u000a\u000aIn a lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Nye claimed that Disney underpaid him by at least $9 million in royalties for his popular PBS show, Bill Nye the Science Guy, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cPlaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that as a direct and proximate result of the Defendants\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the amount of not less than Nine Million Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Five Hundred Sixty dollars (USD$9,350,565.00), the final amount to be proven at trial,\u201d the 28-page lawsuit reads.\u000a\u000aNye further alleged that in addition to the money he claimed not to have received as part of his profit-share on the series, Disney and its subsidiaries \u201cenriched\u201d themselves with \u201cill-gotten profits\u201d of at least $28 million.\u000a\u000aDisney subsidiaries ABC, Buena Vista Television, and Touchstone are also named in the suit.\u000a\u000aNye reportedly received a royalty check from Buena Vista Television in 2008 in the amount of $585,123. But due to an \u201caccounting error,\u201d the company reportedly asked him to return $496,111.\u000a\u000aThat reportedly led the TV host to request an audit of Disney\u2019s financial agreements surrounding the series, which aired on PBS between 1993 and 1998. But Disney allegedly told Nye that the company was backlogged with audit requests and he would need to wait several years before the request could be accommodated. Nye then alleged that once the books were opened, his accountants found several discrepancies between what he had been paid and what he was owed.\u000a\u000aThe complaint calls Disney\u2019s actions an \u201congoing, deliberate conspiracy to decive Mr. Nye and the BNSG Owners\u201d out of what it claims is his rightful profits.\u000a\u000aAfter a years-long hiatus from television, the 61-year-old host recently returned to screens with the Netflix series Bill Nye Saves the World, which was recently renewed for a second season.

aVWhile the U.S. could send as many as 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan, NATO members are considering sending less than half of that, according to several officials.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has approved sending up to 3,900 U.S. forces to implement the new strategy, but NATO members have so far pledged between 1,000 to 2,000, according to a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cRoughly, yes, that is,\u201d said Swedish Royal Navy Capt. Jon Dunmurray, when asked if that was the ballpark figure. \u201c[It\u2019s] something in that area.\u201d A U.S. official in Afghanistan confirmed that discussions have been in that range.\u000a\u000aAny new NATO forces would not likely arrive until 2018, Dunmurray said. Meanwhile, more U.S. forces are expected within weeks, the U.S. official said.\u000a\u000aNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday said the alliance and other nations contribute about half of the forces for the mission to advise-and-assist Afghan forces and that he expected that to continue.\u000a\u000aCurrently, the numbers on paper do show rough parity between U.S. and other coalition members for that mission, which is led by the U.S. but under the auspices of NATO.\u000a\u000aAccording to the latest statistics from May, there were 6,941 U.S. forces, and 6,635 non-U.S. coalition forces part of the joint mission \u2014 with 4,980 of that specifically from NATO members and the rest from non-NATO partner forces.\u000a\u000aBut according to a U.S. official, the number of actual NATO bodies on the ground is much lower \u2014 \u201ccloser to 4,000.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn June, about 15 of 29 NATO members offered to send \u201cseveral hundred\u201d more forces to Afghanistan \u2014 but just to fulfill current unmet obligations, according to the Wall Street Journal.\u000a\u000aDefense Secretary James Mattis alluded to this gap when he visited Brussels in June. \u201cWe still have a few gaps and nations are stepping up,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aEven if the gap is closed, and somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 more NATO forces are deployed, that would leave the alliance far below what the U.S. is expected to deploy.\u000a\u000aThere are currently 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan \u2014 about 7,000 part of the NATO advise-and-assist mission and 1,400 part of a counterterrorism mission.\u000a\u000aWith as many as 4,000 more forces deploying, and another 3,500 who are deployed on a temporary basis as recently revealed by the WSJ, the grand total of U.S. troops on the ground could be around 16,000.\u000a\u000aDunmurray said some NATO and partner nations have not decided yet whether to send more forces and that some new nations may join the 39-nation coalition in Afghanistan in the near future.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump unveiled his plan on Monday, weeks after it was expected, and Mattis was expected to talk with the NATO chief in the coming days after the announcement.\u000a\u000aSome doubt NATO will even send between 1,000 to 2,000 forces for the new plan.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would surprise me if they upheld that minimal commitment,\u201d said Nicholas L. Waddy, associate professor of History at the State University of New York at Albany.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe simple fact of the matter is most other NATO military forces are chronically underfunded, so they\u2019re literally incapable of mounting military operations, especially projecting power overseas, so unfortunately it was to be expected that we would carry most of the burden,\u201d said Waddy.\u000a\u000aTrump made calling on NATO to spend more on their own defense a part of his campaign platform. He called on members to meet the alliance obligation of spending at least 2 percent of GDP on their own defense. Only five members meet that commitment.\u000a\u000aThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s James Carafano, who worked on Trump\u2019s transition team, defended NATO, saying they were waiting to hear from the U.S. what the plan was before committing troops.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think largely what they\u2019ve been really waiting for for the last six months is a clear sign of direction from the United States,\u201d said Carafano, E.W. Richardson Fellow and vice president for the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy.\u000a\u000aHe also said it wasn\u2019t realistic to ask NATO to do much more. \u201cWe all have a common interest to do this and other people need to step up, but they need to step up realistically in their capability,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBut Waddy also thinks it\u2019s a matter of political will to build up that capability.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have the resources, they have money, they have the people, they have the technology, they just don\u2019t have the will,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s bothered many Americans for a long time.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Center for the National Interest\u2019s Director of Defense Studies Harry Kazianis said NATO could play a bigger counterterrorism role in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to make sure another 9/11 does not get planned from this war-torn nation. And NATO should play a big role in that,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think a small, rapid reaction style force from NATO that is capable of targeting and attacking terrorists cells in Afghanistan makes a lot of sense.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt also dovetails nicely with Trump\u2019s promise to the American people to ask more from our allies\u2014they have a big interest in making sure Afghanistan is stable and taking on some of the burden.\u201d

Holder told Yahoo News: \u201cThere\u2019s a justified perception that I\u2019m close to President Obama. So, I want to use whatever skills I have, whatever notoriety I have, to be effective in opposing things that are, at the end of the day, just bad for the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aUber\u2019s investors claim that they wanted a mass culture change to protect the company\u2019s $62.5 billion valuation. Audra Diers-Lawson, a professor of public relations strategy at Leeds Beckett University, told the liberal Atlantic that Uber needed fundamental change. She stated that Uber\u2019s CEO represented \u201ca reputational cancer that could have been cut away \u2014 but that the cancer has infected the rest of the body.\u201d\u000a\u000aTravis Kalanick was runner-up to Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel as Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year in 2015. Time was impressed by Kalanick\u2019s business zeal, but expressed concern with violent protests by taxi drivers against Uber\u2019s expansion. The Brookings Institute featured a column entitled \u201cIs Uber a threat to democracy?\u201d. The liberal publication demanded new social and regulatory policies as part of a new social contract.\u000a\u000aHarvard Business School held a one-day forum featuring top corporate executives to analyze \u201cUber\u2019s Keys to Success.\u201d The consensus was that CEO Travis Kalanick\u2019s willingness to violate corporate norms and flaunt laws was the key for Uber\u2019s access to $8.81 billion in 14 rounds of venture capital to fund its rise to international dominance.\u000a\u000aThe first cultural change by Uber\u2019s 14-member management committee, following Kalanick\u2019s resignation, is that Uber will be lending its cash-free business model for the first time by implementing a driver tipping option in a cultural effort to improve relations with drivers and avoid sexual harassment complaints, according to the Verge. The committee also cut the amount of time from 5 to 2 minutes that a user may cancel an Uber pick-up before being charged a $5 penalty.\u000a\u000aAlthough the cultural tweaks sound modest, they fundamentally change the business relationship Kalanick pioneered between Uber and its users. The company is now encouraging drivers to compete to service the best-tipping customers and communities. Kalanick strived to make the Uber experience consistent for all users.\u000a\u000aUber\u2019s board\u2019s highly visible dumping of Kalanick has similarities to Apple\u2019s board\u2019s dumping of Steve Jobs in 1985. According to Frank Rose\u2019s book, West of Eden: The End of Innocence at Apple Computer, Apple\u2019s board agreed that Jobs was a brilliant entrepreneur, but thought him too impulsive to run the business of a Fortune 500 firm.\u000a\u000aHis replacement, John Sculley, raised prices and licensed Apple\u2019s technology. That initially saw higher profits. But the customer experience faded without Apple creating disruptive new products. On the verge of bankruptcy, Apple brought Jobs\u2019s NeXT Computer 1997 and made him CEO again. Apple is now Forbes\u2019 most valuable brand.\u000a\u000aTravis Kalanick has an advantage over Steve Jobs, because he holds Uber super-voting shares that give him the right to appoint a new majority of Uber\u2019s board, according to Wired. If Uber\u2019s 14-member management committee fails to be entrepreneurial and Uber loses user competitiveness, Kalanick can come back as the company\u2019s savior.

aVWhile the U.S. could send as many as 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan, NATO members are considering sending less than half of that, according to several officials.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has approved sending up to 3,900 U.S. forces to implement the new strategy, but NATO members have so far pledged between 1,000 to 2,000, according to a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cRoughly, yes, that is,\u201d said Swedish Royal Navy Capt. Jon Dunmurray, when asked if that was the ballpark figure. \u201c[It\u2019s] something in that area.\u201d A U.S. official in Afghanistan confirmed that discussions have been in that range.\u000a\u000aAny new NATO forces would not likely arrive until 2018, Dunmurray said. Meanwhile, more U.S. forces are expected within weeks, the U.S. official said.\u000a\u000aNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday said the alliance and other nations contribute about half of the forces for the mission to advise-and-assist Afghan forces and that he expected that to continue.\u000a\u000aCurrently, the numbers on paper do show rough parity between U.S. and other coalition members for that mission, which is led by the U.S. but under the auspices of NATO.\u000a\u000aAccording to the latest statistics from May, there were 6,941 U.S. forces, and 6,635 non-U.S. coalition forces part of the joint mission \u2014 with 4,980 of that specifically from NATO members and the rest from non-NATO partner forces.\u000a\u000aBut according to a U.S. official, the number of actual NATO bodies on the ground is much lower \u2014 \u201ccloser to 4,000.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn June, about 15 of 29 NATO members offered to send \u201cseveral hundred\u201d more forces to Afghanistan \u2014 but just to fulfill current unmet obligations, according to the Wall Street Journal.\u000a\u000aDefense Secretary James Mattis alluded to this gap when he visited Brussels in June. \u201cWe still have a few gaps and nations are stepping up,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aEven if the gap is closed, and somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 more NATO forces are deployed, that would leave the alliance far below what the U.S. is expected to deploy.\u000a\u000aThere are currently 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan \u2014 about 7,000 part of the NATO advise-and-assist mission and 1,400 part of a counterterrorism mission.\u000a\u000aWith as many as 4,000 more forces deploying, and another 3,500 who are deployed on a temporary basis as recently revealed by the WSJ, the grand total of U.S. troops on the ground could be around 16,000.\u000a\u000aDunmurray said some NATO and partner nations have not decided yet whether to send more forces and that some new nations may join the 39-nation coalition in Afghanistan in the near future.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump unveiled his plan on Monday, weeks after it was expected, and Mattis was expected to talk with the NATO chief in the coming days after the announcement.\u000a\u000aSome doubt NATO will even send between 1,000 to 2,000 forces for the new plan.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would surprise me if they upheld that minimal commitment,\u201d said Nicholas L. Waddy, associate professor of History at the State University of New York at Albany.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe simple fact of the matter is most other NATO military forces are chronically underfunded, so they\u2019re literally incapable of mounting military operations, especially projecting power overseas, so unfortunately it was to be expected that we would carry most of the burden,\u201d said Waddy.\u000a\u000aTrump made calling on NATO to spend more on their own defense a part of his campaign platform. He called on members to meet the alliance obligation of spending at least 2 percent of GDP on their own defense. Only five members meet that commitment.\u000a\u000aThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s James Carafano, who worked on Trump\u2019s transition team, defended NATO, saying they were waiting to hear from the U.S. what the plan was before committing troops.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think largely what they\u2019ve been really waiting for for the last six months is a clear sign of direction from the United States,\u201d said Carafano, E.W. Richardson Fellow and vice president for the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy.\u000a\u000aHe also said it wasn\u2019t realistic to ask NATO to do much more. \u201cWe all have a common interest to do this and other people need to step up, but they need to step up realistically in their capability,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBut Waddy also thinks it\u2019s a matter of political will to build up that capability.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have the resources, they have money, they have the people, they have the technology, they just don\u2019t have the will,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s bothered many Americans for a long time.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Center for the National Interest\u2019s Director of Defense Studies Harry Kazianis said NATO could play a bigger counterterrorism role in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to make sure another 9/11 does not get planned from this war-torn nation. And NATO should play a big role in that,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think a small, rapid reaction style force from NATO that is capable of targeting and attacking terrorists cells in Afghanistan makes a lot of sense.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt also dovetails nicely with Trump\u2019s promise to the American people to ask more from our allies\u2014they have a big interest in making sure Afghanistan is stable and taking on some of the burden.\u201d

aVMike Rowe, former host of the television show Dirty Jobs, fired back against a critic who accused him of siding with white nationalists in a Facebook post on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aRowe posted on Facebook Tuesday a comment written to him:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aOne of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitests. Comment? No? I\u2019m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don\u2019t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country \u2013 promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin\u2019 our ass academically.\u000a\u000a\u201cSince we\u2019re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post,\u201d Rowe fired back. \u201cEverything about it annoys me \u2013your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position.\u201d\u000a\u000aRowe then dismantled each of Atkins\u2019 unsubstantiated points. He lambasted celebrities for constantly broadcasting their political opinions as though their views have any impact on most Americans:\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it\u2019s \u201cbad for business,\u201d but because it\u2019s annoying. I can\u2019t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I\u2019m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine.\u000a\u000aHe then criticized the attempt to lump Republicans and white nationalists into the same group:\u000a\u000aYou say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an \u201cacademic elite.\u201d You then say that Republicans promote \u201canti-intellectualism.\u201d You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief. Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common \u2013 a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans \u201clove\u201d me because they believe that my initiative and \u201ctheir\u201d initiative are one and the same. But of course, \u201ctheir\u201d initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you\u2019ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things \u201cintellectual.\u201d And poof \u2013 just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I\u2019m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis!\u000a\u000aRowe goes on to argue that millions of people across the political divide have concerns about the state of higher education, noting that universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world:\u000a\u000aMillions of reasonable people \u2013 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2013 are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They\u2019re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities \u2013 once beacons of free speech \u2013 now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can\u2019t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they\u2019re concerned \u2013 deeply concerned \u2013 that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don\u2019t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn\u2019t care less. My question is, why do you?\u201d Rowe finished.

aVThe West Wing is leaking like a sieve again, this time with details pouring out of the White House into the press about how the new command and control structure is attempting to contain and manage President Donald Trump. But it does not appear they will be successful.\u000a\u000aThe main goal, per many White House leaks across the media, appears to be senior staff controlling what information and reports make it to President Trump\u2014and tamping down who the president talks to and who has access to the president.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs and Margaret Talev wrote on Thursday:\u000a\u000aSince retired Marine Corps General John Kelly started as White House chief of staff last month, President Donald Trump has added a routine caveat before approving proposals advisers place before him: Check with \u2018The General\u2019 before moving ahead. It\u2019s a marked departure from Trump\u2019s instinct to manage around Kelly\u2019s predecessor, Reince Priebus. When making a decision, one aide recalls, Trump often would caution, \u2018Don\u2019t tell Reince.\u2019 Trump\u2019s appointment of Kelly has imposed new order on a White House that had been riven with infighting among warring camps. But it hasn\u2019t been the political lifeline Republican allies had hoped for, as Kelly has so far been unable to perform one of the chief of staff\u2019s most basic duties: to stop a president from following his worst instincts.\u000a\u000aThe Bloomberg piece is hardly the only one in media about new structures in the latest round of West Wing leaks pouring out of the White House.\u000a\u000aAug. 16, the Washington Post\u2019s Ashley Parker and Bob Costa reported that Kelly has instituted a new structure for communication with the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly routes all calls to and from President Trump through the White House switchboard, where he can sign off on them,\u201d Parker and Costa wrote. \u201cHe stanches the flow of information reaching the president\u2019s desk. And he requires that all staff members \u2014 including Trump\u2019s relatives \u2014 go through him to reach the president.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver at Politico on Thursday, Eliana Johnson and Nancy Cook got even more leaked details about the new structure Kelly is implementing. Johnson and Cook wrote:\u000a\u000aConfronted with a West Wing that treated policymaking as a free-for-all, President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John Kelly, is instituting a system used by previous administrations to limit internal competition \u2014 and to make himself the last word on the material that crosses the president\u2019s deskIt\u2019s a quiet effort to make Trump conform to White House decision-making norms he\u2019s flouted without making him feel shackled or out of the loop. In a conference call last week, Kelly initiated a new policymaking process in which just he and one other aide \u2014 White House staff secretary Rob Porter, a little-known but highly regarded Rhodes scholar who overlapped with Jared Kushner as an undergraduate at Harvard \u2014 will review all documents that cross the Resolute desk.\u000a\u000aAll of this comes amid a Democrat takeover of the West Wing, with Republicans being pushed out of the White House. National Security Adviser and three-star Army Gen. H.R. McMaster purged a number of Trump-backing Republicans from the National Security Council, while ex-Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman and now former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus was replaced by retired four-star Marine Gen. John Kelly, the old Secretary of Homeland Security. Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, and his wife Ivanka Trump\u2014as well as National Economic Council director Gary Cohn\u2014have all seen a rise in prominence in the West Wing. They\u2014McMaster, Kelly, Ivanka Trump, Kushner, and Cohn\u2014are all Democrats.\u000a\u000aIn addition to controlling information flow to and from the president\u2014and who communicates with him\u2014the West Wing Democrats have aimed to force Trump to stick to pre-scripted remarks on the TelePrompTer whenever he gives speeches. They have not succeeded on that front, as Trump went on a 45-minute off-script tirade against the media, the left, the GOP establishment, and more during a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, this week.\u000a\u000aSeveral people close to the president tell Breitbart News that while he is for now mostly following along with what Kelly and the others want him to do, people should not expect this to last.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose in the Administration who think they can shackle the President are in for a rude awakening,\u201d one White House aide told Breitbart News. \u201cUnlike so many other political \u2018plastic men,\u2019 he\u2019s not a pre-programmed bot, he thinks for himself and makes his own decisions.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe White House communications office did not comment for this piece to Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aBut, the crackdown in process by the West Wing Democrats is much broader than just what happens with the president. \u201cSince taking over for Priebus last month, Kelly has sought to crack down not just on sneakiness and backbiting but also to impose order more broadly,\u201d Johnson and Cook wrote in Politico. \u201cHe has tasked deputy chiefs of staff Rick Dearborn and Joe Hagin with bringing some order to the president\u2019s schedule, pushing them to plan events further in advance and to include one public-facing event each day and one travel event each week, according to a senior White House aide. He is also reworking what were once free-flowing White House meetings. Each one now includes a list of attendees to prevent aides from inserting themselves gratuitously where Kelly does not want them.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Bloomberg, Jacobs and Talev quoted, \u201cinterviews with 14 current and former administration officials, congressional Republicans and people close to Trump and Kelly\u201d most of whom, they say, \u201ccredited Kelly with imposing new processes and restrictions that have limited freelancing, drama, leaking and backbiting among staff.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cKelly has implored Trump repeatedly to stay on script, emphasizing the importance of being precise and sensitive to the constituencies hearing his words,\u201d Talev and Jacobs wrote. \u201cThe president did stick to the text in his speech Monday night on his approach to Afghanistan. Beforehand, Kelly had emphasized the magnitude and somber nature of sending more young men and women into war.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Trump has pushed off script many times too, something that tests the patience of his staff. His decision to re-litigate his Charlottesville response at a press conference in Trump Tower in New York City last week sparked Cohn to write a resignation letter, and go on record in the press bashing President Trump and the administration in an interview with the Financial Times.\u000a\u000aCohn met w Trump Friday in NJ, per multiple sources. He had even drafted a resignation letter, per those sources https://t.co/GYGhilRf5X \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aAccording to Politico\u2019s Anne Karni and Ben White, McMaster and Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell\u2014who worked with Cohn at Goldman Sachs\u2014leaked that they were upset with the president\u2019s Charlottesville response too. But Politico wrote that McMaster and Powell, unlike Cohn, were not thinking about resigning as of yet.\u000a\u000a\u201cNational security adviser H.R. McMaster and his deputy, Dina Powell, have been unhappy with Trump\u2019s rhetoric on race over the past week, according to a White House official,\u201d Karni and White wrote. \u201cBut neither of them is considering resigning \u2014 they have told people it is too serious and dangerous a moment in the world for them to simply walk away.\u201d\u000a\u000aSimilarly, leaks came out that West Wing aides were not happy with Trump\u2019s Phoenix speech\u2014to the point the president even tweeted out his explanation for different styles of speeches.\u000a\u000aOverall, efforts to contain and control Trump are likely to fail, said one source close with the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery person who is trying to control Donald Trump and not let him be the person that he is has failed in their roles,\u201d an associate of many senior White House officials and a close friend of the president told Breitbart News. \u201cThe establishment and elitists continue to think they are smarter than Trump.

And I certainly hope that\u2019s the position that he has in the future.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Trump was in Phoenix on Tuesday night, he hinted at a looming pardon he plans to grant Sheriff Joe. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll make a prediction: I think he\u2019s going to be just fine,\u201d Trump said in the Phoenix speech. \u201cOK? But I won\u2019t do it tonight, because I don\u2019t want to cause any controversy.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike Heller, though, Tarkanian supports the president when it comes to Arpaio.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe President had very good things to say about Sheriff Joe Arpaio last night (Tuesday) in Arizona and if he makes the decision to pardon Arpaio, then I will strongly endorse and support that decision. It is wrong for Dean Heller to publicly oppose the President\u2019s action even before the President has formally announced his decision,\u201d Tarkanian said per local news reports.\u000a\u000aHeller also, per CNN, announced after the Senate failed to repeal and replace Obamacare that he was \u201cpleased\u201d with how it turned out.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wake up every morning trying to figure out what\u2019s best for the state of Nevada, what can I do for Nevada families. And obviously we got in the middle of this health care battle and I feel real pleased at the way this thing turned out and we\u2019re turning the page now to tax reform,\u201d Heller said after Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) switched to voting against efforts to repeal Obamacare.\u000a\u000aPolling data on the race suggests that Tarkanian has a chance to topple Heller in Nevada, should he gain momentum moving into the next several months. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, is likely to fight as hard as he can to save Heller\u2014but endorsements from major national conservative figures like Palin open the door to a potential upset.\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s endorsement of Trump in Iowa before the caucuses last year was critical in solidifying the president\u2019s position with conservatives. Trump came in second in Iowa\u2019s caucuses to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) but went on to win the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina and then stormed his way to the GOP nomination and then the presidency.

They added that even family members failed to correct them upon being notified of Herring\u2019s death,\u201d CBS explained. \u201cAs if to underscore the complicated situation, however, even supporters who spoke out during the candlelight vigil seemed to get confused, often referring to Herring as \u2018he\u2019 with those in the crowd repeatedly calling out \u2018she\u2019 in response.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn June, a trans teenager in Athens, Georgia, was also killed following a feud between two transgender groups.\u000a\u000aCharlie Nash covers technology and LGBT news for Breitbart News.

aVA Clinton initiative founded in 2002 to save lives infected with HIV/AIDS spent only $23 million of its $140 million of expenditures in 2016 directly on programs, according to financial records on the initiative\u2019s website.\u000a\u000aAccording to its website, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) was set up in 2002 to help save lives by providing treatment to those living with HIV/AIDS. The Clinton Foundation describes CHAI as a \u201cseparate, affiliated entity\u201d from the controversial foundation. CHAI summarizes its approach as a \u201csolution-oriented approach\u201d:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aCHAI\u2019s solution-oriented approach focuses on both global and national level work by rapidly improving market dynamics for medicines and diagnostics; lowering prices for treatment; accelerating access to lifesaving technologies; and helping governments build the capacity required for high-quality care and treatment programs.\u000a\u000aHowever, of that $140 million, according to its financial report, it initially breaks down its expenditures as having spent $129,662,636 on \u201cprogram services,\u201d with $10,117,754 on management and $1,035,062 on fundraising.\u000a\u000aHowever, the report later reveals that only $23 million was actually spent on \u201cdirect program expenditures.\u201d The rest was spent on a whole host of other non-service related items, including $72,957,333 on salaries and benefits; $16,438,199 on meetings and training; $7,983,180 on \u201cprofessional and consultation fees\u201d; and $7,611,344 on travel.\u000a\u000aCHAI did not respond to multiple requests for comment and clarification from Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aThe accounting taps into broader concerns about the Clintons\u2019 philanthropic ventures \u2014 namely that for all its claims to do good in the world, very little of its money is spent on philanthropy.\u000a\u000aPeter Schweizer, who exposed a great deal of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s working in his 2015 book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, told Breitbart News last year that it is possible that as little as six percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s money went to charitable causes.\u000a\u000aIn particular, he pointed to the claims made by Clinton groups such as the Clinton Foundation about their work and noted that even some of those direct services can be \u201cfuzzy and hazy.\u201d He suggested that it can be very hard to figure out exactly what is spent on actually helping people:\u000a\u000aThe problem is, when you start drilling down on what, precisely, those charitable activities are, and what they have to show for it, it gets really, really fuzzy and hazy. So you\u2019ll have some charities like Doctors Without Borders will say, \u201cWe immunized 100,000 kids last year.\u201d And you can look at that. That\u2019s a very clear metric. Okay, here\u2019s where they did it. They were in sub-Saharan Africa. They had all these doctors. The Clinton Foundation will say, \u201cWe assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.\u201d Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don\u2019t really tell you. They don\u2019t really explain to you how it works. So the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities. The other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it\u2019s really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.\u000a\u000aIn September, CHAI announced that if Hillary Clinton was elected president in November, then Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea Clinton would step down from CHAI\u2019s board. However, possibly because Clinton did not win, Bill and Chelsea are still listed as among CHAI\u2019s board members.\u000a\u000aAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

aVI came away from this year\u2019s Electronic Entertainment Expo excited about a precious few upcoming titles. Foremost among them was Middle-earth: Shadow of War. I described the elegance with which the developers introduced complexity to 2014\u2019s Shadow of Mordor\u2018s alchemy of procedural generation and visceral combat. I said that I would be \u201cshocked if it doesn\u2019t immediately become one of the year\u2019s highlights\u201d upon its release, and I meant it.\u000a\u000aWhen Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment first announced the presence of loot chests in the upcoming Shadow of War, I was flabbergasted. It was a reaction shared by the vast majority of the gaming community at large.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aNot only would micro-transactions invade the single-player experience, they would be directly tied to mechanical advantages that would negate time spent actually playing the game. It is an even more egregious spiritual successor to Ubisoft\u2019s abusive tactics in the Assassins Creed series; locking much of the game\u2019s best equipment, and then badgering you to open your wallet while you play.\u000a\u000aWBIE has doubled down on that practice, and in doing so, they have turned Shadow of War into a glorified slot machine.\u000a\u000aNo, it\u2019s not technically (read: legally) gambling. It\u2019s worse. While it is equally as exploitative of the player, the promise of reward is completely artificial. Furthermore, there are multiple studies that suggest that the early introduction of these concepts can have a real impact on the severity of gambling problems later in life. Children who start gambling early have been found to gamble more and (even) less responsibly.\u000a\u000aRather than search for \u201cwhales\u201d among their consumers, many of today\u2019s biggest names in the gaming industry are raising their own.\u000a\u000aLoot boxes and their ilk have proven a clever disguise for the behavioral conditioning that major game publishers have begun to employ as a matter of course. From mobile games to the biggest AAA titles in the industry like Overwatch, Call of Duty, and League of Legends, the problem continues to spread because our lawmakers simply aren\u2019t paying attention. The closest we have gotten to a real examination of the issue was an impotent and arguably misdirected offensive against Steam\u2019s tradeable item marketplace.\u000a\u000aUntil we call publishers to account for these practices, our children will be continually trained to answer the lure of digital Skinner Boxes. So long as we excuse the practice, it will continue to expand until it eclipses the immersive experience that games once intended to provide.\u000a\u000aBut customers sucked into the world of loot box accelerants aren\u2019t the only ones gambling. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and other publishers are making a terrible wager. They are measuring the value of your time spent on their game, and then bluntly suggesting to their own customers that there is value in avoiding it. It clearly defines the publisher\u2019s opinion of both the game and its creators \u2014 in the most negative possible way.\u000a\u000aSo, while I\u2019m giving advice that absolutely no one will follow, here\u2019s something for free:\u000a\u000aJust stop. Write up another press release. Apologize to your fans for insulting them and to your hard working development team for devaluing the work they have put into making something worth our time. Take a hard step back from the reviled business practices for which you are quickly becoming infamous, and don\u2019t forfeit all the good will you have gained on the backs of the talented creators in your employ.\u000a\u000aEventually, someone will realize that loot box schemes are no more than thinly veiled attempts to produce young gamblers. When that happens, you have a choice; to be the ones who came the wrong way around to the right decision\u2026 or Exhibit A.\u000a\u000aI reached out to Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for comment but received no response at the time of this writing.\u000a\u000aFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.

aVWhile the establishment media rails against Brexit and Donald Trump for respectively \u2014 or even collectively \u2014 \u201cdividing\u201d their countries, the Guardian has decided to promote an idea, popularized by Labour MP Laura Pidcock, that conservatives and liberals cannot mix.\u000a\u000aIn an article reminiscent of Shariah supremacist schooling \u2014 written by the paper\u2019s deputy opinion editor and their sister paper\u2019s chief leader writer \u2014 the Guardian also seeks to draw racial dividing lines between political persuasions, with Joseph Harker stating:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aOthers, who I have more respect for, are those racial minorities who believe in self-reliance as a way of overcoming inequality rather than depending on unreliable white liberals\u2026\u000a\u000aForget that some people might actually just be conservative in their world view or philosophy. For Harker, it is all about race. He cannot see beyond it. You may only be right-wing if it is driven by a frustration (or worse) towards white liberals [emphasis added].\u000a\u000aCo-author Sonia Sodha is supposed to offer the counterpoint to this, but only goes so far as to state she would be friends with a \u201cconservative\u201d with a secret leftist agenda:\u000a\u000a\u2026I\u2019d certainly be more than open to friendship with, for example, a Conservative MP who I knew was arguing against the worst of austerity and Brexit behind the scenes\u2026\u000a\u000aRemember, the \u201cworst of austerity\u201d is simply \u201causterity\u201d as far as the political left is concerned.\u000a\u000aThis decision to drive this wedge, especially along racial lines, is the left\u2019s emulation of the Daily Stormer.\u000a\u000aThe Guardian\u2019s contention is no different, philosophically, from that of ethno-nationalists, and in turn leads to racial abuse that black or brown conservatives routinely experience.\u000a\u000aCNN recently reven led its affinity to this same mindset, allowing Democrat Keith Boykin to harrass Republican Paris Dennard over whether he was black enough.\u000a\u000aFor reformist or ex-Muslims, the phrases \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019 or \u2018House Muslim\u2019 have become a new line of attack as \u2018Islamophobe\u2019 begins to lose all meaning. Again, these left-wing xenophobic attitudes appear to be endorsed by the Guardians and CNNs of the world.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnity\u201d has been the buzzword of the month. Meanwhile, the \u2018liberals\u2019 in the media and in politics seek to deride and sometimes even endanger conservatives from ethnic or religious minorities.\u000a\u000aThis proves \u2014 if ever there was any doubt \u2014 that when they say \u201cunity\u201d they don\u2019t mean compromise, or negotiation. They mean \u201cyou had better start thinking like us, or else\u201d.\u000a\u000aClassic alt-left.\u000a\u000aRaheem Kassam is the Editor in Chief of Breitbart London and author of No Go Zones: How Shariah Law is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You

aVA majority of Australians believe the traditional Islamic burqa should be banned in public places, according to a new poll.\u000a\u000aThe survey found that 43.6 per cent of respondents \u201cstrongly\u201d support a ban on the burqa in public while another 12.7 per cent also support the idea, producing a majority of 56.3 per cent generally in favour.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Sky News/ReachTel poll found 12.3 per cent were against a ban and 18.9 cent \u201cstrongly\u201d opposed the idea. Another 12.5 per cent were undecided.\u000a\u000aThe topic has risen to the forefront of political debate Down Under after One Nation leader Senator Pauline Hanson wore a burqa in Australia\u2019s parliament last week. As Breitbart London reported, she wore the garb to gain publicity for her push to ban the burqa in public places and the Senator\u2019s call seems to have found resonance with a large section of the Australian public.\u000a\u000aPAULINE HANSON BURQA SPEECH | @PaulineHansonOz\u2018s speech on public bans of full face coverings. #auspol FULL VIDEOhttps://t.co/mkPuVHgz37 \u2014 Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) August 17, 2017\u000a\u000aSenator Hanson says the burqa poses an unacceptable security risk.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn light of our national security of this nation, will you work with me to actually ban the burqa in Australia considering there have been 13 foiled national threats against us with terrorism, three that have been successful that Australians have lost their lives,\u2019 she told the Senate last Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cTerrorism is a true threat to our country. Many Australians are in fear of it. What I would like to ask on behalf of the Australian people, considering there has been a large majority of Australians wish to see the banning of the burqa.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn April this year the burqa was at the center of another Australian controversy when artist Fabian Muir used his Urban Burqa project to put the garment in an assortment of places and then photograph it. As Breitbart Jerusalem reported, the BBC said Mr. Muir\u2019s Urban Burqa was a critique of \u201cthe rising far right and Islamophobia\u201d in general and Australians who feel that immigration from Islamic countries delivers less than desirable outcomes in particular.\u000a\u000aA YouGov poll in Britain last year found 57 per cent support for a public ban on the outfit.

aVForeign nationals attempting to enter the United States through various visa programs will now have to prove they have the means return to their native countries as federal law mandates.\u000a\u000aAs part of President Donald Trump\u2019s Buy American, Hire American Executive Order, the vetting procedures conducted by the State Department of foreign nationals trying to come to the U.S. have been strengthened to weed out not only radicalized individuals, but also foreigners with no documented intentions on departing.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe National Law Review outlined the changes by the Trump Administration, writing that \u201cthe revisions appear to instruct officers to apply a more rigorous \u2013 and, arguably, protectionist \u2013 approach to determining whether an applicant meets the requirements of the visa category in question.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnder the new guidelines by the State Department, officials will now refuse student visas to foreign nationals who show no evidence or plan of returning to their native countries.\u000a\u000aNumbersUSA spokeswoman Rosemary Jenks says the maneuver is a matter of simply enforcing immigration law which previous administrations refused to do.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re basically trying to literally enforce the law,\u201d Jenks said.\u000a\u000aThe order is meant to enforce federal immigration law that requires nonimmigrant visa-holders leave the U.S. after their visa has expired.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s Buy American, Hire American agenda throws a wrench into the pipelines of cheap, foreign labor that big business interests and tech giants have created through visa programs like the H-1B visa and the OPT program, where foreign student visa-holders can sign onto the program in order to remain in the U.S. for a longer period of time until they receive their H-1B visa.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor example, some applicants who already hold F-1 student status but who have H-1B petitions submitted and pending with the USCIS on their behalf may face an uphill battle in applying for a renewed F-1 visa,\u201d the Law Review report notes. \u201cIn such instances, if a consular officer asks the student whether he or she intends to depart the United States upon completion of his or her studies, the applicant will truthfully need to advise of his or her pending H-1B petition with USCIS. This information in all likelihood will lead to the consulate\u2019s denial of the student\u2019s F-1 visa application and the applicant will need to remain outside the United States until he or she is able to apply for an H-1B visa.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart Texas reported, in the 2016 Fiscal Year, nearly 630,000 foreign nationals overstayed their visas.

aVThirty months ago, I spoke to Conor McGregor about Floyd Mayweather. About thirty hours from now, the two fight.\u000a\u000aThe notion of this reality appeared ridiculous in early 2015\u2014but not to Conor McGregor. That\u2019s how amazing happens: a man dreams and then he does.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI love boxing,\u201d McGregor confessed to me in 2015 about the Manny Pacquiao-Floyd Mayweather bout scheduled for that summer. \u201cBut boxing has this fight. Not everyone is making that money. That is a special fight.\u201d\u000a\u000aBackstage in Boston at an old vaudeville theater, McGregor spoke to me in the dark, where his eyes lit up brightly when I broached the subject of Floyd Mayweather making $300 million for a fight against Manny Paquiao versus the stated $3 million purse he looked to pocket against Jose Aldo. Long after the fans departed, and Jose Aldo headed out the backdoor, McGregor held court, talking to anyone who would talk to him about him. The klieg lights that now accompany him everywhere were nowhere backstage. Instead, he allowed me to shine my iPod\u2019s light on his face as he spoke into my iPhone\u2019s lens. Some shine so blindingly bright that they don\u2019t need the spotlight for anyone around to realize that they look upon a star.\u000a\u000aDidn\u2019t the biggest name in boxing making 100 times more than the biggest name in mixed-martial arts indicate that a profound financial gap still existed between the two combat sports?\u000a\u000a\u201cI feel we will get to that stage,\u201d McGregor insisted. \u201cI certainly will\u2014not everybody else. I most certainly will.\u201d\u000a\u000aI did not believe him. I did not believe him the year earlier at the UFC\u2019s Boston gym, where he earnestly told me that the then-beltless him would become a two-weight UFC champion. I did not believe that could beat Jose Aldo. I did not believe that he would beat Eddie Alvarez.\u000a\u000aFans of McGregor should gleefully note that I do not believe that Conor McGregor can beat Floyd Mayweather.\u000a\u000aBut in speaking to McGregor for a few minutes here and there about a dozen times over the last three years, I do believe that Conor McGregor believes that he beats Floyd Mayweather Saturday night in Las Vegas, nay, I do know that Conor McGregor knows that he beats Floyd Mayweather on Saturday night in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aBelief is more contagious than a cold. The heavy action laid on McGregor in the Las Vegas sports books proves this. Floyd boasts an experience and skills edge. Connor beats him in belief, which, although never appearing on a tale of the tape, ranks as a formidable attribute. Two-thousand miles and more than two years removed from Saturday night in Vegas, one could see the gears churn in McGregor\u2019s mind, his eyes become moon pies, and his manner grow serious but excited at the mere sound of another athlete\u2019s name.\u000a\u000aI said \u201cFloyd Mayweather.\u201d He heard \u201cMoney.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaybe the light bulb went off above McGregor\u2019s head long before the lights went off in that aging theater. But one could see him silently talking himself into this fight that night so long before he talked the public into demanding the fight and so long before he talked Floyd Mayweather out of retirement.\u000a\u000aNate Diaz does not put nine figures on your paycheck. Khabib Nurmagomedov does not push your personal GDP past Montserrat\u2019s. Cowboy Cerrone does not elevate you near the top of the Forbes richest athletes list.\u000a\u000aTo make that kind of money, it helps to fight a man named Money. But in the ring as in life, money usually wins. Just don\u2019t tell that to Conor McGregor. People holding such an overpowering belief in themselves just won\u2019t believe you.

aVCharlottesville\u2019s Mayor claimed Thursday that he and other members of the city council \u201cwere not given the security plan for August 12,\u201d which was developed and closely held by the City Manager, the Police Chief, and the Fire Chief.\u000a\u000aMayor Mike Signer\u2019s Facebook statement about city preparations in Charlottesville prior to the brawls between self-described white supremacists, white nationalists, and progressive street groups said:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aI asked the Police Chief what I could do to be helpful during that day as Mayor, he answered, \u2018Stay out of my way.\u2019 Despite repeated requests, I was not allowed into the City\u2019s Command Center (run by City staff) and was instead asked to be in the Emergency Operations Center (where fire, rescue, and other stakeholders were monitoring the situation).\u000a\u000aSigner revealed the political motivations behind the City of Charlottesville\u2019s actions leading up to the August 12 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Emancipation Park:\u000a\u000aUnderstanding from our staff and other experts that the state of our law regarding these events meant that any attempt to cancel the rally would certainly have been shut down in court, I spent dozens of hours conferring with lawyers, law professors, staff, other mayors, security professionals, and other experts to develop another option. That option was to move the event to a more spacious location where there could have been substantial \u201cgreen field\u201d between the protesters and counter protesters. After reviewing all locations in the City with the City Manager, the best option was McIntire Park. In the weeks leading up to August 12, I advocated for McIntire Park, including extensive discussions with my colleagues and staff. I successfully led the drive to hire an outside law firm to advise the City Manager and Police Chief on how such a plan could be developed on the strongest legal grounds. Despite these efforts, the state of First Amendment law regarding these events is badly antiquated. We saw what happened. After the City Manager and Police Chief announced their decision that the rally would be relocated to a safer location\u2014relying principally on the advice from our attorneys that the size of the event was the most \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d grounds for moving it\u2014Jason Kessler immediately stated he would not respect the decision: that he would still head with his people to Emancipation Park. We were then sued by the Virginia ACLU and the Rutherford Institute. And a federal judge ruled against our decision on Friday night, just as we had feared.\u000a\u000aMaurice Jones was named the City Manager in 2010, and Al Thomas was named the Police Chief in 2016.\u000a\u000aSigner declared in January that Charlottesville would become a \u201ccapital of resistance\u201d to recently inaugurated President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aOn the morning of August 12, the groups from both factions clashed early as the white supremacists/white nationalists pushed their way through a human barrier of progressive protesters \u2014 which assembled under a street barrier declaring \u201cDiversity Makes Us Stronger\u201d \u2014 and then got themselves into the park.\u000a\u000aThe rally was legally permitted to begin at noon on August 12, but Governor Terry McAuliffe ordered it shut down at 11:22 a.m. The City of Charlottesville Police Department tweeted out and posted on Facebook at 11:35 a.m. that \u201cunlawful assembly had been declared at the rally.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Virginia State Police then pushed the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally out of Emancipation Park, and into the large crowd of counter protesters gathered in the street at the south entrance of the park. The violence between the two groups spread as a long line of white-power groups walked back through the gauntlet of progressives and away from the park.\u000a\u000aAt about 1:42 pm, a Dodge car drove into a crowd of counter protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. \u201cThe driver of the Dodge, James A.

aVNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon plans to use its deep pockets to make big changes at Whole Foods, saying it will cut prices on bananas, eggs, salmon, beef and more when it completes its $13.7 billion takeover next week.\u000a\u000aHelping Whole Foods win back customers who found \u201cgood enough\u201d organic and natural products elsewhere \u2013 possibly at a lower cost \u2013 fits Amazon\u2019s track record of keeping prices low to lock in customer loyalty. Looking ahead, Amazon hopes to give members of its Prime program special savings and other in-store benefits.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s an \u201copening salvo\u201d in the grocery wars, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, and shares of other supermarkets fell sharply on the news.\u000a\u000a\u201cRivals should be under no illusion that they are now dealing with a competitor that is not afraid to damage profits and margins if it creates long-term gains,\u201d Saunders said in an analyst note.\u000a\u000aAmong other Whole Foods items getting discounts Monday: avocados, tilapia, baby kale, apples and rotisserie chicken \u2013 all organic, Amazon said. The company also said certain Whole Foods products will be available through Amazon.com, AmazonFresh, Prime Pantry and Prime Now.\u000a\u000aAmazon\u2019s announcement comes a day after Whole Foods shareholders gave their approval and the Federal Trade Commission said it would not block the purchase. Amazon will pay $42 per Whole Foods share, an 18 percent premium from its price the day before the tie-up was announced June 16. The stock edged up to $41.98 on Thursday.\u000a\u000aBy buying Whole Foods, Amazon is taking a bold step into brick-and-mortar, with its more than 460 stores and potentially very lucrative data about how shoppers behave offline. The grocery chain, which has fought the \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d reputation, had been under shareholder pressure to improve results as customers moved on and discount chains like Lidl and Aldi expanded in the U.S.\u000a\u000aWhether Amazon will succeed in the fiercely competitive grocery segment is unclear, but customers are going to benefit from the attempt, said Charlie O\u2019Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\u000a\u000a\u201cAmazon can come in and price items very low,\u201d he said. \u201cIts shareholders are agnostic about profit, and seem more interested revenue and market share. That\u2019s a competitive advantage.\u201d\u000a\u000aRivals have been scrambling to catch up with the e-commerce giant. Walmart, which has the largest share of the U.S. grocery market, is expanding its grocery delivery service with ride-hailing service Uber and announced Wednesday that it will join forces with Google to let shoppers order goods by voice on Google devices.\u000a\u000aBut Walmart\u2019s shares were off 2 percent, and shares of other big grocery businesses fell more. The Kroger Co. dropped nearly 8 percent, and Supervalu Inc. fell more than 6 percent. Costco lost 5 percent and Target fell 4 percent.\u000a\u000aWhile Whole Foods accounts for less than 3 percent of U.S. grocery and supermarket sales, the purchase gives Amazon a foothold in a fragile industry that can ill-afford more price cutting.\u000a\u000a\u201cLower prices could be catastrophic for some operators,\u201d said Madeline Hurley, a senior analyst at market research firm IBISWorld. \u201cIt could drive them out of the industry.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn average, she said, supermarkets only squeeze about $1 of profit out of every $100 in revenue.\u000a\u000aHurley said she is not sure how big competitors like Walmart will fare, but that Amazon is showing a determination to shake things up, and fast.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was a lot of speculation that Whole Foods might be left as more of an independent entity, at least in the beginning phases of the acquisition,\u201d she said. \u201cThis shows that Amazon is taking a very hands-on approach.\u201d\u000a\u000aFinancial analysts say one challenge for Amazon is how to cut prices and broaden Whole Foods\u2019 appeal without hurting the chain\u2019s image for quality food. It\u2019s a tricky balance that Amazon itself seemed to acknowledge in its statement.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality \u2013 we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market\u2019s long-held commitment to the highest standards,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO of AmazonWorldwide Consumer.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, Amazon sold $16 billion of bonds in order to pay for the purchase. Its shares were down 0.6 percent to $952.45 on Thursday.

aVCharlottesville\u2019s Mayor claimed Thursday that he and other members of the city council \u201cwere not given the security plan for August 12,\u201d which was developed and closely held by the City Manager, the Police Chief, and the Fire Chief.\u000a\u000aMayor Mike Signer\u2019s Facebook statement about city preparations in Charlottesville prior to the brawls between self-described white supremacists, white nationalists, and progressive street groups said:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aI asked the Police Chief what I could do to be helpful during that day as Mayor, he answered, \u2018Stay out of my way.\u2019 Despite repeated requests, I was not allowed into the City\u2019s Command Center (run by City staff) and was instead asked to be in the Emergency Operations Center (where fire, rescue, and other stakeholders were monitoring the situation).\u000a\u000aSigner revealed the political motivations behind the City of Charlottesville\u2019s actions leading up to the August 12 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Emancipation Park:\u000a\u000aUnderstanding from our staff and other experts that the state of our law regarding these events meant that any attempt to cancel the rally would certainly have been shut down in court, I spent dozens of hours conferring with lawyers, law professors, staff, other mayors, security professionals, and other experts to develop another option. That option was to move the event to a more spacious location where there could have been substantial \u201cgreen field\u201d between the protesters and counter protesters. After reviewing all locations in the City with the City Manager, the best option was McIntire Park. In the weeks leading up to August 12, I advocated for McIntire Park, including extensive discussions with my colleagues and staff. I successfully led the drive to hire an outside law firm to advise the City Manager and Police Chief on how such a plan could be developed on the strongest legal grounds. Despite these efforts, the state of First Amendment law regarding these events is badly antiquated. We saw what happened. After the City Manager and Police Chief announced their decision that the rally would be relocated to a safer location\u2014relying principally on the advice from our attorneys that the size of the event was the most \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d grounds for moving it\u2014Jason Kessler immediately stated he would not respect the decision: that he would still head with his people to Emancipation Park. We were then sued by the Virginia ACLU and the Rutherford Institute. And a federal judge ruled against our decision on Friday night, just as we had feared.\u000a\u000aMaurice Jones was named the City Manager in 2010, and Al Thomas was named the Police Chief in 2016.\u000a\u000aSigner declared in January that Charlottesville would become a \u201ccapital of resistance\u201d to recently inaugurated President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aOn the morning of August 12, the groups from both factions clashed early as the white supremacists/white nationalists pushed their way through a human barrier of progressive protesters \u2014 which assembled under a street barrier declaring \u201cDiversity Makes Us Stronger\u201d \u2014 and then got themselves into the park.\u000a\u000aThe rally was legally permitted to begin at noon on August 12, but Governor Terry McAuliffe ordered it shut down at 11:22 a.m. The City of Charlottesville Police Department tweeted out and posted on Facebook at 11:35 a.m. that \u201cunlawful assembly had been declared at the rally.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Virginia State Police then pushed the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally out of Emancipation Park, and into the large crowd of counter protesters gathered in the street at the south entrance of the park. The violence between the two groups spread as a long line of white-power groups walked back through the gauntlet of progressives and away from the park.\u000a\u000aAt about 1:42 pm, a Dodge car drove into a crowd of counter protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. \u201cThe driver of the Dodge, James A. Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, was taken into custody and charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit-and-run,\u201d the City of Charlottesville reported.\u000a\u000aBefore the riot, \u201cduring that week [from August 7 to August 12], City Council was under firm instructions not to speak about the rally at all, except to refer to its size,\u201d Signer wrote:\u000a\u000aFor a public looking for condemnation of groups like the KKK and Nazis, this was very frustrating.

aVDirector James Cameron sparked an uproar on social media Thursday after saying in an interview that this summer\u2019s blockbuster film Wonder Woman represented a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for female protagonists in Hollywood.\u000a\u000aIn a lengthy interview with the Guardian to discuss the re-release of his 1984 mega-hit Terminator 2: Judgement Day in 3D, the Oscar-winning filmmaker said he couldn\u2019t understand the critical frenzy surrounding Gal Gadot\u2019s portrayal of the iconic DC superheroine.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood\u2019s been doing over Wonder Woman has been so misguided,\u201d Cameron told the paper. \u201cShe\u2019s an objectified icon, and it\u2019s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing! I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t like the movie but, to me, it\u2019s a step backwards.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe director \u2014 long lauded for writing strong female characters in his films, including Ripley in Aliens and Neytiri in Avatar \u2014 also pointed out that his character of Sarah Conner in the Terminator films \u201cwas not a beauty icon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to me, [the benefit of characters like Sarah] is so obvious. I mean, half the audience is female!\u201d\u000a\u000aCameron\u2019s comments quickly drew the ire of the Internet, with the director\u2019s name becoming a top trend on Twitter Thursday night.\u000a\u000aWonder Woman director Patty Jenkins responded to the uproar herself with a lengthy note posted to her Twitter account Thursday evening.\u000a\u000a\u201cJames Cameron\u2019s inability to understand what Wonder Woman is, or stands for, to women all over the world is unsurprising as, though he is a great filmmaker, he is not a woman,\u201d Jenkins wrote. \u201cStrong women are great. His praise of my film Monster, and our portrayal of a strong yet damaged woman was so appreciated. But if women have to always be hard, tough and troubled to be strong, and we aren\u2019t free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we haven\u2019t come very far have we.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe women can and should be EVERYTHING just like male lead characters should be,\u201d Jenkins added. \u201cThere is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman. And the massive female audience who made the film a hit it is, can surely choose to judge their own icons of progress.\u201d\u000a\u000aJenkins was just one of many people, including actress Lena Dunham, to respond to Cameron\u2019s comments.\u000a\u000a"James Cameron says Wonder Woman is a step backwards" is a headline from my personal parody newspaper. \u2014 Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aIs this the same James Cameron who routinely polled his all-male crew to ensure a lady alien was fuckable, or is that a different dickhead? https://t.co/9AXfkVacD0 \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aI mean no disrespect when I say I can't imagine why I would value James Cameron's opinion of Wonder Woman. \u2014 Linda Holmes (@nprmonkeysee) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aJames Cameron: "Wonder Woman objectified it's lead & was a step backwards from Sarah Connor."\u000a\u000aLinda Hamilton: pic.twitter.com/jUeaNjOVpd \u2014 Cher (@thecherness) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aNo James Cameron.

You remember, there was a lot of concern during the campaign about the fact that he attacked a judge of Mexican descent, Judge Curiel, right? \u2026 This is so much worse. Because the crime that he is being pardoned for is effectively not following the Constitution. Because a judge determined what his officers were doing was harassment, was discrimination.

aVAn elementary school teacher in Indiana caught flak from parents and school administrators alike for sending a letter home warning parents to tell their children to stop talking about God, Jesus, and the devil in her classroom.\u000a\u000aA first-grade teacher at McCordsville Elementary School sent a letter home to parents informing them that \u201cabout 5 students\u201d had been heard talking about religion and using the words \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cJesus,\u201d and \u201cdevil,\u201d Fox 59 reported.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cWith McCordsville Elementary being a public school, we have many different religions and beliefs, and I do not want to upset a child/parent because of these words being used,\u201d the teacher\u2019s letter said. \u201cIf you go to church or discuss these things at home, please have a talk with your child about there being an appropriate time and place of talking about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe teacher also noted that she warned the students before about discussing religion in class.\u000a\u000aParents were alarmed enough to contact the teacher\u2019s superiors forcing Superintendent Shane Robbins to issue a letter calling the teacher\u2019s missive \u201cunfortunate\u201d and denouncing the teacher\u2019s actions.

Trying to limit a student\u2019s view on religion is a violation of a student\u2019s first amendment rights.

aVFormer White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s economic-nationalist, non-interventionist, and pro-assimilation agenda is on the ascent, and what FiveThirtyEight dubbed the \u201cBannon Wing\u201d represents a \u201cmajor part of the modern Republican Party.\u201d\u000a\u000aFurther, \u201cBannon-ism,\u201d according to the report, is in \u201cnearly every Republican voter.\u201d And it may offer Republicans the best chance to expand its coalition in a general election by attracting blue-collar Democrats and politically unaffiliated or unengaged voters of all backgrounds like Donald Trump did in 2016.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aFiveThirtyEight defined the \u201cBannon wing\u201d of the GOP as a more \u201cpopulist, nationalist,\u201d and non-interventionist wing of the GOP. The study pointed out that, more specifically, the \u201cBannon wing\u201d consists of \u201cTrump voters who are pro-police, against free trade, against the U.S. playing an active role (militarily and diplomatically) in the international community, strongly against illegal immigration, and in favor of more infrastructure spending.\u201d FiveThirtyEight used five questions from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study to more specifically define the Bannon wing:\u000a\u000a1. They are for or against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Which we\u2019ll use as a proxy for free trade.)\u000a\u000a2. The U.S. should send troops to help the United Nations uphold international law.2 (Involvement in the international community.)\u000a\u000a3. The U.S. government should identify and deport immigrants in the country illegally. (Illegal immigration.)\u000a\u000a4. Their local police should receive a grade of A (excellent), B (above average), C (average), D (below average) or F (poor).\u000a\u000a5. Their state government should increase spending on infrastructure. (Infrastructure spending.)\u000a\u000aFiveThirtyEight noted that \u201cperhaps the most telling sign that Bannon\u2019s positions represent a major part of the modern Republican Party is the percentage of Trump voters who disagree with all of the five key Bannon-esque policy stances listed above. It\u2019s less than 2 percent.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether the Republican mainstream likes it or not, a little bit of Bannonism is in pretty much every Republican voter,\u201d the numbers-crunching outlet concluded. \u201cDon\u2019t expect Trump to suddenly become a different person. Bannonism is a part of Trump\u2019s coalition, even if Bannon is no longer part of the Trump administration. And Trump needs it to remain that way.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study found that Republicans agreed with many core aspects of \u201cBannon-ism\u201d and approximately 15% of all Trump voters agreed with all five of the tenets as defined by FiveThirtyEight, based on questions from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. But \u201cto put this 15 percent in some additional perspective, the percentage of Hillary Clinton voters who were Hispanic in the general election, an important part of her coalition, was about 12 percent,\u201d FiveThirtyEight noted. When FiveThirtyEight broke down \u201cBannonism\u201d further, it found that nearly half of Trump\u2019s voters wanted a more non-interventionist and realist foreign policy that put America\u2019s national interest above all else while 40-45 percent of Trump voters were nationalist-populist.\u000a\u000aNon-interventionist Bannon-ites (Nearly 50% of Trump voters) \u2014 \u201cTrump voters who want the U.S. to have a more distant relationship with international partners. These are people who are against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and against sending troops overseas to uphold international law.\u201d The report found that nearly half of Trump voters fall into this category, which should not be surprising \u201cgiven that even Clinton was forced to come out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u201d and Trump emphasized his opposition to the Iraq War during the campaign. Nationalist Bannon-ites (About 45% of Trump voters) \u2014 \u201cTrump voters who support deporting immigrants who are here illegally. These voters are pro-police and strongly against illegal immigration.\u201d These voters also, as Breitbart News has pointed out, value assimilation and Americanism and vote for E Pluribus Unum as opposed to Ex Uno Plures. This group, according to the report, make up about 45 percent of Trump voters, but also appeal to a broader segment of the electorate since the pro-assimilation and America-first issues the nationalist Bannon-ites cared about \u201cclearly went beyond voters with hardline positions on policing and immigration.\u201d Populist Bannon-ites (About 40% of Trump voters) \u2014\u201dTrump voters who are more economically populist in a party that often isn\u2019t. These voters are against the Trans-Pacific partnership and are for more infrastructure spending.\u201d The report notes that \u201cthis may be the area where Bannon and Trump were most at odds with Republican Party leaders,\u201d but the issues that appeal to \u201cpopulist Bannon-ites\u201d are more likely to win over blue-collar Reagan Democrats and enable Republicans to win states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin like Trump unlike the Republicans who have pursued the 3.8 of voters who are \u201csocially liberal\u201d and favor economically rigid policies that benefit Wall Street and corporatists.\u000a\u000aThe outlet found that Bannon \u201crepresented a clear ideological wing within the Trump White House and in the GOP electorate more broadly.\u201d Bannon-ism allowed Trump to appeal to various groups in the GOP primary and attract non-Republicans in the general election. In addition, Trump will need the support from the \u201cBannon wing\u201d to fend off potential primary challengers in 2020, according to the report. Yet, GOP establishment consultants, \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d and the media want to push GOP candidates to become more socially liberal and economically rigid to appeal to the narrow 3.8% of their fellow elites\u2013a surefire recipe for general election losses.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with the Economist, Bannon fought for his worldview and called out China (\u201cLet\u2019s go screw up One Belt One Road\u201d) and \u201cthe elites in Silicon Valley and Wall Street\u2014they\u2019re a bunch of globalists who have forgotten their fellow Americans.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI want the world to look back in 100 years and say, their mercantilist, Confucian system lost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Judeo-Christian liberal West won.\u201d\u000a\u000aBannon recalled when Republican leaders and even some of Trump\u2019s top advisers were distancing themselves from Trump during the 2016 campaign, Bannon\u2019s message to Trump was simple: \u201cWe are going for a nationalist message, we are going to go barbarian, and we will win.\u201d

aVHellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice impresses with sight and sound, but there isn\u2019t any meat on the game\u2019s bones.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aDeveloper Ninja Theory\u2019s latest work is a third-person action experience with all the depth of a mobile game, disguised by a thoroughly impressive audio/visual presentation. The title follows Senua, a Celtic warrior driven insane by the tragic death of her lover. She descends into the madness of her own personal hell in a quest to save his soul.\u000a\u000aI can still hear Senua\u2019s voices in my head. Her existence is a haunted one, and the constant chatter of doubt and fear, rage and pain, was oppressive. But even while they linger, I am hard pressed to recall a single moment where I enjoyed actually playing Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice. The game, which Ninja Theory states was \u201ccreated in collaboration with neuroscientists and people who experience psychosis,\u201d is a fascinating rumination on mental illness, couched in the fantastic horror of Viking mythology, but it just isn\u2019t much of a game.\u000a\u000aCombat is rudimentary, and every enemy in the game follows the same pattern. Press a button to dodge or parry until you have the opportunity to strike, and then repeat ad nauseum until the fight is over. There are light and heavy attacks to add a measure of variation, though they feel redundant in practice.\u000a\u000aThere is a button to slow everything down and make your attacks more potent, too. Mostly, it feels like a welcome relief from fighting some of the endlessly repetitive enemies.\u000a\u000aThe entirety of your time in Senua\u2019s world will be spent running along a thinly veiled corridor, broken up by occasional puzzle areas. Exploration is almost always punished \u2014 there are precious few paths that you will not be forced down at some point, and there are no rewards for your diligence in scouring the environment. It is a game that begs to be thoughtfully considered, then forces your gaze solely forward.\u000a\u000aMuch of the several hours of you spend with the game will be occupied by camera-hunt perspective puzzles that would only be mildly interesting, even if they were carefully measured. They aren\u2019t. Being given yet another set of glyphs to pace around the environment with in search of a match is tiresome after the third time, and that barely covers the first hour or so. Before you can even enter Helheim, you\u2019ll have already participated in about a dozen such errands.\u000a\u000aHellblade alleviates that tedium with arresting visual and sound design, only outshone by the sort of scenery-chewing protagonist I would love to see in a better game. I cannot overstate how compelling protagonist Senua herself truly is. She is beautifully animated, expressive, and actress Melina Juergens\u2019 performance is easily one of the best we\u2019ve seen in all of gaming. The interspersed live-action visions of Nicholas Boulton\u2019s Druth, Senua\u2019s mentor who she sees in visions, would be jarring in virtually any other game, but here a clever use of visual effects manages to make it work.\u000a\u000aAt $30, Hellblade is priced so that trying it out isn\u2019t too costly a gamble. And despite its brevity and infuriatingly repetitive design, the presentation alone is something that many will want to experience for themselves. Still, as games go, this is little more than a flashy, bloody walking simulator. If you are compelled by the promise of its narrative clout, I have no qualms about recommending that you take a trip into Senua\u2019s troubled psyche. But if you are looking for a great game to play, let the voices guide you elsewhere.\u000a\u000aFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.

aVThe Australian government is dealing with a bit of embarrassment over a photo in which Nick Warner, director general of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, did a \u201cfist pump\u201d alongside Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.\u000a\u000aAs the UK Guardian points out, the fist pump is Duterte\u2019s signature victory gesture, developed during a 2016 presidential campaign in which he promised to kill drug dealers by the thousands. According to international observers, Duterte has kept that promise, although many of the roughly 5,500 people killed since he came into office were not, strictly speaking, drug dealers. Some of them do not appear to have been criminals at all.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAmong the latest casualties of Duterte\u2019s drug war was 17-year-old student Kian Delos Santos, who was allegedly dragged from his home and murdered by police officers. A witness said he used his last words to beg the officers not to kill him because he had an important test coming up at school the next day.\u000a\u000aEven Duterte thought this was out of line, as he claims to have ordered the immediate arrest of the police officers involved. Furious Australian politicians thought it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d for Warner to pose with Duterte in a jovial fist-pump photo, as Labor MP Anthony Byrne put it.\u000a\u000aElaine Pearson of Human Rights Watch went further, saying it was \u201csickening\u201d to see Australians intelligence chief \u201cfist-pumping a man who has instigated the killing of thousands.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAustralia is sending mixed messages amid an incredible spike in killings of the Philippines poorest people. Australia must condemn in the strongest terms the killings by Philippines police of people without trial,\u201d said Michael Hayworth of Amnesty International.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not know the details of how it came about or who released the photograph, but of course, Australia\u2019s secret intelligence service is called a secret intelligence service for a reason, so preferably, the work that they do is below the surface,\u201d said Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop of the fist-pump photo on Thursday, probably wishing Warner had seen fit to keep his photo shoot with Duterte below the surface too.\u000a\u000aShe said she believed the photo was taken at Duterte\u2019s request during Warner\u2019s visit to the Philippine president\u2019s palace on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn both occasions that I\u2019ve met with President Duterte, I\u2019ve raised the issue of human rights and the extrajudicial killings,\u201d Bishop assured reporters.\u000a\u000aShe added that the ongoing Islamic State insurgency on the Philippine island of Mindanao is a \u201csignificant issue\u201d for the entire region, because it has \u201cthe potential to be the southeast Asian headquarters for ISIS,\u201d so Australian support for the Philippine government is crucial.\u000a\u000aAustralia formally listed the Islamic State in East Asia as a terrorist organization last week, noting that ISIS is actively recruiting extremists from Australia to join the battle for Mindanao.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for Duterte said on Thursday that the photo captured a \u201clighthearted\u201d moment between Warner and Duterte, a happy \u201cwarming of relationships\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t meant to be in any way political.\u201d

aVThis expansion has For more than eighty years, beginning with FDR\u2019s New Deal, Americans have witnessed a constant increase in the size and scope of the federal government.This expansion has continued unabated during both Democratic and Republican administrations.\u000a\u000aWhether measured in terms of dollars spent, or in terms of percentage of Gross Domestic Product (\u201cGDP\u201d) consumed by the federal government, big government has become inexorably bigger.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn 1940, federal spending was a relatively modest 9.6% of GDP \u2013 or $9.5 billion out of $98.2 billion. In 2009 under President Obama, federal spending hit a high water mark (excluding the World War II years) of 24.4% of GDP \u2013 or $3,517.7 billion out of $14,414.6 billion.\u000a\u000aThe growth of the federal civilian workforce has slowed since 1960 \u2013 levelling off between 2.5 and 3 million \u2013 but this has masked the transfer of federal programs to state and local bureaucracies. Since 1960, the number of state and local government employees has tripled to over 18 million. This growth has been driven by a tenfold increase in federal grants to cities and states.\u000a\u000aFor conservatives, this trend has been depressing. We plead for smaller government, but our cries have been futile as Congress and state legislatures refuse to make significant or lasting cuts in the size of government. The growth of the Leviathan has seemed unstoppable.\u000a\u000aThe forces pushing the expansion of government are powerful. Bureaucrats justify their existence by spending every dime appropriated to their agencies and then asking for more. Politicians of both parties find it easier to win votes by serving up pork than by offering austerity. Congresses deals with every crisis by spending money. And the progressive Left continually pushes the growth of entitlements for its own political advantage.\u000a\u000aFortunately, there is now hope in the fight against big government. There is a demographic sea change at work \u2013 something that has the potential to shift the forces in favor of conservatives who are serious about shrinking government. The baby boomers are retiring.\u000a\u000aThe baby boomer generation \u2013 those born between 1946 and 1964 \u2013 includes 76 million Americans. Over a 19 year period that started approximately in 2011, virtually all of them will retire. That\u2019s an average of four million people retiring every year, or nearly 11,000 every day. And a large percentage of them are working for the government. Government agencies across the federal government, as well as in state and local governments, are seeing a slew of retirements.\u000a\u000aTake the Social Security Administration. Starting in 2011, the SSA began seeing 4,000 retirements a year. The same is happening throughout the federal government. The bureaucrats see this as a crisis. Conservatives should see it as an opportunity.\u000a\u000aAttrition through retirement is causing federal and state workforces to turn over. Many of these retirees need not be replaced. The size of government can be dramatically reduced simply by making the decision not to fill every vacancy. And it doesn\u2019t take an act of Congress to do it. All it takes is political will in the executive branch not to fill vacancies. The only exceptions should be law enforcement agencies and the military.\u000a\u000aBut can it really be done in practice? The answer is yes, it can. I know because I\u2019ve done it. Shortly after I became Kansas Secretary of State in 2011, I saw baby boomer retirements occurring in my own agency. Realizing this opportunity, I directed my deputies to reassign the duties of retiring employees to those who remained. Wherever possible, the open positions were not to be filled. We left approximately 1/3 of the vacancies unfilled.\u000a\u000aOver the course of six years, I was able to shrink my agency\u2019s workforce by 18 percent. We did it through natural attrition, without massive layoffs. The smaller payroll, along with other cuts, also allowed me to reduce agency spending by over 30 percent. And the agency is still carrying out all of the same responsibilities that it was back in 2011.\u000a\u000aThe same must be done in the federal government and in state governments across the country. President Trump has already taken the first steps. In January he imposed a freeze on hiring. And in March he issued an executive order directing agencies to find redundancies and other ways to make cuts. Looking at the bloated federal bureaucracy, he pointed out, \u201cToday there is duplication and redundancy everywhere.\u201d Consequently, \u201cBillions and billions of dollars are being wasted.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen the hiring freeze is lifted, as it eventually will be, President Trump should order the relevant departments to fill no more than 2/3 of the vacancies that exist. Without such an order, the career bureaucrats will carry on as before, deeming every position necessary to be filled.\u000a\u000aThe baby boomers are creating those vacancies by the thousand as they retire. Fortunately, this historic opportunity coincides with a President who is serious about cutting the size of government. If he declines to fill those vacancies and if state governors do the same, we could witness the first substantial reduction in big government in our nation\u2019s history. But it will take political will to make it happen.\u000a\u000aKris W. Kobach is the elected Secretary of State of Kansas. An expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the Arizona SB-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the 10 ICE agents who sued to stop Obama\u2019s 2012 executive amnesty. In 2017 President Trump named him Vice Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity. His website is kriskobach.com.

aVKelly Sadler, a low-level staffer in the White House, lied about her credentials to push inaccurate leaked information to the press about the resignation of Dr. Sebastian Gorka from the administration.\u000a\u000aIn an email to a number of people in the media, Sadler opens up by saying the email is for \u201cBACKGROUND PURPOSES ONLY.\u201d That text is written in bright red, and bolded. The headline of the email is \u201cBackground on Sebastian Gorka.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn the body of the email, Sadler then writes to media figures covering the resignation of Dr. Gorka: \u201cFrom a White House Official: \u2018Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aShe rounds out the email to media elites by pleading: \u201cNo attribution to me, please. Senior White House official only.\u201d\u000a\u000aSadler\u2019s claim that she is a \u201cSenior White House official\u201d is not true.

Gorka sent the president a detailed resignation letter, as multiple media outlets have reported.\u000a\u000aIn his resignation letter, Gorka wrote to President Trump that given \u201crecent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are \u2013 for now \u2013 ascendant within the White House.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People\u2019s House,\u201d Gorka wrote. He went on:\u000a\u000aRegrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week. The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost. Just as worrying, when discussing our future actions in the region, the speech listed operational objectives without ever defining the strategic victory conditions we are fighting for. This omission should seriously disturb any national security professional, and any American who is unsatisfied with the last 16 years of disastrous policy decisions which have led to thousands of Americans killed and trillions of taxpayer dollars spent in ways that have not brought security or victory.\u000a\u000aThe White House refused to comment on Sadler\u2019s decision to inflate her credentials to lie about Gorka\u2019s resignation.

aVCORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) \u2014 Hurricane Harvey settled over southeast Texas early Saturday, lashing the state\u2019s Gulf Coast with damaging winds and dumping torrents of rain over hundreds of miles of coastline that braced for what forecasters predicted would be life-threatening storm surges \u2013 basically walls of water moving inland.\u000a\u000aThe fiercest hurricane to hit the U.S. in more than a decade made landfall Friday night about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Corpus Christi as a Category 4 storm with 130 mph (209 kph) winds. It gradually weakened over the next several hours and the National Hurricane Center said that by 5 a.m. Saturday Harvey was downgraded to a Category 1 \u2013 still sustaining winds of 90 mph (144 kph). It had already dumped more than 9 inches (228.6 millimeters) of rain in the South Texas city of Victoria and had knocked out power to more than 200,000 customers.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHarvey\u2019s approach sent tens of thousands of residents fleeing inland, hoping to escape the wrath of a menacing storm that threatens not only the coast but a wide swath of Texas that is home to oil refineries, chemical plants and dangerously flood-prone Houston, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city.\u000a\u000aNo deaths were immediately confirmed in the hours after Harvey\u2019s arrival, but officials noted emergency crews couldn\u2019t get out in many places due to high winds. Melissa Munguia, deputy emergency management coordinator in Nueces County, which includes Corpus Christi, said early Saturday that it could be hours before crews could fully assess the damage in coastal communities.\u000a\u000aEarly reports did begin to emerge from Rockport, a coastal city of about 10,000 people that was directly in Harvey\u2019s path when it came ashore. Officials confirmed that the roof of Rockport\u2019s high school had partially caved in and that the community\u2019s historic downtown saw extensive damage.\u000a\u000aRockport City Manager Kevin Carruth told local media outlets that multiple people had been taken to the county\u2019s jail for assessment and treatment after the roof of a senior housing complex collapsed. KIII-TV reported that 10 people were treated there.\u000a\u000aEarlier Friday, Rockport Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Rios had offered ominous advice, telling the station that those who chose to stay put rather than evacuate the area \u201cshould make some type of preparation to mark their arm with a Sharpie pen,\u201d implying doing so would make it easier for rescuers to identify them.\u000a\u000aIn Corpus Christi, the major city closest to the storm\u2019s center, wind whipped palm trees and stinging sheets of horizontal rain slapped against hotels and office buildings along the city\u2019s seawall as the storm made landfall. Boats bobbed violently in the marina. It was too dark to tell whether any boats had broken their moorings.\u000a\u000aFueled by warm Gulf of Mexico waters, Harvey grew rapidly, accelerating from a Category 1 early Friday morning to a Category 4 by evening. Its transformation from an unnamed storm to a life-threatening behemoth took only 56 hours, an incredibly fast intensification.\u000a\u000aHarvey came ashore as the fiercest hurricane to hit the U.S. in 13 years and the strongest to strike Texas since 1961\u2019s Hurricane Carla, the most powerful Texas hurricane on record. Based on the atmospheric pressure, Harvey ties for the 18th strongest hurricane on landfall in the U.S. since 1851 and ninth strongest in Texas.\u000a\u000aA worst case scenario is that the hurricane could hug the coast for days and stay strong enough to remain a tropical storm. Forecasts call for as much as 30 inches (.76 meters) of rain to fall by next Wednesday, with some areas getting as much as 40 inches (1 meter), according to the hurricane center. Meanwhile, the storm surge could bring flooding of 6 to 12 feet (2 to 4 meters) to a coastal area that includes Matagorda Island and Port O\u2019Connor.\u000a\u000aSometime early next week forecasters said it could go back into the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, which provide fuel, then turn back in for a potential second hit on what may be an already flooded Houston-Galveston area.\u000a\u000aBefore the storm arrived, home and business owners raced to nail plywood over windows and fill sandbags. Steady traffic filled the highways leaving Corpus Christi, but there were no apparent jams. In Houston, where mass evacuations can include changing major highways to a one-way vehicle flow, authorities left traffic patterns unchanged.\u000a\u000aJust hours before the projected landfall, the governor and Houston leaders issued conflicting statements on evacuation.\u000a\u000aAfter Gov. Greg Abbott urged more people to flee, Houston authorities told people to remain in their homes and recommended no widespread evacuations.\u000a\u000aIn a Friday press conference that addressed Houston officials\u2019 decision to not have a voluntary or mandatory evacuation, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said there might be a \u201cgreater danger\u201d in having people who don\u2019t need to be evacuated on roads that could flood.\u000a\u000aHarris County Judge Ed Emmett said that because the hurricane was not taking direct aim at Houston, the city\u2019s primary concern was heavy flooding.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not having a hurricane,\u201d said Emmett, the top elected official for the county, which encompasses Houston. \u201cWe are having a rain event.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt a convenience store in Houston\u2019s Meyerland neighborhood, at least 12 cars lined up for fuel. Brent Borgstedte said this was the fourth gas station he had visited to try to fill up his son\u2019s car. The 55-year-old insurance agent shrugged off Harvey\u2019s risks.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is really that worried about it. I\u2019ve lived here my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through several hurricanes.\u201d\u000a\u000aScientists warned that Harvey could swamp counties more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) inland and stir up dangerous surf as far away as Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) from the projected landfall.\u000a\u000aIt may also spawn tornadoes. Even after weakening, the system might spin out into the Gulf and regain strength before hitting Houston a second time Wednesday as a tropical storm, forecasters said.\u000a\u000aAll seven Texas counties on the coast from Corpus Christi to the western end of Galveston Island ordered mandatory evacuations from low-lying areas. Four counties ordered full evacuations and warned there was no guarantee of rescue for people staying behind.\u000a\u000aState officials said they had no count on how many people actually left their homes.\u000a\u000aThe storm posed the first major emergency management test of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The president was expected to receive briefings during the weekend at Camp David, and signed a federal disaster declaration for coastal counties Friday night.\u000a\u000aThe last Category 4 storm to hit the U.S. was Hurricane Charley in August 2004 in Florida. Superstorm Sandy, which pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, never had the high winds and had lost tropical status by the time it struck. But it was devastating without formally being called a major hurricane.\u000a\u000aHarvey is the first significant hurricane to hit Texas since Ike in September 2008 brought winds of 110 mph (177 kph) to the Galveston and Houston areas, inflicting $22 billion in damage.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s taking aim at the same vicinity as Carla, which had wind gusts estimated at 175 mph and inflicted more than $300 million in damage. The storm killed 34 people and forced about 250,000 people to evacuate.

aVAn elderly Pennsylvania woman was set upon, beaten, and had her head shaved by her daughter and granddaughter because she had the volume of the Pittsburgh Steelers game up too high, police say.\u000a\u000aThe incident occurred on August 20 as the 77-year-old victim was listening to the Steelers game on the radio in her Youngwood home, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aPolice say that the elderly woman\u2019s daughter, Delores M.

aVThe Cuban government has yet to release Daniel Llorente, a dissident arrested for waving an American flag during the nation\u2019s communist May Day parade this year, from a mental health ward his family was told he was confined to following the incident because he believes in God.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban-American outlet Mart Noticias spoke to Llorente from the psychiatric ward where he has been kept since May this week. In the short call, Llorente says he has been told he needs a special form to be released from the institution, but keeps being refused the document. \u201cI\u2019ve been to several places, nobody tells me anything\u2014all it is is waiting, waiting, waiting,\u201d he lamented.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLlorente was beaten publicly by plainclothes state security agents on May 1 after he ran in front of the parade with his American flag. He was subsequently arrested but\u2014partly due to international pressure from the human rights community, and partly due to Llorente\u2019s status as not a member of any Cuban dissident or pro-democracy organization\u2014the Cuban government did not place him in prison, despite awaiting trial on charges of \u201cpublic disorder and resistance.\u201d\u000a\u000aInstead, police placed Llorente in a \u201cmental health facility\u201d that most in the Cuban exile community know as the dreaded \u201cMazorra,\u201d which the government traditionally used for mental health cases professionals deemed hopeless. Llorente\u2019s family has said that he has since been deprived of sunlight and forced to take unidentified medications, which he told relatives sedated him.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey say that since he believes in God and is always talking about that \u2026 they say that is a disorder,\u201d teenage son Elicer Llorente told Mart in June. \u201cThat is a lie. He told me to talk to journalists from the first day I visited him because he signed himself out of the institution and has not been let out.\u201d\u000a\u000aLlorente attempted to go on hunger strike temporarily in June.\u000a\u000aLlorente had previously caused a commotion in May 2016, when the first American cruise ship came to shore in Havana. At the time, Llorente brought his American flag to greet the ship and was arrested while shouting \u201cyes we can!\u201d the slogan of the Barack Obama presidential campaign. At the time, Llorente said on camera that Cubans attending the May Day parade were \u201chypocrites\u201d and that he waved the American flag because \u201cI don\u2019t fear the government.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe use of alleged psychiatric treatment to contain outspoken anti-communist dissidents has long been part of the Cuban regime\u2019s approach towards oppressing its opponents. Communist officials have apparently attempted to use the threat of psychiatric detention with other dissidents\u2014in a recent case, with three men who publicly opposed celebrations of the 26 of July.\u000a\u000aCuba observes July 26 as a holiday, as on this date in 1953, Fidel Castro and his cronies violently attacked the Moncada Barracks, killing fifteen soldiers and three police officers\u2014an event the communist dictatorship celebrates.\u000a\u000aOn July 26, 2017, three men\u2014brothers Alberto and Leonardo Ramrez Odio and father Alberto de La Caridad Ramrez took to a balcony with large signs reading \u201c58 years of deceit, hunger, and misery\u201d and \u201cthe people demand freedom, justice, democracy.\u201d The men chanted \u201cDown with the dictatorship! Down with Fidel! Down with Raul!\u201d They were summarily beaten by an official state gang and arrested.\u000a\u000aLast week, family reported that the three were taken to a psychiatric hospital and kept on a bus to watch from afar for about an hour before being returned to prison. The trip appeared to be a threat to keep them imprisoned in a psychiatric facility without a trial, indefinitely.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban regime has become significantly more violent against dissidents since President Barack Obama announced a series of diplomatic concessions to the Castro regime in 2016. According to the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN), an NGO that tracks politically-motivated arrests on the island, the number of political prisoners in Cuba doubled between April 2016 and April 2017.

I strongly endorse Danny Tarkanian for the United States Senate and look forward to helping him win this important election.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTarkanian responded by thanking Palin, and pledging to stand up for President Donald Trump in a way that incumbent career politician Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) has not.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thank Governor Palin for her endorsement and appreciate the confidence she has shown in our campaign,\u201d Tarkanian said. \u201cI will hold Dean Heller accountable for turning his back on Nevadans by voting against the repeal of Obamacare and helping Hillary Clinton win Nevada by attacking Donald Trump over and over again.\u201d\u000a\u000aTarkanian\u2019s race against Heller comes as Heller, a far-outside-the-mainstream establishment Republican, has not stood with President Trump on most issues. For instance, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Heller \u201cbragged about his dissent against the Republican-backed health reform bills\u201d and he \u201cstated he would continue to uphold\u201d support for former President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive amnesty for illegal alien youths.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Heller announced his opposition to the idea that President Trump would pardon Arizona\u2019s former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not from Arizona, I see this from a distance and I read it, so on, so forth,\u201d Heller said of Trump\u2019s position on Arpaio, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \u201cBut I just want to make the point that the president was going to come to Phoenix yesterday and pardon him, and chose not to do so. And I certainly hope that\u2019s the position that he has in the future.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Trump was in Phoenix on Tuesday night, he hinted at a looming pardon he plans to grant Sheriff Joe. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll make a prediction: I think he\u2019s going to be just fine,\u201d Trump said in the Phoenix speech. \u201cOK? But I won\u2019t do it tonight, because I don\u2019t want to cause any controversy.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike Heller, though, Tarkanian supports the president when it comes to Arpaio.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe President had very good things to say about Sheriff Joe Arpaio last night (Tuesday) in Arizona and if he makes the decision to pardon Arpaio, then I will strongly endorse and support that decision. It is wrong for Dean Heller to publicly oppose the President\u2019s action even before the President has formally announced his decision,\u201d Tarkanian said per local news reports.\u000a\u000aHeller also, per CNN, announced after the Senate failed to repeal and replace Obamacare that he was \u201cpleased\u201d with how it turned out.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wake up every morning trying to figure out what\u2019s best for the state of Nevada, what can I do for Nevada families. And obviously we got in the middle of this health care battle and I feel real pleased at the way this thing turned out and we\u2019re turning the page now to tax reform,\u201d Heller said after Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) switched to voting against efforts to repeal Obamacare.\u000a\u000aPolling data on the race suggests that Tarkanian has a chance to topple Heller in Nevada, should he gain momentum moving into the next several months. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, is likely to fight as hard as he can to save Heller\u2014but endorsements from major national conservative figures like Palin open the door to a potential upset.\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s endorsement of Trump in Iowa before the caucuses last year was critical in solidifying the president\u2019s position with conservatives. Trump came in second in Iowa\u2019s caucuses to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) but went on to win the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina and then stormed his way to the GOP nomination and then the presidency.

His testimony described a tool that resembled theories of how some U.S. diplomats may have been severely injured by sonic devices in Havana.\u000a\u000aIn a briefing Thursday, the U.S. State Department confirmed that at least 16 U.S. diplomats suffered a variety of physical symptoms doctors believe were prompted by a sophisticated \u201csonic\u201d device.

aVPro-Donald J. Trump GOP U.S. Senate challenger Danny Tarkanian has blown past incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV), an opponent of the president and much of his agenda, per a new poll out of the state of Nevada obtained exclusively by Breitbart News ahead of its public release.\u000a\u000aTarkanian, per the new poll from JMC Analytics, is up at 39 percent in the new survey. His lead towers eight points over the incumbent Heller\u2019s 31 percent, spelling certain trouble for Senate GOP establishment forces desperate to save Heller\u2019s seat. A whopping 31 percent are undecided between Heller and Tarkanian. Even so, when given the choice of Heller versus not Tarkanian, a majority of Republicans in Nevada\u201451 percent\u2014want someone other than Heller, 31 percent would renominate Heller, and 18 percent are undecided.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe survey of 700 likely GOP voters in Nevada was conducted from Aug. 24 to Aug. 25 and has a margin of error of 3.7 percent with a 95 percent confidence interval.\u000a\u000aHeller\u2019s approval rating is underwater, down to just 34 percent of Nevada Republicans approving of his job performance, while 48 percent disapprove. Sixteen percent have no opinion and two percent have not heard of Heller.\u000a\u000aTarkanian\u2019s numbers are exactly the opposite, as he has high approval ratings among those who know him. A significant 42 percent approve of Tarkanian, while 23 percent disapprove, 30 percent have no opinion, and five percent have never heard of him.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s approval ratings are sky-high among Nevada Republicans, with 80 percent approving of the president\u2019s job\u2014and only 14 percent disapproving, while six percent have no opinion.\u000a\u000aJMC Analytics\u2019 John Couvillon wrote in his analysis of the poll:\u000a\u000aJMC Analytics and Polling independently conducted this poll for the Nevada U.S. Senate Republican primary to be held next year. Next year\u2019s Senate race already has the potential to be competitive, given that (1) Senator Heller won his first term in 2012 with a 46-45% plurality, and (2) in last year\u2019s Presidential election, Hillary Clinton carried the state 48-46%. But while the general election will be a challenge (Nevada is one of two Republican held Senate seats that Democrats could put in play next November), Senator Heller has a more immediate problem: he faces a substantial primary challenge as well.\u000a\u000aCouvillon continued by noting that Tarkanian is a serious contender, and that a Trump endorsement of either candidate could significantly swing this race. Couvillon wrote:\u000a\u000aThis is one primary race where President Trump\u2019s involvement could make a difference. Republicans in Nevada give him an 80-14% approval rating, and a Trump endorsement would by a 64-13% margin make the respondent more likely to support his endorsed candidate. And given Tarkanian\u2019s recent strong endorsement of Trump policies, it appears some of that is already happening: those more likely to be impacted by a Trump endorsement favor Tarkanian 43-30% over Heller (27% undecided), while those less likely to be impacted by a Trump endorsement favor Heller 35-23% (42% undecided). Those who say the endorsement doesn\u2019t matter favor Tarkanian 35-31% (35% undecided) \u2013 these undecideds almost exactly equal the margin by which Tarkanian leads Heller. In summary, Senator Heller faces a substantial primary challenge from Danny Tarkanian in a race that ultimately could determine partisan control of the U.S. Senate.\u000a\u000aTarkanian\u2019s new lead over Heller comes on the heels of an endorsement from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee.\u000a\u000a\u201cDanny Tarkanian is a conservative outsider who will support the \u2018America First\u2019 policies our nation needs to survive and thrive, including building the border wall, ending sanctuary cities, and finally repealing Obamacare,\u201d Palin said in the statement endorsing Tarkanian, provided exclusively to Breitbart News. \u201cCommonsense Conservatives in Nevada and across America need to unite and help win this critical fight. I strongly endorse Danny Tarkanian for the United States Senate and look forward to helping him win this important election.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thank Governor Palin for her endorsement and appreciate the confidence she has shown in our campaign,\u201d Tarkanian said in response, thanking Palin for the endorsement. \u201cI will hold Dean Heller accountable for turning his back on Nevadans by voting against the repeal of Obamacare and helping Hillary Clinton win Nevada by attacking Donald Trump over and over again.\u201d\u000a\u000aTarkanian will join Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 on Saturday morning this weekend to discuss his new lead in the Senate race.\u000a\u000aNevada Senate Executive Summary

aVThe Inspector General for Tax Administration has discovered that under Commissioner John Koskinen, the Internal Revenue Service re-hired 212 employees it had previously fired for offenses including tax evasion, theft, and abuse of taxpayer data.\u000a\u000aThe title of the report makes it clear that the IRS \u201ccontinues to rehire former employees with conduct and performance issues.\u201d The inspection was requested by a U.S. Senator, who is not named in the report, although Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) introduced legislation to block the agency from rehiring such employees shortly after the report was released.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether it is the rehiring of previously terminated employees or continuing to give bonuses to poorly performing executives who can\u2019t be fired \u2013 the delinquency at the IRS must end,\u201d Burr declared. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly actions like this that erode the public\u2019s trust in their government. The American people are sick and tired of Washington at its worst. We have Americans paying the salaries of IRS workers who have repeatedly cheated the very government they took an oath to serve, and a Commissioner who won\u2019t fire bad actors. The time to put a stop to these atrocious practices is now.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs noted in a FedSmith report on Burr\u2019s legislation, this is actually the second time he has attempted to block the IRS from restoring employees it fired for serious offenses. His effort last year was prompted by an Inspector General report very similar to this one. On that previous occasion, Burr noted that one of the employees re-hired by IRS literally had \u201cDO NOT REHIRE\u201d stamped on his or her personnel file.\u000a\u000aThe office of the Inspector General (TIGTA) is painfully aware that little improvement has occurred since last year\u2019s report. In fact, the new publication notes with dismay that \u201cnearly 300 of the 824 employees identified in the prior report were still employed by the IRS as of May 2016.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso, TIGTA notes that IRS is already required by federal law to consider prior conduct issues when rehiring terminated employees, under the IRS Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. Evidently that law is simply ignored, or rendered null and void by inept employment procedures.\u000a\u000aThe new report describes bureaucratic buffoonery that would be amusing, if the money and sensitive data of American taxpayers were not on the line. For example, IRS has an extensive \u201cALERTS\u201d database filled with records of employee misconduct\u2026 but the people who actually make hiring decisions do not have access to it. A few dozen of the problematic rehired personnel were able to evade IRS employment screening by simply forgetting to mention they were previously terminated for cause by the agency.\u000a\u000aTwo employees who couldn\u2019t make the grade as tax examining technicians were rehired for the same position less than six months later, on the grounds that the job requirements had changed.\u000a\u000aRobert Wood at Forbes tallies up the other offenses: \u201cFour of the more than 200 employees had been terminated or resigned for willful failure to properly file their Federal tax returns; four separated while under investigation for unauthorized accesses to taxpayer information; and 86 separated while under investigation for absences and leave, workplace disruption, or failure to follow instructions.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne rehired employee had a legal record that included misdemeanor theft and felony possession of a forgery device. The Treasury Department normally frowns on that sort of thing.\u000a\u000aThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s Daily Signal chalks up the report as more evidence that President Trump should fire IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who has been strongly criticized by Republicans ever since the dawn of the Tea Party targeting scandal.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe average American is not happy with the way the IRS behaves on a good day. It\u2019s disappointing that they are rehiring people who were fired for very bad behavior,\u201d Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist told the Daily Signal. He complained that the difficulty of getting past civil service and union protections to fire bad federal employees \u201cmakes my head hurt.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorquist threw in a little free advice for President Trump, noting that if he doesn\u2019t fire Koskinen soon, the IRS Commissioner might make some public statement about Trump\u2019s taxes that would make it politically impossible for the president to fire him a repeat performance of the James Comey fiasco.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know why President Trump hasn\u2019t fired John Koskinen since there is more evidence the agency is mismanaged,\u201d agreed Peter Flaherty of the National Legal and Policy Center. \u201cKoskinen is a very typical Washington creature and is very at home in the swamp. It\u2019s a puzzle to me why Trump hasn\u2019t acted.\u201d\u000a\u000aThus far the response from the IRS has consisted of boilerplate assurances that it will \u201ctake all steps allowable to prevent the rehiring of former employees with conduct and performance issues,\u201d which would sound less risible if the same problem had not been identified in last year\u2019s TIGTA report. Internal Revenue Service spokespeople should at least do taxpayers the courtesy of pinky-swearing that they\u2019ll do better this time.

A fan also compiled a \u201ctranslated\u201d version of the post with the proper names of Half-Life characters, aliens, and locations replacing the pseudonyms in Laidlaw\u2019s original blog.\u000a\u000aIn a tweet, Laidlaw called the \u201cfanfic\u201d a \u201cgenderswapped snapshot of a dream I had many years ago.\u201d When someone pointed out that it hardly seemed like a \u201cfanfic\u201d as Laidlaw wrote the story for the previous Half-Life games, the writer, who resigned from Half-Life developer Valve in 2016, reasserted: \u201cAt this point I\u2019m operating strictly in a fan capacity.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, this is almost certainly the most closure fans will ever get for the legendary first-person shooter franchise, as Valve shifts its focus to competitive gaming and its megalithic online store. A link to the translated version of the blog was posted on the popular /r/Gaming subreddit and rocketed to the top of Reddit\u2019s front page, with over 10,000 comments at the time of this writing, many of which lamented the thought that Laidlaw revealing the potential plot for an unreleased Half-Life title must be a sure sign the franchise is truly dead.\u000a\u000aFrankly, it\u2019s a difficult read. There are still questions left unanswered, and even with this general story closure, it\u2019s difficult not to pine for a proper, playable ending. But Laidlaw has given fans some measure of closure regarding his vision for what is easily the most infuriating cliffhanger in gaming history, and it looks as if that is all we will get for the foreseeable future.\u000a\u000aFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.

aVFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has endorsed Roy Moore in the Alabama U.S. Senate race over establishment-backed Luther Strange, an endorsement Palin and Moore\u2019s campaign provided to Breitbart News ahead of its public release.\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s endorsement of Moore\u2014the former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court\u2014ahead of the Sept. 26 runoff is a huge momentum booster for the conservative candidate as he extends his commanding lead in the polls over Strange.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cGlad he\u2019s running and am honored to endorse Judge Roy Moore for the US Senate,\u201d Palin said in the endorsement statement. \u201cJudge Moore has shown he has what it takes to stand up to the out-of-touch political establishment. The Judge has proven he\u2019s not afraid of a fight for what is right, and he\u2019s ready to take on DC\u2019s swamp monsters and help make America great again. We need more bold leaders like Judge Moore who will fight for all of us in the US Senate.\u201d\u000a\u000aMoore, in response, thanked Palin for the endorsement and said he was honored to have it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am honored to have the endorsement of Governor Sarah Palin,\u201d Moore said. \u201cGovernor Palin has a strong record of speaking out for conservative causes and standing up to the Washington establishment. Having her support shows how conservatives across the country are uniting behind our campaign to send a message to Mitch McConnell and the Washington elites who are trying to buy this election.\u201d\u000a\u000aMoore, in two separate recent polls, has taken a commanding lead over Strange after the Aug. 15 primary heading into the Sept. 26 runoff. A JMC Analytics survey has Moore at 51 percent and Strange lagging significantly far behind at 32 percent. A Decision Desk HQ poll has Strange down around 32 percent and Moore over 50 percent as well.\u000a\u000aTo mitigate the damage, Strange\u2019s and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s allies at the vehemently anti-Trump Senate Leadership Fund fabricated a new push poll showing Moore up four points over Strange\u2014leading Strange 45 percent to 41 percent.\u000a\u000aThe survey conducted at the McConnell group Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s behest by pollster Jan van Lohuizen was conducted from Aug. 21 to Aug. 23, surveying 601 GOP voters with a margin of error of four points. The fact that they could not even produce a push poll that shows the candidate they support, Strange, in the lead is a stark admission of just how badly Strange\u2019s campaign is doing in Alabama. Strange\u2019s allies leaked the push poll to the Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker, a writer who often sides with the GOP establishment.\u000a\u000aThe Senate Leadership Fund is run by Steven Law, an anti-Trump GOP establishment activist who has worked alongside Karl Rove at American Crossroads. President Trump thinks very lowly of Rove, telling Breitbart News in an April 2016 interview that Rove is a \u201cdishonorable guy.\u201d Trump believes that Rove should not be allowed to write for the Wall Street Journal, as he is so \u201cdishonorable,\u201d and Law\u2019s and Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s deep ties to Rove only hurt Strange more than he is already hurting in the race.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, Strange and his allies are planning\u2014sources close to them tell Breitbart News\u2014a series of smear tactics against Moore in the final weeks. The attacks are likely to revive old and baseless charges against Moore, these sources say\u2013something Moore is ready for, given the fact that the Washington establishment has already dumped more than $10 million into Alabama on behalf of the failing Strange\u2019s campaign. In an interview with Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 this past weekend, Moore said he was ready for the onslaught of false attacks from Strange and his D.C. allies.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think $14 million is exactly the problem they got, but with the results they got they better start wondering when they\u2019re going to stop throwing away their money,\u201d Moore told Breitbart News Sunday. \u201cAttack ads aren\u2019t working in this state. It\u2019s obvious when an opponent attacks both of his opponents with negative ads or even one, but both opponents? They\u2019ve been trying to manipulate this race from the very beginning and they\u2019ve simply failed. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re planning in the future. I expect they\u2019re going to continue to come up and present some negative ads that are false in their nature because they got the money to do it and they know we\u2019re strapped with money. But still, God has given the people vision to see through this.\u201d\u000a\u000aStrange\u2019s decision to align himself against President Trump on the issue of whether to eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the U.S. Senate when it comes to passing legislation further complicates matters. Moore stands firmly with President Trump, against McConnell, in believing that the filibuster rule should be eliminated. Strange actually joined dozens of other establishment senators from both the GOP and Democratic Party in writing a letter to McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer earlier this year opposing the president and pushing for no changes to the rules. Strange\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Shana Teehan has not responded when asked if the senator regrets signing that letter or would like to remove his name from the anti-Trump document.\u000a\u000aMoore, meanwhile, is 100 percent with Trump on changing the Senate rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the people should understand that this is a rule\u2014it\u2019s not a Constitutional rule, it\u2019s a Senate rule,\u201d Moore told Breitbart News Sunday. \u201cThe Founding Fathers described when they preferred super majorities on things like vetoes of presidents, overriding a veto, or expelling a member from one of the two houses of Congress or passing a Constitutional amendment. They have a super majority rule which is simply a rule of anything over a majority which is one over half. It\u2019s not in the Constitution. Quite frankly, it\u2019s unconstitutional. And it\u2019s preventing many bills from going through the Senate. They can\u2019t even get to the floor because of the filibuster rule. A filibuster is different. That\u2019s when you protest bills and speak against them. They can have ways to get that restricted but they can\u2019t put a 60-vote rule and cling to that and say that\u2019s what the Constitution says\u2014it isn\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000aStrange, whose campaign is struggling to gain momentum, has refused to appear on Breitbart News radio on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 to discuss his campaign. It is unclear why he is refusing to talk to conservatives who support the president.\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s move to endorse Moore comes after she endorsed Danny Tarkanian against Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in Nevada\u2019s GOP primary earlier on Thursday, also in a Breitbart News exclusive.

aVNBC News is reporting that President Donald Trump is likely to shut down former President Barack Obama\u2019s legally untenable \u2018DACA amnesty for 800,000 illegals.\u000a\u000aThe news comes as Democratic politicians intensify their opposition to immigration reforms intended to benefit Americans, such as Trump\u2019s popular wage-boosting RAISE Act and his promised border wall. NBC reported:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump appears likely to pull the plug on DACA, the Obama-era program allowing young people who came to the U.S. illegally as children to remain here, several government officials said Friday. Administration officials said the Department of Homeland Security sent a recommendation to the White House earlier this week on what to do, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed the program with senior officials Thursday at the White House. Sessions has been a consistent opponent of the program, formally known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\u000a\u000aThe president can choose to end the program immediately, would cancel roughly 800,000 two-year work permits held by the illegals, who vary in age from 18 to the early 40s. Trump could also announce that he will stop awarding new two-year work permits, which will gradually end the program sometime in mid-2018.\u000a\u000aDemocrats are trying to preserve the DACA program by describing Trump and his voters as racists.\u000a\u000a\u201cKilling the DACA program as the Trump administration\u2019s first post-Charlottesville move would be absolutely shameful,\u201d claimed Vanita Gupta, the left-wing social engineer who directed Obama\u2019s civic-regulation office at the Department of Justice. \u201cWe must not allow the hate violence that we saw on the streets of Charlottesville to become the guiding force for policy making,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aDreamers are not a bargaining chip for the border wall and inhumane deportation force.

The lawsuit is expected to kill the program because the groups of AG use the same legal arguments to end Obama\u2019s 2014 \u2018DAPA\u2019 amnesty for roughly 4 million parents of illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aThe DACA program is expected to gradually grow to roughly 1.5 million people, as additional young illegal immigrants leave K-12 schools and ask for the DACA work permits.\u000a\u000aDemocrats \u2014 and some business-affiliated GOP legislators \u2014 want to Trump to sign legislation offering a full legal amnesty to the DACA illegals. But that full amnesty would also put the parents on track to become citizens, boosting DACA amnesty numbers up to roughly 2.5 million, estimated one immigration expert.

Gorka wrote:\u000a\u000aRegrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week. \u2026 The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost.\u000a\u000aGorka had also become deeply frustrated with the unprecedented levels of personal abuse propagated against him by the mainstream media \u2013which included attacks against Gorka\u2019a children \u2013 as well the numerous bureaucratic obstacles used to slow down his work on national security issues, including delaying Gorka\u2019s final permanent national security clearance.\u000a\u000aDuring his time in the administration, Gorka focused on key issues such as tackling radical Islamic terrorism, the diplomatic crisis in Qatar, and managing relations with China. He also earned a reputation as a formidable media persona, repeatedly ripping mainstream media networks such as CNN for their propagation of fake news narratives.\u000a\u000aBreitbart is currently in negotiations with Dr. Gorka regarding his support for the website, as well as collaboration on a joint venture that would embody a Jacksonian national security vision.\u000a\u000aYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com

Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading,\u201d wrote The New York Times\u2018 Mike Isaac. \u201cFor months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple\u2019s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased \u2014 a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cBut Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been breaking some of our rules,\u201d Cook allegedly said to Kalanick during the meeting, before adding that the CEO must \u201cStop the trickery\u2026 or Uber\u2019s app would be kicked out of Apple\u2019s App Store.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe New York Times added that because a removal of Uber from the App Store would result in the loss of the app\u2019s primary market and millions of iPhone users, Kalanick was forced to adhere to Apple\u2019s rules from then on.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a quest to build Uber into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered,\u201d The Times claimed. \u201cHe has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt has been a rough year for Kalanick and Uber. In January, #DeleteUber started to trend on Twitter after the company refused to become involved in a taxi strike against President Trump\u2019s travel ban. Uber had announced at the time that surge prices were temporarily halted in order to attract customers, while other taxi companies protested and refused to pick up people from JFK Airport.\u000a\u000aIn response to the move, ride-sharing service Lyft donated $1 million to the ACLU and released a statement against President Trump and in support of refugees. The boycott movement launched ride-sharing service Lyft to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store and bombarded Uber with one-star reviews.\u000a\u000aThe protest eventually led Kalanick to resign from his position on President Trump\u2019s business advisory group, though not before another controversy took place just weeks later.\u000a\u000aAfter an Uber driver started to shout at Kalanick, who was acting as a passenger, the Uber CEO started to argue with him, unaware that the incident was being caught on tape.\u000a\u000aIn the video, \u201cThe driver in a dash cam tells Kalanick, a passenger, that \u2018people are not trusting you anymore,\u2019 and complains that rates for drivers have fallen,\u201d before the Uber CEO responds to the driver, claiming, \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else.

aVIn testimony published Thursday, Lus Ziga \u2013 a Cuban dissident who spent 19 years in political prison \u2013 detailed his experience seeing the use of \u201cacoustic attacks\u201d on political prisoners to damage their brains and ultimately kill them. His testimony described a tool that resembled theories of how some U.S. diplomats may have been severely injured by sonic devices in Havana.\u000a\u000aIn a briefing Thursday, the U.S. State Department confirmed that at least 16 U.S. diplomats suffered a variety of physical symptoms doctors believe were prompted by a sophisticated \u201csonic\u201d device. Multiple news outlets have reported that the symptoms vary from headaches and vomiting to more severe issues like permanent hearing loss and brain damage.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aZiga testified to watching Cuban state police kill a man with sonic torture. The Miami-based Cuban Democratic Directorate issued a statement regarding his testimony arguing that acoustic attacks were \u201cnot alien to the Castro agenda.\u201d They cited Ziga\u2019s testimony, delivered on July 15 to Justice Cuba, as proof that others had witnessed such incidents on the island.\u000a\u000aAccording to Ziga, prison guards would place large speakers near the cells and broadcast \u201ca sound that was like short-wave radio when it was not set on any particular station and would emit shrill sounds.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe torture would go on all day and night and \u2026 ended when a prisoner, Rafael Del Pino Siero, died,\u201d he noted. \u201cSince we were in individual cells, nobody could know if he hung himself or he was hanged, but the truth is he died under torture.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe former political prisoner detailed a variety of incidents of torture that he witnessed both in prisons like Combinado del Este, notorious as a torture ward for political dissidents, and \u201cpsychiatric facilities\u201d like the institution informally known as \u201cMazorra,\u201d where dissidents would receive electroshock torture.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was a victim and witness to innumerable cases of torture, cruel and inhuman treatment, mutilations,\u201d he told those convened, noting that some prisons were mixed gender and women could be heard receiving severe beatings from men in their cells.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey beat all political prisoners \u2026 systematically, because the goal was not just to punish you for rebelling or opposing the communist dictatorship, but to destroy your soul, subject your spirit, humble you, turn you into almost an animal,\u201d he asserted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was the official, systematic policy of prisons.\u201d\u000a\u000aDenuncia expreso poltico cubano Lus Ziga ante Justice Cuba: https://t.co/7BQ5WGDKZx via @YouTube \u2014 Directorio (@DirectorioCuba) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aZiga testified to seeing a guard cut half of a prisoner\u2019s hand off with a machete for complaining about the quality of the food and hearing of a man forced into electroshock torture at Mazorra for having relayed confidential information he heard guards discussing to outsiders. \u201cHe received 14 sessions of electroshock: five in the head and ten in the testicles,\u201d Ziga declared.\u000a\u000aMazorra is the location currently holding Daniel Llorente, a Cuban dissident who was detained after daring to wave an American flag at a communist parade in May.\u000a\u000aZiga\u2019s testimony serves as both a reminder of the Castro regime\u2019s brutality and its history of using torture against its enemies.

aVDirector James Cameron sparked an uproar on social media Thursday after saying in an interview that this summer\u2019s blockbuster film Wonder Woman represented a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for female protagonists in Hollywood.\u000a\u000aIn a lengthy interview with the Guardian to discuss the re-release of his 1984 mega-hit Terminator 2: Judgement Day in 3D, the Oscar-winning filmmaker said he couldn\u2019t understand the critical frenzy surrounding Gal Gadot\u2019s portrayal of the iconic DC superheroine.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood\u2019s been doing over Wonder Woman has been so misguided,\u201d Cameron told the paper. \u201cShe\u2019s an objectified icon, and it\u2019s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing!

His praise of my film Monster, and our portrayal of a strong yet damaged woman was so appreciated. But if women have to always be hard, tough and troubled to be strong, and we aren\u2019t free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we haven\u2019t come very far have we.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe women can and should be EVERYTHING just like male lead characters should be,\u201d Jenkins added. \u201cThere is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman.

aV\u201cAmerican liberalism in the twenty-first century is in crisis,\u201d writes Columbia University Professor Mark Lilla, due in no small part to its embrace of a \u201cdisastrous\u201d identity politics that divides instead of uniting.\u000a\u000aIn his newly released book, The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics, Lilla, a self-described \u201cfrustrated American liberal,\u201d decries the implosion of the Democratic Party and liberalism itself, brought on by a growing disconnect from middle America and the inability to paint a compelling vision for the future.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLilla\u2019s new work expands upon \u201cThe End of Identity Liberalism,\u201d an essay he wrote shortly after last November\u2019s Presidential election. In it, he urged fellow liberals to face up to their party\u2019s share in responsibility for Trump\u2019s victory, which Lilla attributed to the rise \u201cidentity liberalism.\u201d\u000a\u000aLiberalism, Lilla contends in his book, is rightly considered by many \u201cas a creed professed mainly by educated urban elites cut off from the rest of the country who see the issues of the day principally through the lens of identities.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe core of their error, Lilla suggests, is that Democrats have thrown themselves headlong into identity politics, focusing on what divides rather than what unites. As a result, many feel alienated from a party that once knew how to bring people together.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe majority of Americans have made it abundantly clear that they no longer respond to whatever larger message we have been conveying over the past decades,\u201d he writes.\u000a\u000aContra the opinion of many of his colleagues, Lilla says that the source of conservatives\u2019 strength has been \u201cnot money, not false advertising, not fear-mongering, not racism\u201d but rather a shared image for America\u2019s future, which\u2014he claims\u2014the Democrats have been unable to produce.\u000a\u000aThe liberal vision, on the other hand, which earlier centered on shared values that bind the nation together, eventually gave way to \u201ca pseudo-politics of self-regard and increasingly narrow and exclusionary self-definition that is now cultivated in our colleges and universities,\u201d he writes.\u000a\u000aSo rather than expounding a common vision for the future, Democrats have embraced a divisive vision of fragmentation, trying desperately to please an unending series of special interest groups who see themselves as victims requiring special attention.\u000a\u000aDemocrats therefore no longer appeal to Americans, he argues, but rather to \u201cwomen, Hispanics, \u2018ethnic Americans,\u2019 the LGBT community, Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe reaction of liberals to Lilla\u2019s book has been overwhelmingly negative, which may simply suggest how deeply the rot of identity politics has penetrated his political comrades in arms.\u000a\u000aPredictably, the New York Times finds Lilla\u2019s analysis thoroughly distasteful, and published a review by Yale University History Professor Beverly Gage that dismissed Lilla\u2019s critique as \u201ctrolling disguised as erudition.\u201d\u000a\u000aWriting in The Los Angeles Review of Books, Columbia law professor Katherine Franke went further still, comparing Lilla to David Duke, the former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.\u000a\u000aWhile Lilla may have effectively put his finger on the key problem undermining the modern Democrat project, there is little sign that his message will garner any support from the guardians of liberal orthodoxy.\u000a\u000aFollow Thomas D.

aVSen. James Lankford (R-OK) has a proposal to change to how the Senate confirms presidential nominees for federal judgeships and the executive branch. It would break the gridlock that has sparked a nationwide campaign to staff the bench and federal government.\u000a\u000aA record number of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominations to fill top positions in the federal government\u2014including key positions such as those in the State Department, Defense Department, Treasury Department, and Justice Department\u2014are being slow-walked in the U.S. Senate, preventing the three million employees of the federal government from carrying out vital parts of the president\u2019s agenda.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aArticle II of the Constitution requires that all federal judges and high-ranking administration officials are nominated by the president, and then must be confirmed by the Senate.\u000a\u000aBy mid-July in each of the four previous administrations (Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama), the average number of Senate-confirmed appointments was 190. For President Trump, that number was 50.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the minority can force the full 30 hours of debate time provided within the rules, which they have repeatedly demanded,\u201d Lankford explains in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. \u201cAt the current rate, it will take 11 years to fill the executive branch.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen cloture is invoked to stop a filibuster, Senate rules technically allow another 30 hours of debate before a final vote. Senators typically give back most of that time because the battle is lost. Instead of following that convention, Senate Democrats are using all 30 hours before allowing the Senate to vote and move on to the next item of business.\u000a\u000aMany commentators thought that this form of obstruction would end with the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d Democrats in 2013 reinterpreted the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule (Rule XXII) not to apply to any presidential nominations to the executive or judicial branches, with the Supreme Court being the sole exception. Senate Republicans abolished that extension earlier this year, resulting in the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch.\u000a\u000aThe situation is just as bad in the federal judiciary, where only a handful of 140 judicial vacancies have been filled with President Trump\u2019s nominees. This has led to the Judicial Crisis Network launching a nationwide campaign with grassroots groups using the handle #GridlockReform, pushing senators to bring nominees to the Senate floor for an up or down vote.\u000a\u000aLankford cites Judge David Nye as an example of this obstruction. President Barack Obama originally nominated Nye for a federal judgeship. Nye did not make it through the confirmation process before Obama left office, so President Trump re-nominated him as a gesture of bipartisanship to Senate Democrats.\u000a\u000aEvery Senate Democrat finally joined all the Republicans to confirm Nye by a unanimous vote of 100-0, but only after consuming all 30 hours of debate.\u000a\u000aThe solution? According to Lankford, \u201cFirst, we should reduce floor debate time for executive nominees from 30 hours to eight or less. The Senate could debate and vote on five or more nominees a week, instead of just one or two.\u201d\u000a\u000aLankford notes that Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) agreed to this arrangement when he was majority leader. \u201cIt worked then, and it would work now,\u201d he declares.\u000a\u000a\u201cSecond, we should lower the vote threshold on the \u2018motion to proceed,\u2019 which begins legislative debate and amendment consideration, from 60 votes to 51,\u201d Lankford continued, explaining that almost every bill in the Senate requires two 60-vote approvals, one to begin debate and one to end it. Requiring only 51 votes to start debate would still protect minority-party rights by requiring 60 to move to an up-or-down vote, but move the process along.\u000a\u000aSuch a change would also ensure that senators could no longer duck a tough issue by not letting it come up for debate.\u000a\u000aCoupled with Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley\u2019s (R-IA) discretion to end the abuse of \u201cblue slips\u201d to filibuster nominees, such a change could lead to swift votes on judicial nominees, with the likely result that every one of President Trump\u2019s picks would be confirmed.\u000a\u000aNo word yet on whether Senate Republicans will use their votes as the majority to enact these changes.\u000a\u000aKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

aVNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon plans to use its deep pockets to make big changes at Whole Foods, saying it will cut prices on bananas, eggs, salmon, beef and more when it completes its $13.7 billion takeover next week.\u000a\u000aHelping Whole Foods win back customers who found \u201cgood enough\u201d organic and natural products elsewhere \u2013 possibly at a lower cost \u2013 fits Amazon\u2019s track record of keeping prices low to lock in customer loyalty. Looking ahead, Amazon hopes to give members of its Prime program special savings and other in-store benefits.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s an \u201copening salvo\u201d in the grocery wars, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, and shares of other supermarkets fell sharply on the news.\u000a\u000a\u201cRivals should be under no illusion that they are now dealing with a competitor that is not afraid to damage profits and margins if it creates long-term gains,\u201d Saunders said in an analyst note.\u000a\u000aAmong other Whole Foods items getting discounts Monday: avocados, tilapia, baby kale, apples and rotisserie chicken \u2013 all organic, Amazon said. The company also said certain Whole Foods products will be available through Amazon.com, AmazonFresh, Prime Pantry and Prime Now.\u000a\u000aAmazon\u2019s announcement comes a day after Whole Foods shareholders gave their approval and the Federal Trade Commission said it would not block the purchase. Amazon will pay $42 per Whole Foods share, an 18 percent premium from its price the day before the tie-up was announced June 16. The stock edged up to $41.98 on Thursday.\u000a\u000aBy buying Whole Foods, Amazon is taking a bold step into brick-and-mortar, with its more than 460 stores and potentially very lucrative data about how shoppers behave offline. The grocery chain, which has fought the \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d reputation, had been under shareholder pressure to improve results as customers moved on and discount chains like Lidl and Aldi expanded in the U.S.\u000a\u000aWhether Amazon will succeed in the fiercely competitive grocery segment is unclear, but customers are going to benefit from the attempt, said Charlie O\u2019Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\u000a\u000a\u201cAmazon can come in and price items very low,\u201d he said. \u201cIts shareholders are agnostic about profit, and seem more interested revenue and market share. That\u2019s a competitive advantage.\u201d\u000a\u000aRivals have been scrambling to catch up with the e-commerce giant. Walmart, which has the largest share of the U.S. grocery market, is expanding its grocery delivery service with ride-hailing service Uber and announced Wednesday that it will join forces with Google to let shoppers order goods by voice on Google devices.\u000a\u000aBut Walmart\u2019s shares were off 2 percent, and shares of other big grocery businesses fell more. The Kroger Co. dropped nearly 8 percent, and Supervalu Inc. fell more than 6 percent. Costco lost 5 percent and Target fell 4 percent.\u000a\u000aWhile Whole Foods accounts for less than 3 percent of U.S. grocery and supermarket sales, the purchase gives Amazon a foothold in a fragile industry that can ill-afford more price cutting.\u000a\u000a\u201cLower prices could be catastrophic for some operators,\u201d said Madeline Hurley, a senior analyst at market research firm IBISWorld. \u201cIt could drive them out of the industry.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn average, she said, supermarkets only squeeze about $1 of profit out of every $100 in revenue.\u000a\u000aHurley said she is not sure how big competitors like Walmart will fare, but that Amazon is showing a determination to shake things up, and fast.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was a lot of speculation that Whole Foods might be left as more of an independent entity, at least in the beginning phases of the acquisition,\u201d she said. \u201cThis shows that Amazon is taking a very hands-on approach.\u201d\u000a\u000aFinancial analysts say one challenge for Amazon is how to cut prices and broaden Whole Foods\u2019 appeal without hurting the chain\u2019s image for quality food. It\u2019s a tricky balance that Amazon itself seemed to acknowledge in its statement.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality \u2013 we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market\u2019s long-held commitment to the highest standards,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO of AmazonWorldwide Consumer.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, Amazon sold $16 billion of bonds in order to pay for the purchase. Its shares were down 0.6 percent to $952.45 on Thursday.

I can hear your complaint already, \u201c[Gordon Freeman], we have not heard from you in ages!\u201d Well, if you care to hear excuses, I have plenty, the greatest of them being I\u2019ve been in other dimensions and whatnot, unable to reach you by the usual means. This was the case until eighteen months ago, when I experienced a critical change in my circumstances, and was redeposited on these shores. In the time since, I have been able to think occasionally about how best to describe the intervening years, my years of silence. I do first apologize for the wait, and that done, hasten to finally explain (albeit briefly, quickly, and in very little detail) events following those described in my previous game (referred to herewith as [Episode 2]).\u000a\u000aWhat follows is the recap of what may have been the planned story of Half-Life 2: Episode 3 or Half-Life 3, wrapping up the loose ends dangling at the end of Half-Life 2: Episode 2. A fan also compiled a \u201ctranslated\u201d version of the post with the proper names of Half-Life characters, aliens, and locations replacing the pseudonyms in Laidlaw\u2019s original blog.\u000a\u000aIn a tweet, Laidlaw called the \u201cfanfic\u201d a \u201cgenderswapped snapshot of a dream I had many years ago.\u201d When someone pointed out that it hardly seemed like a \u201cfanfic\u201d as Laidlaw wrote the story for the previous Half-Life games, the writer, who resigned from Half-Life developer Valve in 2016, reasserted: \u201cAt this point I\u2019m operating strictly in a fan capacity.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, this is almost certainly the most closure fans will ever get for the legendary first-person shooter franchise, as Valve shifts its focus to competitive gaming and its megalithic online store. A link to the translated version of the blog was posted on the popular /r/Gaming subreddit and rocketed to the top of Reddit\u2019s front page, with over 10,000 comments at the time of this writing, many of which lamented the thought that Laidlaw revealing the potential plot for an unreleased Half-Life title must be a sure sign the franchise is truly dead.\u000a\u000aFrankly, it\u2019s a difficult read. There are still questions left unanswered, and even with this general story closure, it\u2019s difficult not to pine for a proper, playable ending. But Laidlaw has given fans some measure of closure regarding his vision for what is easily the most infuriating cliffhanger in gaming history, and it looks as if that is all we will get for the foreseeable future.\u000a\u000aFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.

aVFormer White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s economic-nationalist, non-interventionist, and pro-assimilation agenda is on the ascent, and what FiveThirtyEight dubbed the \u201cBannon Wing\u201d represents a \u201cmajor part of the modern Republican Party.\u201d\u000a\u000aFurther, \u201cBannon-ism,\u201d according to the report, is in \u201cnearly every Republican voter.\u201d And it may offer Republicans the best chance to expand its coalition in a general election by attracting blue-collar Democrats and politically unaffiliated or unengaged voters of all backgrounds like Donald Trump did in 2016.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aFiveThirtyEight defined the \u201cBannon wing\u201d of the GOP as a more \u201cpopulist, nationalist,\u201d and non-interventionist wing of the GOP. The study pointed out that, more specifically, the \u201cBannon wing\u201d consists of \u201cTrump voters who are pro-police, against free trade, against the U.S. playing an active role (militarily and diplomatically) in the international community, strongly against illegal immigration, and in favor of more infrastructure spending.\u201d FiveThirtyEight used five questions from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study to more specifically define the Bannon wing:\u000a\u000a1. They are for or against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Which we\u2019ll use as a proxy for free trade.)\u000a\u000a2. The U.S. should send troops to help the United Nations uphold international law.2 (Involvement in the international community.)\u000a\u000a3. The U.S. government should identify and deport immigrants in the country illegally. (Illegal immigration.)\u000a\u000a4. Their local police should receive a grade of A (excellent), B (above average), C (average), D (below average) or F (poor).\u000a\u000a5. Their state government should increase spending on infrastructure. (Infrastructure spending.)\u000a\u000aFiveThirtyEight noted that \u201cperhaps the most telling sign that Bannon\u2019s positions represent a major part of the modern Republican Party is the percentage of Trump voters who disagree with all of the five key Bannon-esque policy stances listed above. It\u2019s less than 2 percent.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether the Republican mainstream likes it or not, a little bit of Bannonism is in pretty much every Republican voter,\u201d the numbers-crunching outlet concluded. \u201cDon\u2019t expect Trump to suddenly become a different person. Bannonism is a part of Trump\u2019s coalition, even if Bannon is no longer part of the Trump administration. And Trump needs it to remain that way.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study found that Republicans agreed with many core aspects of \u201cBannon-ism\u201d and approximately 15% of all Trump voters agreed with all five of the tenets as defined by FiveThirtyEight, based on questions from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. But \u201cto put this 15 percent in some additional perspective, the percentage of Hillary Clinton voters who were Hispanic in the general election, an important part of her coalition, was about 12 percent,\u201d FiveThirtyEight noted. When FiveThirtyEight broke down \u201cBannonism\u201d further, it found that nearly half of Trump\u2019s voters wanted a more non-interventionist and realist foreign policy that put America\u2019s national interest above all else while 40-45 percent of Trump voters were nationalist-populist.\u000a\u000aNon-interventionist Bannon-ites (Nearly 50% of Trump voters) \u2014 \u201cTrump voters who want the U.S. to have a more distant relationship with international partners. These are people who are against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and against sending troops overseas to uphold international law.\u201d The report found that nearly half of Trump voters fall into this category, which should not be surprising \u201cgiven that even Clinton was forced to come out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u201d and Trump emphasized his opposition to the Iraq War during the campaign. Nationalist Bannon-ites (About 45% of Trump voters) \u2014 \u201cTrump voters who support deporting immigrants who are here illegally. These voters are pro-police and strongly against illegal immigration.\u201d These voters also, as Breitbart News has pointed out, value assimilation and Americanism and vote for E Pluribus Unum as opposed to Ex Uno Plures. This group, according to the report, make up about 45 percent of Trump voters, but also appeal to a broader segment of the electorate since the pro-assimilation and America-first issues the nationalist Bannon-ites cared about \u201cclearly went beyond voters with hardline positions on policing and immigration.\u201d Populist Bannon-ites (About 40% of Trump voters) \u2014\u201dTrump voters who are more economically populist in a party that often isn\u2019t. These voters are against the Trans-Pacific partnership and are for more infrastructure spending.\u201d The report notes that \u201cthis may be the area where Bannon and Trump were most at odds with Republican Party leaders,\u201d but the issues that appeal to \u201cpopulist Bannon-ites\u201d are more likely to win over blue-collar Reagan Democrats and enable Republicans to win states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin like Trump unlike the Republicans who have pursued the 3.8 of voters who are \u201csocially liberal\u201d and favor economically rigid policies that benefit Wall Street and corporatists.\u000a\u000aThe outlet found that Bannon \u201crepresented a clear ideological wing within the Trump White House and in the GOP electorate more broadly.\u201d Bannon-ism allowed Trump to appeal to various groups in the GOP primary and attract non-Republicans in the general election. In addition, Trump will need the support from the \u201cBannon wing\u201d to fend off potential primary challengers in 2020, according to the report. Yet, GOP establishment consultants, \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d and the media want to push GOP candidates to become more socially liberal and economically rigid to appeal to the narrow 3.8% of their fellow elites\u2013a surefire recipe for general election losses.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with the Economist, Bannon fought for his worldview and called out China (\u201cLet\u2019s go screw up One Belt One Road\u201d) and \u201cthe elites in Silicon Valley and Wall Street\u2014they\u2019re a bunch of globalists who have forgotten their fellow Americans.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI want the world to look back in 100 years and say, their mercantilist, Confucian system lost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Judeo-Christian liberal West won.\u201d\u000a\u000aBannon recalled when Republican leaders and even some of Trump\u2019s top advisers were distancing themselves from Trump during the 2016 campaign, Bannon\u2019s message to Trump was simple: \u201cWe are going for a nationalist message, we are going to go barbarian, and we will win.\u201d

Both followed on the heels of Rep. Ted Lieu\u2019s push for legislation requiring a psychiatrist at the White House. \u201c[Trump] has demonstrated that his mental capacity and his erratic behavior are issues we need to be concerned about for our national security,\u201d Speier told POLITICO. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019m not the first person that\u2019s talked about it.

U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, introduced a resolution for a congressional censure Friday.\u000a\u000aCensure by the Congress does nothing to remove a president from office. Ironically, the last president to be censured was one to whom Trump has often compared himself: Andrew Jackson.

aVThe Cuban government has yet to release Daniel Llorente, a dissident arrested for waving an American flag during the nation\u2019s communist May Day parade this year, from a mental health ward his family was told he was confined to following the incident because he believes in God.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban-American outlet Mart Noticias spoke to Llorente from the psychiatric ward where he has been kept since May this week. In the short call, Llorente says he has been told he needs a special form to be released from the institution, but keeps being refused the document. \u201cI\u2019ve been to several places, nobody tells me anything\u2014all it is is waiting, waiting, waiting,\u201d he lamented.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLlorente was beaten publicly by plainclothes state security agents on May 1 after he ran in front of the parade with his American flag. He was subsequently arrested but\u2014partly due to international pressure from the human rights community, and partly due to Llorente\u2019s status as not a member of any Cuban dissident or pro-democracy organization\u2014the Cuban government did not place him in prison, despite awaiting trial on charges of \u201cpublic disorder and resistance.\u201d\u000a\u000aInstead, police placed Llorente in a \u201cmental health facility\u201d that most in the Cuban exile community know as the dreaded \u201cMazorra,\u201d which the government traditionally used for mental health cases professionals deemed hopeless. Llorente\u2019s family has said that he has since been deprived of sunlight and forced to take unidentified medications, which he told relatives sedated him.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey say that since he believes in God and is always talking about that \u2026 they say that is a disorder,\u201d teenage son Elicer Llorente told Mart in June. \u201cThat is a lie. He told me to talk to journalists from the first day I visited him because he signed himself out of the institution and has not been let out.\u201d\u000a\u000aLlorente attempted to go on hunger strike temporarily in June.\u000a\u000aLlorente had previously caused a commotion in May 2016, when the first American cruise ship came to shore in Havana. At the time, Llorente brought his American flag to greet the ship and was arrested while shouting \u201cyes we can!\u201d the slogan of the Barack Obama presidential campaign. At the time, Llorente said on camera that Cubans attending the May Day parade were \u201chypocrites\u201d and that he waved the American flag because \u201cI don\u2019t fear the government.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe use of alleged psychiatric treatment to contain outspoken anti-communist dissidents has long been part of the Cuban regime\u2019s approach towards oppressing its opponents. Communist officials have apparently attempted to use the threat of psychiatric detention with other dissidents\u2014in a recent case, with three men who publicly opposed celebrations of the 26 of July.\u000a\u000aCuba observes July 26 as a holiday, as on this date in 1953, Fidel Castro and his cronies violently attacked the Moncada Barracks, killing fifteen soldiers and three police officers\u2014an event the communist dictatorship celebrates.\u000a\u000aOn July 26, 2017, three men\u2014brothers Alberto and Leonardo Ramrez Odio and father Alberto de La Caridad Ramrez took to a balcony with large signs reading \u201c58 years of deceit, hunger, and misery\u201d and \u201cthe people demand freedom, justice, democracy.\u201d The men chanted \u201cDown with the dictatorship! Down with Fidel! Down with Raul!\u201d They were summarily beaten by an official state gang and arrested.\u000a\u000aLast week, family reported that the three were taken to a psychiatric hospital and kept on a bus to watch from afar for about an hour before being returned to prison. The trip appeared to be a threat to keep them imprisoned in a psychiatric facility without a trial, indefinitely.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban regime has become significantly more violent against dissidents since President Barack Obama announced a series of diplomatic concessions to the Castro regime in 2016. According to the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN), an NGO that tracks politically-motivated arrests on the island, the number of political prisoners in Cuba doubled between April 2016 and April 2017. President Obama visited Cuba\u2014the first such visit of an American head of state in decades\u2014in March 2016.

Olson was appointed to the Fed Board of Governors by George Bush in 2001.\u000a\u000aOlson went on to compare Cohn to William Miller, the Carter-era Fed chair whose neglect of rising inflation is thought to have greatly contributed to America\u2019s economic malaise at the time. Only 11 months into his term, the dollar fell nearly 34 percent against the German mark and almost 42 percent against the Japanese yen.\u000a\u000a\u201cMiller did not do well,\u201d Olson added.\u000a\u000aMiller\u2019s term is widely considered one of the worst of any Fed chairmen.

aVA Clinton initiative founded in 2002 to save lives infected with HIV/AIDS spent only $23 million of its $140 million of expenditures in 2016 directly on programs, according to financial records on the initiative\u2019s website.\u000a\u000aAccording to its website, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) was set up in 2002 to help save lives by providing treatment to those living with HIV/AIDS. The Clinton Foundation describes CHAI as a \u201cseparate, affiliated entity\u201d from the controversial foundation. CHAI summarizes its approach as a \u201csolution-oriented approach\u201d:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aCHAI\u2019s solution-oriented approach focuses on both global and national level work by rapidly improving market dynamics for medicines and diagnostics; lowering prices for treatment; accelerating access to lifesaving technologies; and helping governments build the capacity required for high-quality care and treatment programs.\u000a\u000aHowever, of that $140 million, according to its financial report, it initially breaks down its expenditures as having spent $129,662,636 on \u201cprogram services,\u201d with $10,117,754 on management and $1,035,062 on fundraising.\u000a\u000aHowever, the report later reveals that only $23 million was actually spent on \u201cdirect program expenditures.\u201d The rest was spent on a whole host of other non-service related items, including $72,957,333 on salaries and benefits; $16,438,199 on meetings and training; $7,983,180 on \u201cprofessional and consultation fees\u201d; and $7,611,344 on travel.\u000a\u000aCHAI did not respond to multiple requests for comment and clarification from Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aThe accounting taps into broader concerns about the Clintons\u2019 philanthropic ventures \u2014 namely that for all its claims to do good in the world, very little of its money is spent on philanthropy.\u000a\u000aPeter Schweizer, who exposed a great deal of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s working in his 2015 book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, told Breitbart News last year that it is possible that as little as six percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s money went to charitable causes.\u000a\u000aIn particular, he pointed to the claims made by Clinton groups such as the Clinton Foundation about their work and noted that even some of those direct services can be \u201cfuzzy and hazy.\u201d He suggested that it can be very hard to figure out exactly what is spent on actually helping people:\u000a\u000aThe problem is, when you start drilling down on what, precisely, those charitable activities are, and what they have to show for it, it gets really, really fuzzy and hazy. So you\u2019ll have some charities like Doctors Without Borders will say, \u201cWe immunized 100,000 kids last year.\u201d And you can look at that. That\u2019s a very clear metric. Okay, here\u2019s where they did it. They were in sub-Saharan Africa. They had all these doctors. The Clinton Foundation will say, \u201cWe assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.\u201d Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don\u2019t really tell you. They don\u2019t really explain to you how it works. So the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities. The other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it\u2019s really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.\u000a\u000aIn September, CHAI announced that if Hillary Clinton was elected president in November, then Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea Clinton would step down from CHAI\u2019s board. However, possibly because Clinton did not win, Bill and Chelsea are still listed as among CHAI\u2019s board members.\u000a\u000aAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

It would break the gridlock that has sparked a nationwide campaign to staff the bench and federal government.\u000a\u000aA record number of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominations to fill top positions in the federal government\u2014including key positions such as those in the State Department, Defense Department, Treasury Department, and Justice Department\u2014are being slow-walked in the U.S. Senate, preventing the three million employees of the federal government from carrying out vital parts of the president\u2019s agenda.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aArticle II of the Constitution requires that all federal judges and high-ranking administration officials are nominated by the president, and then must be confirmed by the Senate.\u000a\u000aBy mid-July in each of the four previous administrations (Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama), the average number of Senate-confirmed appointments was 190. For President Trump, that number was 50.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the minority can force the full 30 hours of debate time provided within the rules, which they have repeatedly demanded,\u201d Lankford explains in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. \u201cAt the current rate, it will take 11 years to fill the executive branch.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen cloture is invoked to stop a filibuster, Senate rules technically allow another 30 hours of debate before a final vote. Senators typically give back most of that time because the battle is lost. Instead of following that convention, Senate Democrats are using all 30 hours before allowing the Senate to vote and move on to the next item of business.\u000a\u000aMany commentators thought that this form of obstruction would end with the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d Democrats in 2013 reinterpreted the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule (Rule XXII) not to apply to any presidential nominations to the executive or judicial branches, with the Supreme Court being the sole exception. Senate Republicans abolished that extension earlier this year, resulting in the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch.\u000a\u000aThe situation is just as bad in the federal judiciary, where only a handful of 140 judicial vacancies have been filled with President Trump\u2019s nominees. This has led to the Judicial Crisis Network launching a nationwide campaign with grassroots groups using the handle #GridlockReform, pushing senators to bring nominees to the Senate floor for an up or down vote.\u000a\u000aLankford cites Judge David Nye as an example of this obstruction. President Barack Obama originally nominated Nye for a federal judgeship. Nye did not make it through the confirmation process before Obama left office, so President Trump re-nominated him as a gesture of bipartisanship to Senate Democrats.\u000a\u000aEvery Senate Democrat finally joined all the Republicans to confirm Nye by a unanimous vote of 100-0, but only after consuming all 30 hours of debate.\u000a\u000aThe solution? According to Lankford, \u201cFirst, we should reduce floor debate time for executive nominees from 30 hours to eight or less. The Senate could debate and vote on five or more nominees a week, instead of just one or two.\u201d\u000a\u000aLankford notes that Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) agreed to this arrangement when he was majority leader. \u201cIt worked then, and it would work now,\u201d he declares.\u000a\u000a\u201cSecond, we should lower the vote threshold on the \u2018motion to proceed,\u2019 which begins legislative debate and amendment consideration, from 60 votes to 51,\u201d Lankford continued, explaining that almost every bill in the Senate requires two 60-vote approvals, one to begin debate and one to end it. Requiring only 51 votes to start debate would still protect minority-party rights by requiring 60 to move to an up-or-down vote, but move the process along.\u000a\u000aSuch a change would also ensure that senators could no longer duck a tough issue by not letting it come up for debate.\u000a\u000aCoupled with Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley\u2019s (R-IA) discretion to end the abuse of \u201cblue slips\u201d to filibuster nominees, such a change could lead to swift votes on judicial nominees, with the likely result that every one of President Trump\u2019s picks would be confirmed.\u000a\u000aNo word yet on whether Senate Republicans will use their votes as the majority to enact these changes.\u000a\u000aKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

aVThe \u201cnegative heat\u201d that the legacy media and Hollywood continually direct at President Donald Trump may be helping him, according to MSNBC analyst Steve Kornacki, who pointed out that Trump is \u201ccentral\u201d to all of American popular culture unlike any other president before him.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you look on paper, the poll numbers are terrible. But the position Donald Trump occupies not just in the media landscape but in all of culture \u2026 he is central to all \u2026 of American popular culture\u2014he has been since before the election and he\u2019s gonna be as far out as we can see,\u201d he said on Thursday\u2019s MTP Daily. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had that with other presidents before.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHe added that there is \u201cso much negative heat coming in \u2026 from the media, from popular culture\u201d that \u201cit raises the question\u201d whether those who voted for Trump in 2016 even though they had low opinions of him did so as a reaction to the media and \u201call of culture pushing so hard against Trump.\u201d\u000a\u000aKornacki, the numbers-cruncher who is one of the left-wing network\u2019s more underrated personalities, added that Trump was so successful in the 2016 GOP primary because he was not a \u201cfactional\u201d candidate. He noted that Trump got \u201cbroad\u201d support from various \u201canti-establishment\u201d parts of the GOP coalition and not just from one narrow corner.\u000a\u000aLike Breitbart News has noted many times, guest-host Katy Tur wondered if Trump actually has \u201call the right enemies.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart News recently pointed out that Axios criticized Trump for having alienated in just seven months \u201cMitch McConnell (voters hate Congress), Democrats (the rudderless party is having a tough time winning elections at all levels), the media (their approval ratings are at near-record lows\u2014so why should virtue-signaling Republicans take their cues from an institution everyday Americans do not trust?), CEOs, world leaders (doesn\u2019t hurt Trump to be disliked by the \u201cParty of Davos\u201d), Europe, [radical] Muslims, [\u201csalad-bowl\u201d] Hispanics, [self-appointed leaders of] black Americans, military leaders and intelligence officials [many of whom support former President Barack Obama or the nation-building foreign policy of Allen\u2019s favored neoconservatives in the GOP establishment], his own staff [of globalists, Democrats, and establishment Republicans].\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt turns out Trump may be alienating mostly all of the right types of groups and people,\u201d Breitbart News wrote.\u000a\u000aKornacki and the panel also did not discuss that these polls may be off because of strong \u201csocial desirability bias,\u201d which is something Breitbart News, unlike nearly every other media outlet, thoroughly discussed during the 2016 election and was one of the reasons why Breitbart News covered the 2016 election better than any other outlet.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News has also pointed out how Trump\u2019s celebrity helped him during the 2016 campaign and was the reason why the Access Hollywood tape, which \u201cwould have been devastating for a conventional politician,\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cfatal\u201d for Trump:\u000a\u000aBecause of his success on reality television, Trump understood how to be a politician in the reality-tv era just like Ronald Reagan\u2019s past as an actor allowed Reagan, with Michael Deaver\u2019s help, to master being a candidate and president in the broadcast television era. In addition, because Trump played everybody\u2019s favorite boardroom executive on The Apprentice, regular Americans already envisioned him as president just like 24\u2019s fictional black American president David Palmer allowed voters to see a black man as president. \u2026 Trump\u2019s over-the-top reality star personality may have ameliorated the fallout from his infamous Access Hollywood tape in which he talked about grabbing women by their private parts. What would have been devastating for a conventional politician wasn\u2019t fatal for Trump because the \u201coutrageous factor\u201d was already baked into the cake when voters were considering whether to vote for him.\u000a\u000a(Photo Credit: Joel Pollak/Breitbart News)

aVThe New York Times reports that Uber was nearly kicked off the Apple App Store after the ride-hailing company was caught breaking privacy rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cTravis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple\u2019s headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Timothy D. Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading,\u201d wrote The New York Times\u2018 Mike Isaac. \u201cFor months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple\u2019s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased \u2014 a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cBut Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been breaking some of our rules,\u201d Cook allegedly said to Kalanick during the meeting, before adding that the CEO must \u201cStop the trickery\u2026 or Uber\u2019s app would be kicked out of Apple\u2019s App Store.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe New York Times added that because a removal of Uber from the App Store would result in the loss of the app\u2019s primary market and millions of iPhone users, Kalanick was forced to adhere to Apple\u2019s rules from then on.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a quest to build Uber into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered,\u201d The Times claimed. \u201cHe has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt has been a rough year for Kalanick and Uber. In January, #DeleteUber started to trend on Twitter after the company refused to become involved in a taxi strike against President Trump\u2019s travel ban. Uber had announced at the time that surge prices were temporarily halted in order to attract customers, while other taxi companies protested and refused to pick up people from JFK Airport.\u000a\u000aIn response to the move, ride-sharing service Lyft donated $1 million to the ACLU and released a statement against President Trump and in support of refugees. The boycott movement launched ride-sharing service Lyft to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store and bombarded Uber with one-star reviews.\u000a\u000aThe protest eventually led Kalanick to resign from his position on President Trump\u2019s business advisory group, though not before another controversy took place just weeks later.\u000a\u000aAfter an Uber driver started to shout at Kalanick, who was acting as a passenger, the Uber CEO started to argue with him, unaware that the incident was being caught on tape.\u000a\u000aIn the video, \u201cThe driver in a dash cam tells Kalanick, a passenger, that \u2018people are not trusting you anymore,\u2019 and complains that rates for drivers have fallen,\u201d before the Uber CEO responds to the driver, claiming, \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!\u201d\u000a\u000aKalanick later apologized for the incident, declaring that he needs to \u201cgrow up.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

aVPro-Donald J. Trump GOP U.S. Senate challenger Danny Tarkanian has blown past incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV), an opponent of the president and much of his agenda, per a new poll out of the state of Nevada obtained exclusively by Breitbart News ahead of its public release.\u000a\u000aTarkanian, per the new poll from JMC Analytics, is up at 39 percent in the new survey. His lead towers eight points over the incumbent Heller\u2019s 31 percent, spelling certain trouble for Senate GOP establishment forces desperate to save Heller\u2019s seat. A whopping 31 percent are undecided between Heller and Tarkanian. Even so, when given the choice of Heller versus not Tarkanian, a majority of Republicans in Nevada\u201451 percent\u2014want someone other than Heller, 31 percent would renominate Heller, and 18 percent are undecided.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe survey of 700 likely GOP voters in Nevada was conducted from Aug. 24 to Aug. 25 and has a margin of error of 3.7 percent with a 95 percent confidence interval.\u000a\u000aHeller\u2019s approval rating is underwater, down to just 34 percent of Nevada Republicans approving of his job performance, while 48 percent disapprove. Sixteen percent have no opinion and two percent have not heard of Heller.\u000a\u000aTarkanian\u2019s numbers are exactly the opposite, as he has high approval ratings among those who know him. A significant 42 percent approve of Tarkanian, while 23 percent disapprove, 30 percent have no opinion, and five percent have never heard of him.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s approval ratings are sky-high among Nevada Republicans, with 80 percent approving of the president\u2019s job\u2014and only 14 percent disapproving, while six percent have no opinion.\u000a\u000aJMC Analytics\u2019 John Couvillon wrote in his analysis of the poll:\u000a\u000aJMC Analytics and Polling independently conducted this poll for the Nevada U.S. Senate Republican primary to be held next year. Next year\u2019s Senate race already has the potential to be competitive, given that (1) Senator Heller won his first term in 2012 with a 46-45% plurality, and (2) in last year\u2019s Presidential election, Hillary Clinton carried the state 48-46%. But while the general election will be a challenge (Nevada is one of two Republican held Senate seats that Democrats could put in play next November), Senator Heller has a more immediate problem: he faces a substantial primary challenge as well.\u000a\u000aCouvillon continued by noting that Tarkanian is a serious contender, and that a Trump endorsement of either candidate could significantly swing this race. Couvillon wrote:\u000a\u000aThis is one primary race where President Trump\u2019s involvement could make a difference. Republicans in Nevada give him an 80-14% approval rating, and a Trump endorsement would by a 64-13% margin make the respondent more likely to support his endorsed candidate. And given Tarkanian\u2019s recent strong endorsement of Trump policies, it appears some of that is already happening: those more likely to be impacted by a Trump endorsement favor Tarkanian 43-30% over Heller (27% undecided), while those less likely to be impacted by a Trump endorsement favor Heller 35-23% (42% undecided). Those who say the endorsement doesn\u2019t matter favor Tarkanian 35-31% (35% undecided) \u2013 these undecideds almost exactly equal the margin by which Tarkanian leads Heller. In summary, Senator Heller faces a substantial primary challenge from Danny Tarkanian in a race that ultimately could determine partisan control of the U.S. Senate.\u000a\u000aTarkanian\u2019s new lead over Heller comes on the heels of an endorsement from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee.\u000a\u000a\u201cDanny Tarkanian is a conservative outsider who will support the \u2018America First\u2019 policies our nation needs to survive and thrive, including building the border wall, ending sanctuary cities, and finally repealing Obamacare,\u201d Palin said in the statement endorsing Tarkanian, provided exclusively to Breitbart News. \u201cCommonsense Conservatives in Nevada and across America need to unite and help win this critical fight. I strongly endorse Danny Tarkanian for the United States Senate and look forward to helping him win this important election.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thank Governor Palin for her endorsement and appreciate the confidence she has shown in our campaign,\u201d Tarkanian said in response, thanking Palin for the endorsement. \u201cI will hold Dean Heller accountable for turning his back on Nevadans by voting against the repeal of Obamacare and helping Hillary Clinton win Nevada by attacking Donald Trump over and over again.\u201d\u000a\u000aTarkanian will join Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 on Saturday morning this weekend to discuss his new lead in the Senate race.\u000a\u000aNevada Senate Executive Summary

Comment? No? I\u2019m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don\u2019t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country \u2013 promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin\u2019 our ass academically.\u000a\u000a\u201cSince we\u2019re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post,\u201d Rowe fired back. \u201cEverything about it annoys me \u2013your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position.\u201d\u000a\u000aRowe then dismantled each of Atkins\u2019 unsubstantiated points. He lambasted celebrities for constantly broadcasting their political opinions as though their views have any impact on most Americans:\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it\u2019s \u201cbad for business,\u201d but because it\u2019s annoying. I can\u2019t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I\u2019m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine.\u000a\u000aHe then criticized the attempt to lump Republicans and white nationalists into the same group:\u000a\u000aYou say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an \u201cacademic elite.\u201d You then say that Republicans promote \u201canti-intellectualism.\u201d You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief. Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common \u2013 a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans \u201clove\u201d me because they believe that my initiative and \u201ctheir\u201d initiative are one and the same. But of course, \u201ctheir\u201d initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. Very clever.

They\u2019re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities \u2013 once beacons of free speech \u2013 now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can\u2019t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they\u2019re concerned \u2013 deeply concerned \u2013 that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don\u2019t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals.

aVU.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration will win in Afghanistan by allowing the country to \u201cbe Afghanistan\u201d rather than trying to \u201ccreate a state in the U.S. image.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWinning in Afghanistan is really aimed at allowing Afghanistan to be Afghanistan. As the president said, not to nation-build, not to create a state in the U.S. image,\u201d said Gen. McMaster when asked about President Trump\u2019s newly unveiled strategy to end the nearly 16-year-old ear in the country.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aFor years, Afghanistan has been plagued by various persistent problems, including a deadly heroin production and addiction epidemic as well as the centuries-old child sex abuse custom known as bacha bazi (literally \u201cplaying with boys\u201d), among others. Afghanistan also suffers from endemic and widespread corruption that is funneling funds to terrorists and has contributed to the death of Americans.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, SIGAR revealed that the common practice of sexually abusing boys was punishable by death under Taliban rule, but it was \u201cresurrected\u201d after the terrorist group\u2019s regime was overthrown by the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, opium production, which the Taliban was once believed to have prohibited, has increased 25-fold since the United States invaded Afghanistan and is now serving as a top source of funding for the terrorist group.\u000a\u000aAfghanistan, now the world\u2019s top supplier of opium and its heroin derivative, is suffering from an addiction problem afflicting tens of thousands of women and some children inside the war-ravaged country.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, although the U.S.-backed Afghan government enacted a new law in January 2017 that criminalizes bacha bazi, the old custom in which older men exploit boys for social and sexual entertainment continues, according to an American watchdog agency.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfghan officials remain complicit, especially in the sexual exploitation and recruitment of children by Afghan security forces,\u201d reported the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a U.S. watchdog agency, at the end of July.\u000a\u000aThe United States has invested $714 billion in Afghanistan since the conflict started in October 2001, including about $120 billion in reconstruction projects.\u000a\u000aEchoing other U.S. officials and the president himself, McMaster defined what it means to win in Afghanistan for the Trump administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cWinning in Afghanistan means that there are no terrorist groups who are able to control key parts of the territory or population centers there that could be used to mobilize resources, raise funds, use those funds to then organize, plan, and conduct attacks against us and our allies and partners,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo that\u2019s what the success is \u2014 is really a sustainable outcome there that ensures the safety and security of the American people,\u201d McMaster continued. \u201cAnd, as you know, Afghanistan is connected to broader security concerns across the region. And so the outcome is to ensure that a threat from that region doesn\u2019t threaten the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the U.S. military, the Afghanistan-Pakistan region is home to the largest concentration of Islamic terrorists in the world.\u000a\u000aWhile announcing his new Afghan strategy Monday, President Trump defined victory as \u201cattacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS [Islamic State], crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOur nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives,\u201d he added. \u201cThe men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. They deserve the tools they need, and the trust they have earned, to fight and to win.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmerican Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, also said the ultimate goal of Trump\u2019s Afghanistan strategy is to annihilate terrorists and prevent the country from becoming a launching pad for attacks against America.

aVNBC News is reporting that President Donald Trump is likely to shut down former President Barack Obama\u2019s legally untenable \u2018DACA amnesty for 800,000 illegals.\u000a\u000aThe news comes as Democratic politicians intensify their opposition to immigration reforms intended to benefit Americans, such as Trump\u2019s popular wage-boosting RAISE Act and his promised border wall. NBC reported:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump appears likely to pull the plug on DACA, the Obama-era program allowing young people who came to the U.S. illegally as children to remain here, several government officials said Friday. Administration officials said the Department of Homeland Security sent a recommendation to the White House earlier this week on what to do, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed the program with senior officials Thursday at the White House. Sessions has been a consistent opponent of the program, formally known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\u000a\u000aThe president can choose to end the program immediately, would cancel roughly 800,000 two-year work permits held by the illegals, who vary in age from 18 to the early 40s. Trump could also announce that he will stop awarding new two-year work permits, which will gradually end the program sometime in mid-2018.\u000a\u000aDemocrats are trying to preserve the DACA program by describing Trump and his voters as racists.\u000a\u000a\u201cKilling the DACA program as the Trump administration\u2019s first post-Charlottesville move would be absolutely shameful,\u201d claimed Vanita Gupta, the left-wing social engineer who directed Obama\u2019s civic-regulation office at the Department of Justice. \u201cWe must not allow the hate violence that we saw on the streets of Charlottesville to become the guiding force for policy making,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aDreamers are not a bargaining chip for the border wall and inhumane deportation force.

But that full amnesty would also put the parents on track to become citizens, boosting DACA amnesty numbers up to roughly 2.5 million, estimated one immigration expert.

McMaster, fired key individuals from the National Security Council who were loyal to that platform.\u000a\u000aA source close to Dr. Gorka claimed that he made his decision following the president\u2019s speech in which he indicated he would escalate America\u2019s war in Afghanistan. \u201cThe anti-MAGAs\u201d have control of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, the source said.\u000a\u000aIn his resignation letter, he also expressed disappointment with the administration\u2019s new foreign policy direction, particularly in light of Donald Trump\u2019s most recent speech in which he announced his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan. Gorka wrote:\u000a\u000aRegrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week. \u2026 The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost.\u000a\u000aGorka had also become deeply frustrated with the unprecedented levels of personal abuse propagated against him by the mainstream media \u2013which included attacks against Gorka\u2019a children \u2013 as well the numerous bureaucratic obstacles used to slow down his work on national security issues, including delaying Gorka\u2019s final permanent national security clearance.\u000a\u000aDuring his time in the administration, Gorka focused on key issues such as tackling radical Islamic terrorism, the diplomatic crisis in Qatar, and managing relations with China. He also earned a reputation as a formidable media persona, repeatedly ripping mainstream media networks such as CNN for their propagation of fake news narratives.\u000a\u000aBreitbart is currently in negotiations with Dr. Gorka regarding his support for the website, as well as collaboration on a joint venture that would embody a Jacksonian national security vision.\u000a\u000aYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com

aVThis expansion has For more than eighty years, beginning with FDR\u2019s New Deal, Americans have witnessed a constant increase in the size and scope of the federal government.This expansion has continued unabated during both Democratic and Republican administrations.\u000a\u000aWhether measured in terms of dollars spent, or in terms of percentage of Gross Domestic Product (\u201cGDP\u201d) consumed by the federal government, big government has become inexorably bigger.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn 1940, federal spending was a relatively modest 9.6% of GDP \u2013 or $9.5 billion out of $98.2 billion. In 2009 under President Obama, federal spending hit a high water mark (excluding the World War II years) of 24.4% of GDP \u2013 or $3,517.7 billion out of $14,414.6 billion.\u000a\u000aThe growth of the federal civilian workforce has slowed since 1960 \u2013 levelling off between 2.5 and 3 million \u2013 but this has masked the transfer of federal programs to state and local bureaucracies. Since 1960, the number of state and local government employees has tripled to over 18 million. This growth has been driven by a tenfold increase in federal grants to cities and states.\u000a\u000aFor conservatives, this trend has been depressing. We plead for smaller government, but our cries have been futile as Congress and state legislatures refuse to make significant or lasting cuts in the size of government. The growth of the Leviathan has seemed unstoppable.\u000a\u000aThe forces pushing the expansion of government are powerful. Bureaucrats justify their existence by spending every dime appropriated to their agencies and then asking for more. Politicians of both parties find it easier to win votes by serving up pork than by offering austerity. Congresses deals with every crisis by spending money. And the progressive Left continually pushes the growth of entitlements for its own political advantage.\u000a\u000aFortunately, there is now hope in the fight against big government. There is a demographic sea change at work \u2013 something that has the potential to shift the forces in favor of conservatives who are serious about shrinking government. The baby boomers are retiring.\u000a\u000aThe baby boomer generation \u2013 those born between 1946 and 1964 \u2013 includes 76 million Americans. Over a 19 year period that started approximately in 2011, virtually all of them will retire. That\u2019s an average of four million people retiring every year, or nearly 11,000 every day. And a large percentage of them are working for the government. Government agencies across the federal government, as well as in state and local governments, are seeing a slew of retirements.\u000a\u000aTake the Social Security Administration. Starting in 2011, the SSA began seeing 4,000 retirements a year. The same is happening throughout the federal government. The bureaucrats see this as a crisis. Conservatives should see it as an opportunity.\u000a\u000aAttrition through retirement is causing federal and state workforces to turn over. Many of these retirees need not be replaced. The size of government can be dramatically reduced simply by making the decision not to fill every vacancy. And it doesn\u2019t take an act of Congress to do it. All it takes is political will in the executive branch not to fill vacancies. The only exceptions should be law enforcement agencies and the military.\u000a\u000aBut can it really be done in practice? The answer is yes, it can. I know because I\u2019ve done it. Shortly after I became Kansas Secretary of State in 2011, I saw baby boomer retirements occurring in my own agency. Realizing this opportunity, I directed my deputies to reassign the duties of retiring employees to those who remained. Wherever possible, the open positions were not to be filled. We left approximately 1/3 of the vacancies unfilled.\u000a\u000aOver the course of six years, I was able to shrink my agency\u2019s workforce by 18 percent. We did it through natural attrition, without massive layoffs. The smaller payroll, along with other cuts, also allowed me to reduce agency spending by over 30 percent. And the agency is still carrying out all of the same responsibilities that it was back in 2011.\u000a\u000aThe same must be done in the federal government and in state governments across the country. President Trump has already taken the first steps. In January he imposed a freeze on hiring. And in March he issued an executive order directing agencies to find redundancies and other ways to make cuts. Looking at the bloated federal bureaucracy, he pointed out, \u201cToday there is duplication and redundancy everywhere.\u201d Consequently, \u201cBillions and billions of dollars are being wasted.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen the hiring freeze is lifted, as it eventually will be, President Trump should order the relevant departments to fill no more than 2/3 of the vacancies that exist. Without such an order, the career bureaucrats will carry on as before, deeming every position necessary to be filled.\u000a\u000aThe baby boomers are creating those vacancies by the thousand as they retire. Fortunately, this historic opportunity coincides with a President who is serious about cutting the size of government. If he declines to fill those vacancies and if state governors do the same, we could witness the first substantial reduction in big government in our nation\u2019s history. But it will take political will to make it happen.\u000a\u000aKris W. Kobach is the elected Secretary of State of Kansas. An expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the Arizona SB-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the 10 ICE agents who sued to stop Obama\u2019s 2012 executive amnesty. In 2017 President Trump named him Vice Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity. His website is kriskobach.com.

aVHellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice impresses with sight and sound, but there isn\u2019t any meat on the game\u2019s bones.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aDeveloper Ninja Theory\u2019s latest work is a third-person action experience with all the depth of a mobile game, disguised by a thoroughly impressive audio/visual presentation. The title follows Senua, a Celtic warrior driven insane by the tragic death of her lover. She descends into the madness of her own personal hell in a quest to save his soul.\u000a\u000aI can still hear Senua\u2019s voices in my head. Her existence is a haunted one, and the constant chatter of doubt and fear, rage and pain, was oppressive. But even while they linger, I am hard pressed to recall a single moment where I enjoyed actually playing Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice. The game, which Ninja Theory states was \u201ccreated in collaboration with neuroscientists and people who experience psychosis,\u201d is a fascinating rumination on mental illness, couched in the fantastic horror of Viking mythology, but it just isn\u2019t much of a game.\u000a\u000aCombat is rudimentary, and every enemy in the game follows the same pattern. Press a button to dodge or parry until you have the opportunity to strike, and then repeat ad nauseum until the fight is over. There are light and heavy attacks to add a measure of variation, though they feel redundant in practice.\u000a\u000aThere is a button to slow everything down and make your attacks more potent, too. Mostly, it feels like a welcome relief from fighting some of the endlessly repetitive enemies.\u000a\u000aThe entirety of your time in Senua\u2019s world will be spent running along a thinly veiled corridor, broken up by occasional puzzle areas. Exploration is almost always punished \u2014 there are precious few paths that you will not be forced down at some point, and there are no rewards for your diligence in scouring the environment. It is a game that begs to be thoughtfully considered, then forces your gaze solely forward.\u000a\u000aMuch of the several hours of you spend with the game will be occupied by camera-hunt perspective puzzles that would only be mildly interesting, even if they were carefully measured. They aren\u2019t. Being given yet another set of glyphs to pace around the environment with in search of a match is tiresome after the third time, and that barely covers the first hour or so. Before you can even enter Helheim, you\u2019ll have already participated in about a dozen such errands.\u000a\u000aHellblade alleviates that tedium with arresting visual and sound design, only outshone by the sort of scenery-chewing protagonist I would love to see in a better game. I cannot overstate how compelling protagonist Senua herself truly is. She is beautifully animated, expressive, and actress Melina Juergens\u2019 performance is easily one of the best we\u2019ve seen in all of gaming. The interspersed live-action visions of Nicholas Boulton\u2019s Druth, Senua\u2019s mentor who she sees in visions, would be jarring in virtually any other game, but here a clever use of visual effects manages to make it work.\u000a\u000aAt $30, Hellblade is priced so that trying it out isn\u2019t too costly a gamble.

aVVenezuela\u2019s recently ousted prosecutor general, Luisa Ortega Daz, has accused socialist dictator Nicols Maduro of personally profiting from food rations amid the country\u2019s widespread humanitarian crisis.\u000a\u000aAttending a regional trade summit in Brazil, Ortega accused Maduro of profiting off of the government\u2019s food ration delivery system, claiming that the Mexican company behind it \u201cis presumably owned by Nicols Maduro,\u201d despite being registered under other names.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to denounce, in front of the world, a grave situation in Venezuela: that of excessive corruption,\u201d Ortega said at the conference. \u201cBecause of that reason, the Maduro administration is violating the constitution and law to protect itself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Venezuela, there are no guarantees that any investigation related to organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking ends in conviction because the most probable outcome is that the key evidence disappears because there are many interests in corruption not being investigated,\u201d she continued.\u000a\u000aShe also accused high-ranking chavista Diosdado Cabello of illicitly profiting from the Brazilian firm Odebrecht, which has admitted to bribing governments across Latin America to the tune of $100 million.\u000a\u000aThe scandal-plagued firm allegedly won $300 billion in Venezuelan construction contracts; however, many of their projects remain unfinished.\u000a\u000aResponding to Ortega\u2019s statements, Henrique Capriles Radonski, the opposition governor of Miranda state, urged her to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of the corruption scandal.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe people need to know who is stealing their money and how much they\u2019ve robbed,\u201d Capriles said in a statement. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t stolen the income of Venezuelans, we would never be in this economic situation of shortages, hunger, and poverty.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe allegations of corruption are all the more shocking given Venezuela\u2019s current economic predicament. Amidst skyrocketing inflation, the country\u2019s monthly minimum wage has fallen to under $6 and there are chronic shortages of food, medicine, electricity, and basic sanitary products.\u000a\u000aOrtega fled Venezuela this week with her husband for Colombia after taking a speedboat the island of Aruba and then flying to the capital of Bogot.\u000a\u000aOrtega, who for years served as a pro-government attorney general and loyalist to the late Hugo Chvez, was fired by Maduro\u2019s \u201cnational constituents assembly\u201d (ANC), a fraudulent legislative body, after she began filing charges of human rights abuses against the regimes security forces.\u000a\u000aFollowing her departure, Venezuelan authorities broadcasted a raid on Ortega\u2019s home on national television, with images showing officers rifling through luxury items such as designer clothes, fine wines, and signed artworks belonging to the former attorney general.\u000a\u000aThe replacement attorney general, Tarek William Saab, has, in turn, accused Ortega herself of \u201cgrave moral and ethical infractions,\u201d and last week unveiled a number of corruption charges against her including claims she ran \u201cextortion gang\u201d by funneling profits into an offshore account, as well as blaming her for the deaths of protesters during the widespread anti-government demonstrations that have taken place since April.\u000a\u000aYesterday, Ortega confirmed she would return to Colombia, where Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has confirmed he will grant asylum. It is not yet clear whether she will accept it.\u000a\u000aYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com

aVUber\u2019s CEO Travis Kalanick was dumped after a 47-point report by former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder found the company to be a management disaster, but he could make a triumphant return, like Apple\u2019s once-fired CEO Steve Jobs.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News reported that the investigation by Eric Holder\u2019s Law Firm, Covington & Burling LLP, was the Death Star that caused Uber\u2019s Chief Executive Office, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Business Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Head of Engineering and General Counsel to leave involuntarily.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to Recode, Holder investigated 215 Uber incidents, which led to 20 terminations, 31 employees in training or counseling, 7 written warnings, 100 cases with no action taken, and 57 cases still open.\u000a\u000aAs Kalanick was resigning in disgrace on June 20, Eric Holder was announcing that he plans to lead the legal resistance to Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, and is exploring a run against the President in 2020. Holder told Yahoo News: \u201cThere\u2019s a justified perception that I\u2019m close to President Obama. So, I want to use whatever skills I have, whatever notoriety I have, to be effective in opposing things that are, at the end of the day, just bad for the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aUber\u2019s investors claim that they wanted a mass culture change to protect the company\u2019s $62.5 billion valuation. Audra Diers-Lawson, a professor of public relations strategy at Leeds Beckett University, told the liberal Atlantic that Uber needed fundamental change. She stated that Uber\u2019s CEO represented \u201ca reputational cancer that could have been cut away \u2014 but that the cancer has infected the rest of the body.\u201d\u000a\u000aTravis Kalanick was runner-up to Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel as Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year in 2015. Time was impressed by Kalanick\u2019s business zeal, but expressed concern with violent protests by taxi drivers against Uber\u2019s expansion. The Brookings Institute featured a column entitled \u201cIs Uber a threat to democracy?\u201d. The liberal publication demanded new social and regulatory policies as part of a new social contract.\u000a\u000aHarvard Business School held a one-day forum featuring top corporate executives to analyze \u201cUber\u2019s Keys to Success.\u201d The consensus was that CEO Travis Kalanick\u2019s willingness to violate corporate norms and flaunt laws was the key for Uber\u2019s access to $8.81 billion in 14 rounds of venture capital to fund its rise to international dominance.\u000a\u000aThe first cultural change by Uber\u2019s 14-member management committee, following Kalanick\u2019s resignation, is that Uber will be lending its cash-free business model for the first time by implementing a driver tipping option in a cultural effort to improve relations with drivers and avoid sexual harassment complaints, according to the Verge. The committee also cut the amount of time from 5 to 2 minutes that a user may cancel an Uber pick-up before being charged a $5 penalty.\u000a\u000aAlthough the cultural tweaks sound modest, they fundamentally change the business relationship Kalanick pioneered between Uber and its users. The company is now encouraging drivers to compete to service the best-tipping customers and communities. Kalanick strived to make the Uber experience consistent for all users.\u000a\u000aUber\u2019s board\u2019s highly visible dumping of Kalanick has similarities to Apple\u2019s board\u2019s dumping of Steve Jobs in 1985. According to Frank Rose\u2019s book, West of Eden: The End of Innocence at Apple Computer, Apple\u2019s board agreed that Jobs was a brilliant entrepreneur, but thought him too impulsive to run the business of a Fortune 500 firm.\u000a\u000aHis replacement, John Sculley, raised prices and licensed Apple\u2019s technology. That initially saw higher profits. But the customer experience faded without Apple creating disruptive new products. On the verge of bankruptcy, Apple brought Jobs\u2019s NeXT Computer 1997 and made him CEO again. Apple is now Forbes\u2019 most valuable brand.\u000a\u000aTravis Kalanick has an advantage over Steve Jobs, because he holds Uber super-voting shares that give him the right to appoint a new majority of Uber\u2019s board, according to Wired. If Uber\u2019s 14-member management committee fails to be entrepreneurial and Uber loses user competitiveness, Kalanick can come back as the company\u2019s savior.

According to international observers, Duterte has kept that promise, although many of the roughly 5,500 people killed since he came into office were not, strictly speaking, drug dealers. Some of them do not appear to have been criminals at all.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAmong the latest casualties of Duterte\u2019s drug war was 17-year-old student Kian Delos Santos, who was allegedly dragged from his home and murdered by police officers. A witness said he used his last words to beg the officers not to kill him because he had an important test coming up at school the next day.\u000a\u000aEven Duterte thought this was out of line, as he claims to have ordered the immediate arrest of the police officers involved. Furious Australian politicians thought it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d for Warner to pose with Duterte in a jovial fist-pump photo, as Labor MP Anthony Byrne put it.\u000a\u000aElaine Pearson of Human Rights Watch went further, saying it was \u201csickening\u201d to see Australians intelligence chief \u201cfist-pumping a man who has instigated the killing of thousands.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAustralia is sending mixed messages amid an incredible spike in killings of the Philippines poorest people. Australia must condemn in the strongest terms the killings by Philippines police of people without trial,\u201d said Michael Hayworth of Amnesty International.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not know the details of how it came about or who released the photograph, but of course, Australia\u2019s secret intelligence service is called a secret intelligence service for a reason, so preferably, the work that they do is below the surface,\u201d said Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop of the fist-pump photo on Thursday, probably wishing Warner had seen fit to keep his photo shoot with Duterte below the surface too.\u000a\u000aShe said she believed the photo was taken at Duterte\u2019s request during Warner\u2019s visit to the Philippine president\u2019s palace on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn both occasions that I\u2019ve met with President Duterte, I\u2019ve raised the issue of human rights and the extrajudicial killings,\u201d Bishop assured reporters.\u000a\u000aShe added that the ongoing Islamic State insurgency on the Philippine island of Mindanao is a \u201csignificant issue\u201d for the entire region, because it has \u201cthe potential to be the southeast Asian headquarters for ISIS,\u201d so Australian support for the Philippine government is crucial.\u000a\u000aAustralia formally listed the Islamic State in East Asia as a terrorist organization last week, noting that ISIS is actively recruiting extremists from Australia to join the battle for Mindanao.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for Duterte said on Thursday that the photo captured a \u201clighthearted\u201d moment between Warner and Duterte, a happy \u201cwarming of relationships\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t meant to be in any way political.\u201d

aVIvanka Trump\u2019s \u201cspecial status\u201d in Chief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s White House could lead to President Donald Trump receiving some bad advice, according to RealClearPolitics reporter Rebecca Berg.\u000a\u000aIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, have never understood Trump\u2019s voters or his economic nationalist movement. But since Ivanka is now the only West Wing staffer who can reportedly enter the Oval Office without an appointment, Javanka\u2019s political suggestions will be more influential.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAppearing on CNN\u2019s The Situation Room, Berg told host Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that though Kushner and Ivanka Trump are \u201csenior advisers,\u201d they are \u201cnever going to be totally separate from their roles as members of his family.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd that gives them a special status,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd it also potentially gives their advice a special status, which could be detrimental to the president, potentially, when maybe they\u2019re not giving the best advice.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, on Kelly\u2019s first day on the job, he told top White House advisers that \u201cOval Office access\u201d to Trump \u201cwould be strictly limited to appointments only.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe exceptions, Mr. Kelly said, were the president\u2019s wife and his 11-year-old son. And, he added, turning to Ivanka Trump, who was seated near him, the president\u2019s eldest daughter, if she was speaking to him as a daughter and not a member of his staff,\u201d Haberman reported.\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News has pointed out, Kushner already committed political malpractice when he reportedly urged Trump to fire then-FBI director James Comey, naively believing that Democrats would cheer the move like some neoconservatives foolishly believed Iraqis would greet American troops with \u201csweets\u201d and \u201cflowers.\u201d Had he never taken Kushner\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d advice, Trump may not be in the mess that he is in now.\u000a\u000aIvanka Trump, meanwhile, has apparently been working to push Trump to support policies\u2014like on climate change\u2014that her liberal urbanite friends on the coasts like.\u000a\u000aBut urging Trump to adopt more socially liberal positions, especially if Trump pushes a more corporatist and Wall Street-centric economic agenda, could destroy Trump in 2020, unless Trump\u2019s ultimate goal is to host Morning Joe, where card-carrying \u201cNo Labels\u201d/St. Albans/Never Trump members of the 3.8% tune in to get their insular worldview reaffirmed by \u201cjournalists\u201d and \u201cthinkers\u201d (poseurs) who have perfected the art of \u201csounding smart\u201d without dispensing any knowledge whatsoever.

aVCalifornia Democrats are losing their minds over President Donald Trump\u2019s mental health, leading the charge nationally to call for everything from mandatory psychiatric treatment to censure and even impeachment.\u000a\u000aPolitico\u2019s Carla Marinucci reports on the California House Democrats\u2019 seeming obsession with the President\u2019s mental well-being or lack thereof:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aRep. Zoe Lofgren last week introduced a congressional resolution urging Trump to seek a medical and psychiatric evaluation to determine if he is unfit for the office. Rep. Jackie Speier called for invoking the 25th Amendment \u2014 which empowers the vice president and Cabinet to remove a president who is incapable of serving \u2014 after a press conference from Trump Tower in which the president appeared to equate white supremacists with counter-protesters. Both followed on the heels of Rep. Ted Lieu\u2019s push for legislation requiring a psychiatrist at the White House. \u201c[Trump] has demonstrated that his mental capacity and his erratic behavior are issues we need to be concerned about for our national security,\u201d Speier told POLITICO. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019m not the first person that\u2019s talked about it. I\u2019m just the first person that\u2019s been public about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs news stories abound across the country with pundits pontificating on Trump\u2019s supposed meltdown during his lengthy speech at a Phoenix rally on Tuesday, California elected officials are taking the lead in proposing action to address what they claim is a crisis in the White House.\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s not just the Congressional Democrats from California speaking out.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Los Angeles Times, days after the Charlottesville rally, a California Assemblyman \u2014Tony Thurmond, a Richmond Democrat \u2014 is pushing for Trump to be censured:\u000a\u000a\u201cIn legitimizing groups like the KKK and neo-Nazis whose only association is with terror, hate, and death, the President has emboldened those who seek to divide us and inject fear into our communities,\u201d Thurmond said in a statement. U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, introduced a resolution for a congressional censure Friday.\u000a\u000aCensure by the Congress does nothing to remove a president from office. Ironically, the last president to be censured was one to whom Trump has often compared himself: Andrew Jackson.

aVOnly six of the 242 House GOP legislators signed an August 22 letter urging President Donald Trump to preserve former President Barack Obama\u2019s DACA amnesty for 800,000 illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aThe letter \u2014 which was touted by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s FWD.US pro-immigration advocacy group \u2014 declared:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWe write to express our support for maintaining the protections of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) for current recipients of the policy. We understand and deeply respect the rule of law, and firmly believe that those who have violated the law must face fair consequences. We also have a responsibility to apply the law in the manner required by the circumstances\u000a\u000aThe unpopularity of the 2012 DACA amnesty was underlined by the fact that only six GOP legislators signed the letter, despite the top-level cheering for the DACA amnesty by Zuckerberg\u2019s group and by other business-funded operations.\u000a\u000aThe six legislators who signed the letter are New York Rep. Daniel Donovan, California Rep. David Valadao, Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, California Rep. Jeff Denham and Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Press aides for the members declined to comment when asked by Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aThe low number of open supporters \u201cdemonstrates that there is a clear consensus within the President\u2019s party that DACA should be terminated,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \u201cThe president should focus honoring the promises and pledges he made to the American public during his campaign,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aTrump has the advantage, Mehlman said, in part because Democrats are under great pressure to preserve the DACA amnesty. \u201cJust the mere rumor that [DACA] repeal is in the works \u2026 sent the Democrats leadership apoplectic,\u201d he said. Trump \u201chas to start holding them publicly accountable\u201d for their unpopular pro-immigration policies, he added.\u000a\u000aThe six-person latter was posted as senior globalist aides on Trump\u2019s staff reportedly try to sideline his priorities, which include building a border wall and signing the RAISE Act immigration reform. Those goals are fiercely opposed by Democrats and by many businesses groups, and they also threaten to sink the managers\u2019 top priority goal \u2014 the passage of a tax cut for businesses and high-income earners.\u000a\u000aSo far, when cheered by his supporters at rallies, Trump continues to demand that Congress fund his border wall, and is effectively promising to veto a budget deal unless Congress funds his budget wall this October.\u000a\u000aImmigration reformers, however, fear that Trump\u2019s top aides would gladly agree to make DACA permanent in return for minor benefits, such as one year\u2019s worth of wall funding.\u000a\u000aThe six-legislator letter was tweeted out by FWD.US, which is also using its website to campaign for the DACA amnesty.\u000a\u000aNEW: GOP Members of Congress send @POTUS letter \u2013\u000a\u000aurge protection for #DACA recipients "until we can find a permanent legislative solution" pic.twitter.com/Ec5s1l3Glk \u2014 FWD.us (@FWD_us) August 23, 2017\u000a\u000aAn August 24 article which said Trump might choose to end DACA also prompted laments from the head of the pro-immigration, business-funded New American Economy advocacy group. The group has issued business-funded reports touting the spending power of legal and illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aThis is awful. Worse would be Congress sitting on its hands while it happens. https://t.co/hFkxo7JChd \u2014 Jeremy Robbins (@JeremyARobbins) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aThis support for illegal immigration by business groups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere also reflects the success of the Democrats\u2019 immigration strategy. In general, Democrats block any increased inflow high-tech immigrants sought by business groups unless those business groups also support the Democratic goal of getting amnesty and citizenship for roughly 11 million low-skilled, government-dependent immigrants.\u000a\u000aAdvocacy groups tied to business are helping the joint push by Democrats and business groups. For example, the six-legislator letter quoted a claim by the business-funded CATO Institute which argued that repatriation of the 750,000 illegals would shrink the government\u2019s revenue by just $6 billion a year. Surprisingly, the study ignored federal spending on the DACA recipients, and also assumed that the DACA recipients are similar to H-1B white-collar visa workers, all of whom have college degrees.\u000a\u000aSurprisingly, the CATO study did not count the high level of taxpayer spending on the DACA recipients, and it also assumed that the DACA recipients are similar to H-1B white-collar visa workers, all of whom have college degrees.\u000a\u000aUnder current immigration policy, the federal government accepts 1 million legal immigrants each year, even though 4 million young Americans enter the workforce to look for decent jobs. Each year, the government also hands out almost 3 million short-term work permits to foreign workers. These permits include roughly 330,000 one-year OPT permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, roughly 200,000 three-year H-1B visas for foreign white-collar professionals, and 400,000 two-year permits to DACA illegals.\u000a\u000aThe current annual flood of foreign labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families.\u000a\u000aMultiple business groups admit that Trump\u2019s popular RAISE Act immigration and economic reform would raise Americans\u2019 salaries.\u000a\u000aMany polls show that Americans are very generous, they do welcome individual immigrants, and they do want to like the idea of immigration. But the polls also show that most Americans are increasingly worried that large-scale legal immigration will change their country and disadvantage themselves and their children. Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d policies are also extremely popular, including among Democratic-leaning voters.

Afghanistan also suffers from endemic and widespread corruption that is funneling funds to terrorists and has contributed to the death of Americans.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, SIGAR revealed that the common practice of sexually abusing boys was punishable by death under Taliban rule, but it was \u201cresurrected\u201d after the terrorist group\u2019s regime was overthrown by the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, opium production, which the Taliban was once believed to have prohibited, has increased 25-fold since the United States invaded Afghanistan and is now serving as a top source of funding for the terrorist group.\u000a\u000aAfghanistan, now the world\u2019s top supplier of opium and its heroin derivative, is suffering from an addiction problem afflicting tens of thousands of women and some children inside the war-ravaged country.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, although the U.S.-backed Afghan government enacted a new law in January 2017 that criminalizes bacha bazi, the old custom in which older men exploit boys for social and sexual entertainment continues, according to an American watchdog agency.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfghan officials remain complicit, especially in the sexual exploitation and recruitment of children by Afghan security forces,\u201d reported the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a U.S. watchdog agency, at the end of July.\u000a\u000aThe United States has invested $714 billion in Afghanistan since the conflict started in October 2001, including about $120 billion in reconstruction projects.\u000a\u000aEchoing other U.S. officials and the president himself, McMaster defined what it means to win in Afghanistan for the Trump administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cWinning in Afghanistan means that there are no terrorist groups who are able to control key parts of the territory or population centers there that could be used to mobilize resources, raise funds, use those funds to then organize, plan, and conduct attacks against us and our allies and partners,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo that\u2019s what the success is \u2014 is really a sustainable outcome there that ensures the safety and security of the American people,\u201d McMaster continued. \u201cAnd, as you know, Afghanistan is connected to broader security concerns across the region. And so the outcome is to ensure that a threat from that region doesn\u2019t threaten the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the U.S. military, the Afghanistan-Pakistan region is home to the largest concentration of Islamic terrorists in the world.\u000a\u000aWhile announcing his new Afghan strategy Monday, President Trump defined victory as \u201cattacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS [Islamic State], crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOur nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives,\u201d he added. \u201cThe men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. They deserve the tools they need, and the trust they have earned, to fight and to win.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmerican Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, also said the ultimate goal of Trump\u2019s Afghanistan strategy is to annihilate terrorists and prevent the country from becoming a launching pad for attacks against America.

aVGary Cohn drafted a letter of resignation in the tumultuous week after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, according to the New York Times.\u000a\u000aCohn, the White House\u2019s chief economic adviser, met with President Donald Trump in his New Jersey home last Friday, \u201cscrapping his plans to spend the evening at his second home in the Hamptons,\u201d the New York Times reported. Financial markets were rife with rumors that Cohn would resign, a story the White House insisted was untrue.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBut Cohn apparently did come close to resigning, going as far as to draft a letter of resignation. He was under pressure from Wall Street associates, friends, and even family members to leave Trump\u2019s White House following the president\u2019s remarks about Charlottesville. Establishment media have inaccurately described those remarks as a defense of white nationalist protesters.\u000a\u000aIt remains unclear precisely what Cohn was threatening to resign over and what he got in exchange for staying with the administration. Trump has said that Cohn is on his short-list of potential nominees for the Federal Reserve.\u000a\u000aOne administration official speculated that Cohn may simply have been given permission to go public with his grievances against the president.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with the Financial Times, Cohn went further than any other administration official in publicly condemning the president\u2019s Charlottesville comments. In the interview, he criticized Trump\u2019s remarks and parroted the misleading line that left-wing Antifa forces in Charlottesville were simply \u201ccitizens standing up for equality and freedom.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohn\u2019s comments were very different from those of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who defended the president in answer to criticism from members of Yale\u2019s class of 1985.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t believe the allegations against the president are accurate,\u201d Mnuchin said.\u000a\u000aThe contrast may be due to the political backgrounds of the two men.

Mnuchin is a Republican, who was an early President Trump supporter and who served as the national finance chairman for the campaign.\u000a\u000aBoth men stood beside the president in the lobby of Trump Tower when Trump made his controversial remarks. And each apparently came away with very different interpretations of what was said. Mnuchin wound up defending the president while defending his decision to remain in the administration. In stark contrast, Cohn defended his own decision to remain in the administration and condemned the president\u2019s comments.

aVThirty months ago, I spoke to Conor McGregor about Floyd Mayweather. About thirty hours from now, the two fight.\u000a\u000aThe notion of this reality appeared ridiculous in early 2015\u2014but not to Conor McGregor. That\u2019s how amazing happens: a man dreams and then he does.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI love boxing,\u201d McGregor confessed to me in 2015 about the Manny Pacquiao-Floyd Mayweather bout scheduled for that summer. \u201cBut boxing has this fight. Not everyone is making that money. That is a special fight.\u201d\u000a\u000aBackstage in Boston at an old vaudeville theater, McGregor spoke to me in the dark, where his eyes lit up brightly when I broached the subject of Floyd Mayweather making $300 million for a fight against Manny Paquiao versus the stated $3 million purse he looked to pocket against Jose Aldo. Long after the fans departed, and Jose Aldo headed out the backdoor, McGregor held court, talking to anyone who would talk to him about him. The klieg lights that now accompany him everywhere were nowhere backstage. Instead, he allowed me to shine my iPod\u2019s light on his face as he spoke into my iPhone\u2019s lens. Some shine so blindingly bright that they don\u2019t need the spotlight for anyone around to realize that they look upon a star.\u000a\u000aDidn\u2019t the biggest name in boxing making 100 times more than the biggest name in mixed-martial arts indicate that a profound financial gap still existed between the two combat sports?\u000a\u000a\u201cI feel we will get to that stage,\u201d McGregor insisted. \u201cI certainly will\u2014not everybody else. I most certainly will.\u201d\u000a\u000aI did not believe him. I did not believe him the year earlier at the UFC\u2019s Boston gym, where he earnestly told me that the then-beltless him would become a two-weight UFC champion. I did not believe that could beat Jose Aldo. I did not believe that he would beat Eddie Alvarez.\u000a\u000aFans of McGregor should gleefully note that I do not believe that Conor McGregor can beat Floyd Mayweather.\u000a\u000aBut in speaking to McGregor for a few minutes here and there about a dozen times over the last three years, I do believe that Conor McGregor believes that he beats Floyd Mayweather Saturday night in Las Vegas, nay, I do know that Conor McGregor knows that he beats Floyd Mayweather on Saturday night in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aBelief is more contagious than a cold. The heavy action laid on McGregor in the Las Vegas sports books proves this. Floyd boasts an experience and skills edge. Connor beats him in belief, which, although never appearing on a tale of the tape, ranks as a formidable attribute. Two-thousand miles and more than two years removed from Saturday night in Vegas, one could see the gears churn in McGregor\u2019s mind, his eyes become moon pies, and his manner grow serious but excited at the mere sound of another athlete\u2019s name.\u000a\u000aI said \u201cFloyd Mayweather.\u201d He heard \u201cMoney.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaybe the light bulb went off above McGregor\u2019s head long before the lights went off in that aging theater. But one could see him silently talking himself into this fight that night so long before he talked the public into demanding the fight and so long before he talked Floyd Mayweather out of retirement.\u000a\u000aNate Diaz does not put nine figures on your paycheck. Khabib Nurmagomedov does not push your personal GDP past Montserrat\u2019s. Cowboy Cerrone does not elevate you near the top of the Forbes richest athletes list.\u000a\u000aTo make that kind of money, it helps to fight a man named Money. But in the ring as in life, money usually wins. Just don\u2019t tell that to Conor McGregor. People holding such an overpowering belief in themselves just won\u2019t believe you.

aVU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s strategy to end the war in Afghanistan is \u201cdetermined\u201d to pressure the Taliban into reconciliation and a political settlement with the Kabul government by making the jihadists realize they cannot win, declared the top American commander in the war-ravaged country, echoing the State Department and the Pentagon.\u000a\u000aDespite Afghan President Ashraf Ghani saying peace talks between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Taliban were within reach in early 2015, there has been no discernible progress in negotiations with the terrorist group, which has refused to participate in talks with Kabul because it is winning the war.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aNevertheless, the U.S. military, State, and the Pentagon as a whole have recently indicated that Trump\u2019s new Afghanistan strategy is focused on bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table to discuss peace and reconciliation with the Afghan government.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are determined to pursue the goal of a political settlement. As these terrorist groups realize that they cannot win, they will see that their best option is to pursue peace,\u201d American Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, told reporters in Afghanistan during a joint press conference with the U.S. ambassador in the country.\u000a\u000aGen. Nicholson urged the Taliban to \u201cstop fighting against your countrymen. Stop killing innocent civilians. Stop bringing hardship and misery to the Afghan people. Lay down your arms and join Afghan society. Help build a better future for this country and your own children.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis remarks are consistent with how U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has described Trump\u2019s newly unveiled Afghan strategy \u2014 as an effort to convince the Taliban to negotiate peace with the Afghan government.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are there to facilitate and ensure that there is a pathway for reconciliation and peace talks,\u201d declared Tillerson. \u201cAs the pressure begins to take hold, we believe we already know there are certain moderate elements of the Taliban who we think will be ready and develop a way forward.\u201d\u000a\u000aTillerson acknowledged that the negotiation effort would take time.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is time to begin a process, a lengthy process, of reconciliation and a peace accord in Afghanistan,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cHow long that will take will be based on conditions on the ground.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s South Asia strategy is intended to pressure the Taliban to accept that they \u201cwill not win a battlefield victory,\u201d also said the secretary of state, directly addressing the jihadists and saying, \u201cWe may not win one, but neither will you.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Pentagon recently indicated that Trump\u2019s plan would push for a peace agreement with the Taliban.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur main objective is to prevent Afghanistan from being used as a safe haven for terrorists to attack the United States and our allies,\u201d Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman, recently told Breitbart News. \u201cThe United States will support the Afghan government and security forces in their fight against Taliban, al-Qaeda, ISIS [Islamic State], and other insurgents and prevent re-establishment of international terrorist safe havens in the country. We will maintain pressure on the Taliban to join a peace process with the Afghan government to end the war in Afghanistan.\u201d\u000a\u000aTaliban jihadists are believed to control or contest about 40 percent of Afghanistan, according to a watchdog agency.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Gen. Nicholson argued that peace negotiations are in the best interest of the Taliban.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the rank and file, the Taliban\u2019s losses are even greater than the losses of the Afghan Security Forces. This is unsustainable. The Taliban are a criminal organization, more interested in the profits they find in drugs, kidnapping, and murder for hire than offering anything better to the Afghan people,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe U.S.-backed Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP), considered the only institutional mechanism within the Afghan government with the capability to pursue both high-level reconciliation negotiations and provincial-level reintegration of terrorists, closed its doors last year due to a lack of progress, despite the tens of millions the United States wasted on the effort.\u000a\u000aBetween the program\u2019s creation in 2010 and 2014, over 9,000 terrorists were reintegrated into Afghan society, at a cost of about $35,000 each, with the United States bearing most of the burden.\u000a\u000aCurrently, the Trump administration is preparing to launch a successor to the APRP \u2014 a five-year Afghanistan National Peace and Reconciliation (ANPR) strategy, reported the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency.\u000a\u000a\u201cAccording to [the] State [Department], the ANPR is expected to shift from the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration focus of the APRP to negotiating political settlements with armed opposition groups, forging national and international consensus on a peace process, and promoting and institutionalizing a culture of peace,\u201d explained SIGAR.\u000a\u000aIn announcing his Afghan strategy Monday, President Trump promised a military \u201cvictory\u201d to the American people.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge,\u201d said the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not nation-building again,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are killing terrorists.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe United States has invested about $714 billion in Afghanistan since the war started in October 2001, including an estimated $120 billion on reconstruction efforts alone, dubbed \u201cnation-building\u201d by some critics.\u000a\u000aNicholson \u201crejected criticism that the new military strategy would echo previous U.S. policies that did not make significant headway, even with more than 100,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan at one time,\u201d reports the Washington Post (WaPo).\u000a\u000aHe praised the shift from U.S. strategy of support based on \u201carbitrary timelines\u201d to one \u201cguided by conditions\u201d on the ground, noting, \u201cYou can believe it will be different because we removed the calendar from the equation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military and the Trump administration have been silent about how many additional American troops will deploy to Afghanistan as part of the new strategy.

aVCORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) \u2014 Hurricane Harvey settled over southeast Texas early Saturday, lashing the state\u2019s Gulf Coast with damaging winds and dumping torrents of rain over hundreds of miles of coastline that braced for what forecasters predicted would be life-threatening storm surges \u2013 basically walls of water moving inland.\u000a\u000aThe fiercest hurricane to hit the U.S. in more than a decade made landfall Friday night about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Corpus Christi as a Category 4 storm with 130 mph (209 kph) winds. It gradually weakened over the next several hours and the National Hurricane Center said that by 5 a.m. Saturday Harvey was downgraded to a Category 1 \u2013 still sustaining winds of 90 mph (144 kph). It had already dumped more than 9 inches (228.6 millimeters) of rain in the South Texas city of Victoria and had knocked out power to more than 200,000 customers.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHarvey\u2019s approach sent tens of thousands of residents fleeing inland, hoping to escape the wrath of a menacing storm that threatens not only the coast but a wide swath of Texas that is home to oil refineries, chemical plants and dangerously flood-prone Houston, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city.\u000a\u000aNo deaths were immediately confirmed in the hours after Harvey\u2019s arrival, but officials noted emergency crews couldn\u2019t get out in many places due to high winds. Melissa Munguia, deputy emergency management coordinator in Nueces County, which includes Corpus Christi, said early Saturday that it could be hours before crews could fully assess the damage in coastal communities.\u000a\u000aEarly reports did begin to emerge from Rockport, a coastal city of about 10,000 people that was directly in Harvey\u2019s path when it came ashore. Officials confirmed that the roof of Rockport\u2019s high school had partially caved in and that the community\u2019s historic downtown saw extensive damage.\u000a\u000aRockport City Manager Kevin Carruth told local media outlets that multiple people had been taken to the county\u2019s jail for assessment and treatment after the roof of a senior housing complex collapsed. KIII-TV reported that 10 people were treated there.\u000a\u000aEarlier Friday, Rockport Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Rios had offered ominous advice, telling the station that those who chose to stay put rather than evacuate the area \u201cshould make some type of preparation to mark their arm with a Sharpie pen,\u201d implying doing so would make it easier for rescuers to identify them.\u000a\u000aIn Corpus Christi, the major city closest to the storm\u2019s center, wind whipped palm trees and stinging sheets of horizontal rain slapped against hotels and office buildings along the city\u2019s seawall as the storm made landfall. Boats bobbed violently in the marina. It was too dark to tell whether any boats had broken their moorings.\u000a\u000aFueled by warm Gulf of Mexico waters, Harvey grew rapidly, accelerating from a Category 1 early Friday morning to a Category 4 by evening. Its transformation from an unnamed storm to a life-threatening behemoth took only 56 hours, an incredibly fast intensification.\u000a\u000aHarvey came ashore as the fiercest hurricane to hit the U.S. in 13 years and the strongest to strike Texas since 1961\u2019s Hurricane Carla, the most powerful Texas hurricane on record. Based on the atmospheric pressure, Harvey ties for the 18th strongest hurricane on landfall in the U.S. since 1851 and ninth strongest in Texas.\u000a\u000aA worst case scenario is that the hurricane could hug the coast for days and stay strong enough to remain a tropical storm. Forecasts call for as much as 30 inches (.76 meters) of rain to fall by next Wednesday, with some areas getting as much as 40 inches (1 meter), according to the hurricane center. Meanwhile, the storm surge could bring flooding of 6 to 12 feet (2 to 4 meters) to a coastal area that includes Matagorda Island and Port O\u2019Connor.\u000a\u000aSometime early next week forecasters said it could go back into the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, which provide fuel, then turn back in for a potential second hit on what may be an already flooded Houston-Galveston area.\u000a\u000aBefore the storm arrived, home and business owners raced to nail plywood over windows and fill sandbags. Steady traffic filled the highways leaving Corpus Christi, but there were no apparent jams. In Houston, where mass evacuations can include changing major highways to a one-way vehicle flow, authorities left traffic patterns unchanged.\u000a\u000aJust hours before the projected landfall, the governor and Houston leaders issued conflicting statements on evacuation.\u000a\u000aAfter Gov. Greg Abbott urged more people to flee, Houston authorities told people to remain in their homes and recommended no widespread evacuations.\u000a\u000aIn a Friday press conference that addressed Houston officials\u2019 decision to not have a voluntary or mandatory evacuation, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said there might be a \u201cgreater danger\u201d in having people who don\u2019t need to be evacuated on roads that could flood.\u000a\u000aHarris County Judge Ed Emmett said that because the hurricane was not taking direct aim at Houston, the city\u2019s primary concern was heavy flooding.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not having a hurricane,\u201d said Emmett, the top elected official for the county, which encompasses Houston. \u201cWe are having a rain event.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt a convenience store in Houston\u2019s Meyerland neighborhood, at least 12 cars lined up for fuel. Brent Borgstedte said this was the fourth gas station he had visited to try to fill up his son\u2019s car. The 55-year-old insurance agent shrugged off Harvey\u2019s risks.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is really that worried about it. I\u2019ve lived here my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through several hurricanes.\u201d\u000a\u000aScientists warned that Harvey could swamp counties more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) inland and stir up dangerous surf as far away as Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) from the projected landfall.\u000a\u000aIt may also spawn tornadoes. Even after weakening, the system might spin out into the Gulf and regain strength before hitting Houston a second time Wednesday as a tropical storm, forecasters said.\u000a\u000aAll seven Texas counties on the coast from Corpus Christi to the western end of Galveston Island ordered mandatory evacuations from low-lying areas. Four counties ordered full evacuations and warned there was no guarantee of rescue for people staying behind.\u000a\u000aState officials said they had no count on how many people actually left their homes.\u000a\u000aThe storm posed the first major emergency management test of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The president was expected to receive briefings during the weekend at Camp David, and signed a federal disaster declaration for coastal counties Friday night.\u000a\u000aThe last Category 4 storm to hit the U.S. was Hurricane Charley in August 2004 in Florida. Superstorm Sandy, which pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, never had the high winds and had lost tropical status by the time it struck. But it was devastating without formally being called a major hurricane.\u000a\u000aHarvey is the first significant hurricane to hit Texas since Ike in September 2008 brought winds of 110 mph (177 kph) to the Galveston and Houston areas, inflicting $22 billion in damage.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s taking aim at the same vicinity as Carla, which had wind gusts estimated at 175 mph and inflicted more than $300 million in damage. The storm killed 34 people and forced about 250,000 people to evacuate.

aVAn elderly Pennsylvania woman was set upon, beaten, and had her head shaved by her daughter and granddaughter because she had the volume of the Pittsburgh Steelers game up too high, police say.\u000a\u000aThe incident occurred on August 20 as the 77-year-old victim was listening to the Steelers game on the radio in her Youngwood home, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aPolice say that the elderly woman\u2019s daughter, Delores M.

A police report notes that the elderly woman was beaten and had her head shaved.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe victim was unhappy with the volume of the TV after the defendants turned the volume low, so the victim locked herself in the bedroom and turned on her radio.

aVKelly Sadler, a low-level staffer in the White House, lied about her credentials to push inaccurate leaked information to the press about the resignation of Dr. Sebastian Gorka from the administration.\u000a\u000aIn an email to a number of people in the media, Sadler opens up by saying the email is for \u201cBACKGROUND PURPOSES ONLY.\u201d That text is written in bright red, and bolded. The headline of the email is \u201cBackground on Sebastian Gorka.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn the body of the email, Sadler then writes to media figures covering the resignation of Dr. Gorka: \u201cFrom a White House Official: \u2018Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aShe rounds out the email to media elites by pleading: \u201cNo attribution to me, please. Senior White House official only.\u201d\u000a\u000aSadler\u2019s claim that she is a \u201cSenior White House official\u201d is not true. She is not a \u201cSenior White House official.\u201d She is a low-level press staffer, and a commissioned officer as a special assistant to the president.\u000a\u000aIn addition, her claim that Gorka \u201cdid not resign\u201d is also untrue. Gorka sent the president a detailed resignation letter, as multiple media outlets have reported.\u000a\u000aIn his resignation letter, Gorka wrote to President Trump that given \u201crecent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are \u2013 for now \u2013 ascendant within the White House.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People\u2019s House,\u201d Gorka wrote. He went on:\u000a\u000aRegrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week. The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost. Just as worrying, when discussing our future actions in the region, the speech listed operational objectives without ever defining the strategic victory conditions we are fighting for. This omission should seriously disturb any national security professional, and any American who is unsatisfied with the last 16 years of disastrous policy decisions which have led to thousands of Americans killed and trillions of taxpayer dollars spent in ways that have not brought security or victory.\u000a\u000aThe White House refused to comment on Sadler\u2019s decision to inflate her credentials to lie about Gorka\u2019s resignation.

aVPresident Donald Trump has erased former President Barack Obama\u2019s late-term imposition of the transgender ideology on the U.S. military.\u000a\u000aThe decision likely will boost military effectiveness and also help Americans defend their two-sex, male-and-female society from pro-transgender lawyers and judges.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI am directing the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, to return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016,\u201d Trump said in a Friday afternoon statement.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s restoration of the pre-Obama policies also bars funds from being used for sex-related cosmetic surgery. It directs officials to:\u000a\u000ahalt all use of DoD or DHS resources to fund sex\u2011reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex.\u000a\u000aThe directive complements a recent decision by the Department of Justice reversing Obama\u2019s claim that existing sexual discrimination laws also bar unfair treatment of people who say they have an opposite-sex \u201cgender identity.\u201d This legal shift means that pro-transgender lawyers will be unable to claim in court that the federal government believes that the sex-discrimination laws support the transgender claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their \u201cgender identity\u201d rather than by their male-or-female biology.\u000a\u000aHowever, the short policy statement does not formally say that each soldier\u2019s sex is determined by their biology. That silence may allow holdover Obama officials to quietly maintain Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policy which accepted the transgender political claim soldiers should be allowed to switch their legal sex in military personnel records by declaring they have an opposite-sex \u201cgender identity.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s directive does give Pentagon officials time to clear up the complications caused by the short-lived Obama policy. For example, the policy says:\u000a\u000aAs part of the implementation plan, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military. Until the Secretary has made that determination, no action may be taken against such individuals under the policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum.\u000a\u000aThe policy also includes language to frustrate pro-transgender lawsuits, saying:\u000a\u000aIf any provision of this memorandum, or the application of any provision of this memorandum, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this memorandum and other dissimilar applications of the provision shall not be affected.\u000a\u000aHowever, the policy also allows the Pentagon chief to push for the return of Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policy, saying \u201cthe Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may advise me at any time, in writing, that a change to this policy is warranted.\u201d\u000a\u000aTony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, welcomed the return to the pre-Obama, normal policy:\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Trump is doing what he promised: putting the military\u2019s focus where it belongs \u2013 fighting and winning wars. Political correctness doesn\u2019t win wars \u2014 and the president is ending policies that pretend it does. Monday night the president rightfully praised our service men and women for their \u2018shared mission\u2019 and \u2018shared purpose\u2019 of defending our nation and freedom. President Trump is listening to their concerns about distractions that hinder their mission \u2013 and now he is acting to address them. The guidance released today reflects those conversations, and prioritizes military readiness while also showing respect for those who currently serve and identify as transgender.\u000a\u000aPro-transgender groups and individuals tweeted their opposition to Trump\u2019s reform.\u000a\u000aThere's NO reason for a transgender ban. Military isn't asking for it. Americans don't want it. This is about Trump embrace of hate.

These advocates also argue that the federal and state government must support people who say they are \u201ctransgender\u201d by requiring other people to treat them as members of the opposite sex and to refer to them with opposite-sex pronouns.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, polls show that most Americans want to conserve their two-sex society, in which laws and civic practices are intended to help the two equal sexes manage their different and complementary biology-influenced desires and capabilities.\u000a\u000aThe \u201cgender identity\u201d claims have a growing impact on the operation of different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women\u2019s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.\u000a\u000aPolls show that roughly one-quarter of Americans support the progressive claim that biological sex is less important that chosen \u201cgender identity,\u201d despite intense media pressure in favor of the pro-transgender, anti-sexes campaign.\u000a\u000aThere are very few \u201ctransgender\u201d people. For example, advocates say from 1,320 t0 11,000 people in the military are trying fully or partly to live like members of the other sex, within the military population of 1.3 million full-time soldiers, sailors, marines and air force personnel. Fewer than o.3 percent of Americans wish to live as members of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s formal opposition to the transgender ideology is pushing Democrats to make their unpopular transgender ideology an issue in the 2018 elections. However, Obama has said twice that his 2016 support for the ideology helped contribute to Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in the presidential election.

aVA Californian first grader was sent to the principal\u2019s office this week after allegedly \u201cmisgendering\u201d a transgender student.\u000a\u000aThe incident reportedly took place at California\u2019s Rocklin Academy, in the school playground, where the female student called her biologically male classmate \u201cby his given name \u2013 apparently unaware that the boy now identified as a girl,\u201d according to Fox News.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cThis innocent little first grader sees a classmate, calls him by the name she knew him last year and the boy reports it to a teacher,\u201d claimed Karen England, from the Capitol Resource Institute. \u201cThe little girl gets in trouble on the playground and then gets called out of class to the principal\u2019s office.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring her visit to the principal\u2019s office, the child was reportedly \u201cinvestigated\u201d to determine \u201cwhether or not she had bullied the transgender child by calling him by his original name.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter about an hour it was determined the little girl made an honest mistake and she was not punished or reprimanded. But she was terribly traumatized by the incident,\u201d Fox News claimed.\u000a\u000aAfter the child returned home upset, her mother wrote a letter to the school.\u000a\u000a\u201cI stressed over and over with the principal that I am all for protecting the rights of [the transgender child], but my children have rights as well,\u201d wrote the mother in her letter. \u201cIt makes me sad that my daughter felt like she was punished for trying to be kind to the kid.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn response, the mother was allegedly \u201ctold that whenever there is a pronoun mishap with this biological boy who now claims to be a girl \u2014 the school must investigate.\u201d\u000a\u000aParents of children at Rocklin Academy also complained this week after a teacher read a book about transgenderism to students without notifying them.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,\u201d claimed one parent.\u000a\u000aThe book was allegedly given to the teacher by the same transgender child at the school, who \u201calso changed clothes and was revealed as her true gender\u201d during class.\u000a\u000aLast year, President Obama introduced a new transgender plan which recommended \u201cparents be secretly excluded from any decisive role when their children experiment with sexual \u2018gender identities\u2019 as male or female,\u201d according to Breitbart News\u2019 Neil Munro.\u000a\u000aMonths later, West Virginia University told its students \u201cthey are breaking federal law if don\u2019t agree to use the pronouns \u2014 including \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she,\u2019 \u2018zir\u2019 or \u2018hir\u2019 etc. \u2014 preferred by each person who claims to be transgender.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWVU says using the wrong pronouns is a crime because the United States departments of justice and of education insist that transgender people are protected by decades-old sexual discrimination law,\u201d explained Dr. Susan Berry. \u201cThe new claim is imposed in a university statement that defines the rights of the relatively few students who are confused about their gender. Because it is a list of \u2018rights,\u2019 it doubles as a list of diversity commandments for all normal students.\u201d

aVOnly six of the 242 House GOP legislators signed an August 22 letter urging President Donald Trump to preserve former President Barack Obama\u2019s DACA amnesty for 800,000 illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aThe letter \u2014 which was touted by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s FWD.US pro-immigration advocacy group \u2014 declared:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWe write to express our support for maintaining the protections of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) for current recipients of the policy. We understand and deeply respect the rule of law, and firmly believe that those who have violated the law must face fair consequences. We also have a responsibility to apply the law in the manner required by the circumstances\u000a\u000aThe unpopularity of the 2012 DACA amnesty was underlined by the fact that only six GOP legislators signed the letter, despite the top-level cheering for the DACA amnesty by Zuckerberg\u2019s group and by other business-funded operations.\u000a\u000aThe six legislators who signed the letter are New York Rep. Daniel Donovan, California Rep. David Valadao, Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, California Rep. Jeff Denham and Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Press aides for the members declined to comment when asked by Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aThe low number of open supporters \u201cdemonstrates that there is a clear consensus within the President\u2019s party that DACA should be terminated,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \u201cThe president should focus honoring the promises and pledges he made to the American public during his campaign,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aTrump has the advantage, Mehlman said, in part because Democrats are under great pressure to preserve the DACA amnesty. \u201cJust the mere rumor that [DACA] repeal is in the works \u2026 sent the Democrats leadership apoplectic,\u201d he said. Trump \u201chas to start holding them publicly accountable\u201d for their unpopular pro-immigration policies, he added.\u000a\u000aThe six-person latter was posted as senior globalist aides on Trump\u2019s staff reportedly try to sideline his priorities, which include building a border wall and signing the RAISE Act immigration reform. Those goals are fiercely opposed by Democrats and by many businesses groups, and they also threaten to sink the managers\u2019 top priority goal \u2014 the passage of a tax cut for businesses and high-income earners.\u000a\u000aSo far, when cheered by his supporters at rallies, Trump continues to demand that Congress fund his border wall, and is effectively promising to veto a budget deal unless Congress funds his budget wall this October.\u000a\u000aImmigration reformers, however, fear that Trump\u2019s top aides would gladly agree to make DACA permanent in return for minor benefits, such as one year\u2019s worth of wall funding.\u000a\u000aThe six-legislator letter was tweeted out by FWD.US, which is also using its website to campaign for the DACA amnesty.\u000a\u000aNEW: GOP Members of Congress send @POTUS letter \u2013\u000a\u000aurge protection for #DACA recipients "until we can find a permanent legislative solution" pic.twitter.com/Ec5s1l3Glk \u2014 FWD.us (@FWD_us) August 23, 2017\u000a\u000aAn August 24 article which said Trump might choose to end DACA also prompted laments from the head of the pro-immigration, business-funded New American Economy advocacy group. The group has issued business-funded reports touting the spending power of legal and illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aThis is awful. Worse would be Congress sitting on its hands while it happens. https://t.co/hFkxo7JChd \u2014 Jeremy Robbins (@JeremyARobbins) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aThis support for illegal immigration by business groups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere also reflects the success of the Democrats\u2019 immigration strategy. In general, Democrats block any increased inflow high-tech immigrants sought by business groups unless those business groups also support the Democratic goal of getting amnesty and citizenship for roughly 11 million low-skilled, government-dependent immigrants.\u000a\u000aAdvocacy groups tied to business are helping the joint push by Democrats and business groups. For example, the six-legislator letter quoted a claim by the business-funded CATO Institute which argued that repatriation of the 750,000 illegals would shrink the government\u2019s revenue by just $6 billion a year. Surprisingly, the study ignored federal spending on the DACA recipients, and also assumed that the DACA recipients are similar to H-1B white-collar visa workers, all of whom have college degrees.\u000a\u000aSurprisingly, the CATO study did not count the high level of taxpayer spending on the DACA recipients, and it also assumed that the DACA recipients are similar to H-1B white-collar visa workers, all of whom have college degrees.\u000a\u000aUnder current immigration policy, the federal government accepts 1 million legal immigrants each year, even though 4 million young Americans enter the workforce to look for decent jobs. Each year, the government also hands out almost 3 million short-term work permits to foreign workers. These permits include roughly 330,000 one-year OPT permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, roughly 200,000 three-year H-1B visas for foreign white-collar professionals, and 400,000 two-year permits to DACA illegals.\u000a\u000aThe current annual flood of foreign labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families.\u000a\u000aMultiple business groups admit that Trump\u2019s popular RAISE Act immigration and economic reform would raise Americans\u2019 salaries.\u000a\u000aMany polls show that Americans are very generous, they do welcome individual immigrants, and they do want to like the idea of immigration. But the polls also show that most Americans are increasingly worried that large-scale legal immigration will change their country and disadvantage themselves and their children. Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d policies are also extremely popular, including among Democratic-leaning voters.

aVFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has endorsed Roy Moore in the Alabama U.S. Senate race over establishment-backed Luther Strange, an endorsement Palin and Moore\u2019s campaign provided to Breitbart News ahead of its public release.\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s endorsement of Moore\u2014the former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court\u2014ahead of the Sept. 26 runoff is a huge momentum booster for the conservative candidate as he extends his commanding lead in the polls over Strange.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cGlad he\u2019s running and am honored to endorse Judge Roy Moore for the US Senate,\u201d Palin said in the endorsement statement. \u201cJudge Moore has shown he has what it takes to stand up to the out-of-touch political establishment. The Judge has proven he\u2019s not afraid of a fight for what is right, and he\u2019s ready to take on DC\u2019s swamp monsters and help make America great again. We need more bold leaders like Judge Moore who will fight for all of us in the US Senate.\u201d\u000a\u000aMoore, in response, thanked Palin for the endorsement and said he was honored to have it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am honored to have the endorsement of Governor Sarah Palin,\u201d Moore said. \u201cGovernor Palin has a strong record of speaking out for conservative causes and standing up to the Washington establishment. Having her support shows how conservatives across the country are uniting behind our campaign to send a message to Mitch McConnell and the Washington elites who are trying to buy this election.\u201d\u000a\u000aMoore, in two separate recent polls, has taken a commanding lead over Strange after the Aug. 15 primary heading into the Sept. 26 runoff. A JMC Analytics survey has Moore at 51 percent and Strange lagging significantly far behind at 32 percent. A Decision Desk HQ poll has Strange down around 32 percent and Moore over 50 percent as well.\u000a\u000aTo mitigate the damage, Strange\u2019s and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s allies at the vehemently anti-Trump Senate Leadership Fund fabricated a new push poll showing Moore up four points over Strange\u2014leading Strange 45 percent to 41 percent.\u000a\u000aThe survey conducted at the McConnell group Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s behest by pollster Jan van Lohuizen was conducted from Aug. 21 to Aug. 23, surveying 601 GOP voters with a margin of error of four points. The fact that they could not even produce a push poll that shows the candidate they support, Strange, in the lead is a stark admission of just how badly Strange\u2019s campaign is doing in Alabama. Strange\u2019s allies leaked the push poll to the Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker, a writer who often sides with the GOP establishment.\u000a\u000aThe Senate Leadership Fund is run by Steven Law, an anti-Trump GOP establishment activist who has worked alongside Karl Rove at American Crossroads. President Trump thinks very lowly of Rove, telling Breitbart News in an April 2016 interview that Rove is a \u201cdishonorable guy.\u201d Trump believes that Rove should not be allowed to write for the Wall Street Journal, as he is so \u201cdishonorable,\u201d and Law\u2019s and Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s deep ties to Rove only hurt Strange more than he is already hurting in the race.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, Strange and his allies are planning\u2014sources close to them tell Breitbart News\u2014a series of smear tactics against Moore in the final weeks. The attacks are likely to revive old and baseless charges against Moore, these sources say\u2013something Moore is ready for, given the fact that the Washington establishment has already dumped more than $10 million into Alabama on behalf of the failing Strange\u2019s campaign. In an interview with Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 this past weekend, Moore said he was ready for the onslaught of false attacks from Strange and his D.C. allies.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think $14 million is exactly the problem they got, but with the results they got they better start wondering when they\u2019re going to stop throwing away their money,\u201d Moore told Breitbart News Sunday. \u201cAttack ads aren\u2019t working in this state. It\u2019s obvious when an opponent attacks both of his opponents with negative ads or even one, but both opponents? They\u2019ve been trying to manipulate this race from the very beginning and they\u2019ve simply failed. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re planning in the future. I expect they\u2019re going to continue to come up and present some negative ads that are false in their nature because they got the money to do it and they know we\u2019re strapped with money. But still, God has given the people vision to see through this.\u201d\u000a\u000aStrange\u2019s decision to align himself against President Trump on the issue of whether to eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the U.S. Senate when it comes to passing legislation further complicates matters. Moore stands firmly with President Trump, against McConnell, in believing that the filibuster rule should be eliminated. Strange actually joined dozens of other establishment senators from both the GOP and Democratic Party in writing a letter to McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer earlier this year opposing the president and pushing for no changes to the rules. Strange\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Shana Teehan has not responded when asked if the senator regrets signing that letter or would like to remove his name from the anti-Trump document.\u000a\u000aMoore, meanwhile, is 100 percent with Trump on changing the Senate rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the people should understand that this is a rule\u2014it\u2019s not a Constitutional rule, it\u2019s a Senate rule,\u201d Moore told Breitbart News Sunday. \u201cThe Founding Fathers described when they preferred super majorities on things like vetoes of presidents, overriding a veto, or expelling a member from one of the two houses of Congress or passing a Constitutional amendment. They have a super majority rule which is simply a rule of anything over a majority which is one over half. It\u2019s not in the Constitution. Quite frankly, it\u2019s unconstitutional. And it\u2019s preventing many bills from going through the Senate. They can\u2019t even get to the floor because of the filibuster rule. A filibuster is different. That\u2019s when you protest bills and speak against them. They can have ways to get that restricted but they can\u2019t put a 60-vote rule and cling to that and say that\u2019s what the Constitution says\u2014it isn\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000aStrange, whose campaign is struggling to gain momentum, has refused to appear on Breitbart News radio on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 to discuss his campaign. It is unclear why he is refusing to talk to conservatives who support the president.\u000a\u000aPalin\u2019s move to endorse Moore comes after she endorsed Danny Tarkanian against Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in Nevada\u2019s GOP primary earlier on Thursday, also in a Breitbart News exclusive.

aVI came away from this year\u2019s Electronic Entertainment Expo excited about a precious few upcoming titles. Foremost among them was Middle-earth: Shadow of War. I described the elegance with which the developers introduced complexity to 2014\u2019s Shadow of Mordor\u2018s alchemy of procedural generation and visceral combat. I said that I would be \u201cshocked if it doesn\u2019t immediately become one of the year\u2019s highlights\u201d upon its release, and I meant it.\u000a\u000aWhen Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment first announced the presence of loot chests in the upcoming Shadow of War, I was flabbergasted. It was a reaction shared by the vast majority of the gaming community at large.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aNot only would micro-transactions invade the single-player experience, they would be directly tied to mechanical advantages that would negate time spent actually playing the game. It is an even more egregious spiritual successor to Ubisoft\u2019s abusive tactics in the Assassins Creed series; locking much of the game\u2019s best equipment, and then badgering you to open your wallet while you play.\u000a\u000aWBIE has doubled down on that practice, and in doing so, they have turned Shadow of War into a glorified slot machine.\u000a\u000aNo, it\u2019s not technically (read: legally) gambling. It\u2019s worse. While it is equally as exploitative of the player, the promise of reward is completely artificial. Furthermore, there are multiple studies that suggest that the early introduction of these concepts can have a real impact on the severity of gambling problems later in life. Children who start gambling early have been found to gamble more and (even) less responsibly.\u000a\u000aRather than search for \u201cwhales\u201d among their consumers, many of today\u2019s biggest names in the gaming industry are raising their own.\u000a\u000aLoot boxes and their ilk have proven a clever disguise for the behavioral conditioning that major game publishers have begun to employ as a matter of course. From mobile games to the biggest AAA titles in the industry like Overwatch, Call of Duty, and League of Legends, the problem continues to spread because our lawmakers simply aren\u2019t paying attention. The closest we have gotten to a real examination of the issue was an impotent and arguably misdirected offensive against Steam\u2019s tradeable item marketplace.\u000a\u000aUntil we call publishers to account for these practices, our children will be continually trained to answer the lure of digital Skinner Boxes. So long as we excuse the practice, it will continue to expand until it eclipses the immersive experience that games once intended to provide.\u000a\u000aBut customers sucked into the world of loot box accelerants aren\u2019t the only ones gambling. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and other publishers are making a terrible wager. They are measuring the value of your time spent on their game, and then bluntly suggesting to their own customers that there is value in avoiding it. It clearly defines the publisher\u2019s opinion of both the game and its creators \u2014 in the most negative possible way.\u000a\u000aSo, while I\u2019m giving advice that absolutely no one will follow, here\u2019s something for free:\u000a\u000aJust stop. Write up another press release. Apologize to your fans for insulting them and to your hard working development team for devaluing the work they have put into making something worth our time.

aVPresident Donald Trump has erased former President Barack Obama\u2019s late-term imposition of the transgender ideology on the U.S. military.\u000a\u000aThe decision likely will boost military effectiveness and also help Americans defend their two-sex, male-and-female society from pro-transgender lawyers and judges.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI am directing the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, to return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016,\u201d Trump said in a Friday afternoon statement.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s restoration of the pre-Obama policies also bars funds from being used for sex-related cosmetic surgery. It directs officials to:\u000a\u000ahalt all use of DoD or DHS resources to fund sex\u2011reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex.\u000a\u000aThe directive complements a recent decision by the Department of Justice reversing Obama\u2019s claim that existing sexual discrimination laws also bar unfair treatment of people who say they have an opposite-sex \u201cgender identity.\u201d This legal shift means that pro-transgender lawyers will be unable to claim in court that the federal government believes that the sex-discrimination laws support the transgender claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their \u201cgender identity\u201d rather than by their male-or-female biology.\u000a\u000aHowever, the short policy statement does not formally say that each soldier\u2019s sex is determined by their biology. That silence may allow holdover Obama officials to quietly maintain Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policy which accepted the transgender political claim soldiers should be allowed to switch their legal sex in military personnel records by declaring they have an opposite-sex \u201cgender identity.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s directive does give Pentagon officials time to clear up the complications caused by the short-lived Obama policy. For example, the policy says:\u000a\u000aAs part of the implementation plan, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military. Until the Secretary has made that determination, no action may be taken against such individuals under the policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum.\u000a\u000aThe policy also includes language to frustrate pro-transgender lawsuits, saying:\u000a\u000aIf any provision of this memorandum, or the application of any provision of this memorandum, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this memorandum and other dissimilar applications of the provision shall not be affected.\u000a\u000aHowever, the policy also allows the Pentagon chief to push for the return of Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policy, saying \u201cthe Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may advise me at any time, in writing, that a change to this policy is warranted.\u201d\u000a\u000aTony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, welcomed the return to the pre-Obama, normal policy:\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Trump is doing what he promised: putting the military\u2019s focus where it belongs \u2013 fighting and winning wars. Political correctness doesn\u2019t win wars \u2014 and the president is ending policies that pretend it does. Monday night the president rightfully praised our service men and women for their \u2018shared mission\u2019 and \u2018shared purpose\u2019 of defending our nation and freedom. President Trump is listening to their concerns about distractions that hinder their mission \u2013 and now he is acting to address them. The guidance released today reflects those conversations, and prioritizes military readiness while also showing respect for those who currently serve and identify as transgender.\u000a\u000aPro-transgender groups and individuals tweeted their opposition to Trump\u2019s reform.\u000a\u000aThere's NO reason for a transgender ban. Military isn't asking for it. Americans don't want it. This is about Trump embrace of hate. Period. https://t.co/OwX3QEgXHV \u2014 VoteVets (@votevets) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aCorrect. https://t.co/AcOXbigpzi \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aTrump directs Pentagon to move forward on transgender ban and bans DOD from providing medical treatment to transgender servicemembers. pic.twitter.com/AQpFqOQe0n \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aAdvocates for transgenderism say each person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their chosen \u201cgender identity,\u201d not their biology. These advocates also argue that the federal and state government must support people who say they are \u201ctransgender\u201d by requiring other people to treat them as members of the opposite sex and to refer to them with opposite-sex pronouns.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, polls show that most Americans want to conserve their two-sex society, in which laws and civic practices are intended to help the two equal sexes manage their different and complementary biology-influenced desires and capabilities.\u000a\u000aThe \u201cgender identity\u201d claims have a growing impact on the operation of different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women\u2019s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.\u000a\u000aPolls show that roughly one-quarter of Americans support the progressive claim that biological sex is less important that chosen \u201cgender identity,\u201d despite intense media pressure in favor of the pro-transgender, anti-sexes campaign.\u000a\u000aThere are very few \u201ctransgender\u201d people. For example, advocates say from 1,320 t0 11,000 people in the military are trying fully or partly to live like members of the other sex, within the military population of 1.3 million full-time soldiers, sailors, marines and air force personnel. Fewer than o.3 percent of Americans wish to live as members of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s formal opposition to the transgender ideology is pushing Democrats to make their unpopular transgender ideology an issue in the 2018 elections. However, Obama has said twice that his 2016 support for the ideology helped contribute to Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in the presidential election.

aVA Californian first grader was sent to the principal\u2019s office this week after allegedly \u201cmisgendering\u201d a transgender student.\u000a\u000aThe incident reportedly took place at California\u2019s Rocklin Academy, in the school playground, where the female student called her biologically male classmate \u201cby his given name \u2013 apparently unaware that the boy now identified as a girl,\u201d according to Fox News.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cThis innocent little first grader sees a classmate, calls him by the name she knew him last year and the boy reports it to a teacher,\u201d claimed Karen England, from the Capitol Resource Institute. \u201cThe little girl gets in trouble on the playground and then gets called out of class to the principal\u2019s office.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring her visit to the principal\u2019s office, the child was reportedly \u201cinvestigated\u201d to determine \u201cwhether or not she had bullied the transgender child by calling him by his original name.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter about an hour it was determined the little girl made an honest mistake and she was not punished or reprimanded. But she was terribly traumatized by the incident,\u201d Fox News claimed.\u000a\u000aAfter the child returned home upset, her mother wrote a letter to the school.\u000a\u000a\u201cI stressed over and over with the principal that I am all for protecting the rights of [the transgender child], but my children have rights as well,\u201d wrote the mother in her letter. \u201cIt makes me sad that my daughter felt like she was punished for trying to be kind to the kid.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn response, the mother was allegedly \u201ctold that whenever there is a pronoun mishap with this biological boy who now claims to be a girl \u2014 the school must investigate.\u201d\u000a\u000aParents of children at Rocklin Academy also complained this week after a teacher read a book about transgenderism to students without notifying them.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,\u201d claimed one parent.\u000a\u000aThe book was allegedly given to the teacher by the same transgender child at the school, who \u201calso changed clothes and was revealed as her true gender\u201d during class.\u000a\u000aLast year, President Obama introduced a new transgender plan which recommended \u201cparents be secretly excluded from any decisive role when their children experiment with sexual \u2018gender identities\u2019 as male or female,\u201d according to Breitbart News\u2019 Neil Munro.\u000a\u000aMonths later, West Virginia University told its students \u201cthey are breaking federal law if don\u2019t agree to use the pronouns \u2014 including \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she,\u2019 \u2018zir\u2019 or \u2018hir\u2019 etc. \u2014 preferred by each person who claims to be transgender.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWVU says using the wrong pronouns is a crime because the United States departments of justice and of education insist that transgender people are protected by decades-old sexual discrimination law,\u201d explained Dr. Susan Berry. \u201cThe new claim is imposed in a university statement that defines the rights of the relatively few students who are confused about their gender. Because it is a list of \u2018rights,\u2019 it doubles as a list of diversity commandments for all normal students.\u201d

aVGary Cohn drafted a letter of resignation in the tumultuous week after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, according to the New York Times.\u000a\u000aCohn, the White House\u2019s chief economic adviser, met with President Donald Trump in his New Jersey home last Friday, \u201cscrapping his plans to spend the evening at his second home in the Hamptons,\u201d the New York Times reported. Financial markets were rife with rumors that Cohn would resign, a story the White House insisted was untrue.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBut Cohn apparently did come close to resigning, going as far as to draft a letter of resignation. He was under pressure from Wall Street associates, friends, and even family members to leave Trump\u2019s White House following the president\u2019s remarks about Charlottesville. Establishment media have inaccurately described those remarks as a defense of white nationalist protesters.\u000a\u000aIt remains unclear precisely what Cohn was threatening to resign over and what he got in exchange for staying with the administration. Trump has said that Cohn is on his short-list of potential nominees for the Federal Reserve.\u000a\u000aOne administration official speculated that Cohn may simply have been given permission to go public with his grievances against the president.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with the Financial Times, Cohn went further than any other administration official in publicly condemning the president\u2019s Charlottesville comments. In the interview, he criticized Trump\u2019s remarks and parroted the misleading line that left-wing Antifa forces in Charlottesville were simply \u201ccitizens standing up for equality and freedom.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohn\u2019s comments were very different from those of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who defended the president in answer to criticism from members of Yale\u2019s class of 1985.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t believe the allegations against the president are accurate,\u201d Mnuchin said.\u000a\u000aThe contrast may be due to the political backgrounds of the two men. Cohn has long been a Democrat and a major fundraiser for Democratic politicians. Mnuchin is a Republican, who was an early President Trump supporter and who served as the national finance chairman for the campaign.\u000a\u000aBoth men stood beside the president in the lobby of Trump Tower when Trump made his controversial remarks. And each apparently came away with very different interpretations of what was said. Mnuchin wound up defending the president while defending his decision to remain in the administration. In stark contrast, Cohn defended his own decision to remain in the administration and condemned the president\u2019s comments.
