aVMexican-born artist Bosco Sodi put on a very public \u201cpolitical performance\u201d Thursday, unveiling a 6 feet high, 26 feet long brick wall art installation in Washington Square Park in New York City.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wanted to create a wall made by Mexicans with Mexican earth,\u201d Sodi told the New York Times of his one-day political installation, which will stand from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday or until passersby dismantle the wall brick-by-brick. \u201cThen the disappearance of the wall will be by the community and all kinds of people who visit the park.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aCalled \u201cMuro,\u201d which translates to \u201cwall\u201d in Spanish, the wall was presented in partnership with the Paul Kasmin Gallery, where the New York-based artist will have a show opening in November. The 1,600 clay timbers used to erect the massive installation were fired in Oaxaca, Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe wall was \u201cbuilt by Mexicans living in New York,\u201d reports theartnewspaper.com, which quoted Sodi as saying he wanted the wall to be received as a \u201cpolitical piece\u201d more than a work of art.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s my first political performance, but I just felt I had to do it now,\u201d Sodi said according to the outlet. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave the wall up too long, because it would look more like a work of art than a political piece.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe idea for the wall, the artist said, came shortly after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump had just been inaugurated and things were tense politically,\u201d Sodi said. \u201cI was talking to the eight or nine craftsmen and they were telling me stories about how they wanted to emigrate to the US, but how that\u2019s impossible right now.\u201d\u000a\u000aDismantling the wall, Sodi said, is \u201cabout breaking down walls physically and mentally.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson

aVProducers of the new, Internet-only Star Trek series say their new Klingon warriors are allegories for racist Trump supporters.\u000a\u000aThe forthcoming, 15-episode order of Star Trek: Discovery, to debut this month exclusively on the Internet-based CBS All Access, will follow a familiar Star Trek practice as the series looks to use its stories to comment on contemporary events.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe story arc of the new Trek series will focus on early relations between the United Federation of Planets and the war-like Klingon Empire. According to producers, that conflagration is an allegory to today\u2019s political climate in the age of Trump, according to Entertainment Weekly.\u000a\u000aShowrunner Aaron Harberts told EW that the election of President Donald Trump highly influenced producers and writers of Discovery.\u000a\u000aThe allegory is that we really started working on the show in earnest around the time the election was happening. The Klingons are going to help us really look at certain sides of ourselves and our country. Isolationism is a big theme. Racial purity is a big theme. The Klingons are not the enemy, but they do have a different view on things. It raises big questions: Should we let people in? Do we want to change? There\u2019s also the question of just because you reach your hand out to someone, do they have to take it? Sometimes, they don\u2019t want to take it. It\u2019s been interesting to see how the times have become more of a mirror than we even thought they were going to be.\u000a\u000aThe producer also noted that its war theme would cause Starfleet to \u201cexamine their ideas and ethical rules of conflict and conduct.\u201d\u000a\u000aHarberts added that the war brewing between the federation and the Klingons \u201cprovides a backdrop to how we want to be as a society and that analysis and self-reflection is new for Trek. They\u2019ve done it in certain episodes in the past, but this is a true journey for the institution in itself.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also admitted that Trump\u2019s confrontation with North Korea also featured in their story.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea is in our thoughts as we finish the series,\u201d Harberts told the magazine. \u201cWhat began as a commentary on our own divided nation \u2014 in terms of Trump supporters and non-Trump supporters \u2014 has blown out to North Korea and how we\u2019re right on the brink.\u201d\u000a\u000aFans seem wary of the new series, at least as far as these new Klingons are concerned. The latest depiction of Klingons differs markedly in physical appearance from the original show as well as the slew of Star Trek spinoffs from the 1990s.\u000a\u000aFans spent decades struggling to explain why Klingons looked more like humans, but just with dark skin and Fu Manchu mustaches in the original, 1960s series but had developed brow ridges and a mane of hair by the time Star Trek: The Next Generation debuted in 1987. Now, the news series depicts Klingons as completely hairless with ridges that seem to run from their forehead all the way down their backs. The newest Klingons look more alien than any before them, yet this series is supposedly set between Captain Kirk\u2019s Star Trek and the Next Generation eras.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

A large group of students gathered in protest this week to rally in the school parking lot with a parade of vehicles sporting American flags. The rally brought students and administrators together to reach a compromise.\u000a\u000aAfter the flag rally, school administrators rescinded the flag ban in part agreeing that the U.S. flag would be permitted but that it will still ban flags that make students feel \u201cthreatened, uncomfortable or unsafe.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe administration issued a Facebook post alerting students to the new rule and insisting, \u201cStudents and school leaders fully agreed that celebration of our nation is desired, but disrespect is not acceptable or desired.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe students want their peers to feel safe and comfortable in school and understand that other flags can be disruptive and harmful or cause emotional responses in others,\u201d the statement added.\u000a\u000aRocori School District Superintendent Scott Staska praised the protest.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you could have a protest, you would want one like what the students did today,\u201d Staska told the media.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston

aVOnce again, gunmen executed with complete impunity a journalist exposing organized crime networks in Mexico.\u000a\u000aThis week, at least two gunmen shot and killed Juan Carlos Hernandez Rios, a journalist with the online Mexican news outlet La Bandera. The 29-year-old was killed as he returned to his house in the Mexican state of Guanajuato.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhile little official information has been released, the website La Bandera had been the target of numerous death threats in connection with its reporting. Hernandez Rios himself previously claimed to be the target of death threats from Mexican municipal police officers and local politicians from Yuriria, Guanajuato.\u000a\u000aBefore the murder, Hernandez published a video where two police officers from Salamanca, Guanajuato, called out colleagues working for organized crime. Days later, the bodies of those two officers were located\u2013tortured and executed. The story that led to Hernandez\u2019s death has since been removed from the website, but the link remains active.\u000a\u000aIn the video, Juan Manuel Vergara, a local cop, is seen claiming that Jose Luis Garcia Cardozo and Juan Duarte Ramirez\u2013two top ranking law enforcement officials\u2013along with several others were working for organized crime.\u000a\u000aHernandez\u2019s murder comes days after gunmen in the Mexican state of Veracruz shot and killed Candido Rios Vasquez outside of a small convenience store, Breitbart Texas reported. Rios worked for years as a crime reporter before receiving threats. He joined a government protection system for journalists shortly before his murder.\u000a\u000aHuman rights activists and journalists previously called out the Mexican government its inaction in addressing the impunity with which reporters are murdered, Breitbart Texas noted. Mexican authorities have not solved any of the 10 cases and are largely ineffective in addressing the multiple threats by cartels.\u000a\u000aLate last month, gunmen shot and killed veteran reporter Luciano Rivera at a bar in the resort town of Rosarito, Baja California. Rivera was a journalist with CNR TV.\u000a\u000aIn June, Mexican authorities confirmed that a charred body found in rural Michoacan was Mexican journalist Salvador Adame, Breitbart Texas reported. The TV reporter was kidnapped a month prior by a team of cartel gunmen.\u000a\u000aIn May, gunmen shot and killed Javier Valdez, a trailblazing journalist who helped start Rio Doce, an independent news outlet exposing government corruption and cartel activity in Sinaloa, Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aIn March, La Linea faction of the Juarez Cartel murdered investigative journalist Miroslava Breach, Breitbart Texas reported. Prior to her death, Breach covered relatives of a leading cartel member trying to take political office in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.\u000a\u000aEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Nuevo León and other areas to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

aVThe NFL opened its 2017 season Thursday night, in much the same way that it played out the 2016 season. The game featured the team that won the final game of the year last season, the game was high-scoring with plenty of offense, the game featured an anthem protest, and the league\u2019s ratings went down.\u000a\u000aThe game between the Chiefs and the Patriots drew a 14.6 overnight rating on NBC. That rating is down nearly two full points from last year\u2019s 16.5 number for the Panthers-Broncos opener, and more than three points down from the Steelers-Patriots opener in 2015.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhy, the steep decline?\u000a\u000aWhile the ratings have clearly trended down for a number of seasons, last night\u2019s game did feature an anthem protest from Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters, and it\u2019s entirely likely that many tuned-out after seeing that:\u000a\u000a#Chiefs CB Marcus Peters sits on trainer's bench during National Anthem. @SportsDailyKC @KCStar pic.twitter.com/5xnDLi4HqD \u2014 David Eulitt (@davidphotokc) September 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThe sports media would gladly point the finger at politics, as the cause of the ratings drop. Though, no debate, or matter of pressing national importance was being discussed in politics on Thursday night. Some have opined that coverage of Hurricane Irma, might be the culprit. Though, it rings hollow that coverage of the storm would cause a 12% decline in ratings from last year.\u000a\u000aInstead, it\u2019s more likely that NFL fans are following through on their warnings of last year. Specifically, the warning where 44% of fans said they would stop watching the NFL if the anthem protests continued. That poll, backed-up by the J.D. Power survey which showed that most fans cited the anthem protests as the main reason for why they stopped watching the league, might have a lot more to do with the ratings drop than Irma.

aVFifteen states with leftist attorneys general sued President Donald Trump in federal court on Wednesday over his decision to end President Barack Obama\u2019s controversial DACA program.\u000a\u000aObama created DACA\u2014the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2014in 2012 by executive fiat, granting indefinite legal status to a category of illegal aliens. Obama later increased to 4.5 million the number of covered illegal aliens when he expanded DACA with the similarly named DAPA.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHalf of the states in the country sued the Obama administration and secured a nationwide legal victory when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA was illegal.\u000a\u000aDACA and DAPA are based on the same concept, just using different criteria to cover a different number of people. It is a difference in degree, not in kind. Legal reasoning that overturns one should also overturn the other.\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News reported in detail, both programs run into three legal problems. First, this policy was made without going through the notice-and-comment process required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Second, even if they had, they would still be inconsistent with Congress\u2019s Immigration and Nationality Act, which trumps any executive order. And third, it violates the Constitution\u2019s Take Care Clause.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, New York is now leading a coalition of 15 states suing President Trump for ending President Obama\u2019s program, filing suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\u000a\u000aNew York alleged in its civil complaint initiating the lawsuit that the president\u2019s decision is \u201cto punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.\u201d Page Six of the complaint adds that coverage under DACA allows an illegal alien to obtain health coverage, but that without it, the foreigners will stay in the United States without health insurance.\u000a\u000aVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring aligned in this lawsuit with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party\u2014an interesting decision as he squares off against Republican Ed Gillespie to be the next governor of Virginia\u2014suing President Trump for affirming that the Constitution designates Congress, not the president, as the branch of government that makes immigration law. Herring argued that it is wrong to transfer 12,000 jobs currently held by DACA illegal aliens to Virginia citizens, and further argues that illegal aliens here under DACA should be able to pursue four-year degrees at Virginia colleges.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit asserts five claims. It claims two Fifth Amendment violations: that the government is violating the amendment\u2019s equal-protection guarantee by discriminating on the basis of race, saying that the decision is anti-Mexican, and also that the decision violates the Due Process Clause because the result \u201cis fundamentally unfair.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe states also claim that it is the Trump administration, rather than the Obama administration, that is violating the APA. First, the suit calls the decision to end DACA arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law. Second, it says that although DACA was created without the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment process, that the current administration must nonetheless go through that lengthy process before it can legally halt an illegal program.\u000a\u000aFinally, the states claim that this decision violates the Regulatory Flexibility Act because it does not examine the potential impact of ending DACA.\u000a\u000aRegardless of the decision in the federal trial court, the losing party can take the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\u000a\u000aThe case is New York v. Trump, No. 1:17-cv-5228 in the Eastern District of New York.\u000a\u000aKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.

aVCap-Haïtien (Haiti) (AFP) \u2013 Hurricane Irma ripped through the Caribbean on Friday, leaving a trail of devastation and killing 17 as it barrelled towards the United States where up to a million people have been told to flee.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aSo far, 1.2 million people have been affected by Irma, the Red Cross said.\u000a\u000aBut that number looks set to rise \u2014 and could reach as high as 26 million, the agency said.\u000a\u000aWith the monster storm expected to reach the American south by the weekend, coastal areas of Florida and Georgia were battening down the hatches and carrying out their biggest evacuation since 2005.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention,\u201d warned US federal emergency chief Brock Long. \u201cIt will be truly devastating.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoaring across the Caribbean, the rare Category Five hurricane laid waste to a series of tiny islands like St Martin, where 60 percent of homes were wrecked, before slamming into the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aBy Friday morning, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) had downgraded Irma to Category Four with maximum wind speeds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 kilometres per hour) while warning it was still extremely dangerous.\u000a\u000aOn many islands, violent winds have ripped roofs and facades off buildings, hurling lumps of concrete, cars and even shipping containers aside.\u000a\u000a\u2013 Death and destruction \u2013\u000a\u000aAt least two people were killed in Puerto Rico, and more than half of its three million residents were without power after rivers broke their banks in the center and north of the island.\u000a\u000aAnother four people were killed on the US Virgin Islands, with the governor\u2019s office saying a number of badly injured people had been airlifted to Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aOne person died in tiny Barbuda which also suffered \u201cabsolute devastation,\u201d with 300 people evacuated to Antigua and up to 30 percent of properties demolished.\u000a\u000aSt Martin, a pristine island resort divided between France and the Netherlands, also suffered the full fury of the storm, as did the French island of St Barthelemy.\u000a\u000aFrance said at least nine people had been killed across its Caribbean territories and seven more were missing. There were 112 people injured, including two seriously, said Interior Minister Gerard Collomb.\u000a\u000aSix out of 10 homes were left uninhabitable, with insurers in Paris estimating their overall costs would likely be \u201cmuch higher\u201d than 200 million euros ($240 million).\u000a\u000aOn the Dutch side of St Martin, one person died, officials said. Dutch King Willem-Alexander will head to the island of Curacao to the south on Sunday for a briefing on the aid operation, and may travel on to St Martin, officials said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s as if a bomb went off. Before everything was so beautiful and green here. Now everything is as grey as a Dutch winter,\u201d retired police officer Klaas Groen told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.\u000a\u000aA state of emergency has been declared in the British Virgin Islands where residents spoke of scenes of \u201ctotal devastation\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur downstairs doors suddenly blew out, which was terrifying,\u201d Emily Killhoury told the BBC from her home in Tortola.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe eventually emerged at about 7:00 pm to see total devastation.\u201d\u000a\u000aBritain\u2019s defence ministry said it was sending two military transport planes to the region carrying personnel, supplies and recovery equipment.\u000a\u000a\u2013 \u2018Looting\u2019 \u2013\u000a\u000aAs European nations quickly mobilized to help their citizens in the Caribbean, French and Dutch ministers said they were sending hundreds of extra police to St Martin tackle a spate of \u201clooting\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe storm has caused major shortages of food, water and petrol.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe situation is serious,\u201d Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Friday when asked about reports of looting on the island.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to Algemeen Dagblad, one witness reported seeing \u201cpeople with guns and machetes\u201d in the street.\u000a\u000aFrench Overseas Territories Minister Annick Girardin said 400 police officers would be deployed after seeing \u201cpillaging right in front of us\u201d in St Martin where most of the 80,000 inhabitants have lost their homes.\u000a\u000aIn the Dominican Republic, torrential rain and powerful winds whipped the northern and eastern coasts, leaving 17 districts cut off.\u000a\u000aNearly 20,000 people were evacuated and more than 100 houses destroyed.\u000a\u000aAnd in Cuba, some 10,000 foreign tourists were evacuated from beach resorts as authorities hiked the disaster alert level to maximum.\u000a\u000a\u2013 \u2018Walking the plank\u2019 \u2013\u000a\u000aAs of early Friday, the eye of the storm was just north of Great Inagua, at the southern tip of the Bahamas.\u000a\u000aThe worst of the storm is expected to hit Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula on Sunday, the NHC said, with forecasters warning of storm surges of up to 25 feet (almost eight meters) above normal tide levels.\u000a\u000aAfter going for a walk along the beach in Miami, theology professor James Nickolos, 69, spoke of a sense of impending doom.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had the feeling of watching a great beauty walking on a gang-plank to their death,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTrump said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the situation but insisted Florida was \u201cwell prepared\u201d for the storm.\u000a\u000aAs Irma cut through the Caribbean, two other storms in the region were upgraded to hurricane status: Jose in the Atlantic Ocean and Katia in the Gulf of Mexico.\u000a\u000aKatia is expected to hit the coast of the Mexico on Friday, while Jose \u2014 a Category Three storm \u2014 is following Irma\u2019s path, the NHC said.\u000a\u000aStill reeling from Irma, many islanders were bracing for the next storm, with Jose bearing down hard.\u000a\u000a\u201cI hear we could take another direct hit,\u201d Carlos Suarez Menendez told Dutch television RTL from Philipsburg on St Martin.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat will be terrible.\u201d\u000a\u000aburs-hmw/kjl

aVFrom a former president of the United States to a billionaire in Silicon Valley, media figures are unanimous on the use of one word in all of their varying statements and social media posts on President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to end the controversial amnesty for illegal aliens who were brought to the country illegally as children is \u201ccruel.\u201d\u000a\u000aThose include President Barack Obama, who through executive order in 2012 put the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in place, which gave temporary legal status and work permits to as many as 850,000 young illegal aliens.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u2022 Obama posted on his Facebook page:\u000a\u000a\u201cTo target these young people is wrong \u2013 because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating \u2013 because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2022 Because one president slamming another president is not enough, former President Bill Clinton took the cue on what word to include in his lengthy statement:\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of all, it\u2019s wrong because it\u2019s cruel to send these young people to places many of them have never lived and do not know,\u201d Clinton said.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Seth Meyers on his television program said:\u000a\u000a\u201cAs his summer of near constant chaos ends, President Trump faces a series of challenges more difficult than any he has dealt with up to this point,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cSo how has he responded? By threatening to deport hundreds of thousands of law-abiding Americans.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Trump\u2019s \u201ccruel and capricious policy\u201d on the dreamers is \u201csupported neither by a majority of voters nor leaders of his own party,\u201d Meyers said.\u000a\u000a\u2022 \u201cConservative\u201d Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin entitled her commentary:\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump didn\u2019t have the nerve to make cruel DACA announcement himself\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2022 NBC\u2019s Paul Reyes had a similar headline in his commentary:\u000a\u000a\u201cDACA Decision is Cowardly, Cruel and Bad Economic Policy\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2022 Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also found the right word to use, calling a \u201ccruel betrayal\u201d to the illegal aliens that have been \u2014 and still are \u2014 protected from deportation.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Even the man at the helm of the happiest place on earth weighed in with the \u201cc\u201d word, Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Dreamers impacted by this cruel and misguided decision make significant contributions to our economy and our country, and I urge Congress to take immediate bipartisan action to pass legislation that will protect these innocent people.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2022 One of the richest men in the world used his own Facebook platform to share his \u201ccruel\u201d wording. Mark Zuckerberg said:\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a sad day for our country. The decision to end DACA is not just wrong.

aVThe City College of New York recently announced a $1.2 million grant that will be exclusively allocated to female minority students looking to pursue \u201cidentity-driven\u201d activism research.\u000a\u000aA new program entitled \u201cBeyond Identity: A Gendered Platform for Activist Scholars\u201d was announced by CCNY in August. The program, which will operate on a $1.2 million grant, will offer an opportunity exclusively for minority women to explore social justice activism research.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to the press release, the program is largely centered on social justice themes, such as \u201cidentity-driven research,\u201d lessons on \u201cgender and violence\u201d from activist-scholars.\u000a\u000aThe program combines elements of teaching (learning identity-driven research from activist-scholars studying immigration, social movements, protest, gender and violence); writing (nonfiction narrative writing and political writing from well-established writers from around the world); activism (movement-building workshops from community organizers); and public engagement through student-driven public events, the submission of student\u2019s writing for publication, and the presentation of research findings to relevant policy audiences.\u000a\u000aThe program will be led by Visiting Professor Nimmi Gowrinathan, who describes the program as an opportunity for under-represented females to \u201carticulate lived experiences\u201d through expressive writing assignments.\u000a\u000a\u201cA central component of the program is the ability to articulate lived experiences, and disseminate findings and opinions,\u201d said Gowrinathan. \u201cSustained, intensive writing courses will push each student to craft nonfiction narratives, as compelling forms of political communication. Without the personal in the political, the stories of these young women remain footnotes in the often exploitative narratives that capture their lives.\u201d\u000a\u000aAna Puente Flores, a CCNY student who works for the new initiative, told Campus Reform in an interview that the program \u201cdoes not discriminate on gender or race,\u201d despite that those invited to participate in research and access grant funds will be minority female students.

aVPresident Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law set up a secret back channel to help a top Democratic Senator lobby White House officials in favor of the \u201cDACA\u201d amnesty for 800,000 young illegals.\u000a\u000aSen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democratic Senator, spilled the beans in an interview with Reuters, where he described how he worked with Jared Kushner and liberal Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham to promote the DACA amnesty in April and July.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to Reuters\u2019s account, which describes the illegals as \u201cDreamers\u201d:\u000a\u000a\u201cWe initially had a conversation (with Kushner), at [Iowa Republican] Senator (Chuck) Grassley\u2019s invitation, on criminal justice and I asked Mr. Kushner afterwards if we could talk about immigration, separate and apart from Senator Grassley, which we did,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI went into \u2026 DACA because I was concerned about how this was going to unfold,\u201d the Illinois lawmaker conversations underscore a level of interest in the issue among senior White House aides that could lend momentum to the congressional debate on approving a permanent legislative fix for the Dreamers that Durbin has sought for the past 16 years\u000a\u000aKushner also arranged phone calls between Durbin and then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who now serves as Trump\u2019s chief of staff.\u000a\u000aFor 16 years, Durbin has been the principal Democratic advocate pushing for an amnesty for the younger illegals who were brought into the country as children by their illegal immigrant parents. Roughly 800,000 young illegals got work-permits from former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 DACA amnesty, and roughly 1.2 million additional illegals were either too young or too ill-educated to qualify for Obama\u2019s amnesty.\u000a\u000aDurbin did not talk to Trump during the process. He told Reuters\u2019 that Trump\u2019s decision to end the 2012 amnesty created by Obama was a disappointment which has been but partly offset by Trump\u2019s subsequent tweets \u201cthat were more encouraging and they continue even until this morning.\u201d\u000a\u000aDurbin also reported that Trump\u2019s policy aide, Steven Miller, maintained the same pro-American immigration priorities that he has championed since at least 2013 when he was worked as a top aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. \u201cThere was nothing in my conversation with him that suggested\u201d had walked away from his policies, Durbin told Reuters.\u000a\u000aHowever, the joint effort by Kushner and Durbin may be working. On September 6, Trump suggested he would sign the Democrats\u2019 amnesty legislation in exchange for some improvements on \u201cborder security.\u201d The White House transcript said:\u000a\u000aQ And what would you like to see, Mr. President, in legislation? THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019d like to see something where we have good border security, and we have a great DACA transaction where everybody is happy and now they don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore because, obviously, as you know, before, it was not a legal deal. It was a deal that wouldn\u2019t have held up and didn\u2019t hold up. And even President Obama when he did it, when he signed it, he said this is obviously not something that\u2019s \u2014 he called it short-term. I\u2019d like to see a permanent deal, and I think it\u2019s going to happen. I think we\u2019re going to have great support from both sides of Congress, and I really believe that Congress is going to work very hard on the DACA agreement and come up with something.\u000a\u000aThat amnesty-for-border-security deal is a long way short of Trump\u2019s campaign promise of an effective border wall and is also very far short of his advocacy for the popular Raise Act merit immigration reform. The Raise Act would reform the nation\u2019s immigration laws to help raise wages and opportunities for the 320 million Americans who dream of better lives for themselves and their children.\u000a\u000aThe current immigration system, said Trump:\u000a\u000ahas placed substantial pressure on American workers, taxpayers and community resources, and among those hit the hardest \u2026 are minority workers competing for jobs against brand new arrivals. It has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers \u2026 [this RAISE act] will give Americans a pay raise by reducing immigration\u2026 [and] it will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens.\u000a\u000aRead about the RAISE Act here.

Hawaii, on the other hand, has the lowest rate of residents going hungry, with only 8.7 percent of households reporting food insecurity.\u000a\u000aThe USDA report says much of the drop is attributed to a decreasing unemployment rate and less inflation of food prices, meaning people can afford to buy more food.\u000a\u000a\u201cFood insecurity increased substantially with the recession,\u201d Alisha Coleman-Jensen, the report\u2019s lead author, told Bloomberg. \u201cAlong with falling unemployment, low levels of food inflation have also eased hunger in the U.S., she said. \u2018We\u2019re continuing the downward trend.'\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. unemployment hit 4.4 percent in August, a 0.5 percent decrease from 2016.

aVAn open borders organization funded by globalist billionaire George Soros is demanding that House and Senate Democrats attach amnesty for illegal aliens to \u201cevery single\u201d piece of legislation moving over the next six months.\u000a\u000aAfter President Trump\u2019s administration announced it would be ultimately ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program giving temporary amnesty to nearly 800,000 illegal aliens, Trump sat down with House and Senate Democrats to strike a deal on an unrelated issue, leaving the open borders lobby fuming.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn a news release by the Soros-funded United We Dream organization, Advocacy Director Greisa Martinez, along with Kamal Essaheb of the National Immigration Law Center and Angel Padilla with the Indivisible Project, demanded Democrats force a vote on the DREAM Act, which would give amnesty to all illegal aliens covered by DACA.\u000a\u000aThe open borders activists said:\u000a\u000aTime and time again, Democratic leaders tell immigrants that relief from deportation would come someday down the road \u2014 and that someday never comes. We are tired of waiting. That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on Democrats to attach the Dream Act \u2013 without dangerous enforcement add-ons \u2013 to every single must-pass bill, without delay. Immigrants and progressive activists are doing our part to protect immigrant young people \u2013 it is time that you do yours.\u000a\u000aUnited We Dream also laid into Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for meeting with Trump and striking a deal with him that did not include amnesty for DACA recipients.\u000a\u000aToday, Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi celebrated a political win: they got Trump to side with them instead of Republicans on must-pass September bills,\u201d the open borders activists said. \u201cTheir deal with Trump just one day after he killed the DACA program is not consistent with the commitment they made to immigrant youth to do everything they could to protect them. When the lives of 800,000 immigrant youth are on the line, it is no time for political games. Following Trump\u2019s decision to eliminate the DACA program, Democrats had a rare opportunity to force congressional action on the Dream Act to protect immigrant youth. They had the leverage of a packed September agenda, full of must-pass bills and momentum of an activated grassroots base that is doing their part to fight for immigrants targeted by Trump. The world\u2019s attention is focused on DACA and public sympathy for the many young immigrants whose worst fears had been realized is at an all time high. And yet Democratic leaders Schumer and Pelosi instead chose to make a deal with Trump, with a vague promise of action on the Dream Act down the road.\u000a\u000aUnited We Dream is funded by a slew of social justice and open borders organizations, including Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation, which grants money to a number of pro-migration groups, like the Center for Popular Democracy.\u000a\u000aIn July, the Soros-funded organization began lobbying members of the Republican establishment to put forward legislation that would grant amnesty and potentially a pathway to citizenship for the 800,000 illegal aliens currently protected by DACA, as Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aMore than a week after beginning their lobbying efforts, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) announced they would be resurrecting the infamously failed DREAM Act that does exactly what the Soros-funded group had been demanding, as Breitbart Texas reported.

aVFor years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter.\u000a\u000aNow, however, facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire\u2019s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire\u2019s four electoral college votes in the presidential election.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aNew Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he\u2019s a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote.\u000a\u000aNew Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire\u2019s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes.\u000a\u000aNow there\u2019s proof.\u000a\u000aAccording to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver\u2019s license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesn\u2019t prove that any fraud occurred \u2013 theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license.\u000a\u000aSo if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driver\u2019s license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017 \u2013 nearly ten months after the election \u2013 only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire.\u000a\u000aSo 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver\u2019s licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State.\u000a\u000a5,513 is a big number \u2013 more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. That\u2019s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also possible that New Hampshire\u2019s four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well.\u000a\u000aIf the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result.\u000a\u000aAnd that is already having consequences for the nation. If the 52-48 Republican-Democrat balance in the Senate were 53-47, it could change the balance in any number of votes \u2013 not the least of which would be the effort to repeal Obamacare.\u000a\u000aBut the mainstream media will tell us, \u201cMove along, there\u2019s nothing to see here.\u201d\u000a\u000aKris W.

aVFifteen states with leftist attorneys general sued President Donald Trump in federal court on Wednesday over his decision to end President Barack Obama\u2019s controversial DACA program.\u000a\u000aObama created DACA\u2014the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2014in 2012 by executive fiat, granting indefinite legal status to a category of illegal aliens. Obama later increased to 4.5 million the number of covered illegal aliens when he expanded DACA with the similarly named DAPA.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHalf of the states in the country sued the Obama administration and secured a nationwide legal victory when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA was illegal.\u000a\u000aDACA and DAPA are based on the same concept, just using different criteria to cover a different number of people. It is a difference in degree, not in kind. Legal reasoning that overturns one should also overturn the other.\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News reported in detail, both programs run into three legal problems. First, this policy was made without going through the notice-and-comment process required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Second, even if they had, they would still be inconsistent with Congress\u2019s Immigration and Nationality Act, which trumps any executive order. And third, it violates the Constitution\u2019s Take Care Clause.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, New York is now leading a coalition of 15 states suing President Trump for ending President Obama\u2019s program, filing suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\u000a\u000aNew York alleged in its civil complaint initiating the lawsuit that the president\u2019s decision is \u201cto punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.\u201d Page Six of the complaint adds that coverage under DACA allows an illegal alien to obtain health coverage, but that without it, the foreigners will stay in the United States without health insurance.\u000a\u000aVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring aligned in this lawsuit with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party\u2014an interesting decision as he squares off against Republican Ed Gillespie to be the next governor of Virginia\u2014suing President Trump for affirming that the Constitution designates Congress, not the president, as the branch of government that makes immigration law. Herring argued that it is wrong to transfer 12,000 jobs currently held by DACA illegal aliens to Virginia citizens, and further argues that illegal aliens here under DACA should be able to pursue four-year degrees at Virginia colleges.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit asserts five claims. It claims two Fifth Amendment violations: that the government is violating the amendment\u2019s equal-protection guarantee by discriminating on the basis of race, saying that the decision is anti-Mexican, and also that the decision violates the Due Process Clause because the result \u201cis fundamentally unfair.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe states also claim that it is the Trump administration, rather than the Obama administration, that is violating the APA. First, the suit calls the decision to end DACA arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law. Second, it says that although DACA was created without the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment process, that the current administration must nonetheless go through that lengthy process before it can legally halt an illegal program.\u000a\u000aFinally, the states claim that this decision violates the Regulatory Flexibility Act because it does not examine the potential impact of ending DACA.\u000a\u000aRegardless of the decision in the federal trial court, the losing party can take the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\u000a\u000aThe case is New York v.

In so doing, they failed to highlight the myriad real-life stories of women using guns for self-defense.\u000a\u000aHere are just a few recent stories:\u000a\u000aOn June 28, Breitbart News reported that a wheelchair-bound female homeowner in West Cleveland pulled a gun and told two alleged home invasion suspects she would use it if they continued trying to make entry. The woman \u2014 an apparent amputee \u2014 told Fox 8 that she \u201clooked at the door and there was a man, right there, right outside looking like he was going for my door.\u201d She said a second man was \u201ccutting the screen on a window of her garage.\u201d Both suspects fled when she showed her gun.\u000a\u000aOn July 18, Breitbart News reported that a 17-year-old girl in Spokane, Washington, armed herself with one of her father\u2019s guns then literally chased an alleged home intrusion suspect out of the family\u2019s home. The girl \u2014 Kimber Wood \u2014 heard the suspect enter the house and said his \u201ceyes got really wide\u201d when he found himself staring down the barrel of her gun.\u000a\u000aOn August 1, Breitbart News also reported that a grandmother who was home alone opened fire on two alleged home invasion suspects, killing one. The incident occurred in Katy, Texas, where the suspects allegedly entered via the garage. According to ABC 13, Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Thomas Gilliland said, \u201cBoth [suspects] were armed with pistols. She confronted both suspects, retrieved a handgun and fired several times at both subjects.\u201d One died at the scene while the second jumped a fence and fled.\u000a\u000aOn August 3, Breitbart News reported that a young mother opened fire to protect her three children during an alleged home invasion. The incident occurred just after 2 a.m. in Marietta, Georgia. The home invasion suspect was dead when police arrived.\u000a\u000aOn August 4, Breitbart News reported that a female driver stopped an alleged road rage attack with one shot. Glendala, Arizona, police indicated that the armed woman and her passenger were attacked by the driver of another car. The armed woman repeatedly warned the attacker that she was armed but to no avail. Finally, as the attack the continued, the armed woman fired one shot, striking the suspect in the abdomen and ending the alleged assault.\u000a\u000aSome of the women in those examples were Millennials, some were not. But the larger point is that examples of women using guns to save their own lives and the lives of others are legion. Millennials seem to know this; they seem to know that having a gun when under attack is better than having a shoe or a whistle.\u000a\u000aShea Drake said people think \u201cwomen are clueless about guns.\u201d She said, \u201cGuys always seem surprised that I don\u2019t need help loading my guns. People assume my husband got me into guns, when it\u2019s actually the other way around.\u201d\u000a\u000aAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

aVTexas Rep. Mike McCaul is reportedly a candidate to take over the Department of Homeland Security, despite his pro-business record and his long-standing support of delegating anti-terror tasks to Islamic political groups.\u000a\u000aThe report comes from Politico:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTexas Rep. Mike McCaul has emerged as a leading candidate in the White House\u2019s search for a homeland security secretary, according to three people familiar with the conversations.\u000a\u000aThe report provides no information about whether McCaul is a serious candidate, of if the \u201cthree people\u201d are merely McCaul\u2019s aides. This is McCaul\u2019s second run for the job, which he lost to retired Marine Corp General John Kelly in December 2016. But Politico reported that McCaul really wants the job:\u000a\u000aMcCaul worked with the White House on its response to Hurricane Harvey, which affected parts of his district, and greeted the president on the tarmac when he touched down in Texas last weekend. McCaul, who was considered for the same post during the transition, is eager to serve in the administration, according to people familiar with his thinking.\u000a\u000aMcCaul is the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, and his record of support for business interests, and his opposition to border defenses has prompted pro-American immigration reformers to dub him \u201cNo-wall McCaul.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCaul emerges as a leading candidate for DHS secretary https://t.co/u7doOyABAG #NeverMcCaul \u2014 Mark Krikorian (@MarkSKrikorian) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000aWhy not Rubio? Or go whole hog with Luis Gutiérrez! https://t.co/882oPhgwJC \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) September 8, 2017\u000a\u000aMcCaul has been supported by the GOP-affiliated business sector which benefits from the mass-inflow of foreign workers and consumers who force down Americans\u2019 wages. That inflow was scorched by President Donald Trump during his campaign. In a September 2016 economics speech, Trump declared that \u201cevery policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?\u201d\u000a\u000aOnce Trump was elected, McCaul edited his speeches to include a few references to Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire\u201d American policies.\u000a\u000aIn February 2014, McCaul even endorsed a doomed proposal by then-House Speaker John Boehner which would have amnestied 11 million illegals. The proposal tried to hide the very unpopular amnesty under a barrage of poll-tested nouns and adjectives, saying:\u000a\u000aThese persons could live legally and without fear in the U.S., but only if they were willing to admit their culpability, pass rigorous background checks, pay significant fines and back taxes, develop proficiency in English and American civics, and be able to support themselves and their families (without access to public benefits).\u000a\u000aMcCaul also has shown very little interest in Trump\u2019s top border priority \u2014 fulfilling his promise to build a wall along the southern border. In fact, McCaul pushed a 2015 border security bill, grandly titled \u201cSecure Our Border First Act of 2015\u201d which approved the construction of 27 extra miles of double-fencing along the 2,000-mile border. The bill also called for the removal and upgrade of 66 miles of older fencing instead of just adding 66 miles of new fencing further along the border.\u000a\u000aThat bill was so weak that it was publicly denounced by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee.\u000a\u000aThanks to house of Rep not moving ahead w BorderSecurity bill. It wld not secure border. Now House has time to marry that w Judiciary bill \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 27, 2015\u000a\u000aA 2013 border bill drafted by McCaul was so lax that it was embraced by Democrats. The do-nothing bill, according to a credulous article in the Washington Post:\u000a\u000adoesn\u2019t set an exact price or timeline or mandate a certain number of hires. Instead, it instructs the Department of Homeland Security to write a plan that could ensure the apprehension of 90 percent of illegal border-crossers in high-traffic areas within 33 months and across the entire southern border within five years. The measure directs the department to find ways to deploy existing U.S. military radar, cameras and unmanned aerial drones used recently in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress would need to review and approve the plan before appropriating any money. Detailed decisions about equipment, manpower and suggested costs would be left to career Homeland Security officials, who would consult with border-state governors and government experts who track security and immigration flows. The independent, nonpartisan Government Accountability Office would be required to assess the proposed strategy and report back to Congress on its implementation.\u000a\u000aMcCaul\u2019s lack of attention to the interests of American employees was made clear in McCaul\u2019s 2015 State of Homeland Security Address. His speech was overwhelmingly focused on the threat of \u201cterror\u201d \u2014 which was mentioned 54 times in the 2015 speech \u2014 but his text did not include any mention of the words that won the election for Trump \u2014 \u201cwall,\u201d \u201cfence,\u201d \u201cworker,\u201d \u201cemployee,\u201d \u201cjob,\u201d \u201cwage,\u201d or \u201csalary.\u201d The speech did not even use the words \u201cimmigration,\u201d \u201cillegal,\u201d or \u201calien.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn November 2012, McCaul called for a law to help companies import more foreign workers instead of hiring American workers. \u201cI think we can have immigration reform,\u201d McCaul told the Texas Tribune. \u201cSome policies we\u2019ve advocated with, for instance, is doing away with the lottery and increasing the cap on high-skilled worker visas.\u201d Currently, the U.S. government offers temporary work-permits to more than 2 million foreigners each year, sharply reducing pressure on Americans companies to recruit, train and pay the four million younger Americans who enter the job market each year.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, McCaul said white-collar outsourcing is needed because \u201cthe fact is that there\u2019s not an interest\u201d among Americans in high-tech training.\u000a\u000aMcCaul defended record at a press event in November. \u201cTo say somehow I am not strong on immigration is laughable because, whether it is sanctuary cities to every vote on the floor of the House, I have strongly voted against illegal immigration,\u201d he said, according to the Washington Times. \u201cI have co-sponsored virtually every bill. I introduced the SAFE Act, which would stop the flow of Syrian refugees into this country. I also strongly support the Secure Fence Act,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMcCaul\u2019s record on Islamic infiltration also clashes with Trump\u2019s plans to protect the nation from immigrants whose \u201chostile attitudes\u201d should prevent them from integrating into Americans\u2019 society.\u000a\u000aMcCaul\u2019s policy has been so focused on external threats that McCaul found himself in 2013 shaking hands with a U.S.-based Islamic political advocate who had declared Muslims were above the law of the land. The activist\u2019s name is Mustafaa Carroll, and he was a member of a national Islamic group. The Texas Tribune reported:\u000a\u000a\u201cFollowing the law of the land is part of Sharia,\u201d Carroll said, according to the video. \u201cAnd we follow the law of the land. In fact, Muslims, if we\u2019re practicing Muslims, we are above the law of the land. The law doesn\u2019t affect us at all.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCaul signed the photograph with a statement saying \u201cthe moderate Muslim is our most effective weapon.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite that experience, McCaul still supported the \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d policy set by the former President Barack Obama. That policy failed because it did what it sought to do \u2014 delegate some counter-intelligence roles to explicitly Islamic political groups instead of to government officials, police officers, and Americans.\u000a\u000aIn March 2016, McCaul overtly endorsed Obama\u2019s tacit alliance with U.S-based Islamic religious groups, many of which share overlapping umbrella networks that are exempt from normal FBI anti-terror monitoring. \u201cThe effective thing is \u2026 effective outreach to the Muslim community, so you can pull the religious leaders really on to our team, if you will, to protect us from radicalization from within those communities,\u201d he said March 27. \u201cI think we can get good intelligence from the Muslim communities in our outreach efforts, in our working with the religious leaders in the communities in the United States,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, candidate Trump has called for more oversight over the Islamic networks. \u201cWe have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we don\u2019t solve it, it\u2019s going to eat our country alive,\u201d he said during his June 15 campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s first pick to run the DHS, Gen. John Kelly, implemented Trump\u2019s skeptical policy. In July, Kelly excluded Islamic political groups from some DHS programs.\u000a\u000aObama\u2019s McCaul-backed CVE plan failed, in large part, because Islamic political activists did not want to do what they were asked, and instead kept raising their demands in negotiations with Obama\u2019s deputies. For example, some Islamic advocates demanded the FBI stay out of Muslim neighborhoods. Many activists also refused to admit the role of Islamic texts in motivating Islamic believers to launch Islamic jihad attacks, despite the repeated use of Islamic texts by U.S-based Islamic clerics to urge Islamic attacks.\u000a\u000aIn December, Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA, an immigration reform group, said:\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s our whole problem. Mike McCaul is completely focused on terrorism, which is a tiny but important slice of the immigration problem, and a tiny slice of what Trump campaigned on. But the idea that you could just drop someone into the most important immigration slot in our government and expect them to push Trump\u2019s agenda is just fantasy.\u000a\u000aIn November 2016, as McCaul was trying to land the DHS job, he was publicly backed Johnson. \u201cOn his behalf, I don\u2019t know anybody who is stronger on border security in Congress that I have dealt with,\u201d Johnson told an audience at the business-funded Bipartisan Policy Center.\u000a\u000aThat praise \u201cshould be the kiss of death in the Trump administration,\u201d Jessica Vaughan, the policy director at the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. It \u201csignals that in Johnson\u2019s estimation, McCaul is not likely to carry out the [pro-American] policies Trump won on.\u201d

Murray, a Harvard alumnus, tweeted on Tuesday that he would not be able to walk across Harvard Yard without a police escort, due to the rising tensions on campus over his appearance.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThis is sad: I will be unable to walk across Harvard Yard tomorrow, on paths I have walked thousands of times. Need a police escort. \u2014 Charles Murray (@charlesmurray) September 6, 2017\u000a\u000aThe students argued that Murry\u2019s invitation equated to dehumanizing marginalized people and suggested that Murray is a part of an ideological tradition that made the tragedy of Charlottesville possible.\u000a\u000aFor the Open Campus Initiative to invite Murray to campus and give him an unchecked platform from which he can participate in and legitimize a tradition of dehumanization of marginalized people \u2014 the same tradition that is responsible for the tragedy of Charlottesville (and America\u2019s entire history of racial trauma) \u2014 is fundamentally at odds with who we should be as a College. We believe that this event is misguided, and urge Open Campus Initiative to cancel it.\u000a\u000aThe students baselessly accuse Murray of embracing white nationalism, citing a designation made by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that has come under fire for labeling Islamic reformists such as Maajid Nawaz and Aayan Hirsi Ali as \u201canti-Muslim extremists.\u201d\u000a\u000aMurray\u2019s ideology is white nationalism and has always been white nationalism. He has never rejected the claims he makes in \u201cThe Bell Curve.\u201d Open Campus Initiative invited a white nationalist to campus, and they cannot control what he choose to bring up in his talk. To assume that race, gender, and class will not ground everything that is discussed during this event is to forget who Charles Murray is. His entire ideology is tainted by white nationalism.\u000a\u000aThe students suggest that Murray\u2019s lecture \u201cfundamentally threatens their lives and freedoms\u201d due to the beliefs he holds. \u201cHow can we begin to foster a sense of belonging and inclusion for these groups on this campus while inviting people who call into question their intelligence, worth, and humanity?\u201d they add.

aVViktor Orbán, Hungary\u2019s redoubtable Prime Minister, has made it clear that Hungary has no intention of caving into pressures from the European Union (EU) to become an \u201cimmigrant country,\u201d in a new letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.\u000a\u000aIn his September 6 letter, Orbán tells Mr. Juncker that unlike other European nations, \u201cHungary is not an immigrant country, does not want to become an immigrant country and cannot accept being forced to change this.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhereas other European nations have become immigrant countries due to obligations stemming from their colonial legacy, Hungary \u201chas no colonial past\u201d and thus feels no such obligation toward nations it has tried to dominate, he said.\u000a\u000aFrance, for example, held territories in enormous geographical areas throughout Africa comprising over a dozen countries. Some of their local currencies are still directly linked to the French Central Bank.\u000a\u000aIn his letter, Orbán takes issue with Juncker\u2019s definition of solidarity, saying that the transformation of Hungary into an immigrant country against the will of Hungarian citizens, \u201cis not solidarity\u201d but \u201cviolence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prime minister also expressed his consternation with the European Commission\u2019s unwillingness to aid Hungary in defending Europe\u2019s borders.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was stunned and puzzled to read that you and the European Commission refuse to provide funds for the fence,\u201d Orbán writes. \u201cI am convinced that those who do not support the fence cannot and do not want to protect the citizens of the European Union.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Orbán went on to question the effectiveness of current immigration strategies of the EU, suggesting that present policies seem aimed at encouraging mass migration rather than reducing it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf instead of defending our borders, the European Commission is willing to finance solely measures and organisations that aim to facilitate the admission of migrants, then we will only give incentives to hundreds of thousands of migrants who wish to move to Europe, instead of curbing migration,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aEarlier this summer, the prime minister asserted that the EU has adopted migration plans drafted by left-wing billionaire George Soros to bring in a million migrants per year, which militates against Europe\u2019s best interests. Soros has proposed the creation of an EU immigration authority to remove the responsibility for immigration from individual EU Member States, he said.\u000a\u000aNot long afterward, Italian media exposed a Soros-sponsored \u201cImmigration Network\u201d in Italy by tracing the provenance of pro-immigration funding back to dozens of organizations financed by Soros\u2019 Open Society. Journalist Luca Donadel uncovered direct ties to Soros money in a web of 41 different groups linked to immigration.\u000a\u000aAccording to Orbán, many European leaders agree with Hungary\u2019s policy on migration but are afraid to say so publicly.\u000a\u000aHe also said that due to the recent surge of migration into Italy, the southern European nation may soon join Hungary and others in looking to secure their national borders.\u000a\u000aFollow Thomas D.

But being a nuclear power is not about using those terrible weapons to threaten others,\u201d Haley said.\u000a\u000a\u201cNuclear powers understand their responsibility.

An overwhelming 47 percent claimed that they don\u2019t believe a four-year degree will increase job and earnings prospects.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe findings reflect an increase in public skepticism of higher education from just four years ago and highlight a growing divide in opinion falling along gender, educational, regional and partisan lines. They also carry political implications for universities, already under public pressure to rein in their costs and adjust curricula after decades of sharp tuition increases.\u000a\u000aAmericans are increasingly concerned about the rising costs of an education.

The Republican Party told its conservative, pro-life base that \u2013 once a Republican was in the White House \u2013 that Planned Parenthood would finally be defunded.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump promised his pro-life constituents he would defund Planned Parenthood if the organization continued to perform abortions, and reallocate its funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care for women and families.\u000a\u000aThe organization \u2013 founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger \u2013 has faced possible elimination of its taxpayer funds following years of scandals, including Medicaid fraud, allegations of child sex abuse cover-up, and, most recently, alleged profiteering from the sale of body parts of babies aborted in its clinics.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the face of the horrors of Planned Parenthood\u2019s activities, Sen.

Murray said in her statement about the bill:\u000a\u000aThis is a bipartisan compromise and not the bill that either of us would have written on our own, but I am glad that Senator Blunt and I were able to work together to protect many critical investments in students, workers, women, families, and the economy. I am especially pleased that this bill doesn\u2019t include a single new damaging policy rider \u2026 this bill is a good first step and a strong foundation for continued bipartisan work.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the bill would continue to fund the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Title X family planning grants and Obama-era Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, with \u201cnew bill language that directs HHS to administer the program as it was during the Obama Administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe two key provisions are as follows:\u000a\u000aFamily Planning Clinics. The bill includes $287 million for the Title X program, the same level of funding as in fiscal year 2017. Grantees rely on these funds to provide comprehensive family planning and preventive health services to nearly 5 million people. The bill also includes new bill language that directs HHS to administer the program as it was during the Obama Administration. Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP). The bill includes $108 million for the TPP program, which provides funding for evidence-based interventions that reduce teen pregnancy and are medically accurate as well as age appropriate. This is level with fiscal year 2017. The program was proposed for elimination in the President\u2019s budget. The bill also includes new bill language directing HHS to administer the program as it was during the Obama Administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is completely undermining Trump\u2019s pro-life agenda and Secretary Price\u2019s pro-life agenda,\u201d said the source to Breitbart News. \u201cIf Murray wanted to offer this stuff as amendments and you have a debate and a vote is one thing, but for Blunt to allow this in the base bill, this is not how a Republican, pro-life Senate should be acting. It\u2019s unilateral disarmament.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe source told Breitbart News that Planned Parenthood obtains a significant amount of the TPP program funds which is used, in turn, to create agreements with Title X family planning clinics. Students receive TPP \u201csex ed\u201d in schools \u2013 which is heavily focused on the use of contraception \u2013 and are then referred to Planned Parenthood for contraception, abortions, and other services.\u000a\u000aThe appropriations bill clears the subcommittee following President Donald Trump\u2019s signature on a resolution in April that overturns former President Barack Obama\u2019s rule that forced states to provide family planning grants under Title X to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers.\u000a\u000aPlanned Parenthood receives about $70 million per year in Title X grants to subsidize birth control.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, Trump has proposed to defund the Obama-era TPP programs that have been shown to be ineffective. Trump\u2019s budget funds, instead, Sexual Risk Avoidance (SRA) programs which incorporate more parental involvement and emphasize abstinence from sex. Obama \u2013 a champion for Planned Parenthood \u2013 had not requested any funding for SRA programs in his 2017 budget.\u000a\u000aThe Teen Pregnancy Prevention grants are \u201cmore than disappointing,\u201d Valerie Huber, the chief of staff for the assistant secretary for health told Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aAscend \u2013 an organization that promotes SRA programs and was previously run by Huber \u2013 noted research that shows more than 80 percent of students in the Obama-era TPP either fared worse or no better than their peers.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, Ascend observed, the numerous studies supporting TPP-type programs have produced results that \u201care not as compelling as they first appear.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe group cites weaknesses in the research, as well as flawed metrics and ignorance of common research protocols.\u000a\u000aSen. James Lankford (R-OK) \u2013 a member of the appropriations subcommittee, voted against the bill. DJ Jordan, a spokesman for Lankford, says Blunt has agreed to a base bill that will tie the hands of the Trump administration in the issuance of Title X grants:\u000a\u000aAs written, the bill does not just provide funding for family planning programs, it also prohibits the Secretary of the Health and Human Services Department from changing the current rules for the issuance of Title X grants. Through this bill, Congress requires the current administration to use the same rules as used by the Obama administration. This comes on the heels of a successful vote under the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of an Obama-era rule prohibiting states from denying Title X funds to Planned Parenthood. Placing this kind of limitation on the current administration is completely unacceptable. Senator Lankford voted no on passage of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee bill and as the bill moves forward, will continue to fight for removal of this harmful language and prioritize pro-life policies.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, the House approved H.J. Res. 43, introduced by Rep. Diane Black (R-TN). The resolution used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to rescind the Obama administration Title X rule, enacted during the last days of the former president\u2019s term as a means to provide protection for Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000aSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) sponsored the measure in the Senate. Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote at the end of March to enable approval in that chamber after Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against it.\u000a\u000aBlunt\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment from Breitbart News.

Even if convicted of murder, it is unlikely that he will be deported.\u000a\u000aThe case is not the first time a failed asylum seeker has committed murder in Germany. Earlier this year, an Afghan failed asylum seeker is said to have brutally murdered a five-year-old girl at an asylum home in Bavaria before later being shot by police.\u000a\u000aAsylum Seeker Shot by Police After Stabbing Five-Year-Old to Death https://t.co/ZVMQghA03t \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 6, 2017\u000a\u000aThe incident caused controversy in Germany after it was revealed that the 41-year-old had attempted to kill his ex-wife and cousin by committing arson and was made to wear an ankle monitor whilst living in the asylum home.

aVThis week has been unusually short \u2014 pared on one side by Labor Day, and by Hurricane Irma on the other. But the brief, three-day whirlwind may have been the most consequential thus far of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\u000a\u000aWhen he rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and invited Congress to replace it, Trump returned the legislative power to its rightful branch. And when he struck a surprise deal with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling until December, he restored \u2014 however briefly \u2014 the basic comity necessary for our system to function.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBoth of these moves were controversial \u2014 and confusing. Conservatives wondered, for good reason, whether Trump had rescinded DACA only to let Congress pass a blanket amnesty for its beneficiaries. And they asked themselves what had become of their party\u2019s hopes to rein in the national debt, which helped fuel the Tea Party wave of 2010.\u000a\u000aOn substance, Trump has a long way to go before implementing the kinds of policies that would fulfill the promises he made to his supporters, and fulfill the dreams of conservatives who hardly dared to imagine, a year ago, that they would control all three branches of government.\u000a\u000aBut Trump has done more than conservatives dreamed possible to make our constitutional system of limited, divided, yet responsive government work as it was designed once again.\u000a\u000aThat process of repair and restoration has been the Trump administration\u2019s silent agenda since January. He began by faithfully executing the law along the country\u2019s borders, letting border patrol and immigration and customs officers do their jobs, slashing illegal immigration by some two-thirds. He continued by overturning excessive regulations that restrained our energy industry and others, repealing some rules that had never even been reported to Congress.\u000a\u000aHe nominated a solid conservative, Neil Gorsuch, to the U.S. Supreme Court, thus preventing what might otherwise have been a liberal takeover that lasted decades. He withdrew from the Paris Climate Accords, which the previous administration signed in defiance of the Senate\u2019s constitutional power to ratify treaties. And he directed an active federal response to the Hurricane Harvey disaster, showing better management than both of the last two presidents.\u000a\u000aThe past few days have been more of the same, at a dizzying pace. On Tuesday, Schumer called Trump\u2019s DACA decision \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201cbrainless.\u201d The next day, he credited Trump for his \u201creasonable\u201d debt ceiling deal, which included funding for Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000aConservatives fumed that Trump obtained nothing in return. But to most Americans, funding emergency hurricane relief is what the government ought to do quickly, setting politics aside.\u000a\u000aBillionaire Mark Cuban, who became such a harsh critic of Trump that he sat in the front row at last year\u2019s first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, lauded Trump\u2019s debt ceiling decision as \u201creally smart.\u201d Conservatives, understandably, are wary of praise from Democrats and celebrities. But Cuban had nothing to gain from praising Trump \u2014 and, given the mood of the Democratic base, much to lose. It is possible he really meant what he said.\u000a\u000aAmidst all the worrying about how divided our country is, a new feeling is beginning to emerge, a sense of a society and a government that are actually working. Some of that is due simply to the resilience and decency of ordinary Americans, on full display in Texas.\u000a\u000aBut some of that is because of Trump. How ironic that the great \u201cdisruptor\u201d of our political system is turning out to be the leader who is restoring it \u2014 and, soon, public faith in it.\u000a\u000aJoel B.

aVA surprising percentage of gun sales to 18-29-year-old Americans go to gun buyers the left rarely wishes to acknowledge \u2014 women.\u000a\u000aTo talk about women buying guns is to undercut the left\u2019s tired excuse that more and more guns are simply being purchased by the same old white men.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to Bustle, personal protection is a big driver for Millennial females who buy guns \u2014 and so is \u201cempowerment.\u201d Shea Drake said, \u201cI grew up in a hunting family, and while I haven\u2019t gone hunting in about 10 years, I still target shoot fairly regularly.\u201d She said, \u201cI am lucky that, so far, I haven\u2019t had to use my guns for self-defense. But, I am glad that I know what to do if such a situation were to arise thanks to regular target practice. There is a sense of security in having a gun in my home, and knowing how to use it.\u201d\u000a\u000aTaylor Giardina said, \u201cI\u2019ve grown up shooting firearms both recreationally and for hunting, my entire life. My family always did this together as a family activity, and I was taught a lot about gun safety and ownership rights at a young age.\u201d She added, \u201cThough I have not had to use [a gun] for self defense, I am happy to know I have one. When I moved out on my own in college, I never worried about lack of a security system because I know how to use a firearm. It was a very empowering experience to know I can protect myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aBustle quotes a study from 2003 to argue that women are less safe if they have a gun in the house. In so doing, they failed to highlight the myriad real-life stories of women using guns for self-defense.\u000a\u000aHere are just a few recent stories:\u000a\u000aOn June 28, Breitbart News reported that a wheelchair-bound female homeowner in West Cleveland pulled a gun and told two alleged home invasion suspects she would use it if they continued trying to make entry. The woman \u2014 an apparent amputee \u2014 told Fox 8 that she \u201clooked at the door and there was a man, right there, right outside looking like he was going for my door.\u201d She said a second man was \u201ccutting the screen on a window of her garage.\u201d Both suspects fled when she showed her gun.\u000a\u000aOn July 18, Breitbart News reported that a 17-year-old girl in Spokane, Washington, armed herself with one of her father\u2019s guns then literally chased an alleged home intrusion suspect out of the family\u2019s home. The girl \u2014 Kimber Wood \u2014 heard the suspect enter the house and said his \u201ceyes got really wide\u201d when he found himself staring down the barrel of her gun.\u000a\u000aOn August 1, Breitbart News also reported that a grandmother who was home alone opened fire on two alleged home invasion suspects, killing one. The incident occurred in Katy, Texas, where the suspects allegedly entered via the garage. According to ABC 13, Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Thomas Gilliland said, \u201cBoth [suspects] were armed with pistols. She confronted both suspects, retrieved a handgun and fired several times at both subjects.\u201d One died at the scene while the second jumped a fence and fled.\u000a\u000aOn August 3, Breitbart News reported that a young mother opened fire to protect her three children during an alleged home invasion. The incident occurred just after 2 a.m. in Marietta, Georgia. The home invasion suspect was dead when police arrived.\u000a\u000aOn August 4, Breitbart News reported that a female driver stopped an alleged road rage attack with one shot. Glendala, Arizona, police indicated that the armed woman and her passenger were attacked by the driver of another car. The armed woman repeatedly warned the attacker that she was armed but to no avail. Finally, as the attack the continued, the armed woman fired one shot, striking the suspect in the abdomen and ending the alleged assault.\u000a\u000aSome of the women in those examples were Millennials, some were not. But the larger point is that examples of women using guns to save their own lives and the lives of others are legion. Millennials seem to know this; they seem to know that having a gun when under attack is better than having a shoe or a whistle.\u000a\u000aShea Drake said people think \u201cwomen are clueless about guns.\u201d She said, \u201cGuys always seem surprised that I don\u2019t need help loading my guns.

Meanwhile, the report also found extensive use of torture against political prisoners.\u000a\u000aThis week, Maduro also declined an invitation to speak at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, a forum where he has previously decried the \u201congoing harassment of the imperialist powers of the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost recently, the Maduro regime has pushed forth with the creation of an illegal lawmaking body, known as the \u201cnational constituents assembly,\u201d filled exclusively with pro-government stooges, effectively rendering the country a dictatorship.\u000a\u000aAmid skyrocketing inflation, and despite three minimum wage hikes over the course of 2017, Venezuela\u2019s monthly minimum wage is now the equivalent of under $6 a month, meaning people can go longer afford everything from food and medicine to basic sanitary products.\u000a\u000aIt is not the first time that The New York Times has published ads from the Venezuelan regime.

aVThe NFL opened its 2017 season Thursday night, in much the same way that it played out the 2016 season. The game featured the team that won the final game of the year last season, the game was high-scoring with plenty of offense, the game featured an anthem protest, and the league\u2019s ratings went down.\u000a\u000aThe game between the Chiefs and the Patriots drew a 14.6 overnight rating on NBC. That rating is down nearly two full points from last year\u2019s 16.5 number for the Panthers-Broncos opener, and more than three points down from the Steelers-Patriots opener in 2015.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhy, the steep decline?\u000a\u000aWhile the ratings have clearly trended down for a number of seasons, last night\u2019s game did feature an anthem protest from Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters, and it\u2019s entirely likely that many tuned-out after seeing that:\u000a\u000a#Chiefs CB Marcus Peters sits on trainer's bench during National Anthem. @SportsDailyKC @KCStar pic.twitter.com/5xnDLi4HqD \u2014 David Eulitt (@davidphotokc) September 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThe sports media would gladly point the finger at politics, as the cause of the ratings drop. Though, no debate, or matter of pressing national importance was being discussed in politics on Thursday night. Some have opined that coverage of Hurricane Irma, might be the culprit. Though, it rings hollow that coverage of the storm would cause a 12% decline in ratings from last year.\u000a\u000aInstead, it\u2019s more likely that NFL fans are following through on their warnings of last year. Specifically, the warning where 44% of fans said they would stop watching the NFL if the anthem protests continued. That poll, backed-up by the J.D.

aVWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 North Korea has, for the first time, threatened to wage an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack against the United States. Such an attack has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to North America, Canada, the West, and many of its neighbors.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea threatens to wipe out the United States on a regular basis through its state media. However, this is the first time North Korea has openly threatened to use an EMP weapon.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to the Associated Press, shortly after North Korea launched its sixth nuclear test using an H-bomb, the \u201cHermit Kingdom\u2019s\u201d leader Kim Jong-un issued a statement through its state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claiming the weapon \u201cis a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack according to strategic goals.\u201d\u000a\u000aKim reportedly claimed that \u201call components of the H-bomb were homemade \u2026 thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart News reported in June that \u201can EMP attack can be caused by the sun, by a nuclear EMP (NEMP), or a non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP).\u201d\u000a\u000aAn NEMP is an abrupt pulse of electromagnetic radiation that occurs as a result of a nuclear explosion. An NNEMP is virtually the same except it does not include the nuclear component. The currents caused by these charges the atmosphere with electromagnetic waves that travel down onto the earth\u2019s surface at super speeds hitting everything within their line of sight, sending high-voltage energy through the electricity grid and frying them, causing massive disarray.\u000a\u000aAnthony Furey\u2019s book Pulse Attack: The Real Story Behind the Secret Weapon That Can Destroy North America is the first of its kind to outline the A-Z effects of a potential EMP attack on North America. The book also presents several simple and straightforward ways North America can protect against such a devastating scenario.\u000a\u000aFurey is a national columnist for the Toronto Sun and a fellow at True North Initiative, a Canada-based think tank dedicated to advancing sound immigration and security policies.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wrote the book and of course it talks about how this could be a possibility for North America,\u201d Furey told Breitbart News. \u201cBut I would have always preferred that not be true. And then I read the statement and my jaw just dropped.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth America\u2019s grid is currently not protected against an EMP disruption or attack. Furey told Breitbart News that this recent statement from North Korea will likely increase public interest in the potential for an EMP attack. \u201cAnd politics is, of course, downstream from culture. It will change the way we look at the issue culturally because for a long time there were people who were dismissive of it\u201d by downplaying the probability of an EMP attack.\u000a\u000aFurey noted how \u201cparticularly over the last six months, analysts have underestimated North Korea\u2019s abilities. And right now, the main underestimation is that, sure, they have some degree of ICBMs, sure they have some degree of nukes and some degree of miniaturized nukes. They just don\u2019t have the guidance systems and the precision to do it. The problem with an EMP attack \u2013 or, from the perspective of someone using it, the benefit of an EMP attack \u2013 is you don\u2019t need as much precision. You\u2019re just detonating it above a general area. Whereas, if you want to strike a target, you have to get within a few kilometers of it. That is not the case with EMP.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said that, while \u201cEMP has always been possible, that\u2019s never been doubted. The probability has always been minor. But that probability has now just increased.\u201d\u000a\u000aFurey noted that, if the Koreans can fly over Japan or any other nation, they can fly and detonate an EMP over it. Furey, who is Canadian, noted that the Canadian government is also not prepared for an EMP attack.\u000a\u000aProtecting North American\u2019s electrical grid against the most devastating consequences of an EMP disruption or attack is simple and would require, at its most basic, a minimal amount of resources. State by state protections are likely.\u000a\u000aIn his book, Furey notes that former President Obama released several hundreds of millions of dollars to harden the Cheyenne Mountain Complex against an EMP attack. \u201cPresident Obama was able to sign onto something, probably in a very implicit small way; there wasn\u2019t large fanfare about it. But there has been movement on it. So I think it\u2019s completely reasonable to expect movement from President Trump on an executive level and definitely from Congress.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

Rick Santorum\u2019s plan to block grant health care to the states. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), as well as Rep.

Governors will present the idea \u201cas a solution outside of Washington.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeadows told reporters that the Santorum plan has \u201creal merit.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe idea of block granting health care to the states continues to gain steam. During the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearings on Wednesday, Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doak supported the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal plan.\u000a\u000aDoak explained:\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not convinced that Obamacare waivers are going to be the solution our problem. What we really need is an innovative and long-term solution that truly returns power back to the states to implement ideas tailored to each state\u2019s specific needs and health problems. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been encouraged by proposals out there like one from Sens. Graham and Cassidy, which would repeal the individual and employer mandates, and block grant dollars to the states. This kind of leadership and flexibility will provide long-term stability to our markets. If some states want Obamacare regulations, that\u2019s great. That works for them, but that isn\u2019t working for Oklahoma. We should have the opportunity to do something different.\u000a\u000aCommissioner Doak\u2019s support for the new Obamacare repeal plan reveals a growing interest in states to manage their own health care programs. Four other commissioners during the hearing supported the idea of allowing states to manage their own health care systems.\u000a\u000aCongressman Meadows suggested that the budgetary reconciliation instructions can be rewritten to include more changes to insurance regulations, to allow more competition across state lines, and expand Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Even though Congress would have to pass an Obamacare repeal plan before the end of September, Meadows contends that there remains a real possibility that Republicans can repeal and replace Obamacare.\u000a\u000aMeadows declared, \u201cIt has the possibility if they can move it in the Senate before the end of September \u2014 certainly they\u2019ve got to move it in before September 30th. We still have, you know \u2014 time after that. So if they can move it before September 30th I think that you have it.\u201d

aVA former financial analyst at Amazon has been charged with insider trading.\u000a\u000aFederal prosecutors and securities regulators said Thursday that Brett D. Kennedy stole confidential information about Amazon\u2019s earnings and gave it to his college friend who was a stock trader.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe scheme alleged by the government was relatively straight-forward. Kennedy had a job at Amazon that gave him access to the company\u2019s financial results. He was only supposed to access the results of one division but managed to get the entire company\u2019s results for the first quarter of 2015.\u000a\u000aHis friend Maziar Rezakhani had formerly run a a business that resold iPhones and other computer products. But sometime in early 2015, he became a full time stock trader. He had another friend, Sam Sadeghi, do stock research for him in exchange for 10 percent of Rezakhani\u2019s monthly trading profits. Apparently, they planned to build up a record of successfully trading stocks and then move to New York to start a hedge fund.\u000a\u000aPart of that plan allegedly involved using non-public information to trade Amazon stock. The SEC complaint says Kennedy looked up the quarterly results in April of 2015, wrote them down on a slip of paper, and then gave the paper to Rezakhani.\u000a\u000aWall Street analysts had expected Amazon to report first quarter revenue of $22.4 billion and a net loss of 14 cents. The information Kennedy obtained, however, showed Amazaon\u2019s revenue would be $22.7 billion and the loss would be just 12 cents. Anticipating that this \u201cbeat\u201d would push up the stock price, Rezakhani bought a bunch of shares of Amazon. To be precise, he bought 4,400 shares for $1.75 million. It\u2019s not clear where the iPhone reseller came up with that kind of money.\u000a\u000aIn a somewhat unique twist to the case, Rezahkani decided against stealthily concealing his possession of Amazon\u2019s non-public information. He took to online message boards and posted the figures as if they were a forecast. Maybe that was part of his plan to move to New York and start a hedge fund: he would be the guy who successfully predicted Amazon\u2019s first quarter 2015 share price. What investor could resist?\u000a\u000aWhen Amazon released its earnings, the share price jumped and Rezahkani sold out of his position. Total profits: $116,000, or a little less than a 10 percent gain. He then allegedly paid $10,000 to Kennedy for his part in the scheme.\u000a\u000aIf Rezahkani had simply bought the Amazon shares and held them, he\u2019d be much wealthier today. The share price has risen 156 percent since Rezahkani\u2019s trading. Simply buying and holding would have made Rezahkani $2.7 million.

aVThe City College of New York recently announced a $1.2 million grant that will be exclusively allocated to female minority students looking to pursue \u201cidentity-driven\u201d activism research.\u000a\u000aA new program entitled \u201cBeyond Identity: A Gendered Platform for Activist Scholars\u201d was announced by CCNY in August. The program, which will operate on a $1.2 million grant, will offer an opportunity exclusively for minority women to explore social justice activism research.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to the press release, the program is largely centered on social justice themes, such as \u201cidentity-driven research,\u201d lessons on \u201cgender and violence\u201d from activist-scholars.\u000a\u000aThe program combines elements of teaching (learning identity-driven research from activist-scholars studying immigration, social movements, protest, gender and violence); writing (nonfiction narrative writing and political writing from well-established writers from around the world); activism (movement-building workshops from community organizers); and public engagement through student-driven public events, the submission of student\u2019s writing for publication, and the presentation of research findings to relevant policy audiences.\u000a\u000aThe program will be led by Visiting Professor Nimmi Gowrinathan, who describes the program as an opportunity for under-represented females to \u201carticulate lived experiences\u201d through expressive writing assignments.\u000a\u000a\u201cA central component of the program is the ability to articulate lived experiences, and disseminate findings and opinions,\u201d said Gowrinathan. \u201cSustained, intensive writing courses will push each student to craft nonfiction narratives, as compelling forms of political communication. Without the personal in the political, the stories of these young women remain footnotes in the often exploitative narratives that capture their lives.\u201d\u000a\u000aAna Puente Flores, a CCNY student who works for the new initiative, told Campus Reform in an interview that the program \u201cdoes not discriminate on gender or race,\u201d despite that those invited to participate in research and access grant funds will be minority female students.

aVPresident Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law set up a secret back channel to help a top Democratic Senator lobby White House officials in favor of the \u201cDACA\u201d amnesty for 800,000 young illegals.\u000a\u000aSen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democratic Senator, spilled the beans in an interview with Reuters, where he described how he worked with Jared Kushner and liberal Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham to promote the DACA amnesty in April and July.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to Reuters\u2019s account, which describes the illegals as \u201cDreamers\u201d:\u000a\u000a\u201cWe initially had a conversation (with Kushner), at [Iowa Republican] Senator (Chuck) Grassley\u2019s invitation, on criminal justice and I asked Mr. Kushner afterwards if we could talk about immigration, separate and apart from Senator Grassley, which we did,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI went into \u2026 DACA because I was concerned about how this was going to unfold,\u201d the Illinois lawmaker conversations underscore a level of interest in the issue among senior White House aides that could lend momentum to the congressional debate on approving a permanent legislative fix for the Dreamers that Durbin has sought for the past 16 years\u000a\u000aKushner also arranged phone calls between Durbin and then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who now serves as Trump\u2019s chief of staff.\u000a\u000aFor 16 years, Durbin has been the principal Democratic advocate pushing for an amnesty for the younger illegals who were brought into the country as children by their illegal immigrant parents. Roughly 800,000 young illegals got work-permits from former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 DACA amnesty, and roughly 1.2 million additional illegals were either too young or too ill-educated to qualify for Obama\u2019s amnesty.\u000a\u000aDurbin did not talk to Trump during the process. He told Reuters\u2019 that Trump\u2019s decision to end the 2012 amnesty created by Obama was a disappointment which has been but partly offset by Trump\u2019s subsequent tweets \u201cthat were more encouraging and they continue even until this morning.\u201d\u000a\u000aDurbin also reported that Trump\u2019s policy aide, Steven Miller, maintained the same pro-American immigration priorities that he has championed since at least 2013 when he was worked as a top aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. \u201cThere was nothing in my conversation with him that suggested\u201d had walked away from his policies, Durbin told Reuters.\u000a\u000aHowever, the joint effort by Kushner and Durbin may be working. On September 6, Trump suggested he would sign the Democrats\u2019 amnesty legislation in exchange for some improvements on \u201cborder security.\u201d The White House transcript said:\u000a\u000aQ And what would you like to see, Mr. President, in legislation? THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019d like to see something where we have good border security, and we have a great DACA transaction where everybody is happy and now they don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore because, obviously, as you know, before, it was not a legal deal. It was a deal that wouldn\u2019t have held up and didn\u2019t hold up. And even President Obama when he did it, when he signed it, he said this is obviously not something that\u2019s \u2014 he called it short-term. I\u2019d like to see a permanent deal, and I think it\u2019s going to happen. I think we\u2019re going to have great support from both sides of Congress, and I really believe that Congress is going to work very hard on the DACA agreement and come up with something.\u000a\u000aThat amnesty-for-border-security deal is a long way short of Trump\u2019s campaign promise of an effective border wall and is also very far short of his advocacy for the popular Raise Act merit immigration reform. The Raise Act would reform the nation\u2019s immigration laws to help raise wages and opportunities for the 320 million Americans who dream of better lives for themselves and their children.\u000a\u000aThe current immigration system, said Trump:\u000a\u000ahas placed substantial pressure on American workers, taxpayers and community resources, and among those hit the hardest \u2026 are minority workers competing for jobs against brand new arrivals. It has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers \u2026 [this RAISE act] will give Americans a pay raise by reducing immigration\u2026 [and] it will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens.\u000a\u000aRead about the RAISE Act here.

aVIn her strongest address since assuming her post, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asserted that the Obama administration\u2019s heavy-handed policy that forced colleges and universities to conduct \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d in dealing with accusations of sexual assault has \u201cfailed.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeVos addressed students and faculty at George Mason University Thursday in long-awaited remarks on the enforcement of Title IX and the need to establish a regulatory framework that serves the needs of all students.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe secretary criticized the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 Dear Colleague letter, in which it sought to end cross-examination of alleged victims by students accused of sexual assault in campus courts and rejected the traditional clear-and-convincing evidence standard of proof in school disciplinary procedures.\u000a\u000aDeVos said:\u000a\u000aThe era of \u201crule by letter\u201d is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. This unraveling of justice is shameful, it is wholly un-American, and it is anathema to the system of self-governance to which our Founders pledged their lives over 240 years ago.\u000a\u000aDeVos made herself clear at the start of her address that \u201cacts of sexual misconduct are reprehensible, disgusting, and unacceptable. They are acts of cowardice and personal weakness, often thinly disguised as strength and power.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike her predecessors in the Obama administration, however, she gave significant attention to the problem of those students who are accused of sexual assault and denied their due process.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to remember that we\u2019re not just talking about faceless \u2018cases,\u2019\u201d the secretary said. \u201cWe are talking about people\u2019s lives. Everything we do must recognize this before anything else.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said the system put into place by the Obama administration has failed both alleged sexual assault victims and the accused.\u000a\u000a\u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,\u201d DeVos said, describing the Obama administration\u2019s approach:\u000a\u000aHere is what it looks like: a student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn\u2019t urged to keep quiet or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. Whatever witnesses\u2014if allowed to be called\u2014may or may not be cross-examined. And Washington dictated that schools must use the lowest standard of proof. And now this campus official\u2014who may or may not have any legal training in adjudicating sexual misconduct\u2014is expected to render a judgment. A judgment that changes the direction of both students\u2019 lives. The right to appeal may or may not be available to either party. And no one is permitted to talk about what went on behind closed doors. It\u2019s no wonder so many call these proceedings \u201ckangaroo courts.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeVos said \u201ceveryone loses\u201d in the current system which some say \u201cprotects survivors and thus must remain untouched.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the reality is it doesn\u2019t even do that,\u201d she added. \u201cSurvivors aren\u2019t well-served when they are re-traumatized with appeal after appeal because the failed system failed the accused. And no student should be forced to sue their way to due process.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe secretary addressed the trend the intimidating Obama-era guidance has promoted in which \u201cany perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said:\u000a\u000aSchools have been compelled by Washington to enforce ambiguous and incredibly broad definitions of assault and harassment. Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes. Any perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation. But if everything is harassment, then nothing is. Punishing speech protected by the First Amendment trivializes actual harassment. It teaches students the wrong lesson about the importance of free speech in our democracy. Harassment codes which trample speech rights derail the primary mission of a school to pursue truth.\u000a\u000aDeVos said her department will launch \u201ca transparent notice-and-comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise, and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective, and fair system,\u201d she said. \u201cTo implement sustainable solutions, institutions must be mindful of the rights of every student. No one benefits from a system that does not have the public\u2019s trust\u2014not survivors, not accused students, not institutions and not the public.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeVos was condemned by feminists and LGBT activists in July for inviting students who have been falsely accused of and disciplined for sexual assault under the Obama-era Title IX guidance.\u000a\u000aUnder the guidance, the Obama administration instructed schools to use the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence standard to resolve complaints of sex discrimination,\u201d which is used in most civil actions.\u000a\u000aTo promote its policy, Obama\u2019s deputies in the federal education department engaged the media by consistently pushing the myth that \u201cone in five\u201d college-age women in the U.S. will be sexually assaulted before they leave college.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe agency\u2019s figures are wildly at odds with the official crime statistics,\u201d nevertheless, began a fact-check video with AEI resident scholar and former philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, who studies the politics of gender and feminism.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Bureau of Justice, the real rate of rape on college campuses is actually closer to 1 in 500. However, armed with the false \u201cone in five\u201d statistic, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement the guidance in its Dear Colleague letter.

aVSouth Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has warned that North Korea may be planning to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Saturday, the latest in a series of increasingly belligerent military actions that culminated in the nation\u2019s sixth and most powerful nuclear test last weekend.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome believe North Korea may launch another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on the 9th; this time at an ordinary angle,\u201d Lee reportedly said on Thursday, according to CNN. \u201cA special measure is urgently needed to stop their recklessness.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe report follows a similar one from South Korean intelligence published this week in the nation\u2019s Asia Business Daily, which cited an unnamed intelligence official claiming there was evidence that Pyongyang was planning yet another ICBM test. According to Reuters, the report claimed that South Korean officials had spotted a rocket being moved towards its launch facilities, indicating it may be planning to test its capabilities. Reuters notes that South Korea\u2019s defense ministry did not confirm the report in Asia Business Daily, which takes on heightened significance given Lee\u2019s comments Thursday.\u000a\u000aSuch an ICBM test would follow the testing of a bomb Pyongyang claimed in its official state media was a hydrogen fusion bomb, a weapon the state newspaper Rodong Sinmun called \u201cperfect\u201d and caused an earthquake the United States Geological Survey rated a 6.3 magnitude. North Korea has threatened to reduce South Korea to \u201cashes\u201d in its state media since the test, calling its leaders \u201cgangsters\u201d and warning, \u201cIf we fire, they will die. This is the inescapable fate of the puppet warmongers.\u201d\u000a\u000aCommunist dictator Kim Jong-un, both in quotes and through state media, has threatened to attack the United States with a nuclear weapon once the nation\u2019s program is fully developed. While North Korea appeared to possess both nuclear warheads and ICBMs, the program appears to be struggling to miniaturize a warhead so that it fits onto an ICBM and has the reach necessary to strike the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aSeoul has already begun preparing for the possibility of such a missile targeting South Korean territory, with the government abruptly announcing that it had allowed the installation of new launchers, part of the U.S.-provided Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system. President Moon Jae-in, a leftist, had vocally opposed the installation of new THAAD launchers in the country, as neighboring countries like China and Russia have opposed the THAAD system arguing that its extensive reach deep into their territories proved it was not meant to defend from only North Korea.\u000a\u000aSeoul\u2019s defense ministry nonetheless confirmed Thursday that it had approved the installation of four more THAAD launchers, according to South Korea\u2019s Joongang Daily. The ministry insisted the installation was \u201ctemporary\u201d and necessary to prevent the possibility of civilian death should North Korea fire. \u201cWith the deployment of the four launchers, the U.S. military secured the field operation capability of one Thaad battery. We will make necessary preparations to use the capability as soon as the internal procedures are completed on the U.S. side,\u201d defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told reporters Thursday.

aVIn a preview of Sunday\u2019s 60 Minutes interview with former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, CBS released a segment in which Bannon is asked a question by Charlie Rose that no one in the media ever asks pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion Democrats.\u000a\u000aBannon was asked to reconcile his Catholic faith with those political beliefs in opposition to the church. In this case, it was about the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) strident and, as I wrote Wednesday, hypocritical support of DACA.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTranscript courtesy of CBS News:\u000a\u000aRose: Can I remind you, a good Catholic, that Cardinal [Timothy] Dolan is opposed to what\u2019s happened with DACA? Cardinal Dolan. Bannon: The Catholic Church has been terrible about this. \u2026 The bishops have been terrible about this \u2026 Because [they\u2019re] unable to really come to grips with the problems in the church, they need illegal aliens, they need illegal aliens to fill the churches. \u2026 They have \u2013 they have an economic interest. They have an economic interest in unlimited immigration, unlimited illegal immigration. Rose: Boy, that\u2019s a tough thing to say about your church. Bannon: As much as I respect Cardinal Dolan and the bishops on doctrine, this is not doctrine.\u000a\u000aIn response, the UCSSB quickly released a statement that is even more absurd than the original one:\u000a\u000aResponse from U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on Care for Migrants and Refugees: pic.twitter.com/orZPuCGf3b \u2014 US Catholic Bishops (@USCCB) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000a\u2014\u000a\u000aAs you can see, a whole lot of scripture is quoted, but there is absolutely nothing quoted about how Jesus said it was okay to burden others with your personal religious and political beliefs, which is exactly what the legalizing of illegal immigration does. In other words\u2026\u000a\u000aSorry, but I fail to see the Christian or Catholic compassion here.\u000a\u000aIt is very easy to call for the legalizing of 800,000 or two million or 11 million or 25 million illegal immigrants when you will only personally benefit from these policies, both through fuller pews and the love of the mainstream media. The problem with this thinking is that it shows ZERO compassion for the victims of this sort of immigration policy \u2014 you know, those who lose their jobs to illegals, those whose wages are lowered by a flood of cheap labor, those whose children cannot get a decent education due to classrooms burdened with illegal children who cannot speak English. Good heavens, where to begin with the wave of crime these illegals have brought with them?\u000a\u000aAnd do you want to know who disproportionately suffers the negative and sometime tragic consequences of all this Catholic compassion?\u000a\u000aThe poor.\u000a\u000aThe working poor.\u000a\u000aAnd this includes legal immigrants trying to get their lives jump-started.\u000a\u000aThe already-disenfranchised in America, the struggling working class, those who follow the rules, they are the ones disproportionately damaged by legalizing and incentivizing illegal immigration. And isn\u2019t it interesting how the advocates of these policies always seem to be above it all, above the consequences of their own advocacy \u2013 how they never seem to be in the demographic that takes it in the neck because a bunch of do-gooders are doing good at someone else\u2019s expense.\u000a\u000aDid Jesus not tell us to do unto others as you would have them do unto you?\u000a\u000aPlease explain to me, then, exactly who would want the very real world consequences of legalizing illegal immigration \u201cdone to them,\u201d and why are my Catholic leaders (I am a practicing Catholic) doing this \u201cto others?\u201d\u000a\u000aI am all in favor of treating illegal immigrants with compassion and mercy. I am all in favor of feeding those who are hungry, clothing those who are naked, offering medical help to those who are sick or injured. But as a good Catholic and Christian who cares about the poor, I am most certainly not in favor of using whatever influence I have on public opinion to virtue-signal at the expense of my neighbor\u2019s job, wages, education, or safety.\u000a\u000aIt simply is not compassion on your part when others pay the price for this so-called compassion.\u000a\u000aWhy not do both? Why not show mercy for the migrant without hurting an innocent person? Because it is certainly within the teachings of Jesus to welcome, feed, clothe, and show compassion to those as we repatriate them back into their own country.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m sorry, but calling for anything else is selfish, is vain, is screwing your neighbor, and is a violation of Christ\u2019s teachings.\u000a\u000aFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

aVThe Department of Justice announced a new set of priorities for one of its law enforcement grants that will place so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d behind jurisdictions that cooperate in federal immigration enforcement.\u000a\u000aAccording to DOJ documents acquired by Breitbart News, the DOJ\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), which issues one of the department\u2019s most important discretionary grant programs for state and local law enforcement agencies, will allow applicants for this year\u2019s cycle to certify their cooperation with Department of Homeland Security immigration enforcement efforts. Certified cooperative agencies will receive \u201cpriority consideration in funding decisions\u201d for the fiscal year 2017 COPS grant program.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe requirements for certification roughly mirror the requirements DOJ put in place in July to prevent non-cooperative sanctuary cities from participating in the department\u2019s Bryne Grant program. Agencies will pledge that DHS officials will have access to their correctional and detention facilities in order to check aliens\u2019 immigration status. They also must certify that they will give at least 48-hours notice to federal authorities before releasing aliens for which DHS requests such notification.\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a press release accompanying the new standards:\u000a\u000aCities and states that cooperate with federal law enforcement make all of us safer by helping remove dangerous criminals from our communities. This cooperation is supported by the vast majority of the American people, and jurisdictions with these policies in place should be acknowledged for their commitment to ending violent crime, including violent crime stemming from illegal immigration. Today, the Justice Department announced it will recognize jurisdictions that commit to the rule of law by awarding additional points in the application scoring process for COPS Office grants. My hope is that this recognition will further incentivize every jurisdiction in America to collaborate with federal law enforcement and help us make this country safer.\u000a\u000aRefusal to, or even outright policy prohibiting officers from meeting these requirements is one the hallmarks of \u201csanctuary cities\u201d like Chicago, IL. Departments in these jurisdictions will, therefore, not be able to apply for the special consideration of their cooperative sister agencies.\u000a\u000aAccording to the documents acquired by Breitbart News, agencies will only have until September 19 to make their certification of cooperation. Additional time will be given to law enforcement agencies involved in assisting the victims of Hurricane Harvey. These affected departments will have until September 29 to apply. Sources at DOJ indicated that these same agencies will be in line for additional consideration based on Harvey for COPS grants in the next fiscal year.

We are aquaphiles, teraphiles, pyrophiles and aerophiles. We shamelessly hug trees, massage the earth with our feet and talk erotically to plants.

aVProducers of the new, Internet-only Star Trek series say their new Klingon warriors are allegories for racist Trump supporters.\u000a\u000aThe forthcoming, 15-episode order of Star Trek: Discovery, to debut this month exclusively on the Internet-based CBS All Access, will follow a familiar Star Trek practice as the series looks to use its stories to comment on contemporary events.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe story arc of the new Trek series will focus on early relations between the United Federation of Planets and the war-like Klingon Empire. According to producers, that conflagration is an allegory to today\u2019s political climate in the age of Trump, according to Entertainment Weekly.\u000a\u000aShowrunner Aaron Harberts told EW that the election of President Donald Trump highly influenced producers and writers of Discovery.\u000a\u000aThe allegory is that we really started working on the show in earnest around the time the election was happening. The Klingons are going to help us really look at certain sides of ourselves and our country. Isolationism is a big theme. Racial purity is a big theme. The Klingons are not the enemy, but they do have a different view on things. It raises big questions: Should we let people in? Do we want to change? There\u2019s also the question of just because you reach your hand out to someone, do they have to take it? Sometimes, they don\u2019t want to take it. It\u2019s been interesting to see how the times have become more of a mirror than we even thought they were going to be.\u000a\u000aThe producer also noted that its war theme would cause Starfleet to \u201cexamine their ideas and ethical rules of conflict and conduct.\u201d\u000a\u000aHarberts added that the war brewing between the federation and the Klingons \u201cprovides a backdrop to how we want to be as a society and that analysis and self-reflection is new for Trek. They\u2019ve done it in certain episodes in the past, but this is a true journey for the institution in itself.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also admitted that Trump\u2019s confrontation with North Korea also featured in their story.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea is in our thoughts as we finish the series,\u201d Harberts told the magazine. \u201cWhat began as a commentary on our own divided nation \u2014 in terms of Trump supporters and non-Trump supporters \u2014 has blown out to North Korea and how we\u2019re right on the brink.\u201d\u000a\u000aFans seem wary of the new series, at least as far as these new Klingons are concerned. The latest depiction of Klingons differs markedly in physical appearance from the original show as well as the slew of Star Trek spinoffs from the 1990s.\u000a\u000aFans spent decades struggling to explain why Klingons looked more like humans, but just with dark skin and Fu Manchu mustaches in the original, 1960s series but had developed brow ridges and a mane of hair by the time Star Trek: The Next Generation debuted in 1987. Now, the news series depicts Klingons as completely hairless with ridges that seem to run from their forehead all the way down their backs. The newest Klingons look more alien than any before them, yet this series is supposedly set between Captain Kirk\u2019s Star Trek and the Next Generation eras.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

aVBillionaire real estate mogul Guo Wengui is currently visiting the United States on a tourist visa, but he decided he would like to stay a little longer after top officials back in his homeland declared him an enemy of the Communist regime.\u000a\u000aGuo applied for asylum in the United States this week, while the Chinese government has filed notices with Interpol seeking his arrest on charges of corruption and rape.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aGuo earned the enmity of powerful officials back in his homeland by accusing them of extravagant corruption, including the top official on the Communist Party\u2019s anti-corruption board, Wang Qishan.\u000a\u000a50-year-old Guo has been working out of a $78 million penthouse in New York City for the past two years, flooding Twitter and YouTube with his allegations against Chinese officials. He often uses the name \u201cMiles Kwok\u201d on social media. Both his Facebook and Twitter accounts were mysteriously wiped out within a week of each other earlier this year, but eventually restored after he complained, and his followers began muttering about the willingness of social media giants to play ball with Chinese censors.\u000a\u000aHis videos and tweets include allegations of everything from \u201ctop leaders\u2019 secret homes in California to their bank account information and hidden stakes in business empires,\u201d according to the Associated Press. He has also accused the Chinese government of arresting his relatives to use as leverage against him.\u000a\u000aHe attempted to sell his apartment in July, but the deal was blocked by a Hong Kong hedge fund that argued he might move the cash from his liquidated asset outside the United States to evade his creditors.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of the evidence he presents to back his claims is easily refuted or simply difficult to believe. But some of his accusations, such as those made against the family of Mr. Wang\u2019s immediate predecessor, can be corroborated,\u201d the New York Times observes.\u000a\u000aGuo\u2019s crusade does not appear to have weakened Wang\u2019s position much, according to the Times, since Beijing has signaled he still enjoys \u201cstrong backing from his peers,\u201d and some of them have taken pains to appear with Wang at ceremonial events such as the 100th anniversary commemoration of his father-in-law\u2019s birth. Also, Wang is still secure in his anti-corruption seat well after the age when Chinese officials normally retire.\u000a\u000aThe counterattack from Chinese authorities and their state-run media has been fierce. The Associated Press kicks off its list of the charges against Guo with allegations that he sexually assaulted his 28-year-old personal assistant, then adds 19 more criminal complaints, including \u201cbribing a top Chinese intelligence official, kidnapping, fraud and money laundering.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe rape charge is exceptionally lurid, as the woman who filed the complaint charged Guo with assaulting her repeatedly in locations around the world over the course of two years while she traveled with him. She said she was occasionally held prisoner in Guo\u2019s luxury accommodations, with her phone, computer, and passport confiscated.\u000a\u000aGuo\u2019s rags-to-riches story contains a good deal of the corruption he is crusading against, which an optimistic supporter might say qualifies him to know it when he sees it. In one colorful example provided by the Associated Press, Guo befriended an up-and-coming Chinese intelligence official named Ma Jian, who supplied him with a sex tape of a vice-mayor in Beijing who was blocking Guo\u2019s bid for major project. Ma himself eventually became the top Chinese counterintelligence official, only to be accused of taking $8.8 million in bribes from Guo.\u000a\u000aThe AP notes that Chinese officials were extraordinarily eager to discuss the details of the ostensibly sensitive cases against Guo. The Chinese have discussed Guo\u2019s case with senior U.S. officials and asked for his visa to be canceled\u2014the strongest demand they could make, since the United States does not have an extradition treaty with China.\u000a\u000aThe New York Times points out a few hitches in Guo\u2019s asylum application, beginning with the fact that it\u2019s not entirely clear which country he is currently a citizen of. He has an impressive collection of passports, but the one nation he definitely lacks valid paperwork from is China. His lawyer said he doesn\u2019t want to retire to any of the other nations he enjoy some form of citizenship from because he only feels safe from China in the United States. (His concerns about being kidnapped or killed by agents of Beijing are not unfounded; inconvenient Chinese billionaires have a habit of disappearing.)\u000a\u000aAnother problem is that granting Guo\u2019s asylum request might interfere with the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to secure Beijing\u2019s assistance with North Korea. \u201cMr. Guo is arguably China\u2019s most-wanted man, and giving him asylum would almost certainly antagonize Beijing, which may interpret the move as tacit approval of Mr. Guo\u2019s tactics to undermine China\u2019s leadership,\u201d the New York Times speculates.\u000a\u000aIn the short term, that conflict might be avoided by allowing Guo to stay put while his asylum request is processed, which his lawyer noted could take years.\u000a\u000aNPR reports that Guo met with Obama-era Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson a few months ago, in which Johnson evidently served as an unofficial emissary of the Trump administration. Leaked recordings of the meeting indicate Guo was told he would not be given to China as a bargaining chip. The recording also captured Guo taking pains to remind Johnson that he is a longtime member of President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort club.

aVRep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily to talk about President Trump\u2019s repeal of DACA and the future of immigration policy in Congress.\u000a\u000aMarlow noted that President Trump has greatly softened his rhetoric against DACA and even expressed a desire to legalize many of the aliens covered by it, even as he acts to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s unlawful executive orders.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he was duty-bound to rescind the order,\u201d DeSantis said of Trump\u2019s decision.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not constitutional,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe attorney general is right; it\u2019s not defensible in court. You had these state attorney generals who were bearing down and getting ready to bring this case. I think the president\u2019s hand was forced with the prospect of those AGs bringing the lawsuit.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen he did it, how the media has reacted, how most politicians \u2013 Democrats and even a lot of Republicans \u2013 react; the sole focus is on what can Congress do to benefit an illegal immigrant?\u201d DeSantis complained.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re getting an amnesty, an amnesty recipient, yeah, they\u2019re going to want that; that\u2019s good for them. There is zero talk, or very little talk, about how any of these immigration policies will affect the American people. Are you going to do things that are going to further incentivize illegal immigration? Are you going to do things that are expanding chain migration?\u201d he asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe argument with DACA is that these folks were minors when they came, so it\u2019s not their fault. I think that much is true, but under things like the amnesty proposals because of chain migration, someone that is given amnesty can then bring in the parents who did knowingly violate the law,\u201d he observed.\u000a\u000a\u201cNone of that stuff is really discussed very much. I\u2019m surprised the president hasn\u2019t highlighted some of that because I think his immigration program was popular when he ran. He was always seeing it through the prism of what is best for the American people. It\u2019s not just what is best for the person who is in the country illegally,\u201d he maintained.\u000a\u000aDeSantis said it was also important to consider the effect of amnesty programs on legal immigrants and naturalized citizens who have \u201cgone through a painstaking process.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen they see calls to create new processes for people who didn\u2019t follow the rules that they do \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ve talked to a lot of those folks in Florida, and that really gets them at their core. They feel like doing it the right way is not the smart thing to do, which is not what you want for our country. So there\u2019s very little perspective from the legal immigrant community,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut when Obama did his executive amnesties, both DACA and DAPA, it was reported, I think conclusively, that diverted so many resources, to try to give the executive amnesty to as many people as you could, that the people who were in line to be legal immigrants, their processes were noticeably slowed down,\u201d he pointed out.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is just proof in the pudding that there are all kinds of effects on American citizens, on would-be legal immigrants who will be American citizens, and the focus is never on any of that, but for a few outlets,\u201d he lamented.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the thing: the American people, when you talk to them about immigration, they want to know how it\u2019s best for the country and how it\u2019s best for the American people. They\u2019re not against immigration, but they don\u2019t want policies that have no connection to what\u2019s good for American workers and what\u2019s good for American society,\u201d said DeSantis.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.\u000a\u000aListen:

aVWASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Former United States Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton warned on Breitbart News Daily Thursday that a potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack from North Korea \u201cabsolutely is a threat\u201d and suggested considering military action against Pyongyang.\u000a\u000a\u201cA high-altitude nuclear detonation that could bring down a substantial part of the electrical grid of the United States, at least in particular geographic regions, would have a huge impact on us,\u201d Bolton told Sirius XM host and Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aA successful EMP attack would overheat vital transformers and ultimately take out that region\u2019s electric grid, leaving the population vulnerable to cyber and physical attacks. The lives of large swaths of the population would be at great risk.\u000a\u000aBolton said that, while people have suggested North Korea does not have the range to attack in its missiles, the thermonuclear capacity, the reentry vehicle, or guidance systems, \u201cwith EMP you don\u2019t need really precise guidance systems. If you just detonate something, let\u2019s say, over the West Coast of the United States, the EMP effects could be significant.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added, \u201cIt ties into the strategic question of what happens if North Korea fires an EMP weapon over the United States.\u201d He said an EMP attack would cause minimal damage on the ground and possibly would not even produce any immediate casualties. \u201cBut the knock-on effects of impairing the electrical grid could be very substantial. What do you do then?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe United States is not prepared for a potential EMP attack against it. The GRID Act and SHIELD Act have been sitting in both the House and Senate but no progress has been made in passing them.\u000a\u000aCenter for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney also discussed a potential EMP attack with Marlow on Wednesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt may or may not be true today\u201d that North Korea can launch a nuclear warhead with intercontinental range, Gaffney said, \u201cBut it\u2019s for sure the case that that\u2019s imminent, if not actually true now.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the first time, North Korea has openly threatened to wage an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack against the United States.\u000a\u000aAlthough North Korea threatens to wipe out the United States on a regular basis through its state media, this is the first time the closed-off country has openly threatened to use an EMP weapon.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Associated Press, shortly after North Korea launched its sixth nuclear test, North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un issued a statement through its state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) saying claiming the weapon \u201cis a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack according to strategic goals.\u201d\u000a\u000aKim reportedly claimed that \u201call components of the H-bomb were homemade \u2026 thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is why I think we\u2019ve got to consider the military option against North Korea first,\u201d Bolton said. He referred back to a statement President Franklin Delano Roosevelt made on September 11, 1941, when he said, \u201cWhen you see a rattlesnake poised to strike, you do not wait until it has struck before you crush it.\u201d\u000a\u000aBolton added:\u000a\u000aPeople say, but my goodness if you use a military option, terrible things will happen on the Korean peninsula. And I agree that this is an enormous concern and we would have to do everything possible to mitigate that. But these same people also say, well of course if North Korea attacked the United States, then we should respond with devastating force, which would likely have the same consequences in South Korea.\u000a\u000aHe asked, \u201cWhat is the difference between their position and mine if they\u2019re insistent that before we strike there have to be dead Americans?

Maxine Waters (D-CA) lumped Breitbart News in with white nationalists and other people who she claimed were seeking her demise.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWaters said, \u201cI\u2019m worried about these domestic attacks. As a matter of fact, I was forced to focus on it a little bit yesterday when in my office in Los Angeles one of the people opening the mail opened an envelope, and a bunch of powder fell out with a note about me dying and killing Hillary Clinton and on and on and on. This is getting more frequent, and I know that we have privacy concerns and information sharing and all that.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe continued, \u201cBut I\u2019m wondering what can we do to get a handle, a fix on these lone killers, and not simply just say we throw our hands up and we can\u2019t really do anything because of privacy concerns. And I\u2019m wondering particularly in our finical institutes and banks if questionnaires that do not invade privacy but simply ask questions about what the intentions are for the uses of certain money under certain circumstances. And these people can say whatever they want to, and they can respond in whatever way they want to, but if resources are used to go and commit killings they will have lied on the questionnaire and perhaps that can trigger some kind of actions to begin to prevent this kind of domestic terrorism.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe added, \u201cI think we should focus on domestic terrorism also. So I would like to ask again, given all that you have said about how difficult it is and about privacy concerns, do you have any thoughts about what can we do to begin to deal with the KKK, the white nationalists, the extremists, the alt-right? They\u2019re on the Internet; they\u2019re Breitbart. If you look at the YouTube, you see how much they want to kill me and others.

aVIn her strongest address since assuming her post, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asserted that the Obama administration\u2019s heavy-handed policy that forced colleges and universities to conduct \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d in dealing with accusations of sexual assault has \u201cfailed.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeVos addressed students and faculty at George Mason University Thursday in long-awaited remarks on the enforcement of Title IX and the need to establish a regulatory framework that serves the needs of all students.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe secretary criticized the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 Dear Colleague letter, in which it sought to end cross-examination of alleged victims by students accused of sexual assault in campus courts and rejected the traditional clear-and-convincing evidence standard of proof in school disciplinary procedures.\u000a\u000aDeVos said:\u000a\u000aThe era of \u201crule by letter\u201d is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. This unraveling of justice is shameful, it is wholly un-American, and it is anathema to the system of self-governance to which our Founders pledged their lives over 240 years ago.\u000a\u000aDeVos made herself clear at the start of her address that \u201cacts of sexual misconduct are reprehensible, disgusting, and unacceptable. They are acts of cowardice and personal weakness, often thinly disguised as strength and power.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike her predecessors in the Obama administration, however, she gave significant attention to the problem of those students who are accused of sexual assault and denied their due process.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to remember that we\u2019re not just talking about faceless \u2018cases,\u2019\u201d the secretary said. \u201cWe are talking about people\u2019s lives. Everything we do must recognize this before anything else.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said the system put into place by the Obama administration has failed both alleged sexual assault victims and the accused.\u000a\u000a\u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,\u201d DeVos said, describing the Obama administration\u2019s approach:\u000a\u000aHere is what it looks like: a student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn\u2019t urged to keep quiet or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. Whatever witnesses\u2014if allowed to be called\u2014may or may not be cross-examined. And Washington dictated that schools must use the lowest standard of proof. And now this campus official\u2014who may or may not have any legal training in adjudicating sexual misconduct\u2014is expected to render a judgment. A judgment that changes the direction of both students\u2019 lives. The right to appeal may or may not be available to either party. And no one is permitted to talk about what went on behind closed doors. It\u2019s no wonder so many call these proceedings \u201ckangaroo courts.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeVos said \u201ceveryone loses\u201d in the current system which some say \u201cprotects survivors and thus must remain untouched.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the reality is it doesn\u2019t even do that,\u201d she added. \u201cSurvivors aren\u2019t well-served when they are re-traumatized with appeal after appeal because the failed system failed the accused. And no student should be forced to sue their way to due process.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe secretary addressed the trend the intimidating Obama-era guidance has promoted in which \u201cany perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said:\u000a\u000aSchools have been compelled by Washington to enforce ambiguous and incredibly broad definitions of assault and harassment. Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes. Any perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation. But if everything is harassment, then nothing is. Punishing speech protected by the First Amendment trivializes actual harassment. It teaches students the wrong lesson about the importance of free speech in our democracy. Harassment codes which trample speech rights derail the primary mission of a school to pursue truth.\u000a\u000aDeVos said her department will launch \u201ca transparent notice-and-comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise, and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective, and fair system,\u201d she said. \u201cTo implement sustainable solutions, institutions must be mindful of the rights of every student. No one benefits from a system that does not have the public\u2019s trust\u2014not survivors, not accused students, not institutions and not the public.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeVos was condemned by feminists and LGBT activists in July for inviting students who have been falsely accused of and disciplined for sexual assault under the Obama-era Title IX guidance.\u000a\u000aUnder the guidance, the Obama administration instructed schools to use the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence standard to resolve complaints of sex discrimination,\u201d which is used in most civil actions.\u000a\u000aTo promote its policy, Obama\u2019s deputies in the federal education department engaged the media by consistently pushing the myth that \u201cone in five\u201d college-age women in the U.S. will be sexually assaulted before they leave college.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe agency\u2019s figures are wildly at odds with the official crime statistics,\u201d nevertheless, began a fact-check video with AEI resident scholar and former philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, who studies the politics of gender and feminism.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Bureau of Justice, the real rate of rape on college campuses is actually closer to 1 in 500. However, armed with the false \u201cone in five\u201d statistic, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement the guidance in its Dear Colleague letter.

aVThe United States will deploy 3,500 American troops to Afghanistan as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s strategy to end the 16-year-old war, bringing the number of U.S. service members there to more than 14,000, according to American officials.\u000a\u000aUntil the end of August, the Pentagon had been reporting that only about 8,300 American service members were serving in Afghanistan, rather than the recently unveiled figure of 11,000.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAs of May, another 6,575 military personnel from 39 NATO allies and non-NATO partner nations were also operating in Afghanistan. NATO has said it is \u201cfully committed\u201d to Trump\u2019s strategy in Afghanistan. On August 30, Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie argued that the intention of excluding about 2,600 troops was to avoid providing \u201cdirect information to the enemy, and sort of preclude telegraphing some of the things that we want to d0.\u201d\u000a\u000aGen. McKenzie revealed that about 11,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Afghanistan, noting, \u201cSo we believe it\u2019s not in our interest to actually parse this out in great detail, which is why we\u2019re adopting a single number. And I\u2019m again emphasizing that\u2019s an approximate number, and that\u2019s the number that you\u2019ll get from the department from now on.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters last week that he had approved the deployment orders for some American troops, noting that the United States would unveil the specific number after the Pentagon briefed Congress.\u000a\u000aDuring a closed-door session Wednesday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. met with lawmakers to discuss the number of U.S. troops expected to deploy soon.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on condition of anonymity, U.S. officials claimed that the Pentagon had approved the nearly 3,500 it long been considering sending, bringing the number of American troops to be stationed in Afghanistan to more than 14,000.\u000a\u000aIt remains unclear what that task of the additional American troops is expected to be and how long their mission will take, given that President Trump has been hesitant to advertise his plans to the enemy.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News asked whether President Trump will officially resume the combat mission that former President Obama prematurely declared over at the end of 2014, resulting in a Taliban resurgence and the Islamic State\u2019s (ISIS/ISIL) establishing a presence, but the Pentagon refused to say.\u000a\u000aAfter ending the combat mission, Obama drastically changed the rules of engagement (ROEs), taking away the U.S. military\u2019s authority to aggressively target the Afghan Taliban, forcing them to respond in self-defense only.\u000a\u000aFaced with an undeniable Taliban resurgence within a year after ending the combat mission, Obama was compelled to once again allow U.S. troops to offensively target the Taliban, rather than waiting to be shot at first, changing the rules of engagement near the end of his tenure in June 2016.\u000a\u000aSo far, the U.S. military is still fighting the Afghanistan war under the ROEs approved by Obama in June 2016, although Trump is expected to implement them differently, allowing commanders on the ground to independently make decisions faster, rather than waiting for micromanaging decisions from the White House\u000a\u000aHowever, the Trump administration has yet to implement the new Afghan strategy, meaning the Obama-era authority remains in place.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported:\u000a\u000aWhile President Barack Obama approved more aggressive airstrikes against the Taliban in 2016, Trump\u2019s new rules of engagement could allow U.S. forces to target Taliban forces faster than they have in the past and attack them even if they are not directly threatening Afghan forces, according to U.S. officials familiar with the possible changes who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the changes had not yet been authorized. The Obama-era change, dubbed \u201cstrategic effects,\u201d allowed U.S. forces to strike Taliban fighters if the airstrike would change the outcome of a ground battle. Trump\u2019s adjustments to the rules of engagement would \u2014 in short \u2014 allow American aircraft to strike the Taliban wherever they might appear.\u000a\u000aAccording to the U.S. Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency, the United States had no clue how many U.S.-funded Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) were serving alongside their American counterparts as of the end of April 2016.\u000a\u000aDespite the U.S. investing an estimated $714 billion in American taxpayer funds on security and reconstruction in corruption-laden Afghanistan since the war began in October 2001, the United States government appeared to keep Americans in the dark about what they were getting for their money as far as security troops and reconstruction projects.

And these people can say whatever they want to, and they can respond in whatever way they want to, but if resources are used to go and commit killings they will have lied on the questionnaire and perhaps that can trigger some kind of actions to begin to prevent this kind of domestic terrorism.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe added, \u201cI think we should focus on domestic terrorism also. So I would like to ask again, given all that you have said about how difficult it is and about privacy concerns, do you have any thoughts about what can we do to begin to deal with the KKK, the white nationalists, the extremists, the alt-right?

Hawaii, on the other hand, has the lowest rate of residents going hungry, with only 8.7 percent of households reporting food insecurity.\u000a\u000aThe USDA report says much of the drop is attributed to a decreasing unemployment rate and less inflation of food prices, meaning people can afford to buy more food.\u000a\u000a\u201cFood insecurity increased substantially with the recession,\u201d Alisha Coleman-Jensen, the report\u2019s lead author, told Bloomberg. \u201cAlong with falling unemployment, low levels of food inflation have also eased hunger in the U.S., she said. \u2018We\u2019re continuing the downward trend.'\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. unemployment hit 4.4 percent in August, a 0.5 percent decrease from 2016.

What we really need is an innovative and long-term solution that truly returns power back to the states to implement ideas tailored to each state\u2019s specific needs and health problems. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been encouraged by proposals out there like one from Sens. Graham and Cassidy, which would repeal the individual and employer mandates, and block grant dollars to the states. This kind of leadership and flexibility will provide long-term stability to our markets. If some states want Obamacare regulations, that\u2019s great. That works for them, but that isn\u2019t working for Oklahoma. We should have the opportunity to do something different.\u000a\u000aCommissioner Doak\u2019s support for the new Obamacare repeal plan reveals a growing interest in states to manage their own health care programs. Four other commissioners during the hearing supported the idea of allowing states to manage their own health care systems.\u000a\u000aCongressman Meadows suggested that the budgetary reconciliation instructions can be rewritten to include more changes to insurance regulations, to allow more competition across state lines, and expand Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Even though Congress would have to pass an Obamacare repeal plan before the end of September, Meadows contends that there remains a real possibility that Republicans can repeal and replace Obamacare.\u000a\u000aMeadows declared, \u201cIt has the possibility if they can move it in the Senate before the end of September \u2014 certainly they\u2019ve got to move it in before September 30th.

aVThis week has been unusually short \u2014 pared on one side by Labor Day, and by Hurricane Irma on the other. But the brief, three-day whirlwind may have been the most consequential thus far of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\u000a\u000aWhen he rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and invited Congress to replace it, Trump returned the legislative power to its rightful branch. And when he struck a surprise deal with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling until December, he restored \u2014 however briefly \u2014 the basic comity necessary for our system to function.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBoth of these moves were controversial \u2014 and confusing. Conservatives wondered, for good reason, whether Trump had rescinded DACA only to let Congress pass a blanket amnesty for its beneficiaries. And they asked themselves what had become of their party\u2019s hopes to rein in the national debt, which helped fuel the Tea Party wave of 2010.\u000a\u000aOn substance, Trump has a long way to go before implementing the kinds of policies that would fulfill the promises he made to his supporters, and fulfill the dreams of conservatives who hardly dared to imagine, a year ago, that they would control all three branches of government.\u000a\u000aBut Trump has done more than conservatives dreamed possible to make our constitutional system of limited, divided, yet responsive government work as it was designed once again.\u000a\u000aThat process of repair and restoration has been the Trump administration\u2019s silent agenda since January. He began by faithfully executing the law along the country\u2019s borders, letting border patrol and immigration and customs officers do their jobs, slashing illegal immigration by some two-thirds. He continued by overturning excessive regulations that restrained our energy industry and others, repealing some rules that had never even been reported to Congress.\u000a\u000aHe nominated a solid conservative, Neil Gorsuch, to the U.S. Supreme Court, thus preventing what might otherwise have been a liberal takeover that lasted decades. He withdrew from the Paris Climate Accords, which the previous administration signed in defiance of the Senate\u2019s constitutional power to ratify treaties. And he directed an active federal response to the Hurricane Harvey disaster, showing better management than both of the last two presidents.\u000a\u000aThe past few days have been more of the same, at a dizzying pace. On Tuesday, Schumer called Trump\u2019s DACA decision \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201cbrainless.\u201d The next day, he credited Trump for his \u201creasonable\u201d debt ceiling deal, which included funding for Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000aConservatives fumed that Trump obtained nothing in return. But to most Americans, funding emergency hurricane relief is what the government ought to do quickly, setting politics aside.\u000a\u000aBillionaire Mark Cuban, who became such a harsh critic of Trump that he sat in the front row at last year\u2019s first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, lauded Trump\u2019s debt ceiling decision as \u201creally smart.\u201d Conservatives, understandably, are wary of praise from Democrats and celebrities. But Cuban had nothing to gain from praising Trump \u2014 and, given the mood of the Democratic base, much to lose. It is possible he really meant what he said.\u000a\u000aAmidst all the worrying about how divided our country is, a new feeling is beginning to emerge, a sense of a society and a government that are actually working. Some of that is due simply to the resilience and decency of ordinary Americans, on full display in Texas.\u000a\u000aBut some of that is because of Trump. How ironic that the great \u201cdisruptor\u201d of our political system is turning out to be the leader who is restoring it \u2014 and, soon, public faith in it.\u000a\u000aJoel B.

For example, he recently calculated a $1 trillion taxpayer-saving for cutting the annual inflow of unskilled migrants by roughly 50 percent or by 5 million people per decade.\u000a\u000aA back-of-the-envelope calculation based on Rector\u2019s data suggests that the cost of providing an amnesty to Obama\u2019s young illegals \u2014 plus their lower-skilled peers and parents \u2014 will add up to $500 billion over the next 75 years.\u000a\u000aUnskilled immigrants \u2013 both illegal and legal \u2014 cost taxpayers much money because the taxes that they can pay into the state, local and federal treasuries are far below the benefits they do receive in the form of education, health care, retirement and income support. The details are included in the September 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, which also showed that recent immigrants are failing to integrate into the United States\u2019 society.\u000a\u000aThat Washington-imposed policy of mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families.\u000a\u000aThose problems are echoed in nation\u2019s increasingly turbulent politics, which featured the unprecedented election of a New York real-estate developer to the White House in 2016 because of his popular opposition to the mass-immigration policies favored by the business and political establishment.\u000a\u000aRector\u2019s calculations do not include the hidden cost of companies\u2019 continued reliance on cheap imported labor instead of new, labor-saving machinery. In contrast to the United States, both Japan and China have national economic policies that oppose immigration and instead favor increased automation and robotics \u2014 and they have growing economies and rising per-person productivity and income.\u000a\u000aUnder current rules, 4 million young Americans enter the workforce each year to search for decent jobs. But each year, the government also hands out 1 million green cards to new immigrants who compete against Americans for good jobs.\u000a\u000aThe government also hands out almost 3 million short-term work permits to foreign workers. These permits include roughly 330,000 one-year OPT permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, roughly 200,000 three-year H-1B visas for foreign white-collar professionals, and 400,000 two-year permits to DACA illegals.\u000a\u000aUnderstandably, business groups strongly favor high levels of immigration because the taxpayers\u2019 huge costs become business revenues once the immigrants buy food, lodging, transport services, and education services. The immigrants also provide federally subsidized labor for new business operations, so reducing pressure on companies to hire labor-saving, American-made machinery, such as crop-picking robots.\u000a\u000aAmnesty Will Push the GOP Towards Extinction\u000a\u000aAny amnesty for the younger illegals damages the GOP\u2019s support among the millions of ordinary Americans voters who backed Trump in 2016 because he promised a reform that would benefit Americans, not illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aEnding DACA now gives chance 2 restore Rule of Law. Delaying so R Leadership can push Amnesty is Republican suicide. https://t.co/iYOLxFWp7V \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) September 4, 2017\u000a\u000aThe damage would be greater if the GOP also failed to push through other GOP priorities, such as a reform of the failing Obamacare government-run medical system.\u000a\u000aIf GOP congress fixes DACA but doesn't repeal/replace Obamacare\u2026 hoo boy. Big chunk of GOP voters are going to be mad as hell. https://t.co/DTMBOekYty \u2014 Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) September 4, 2017\u000a\u000aIt would also contradict Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d inauguration slogan, damaging his influence in 2018 and his reelections chances in 2020.\u000a\u000aIf President Trump wants to put America first\u2026 he will end DACA and work for the passage of the #RAISEAct https://t.co/QhRn0PflrP \u2014 NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) September 5, 2017\u000a\u000aThe public wants to be nice to the young illegals, but polls show that voters strongly prefer immigration policies that help Americans and their children earn a good living in an increasingly turbulent, globalizing economy. That preferences deeply shaped the GOP primaries and the 2016 election, much to the advantage of Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aAlready, multiple business groups admit that Trump\u2019s popular RAISE Act immigration and economic reform would raise Americans\u2019 salaries. Higher salaries allow people to buy houses, get married and create families \u2014 all of which tend to nudge them towards voting GOP.\u000a\u000aThe mass immigration of mostly unskilled government-dependent migrants is also gradually expanding Democratic power throughout the nation. This process is most clear in California, where pro-immigration Democrats now hold all state-wide elected offices. That huge advantage is also helping Democrats move step-by-step towards federal dominance. Democrats now hope to use expanding Latino populations in Florida and Texas to gain political dominance in those two states, so ending GOP hopes of winning presidential elections.\u000a\u000aThere is little or no evidence that the DACA illegals \u2014 or their future children \u2014 will vote Republican. In contrast, there is much evidence that some DACA youths are more loyal to their foreign families than they are to the Americans whom they want to live with.\u000a\u000aLate in the game, and only after the rise of Donald Trump, GOP leaders now seem to be slowly recognizing how their decades-long deference to their cheap-labor business allies is wrecking their party\u2019s future. This week, multiple GOP leaders have said they oppose a no-strings DACA and prefer some sort of package deal that helps Americans \u2014 perhaps the RAISE act which is being pushed by Trump, Cotton, and Georgia Sen. David Perdue.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot repeat the mistakes of the past with a comprehensive immigration bill that does not work,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cThe RAISE Act\u2019s changes to our legal immigration system should be part of the solution.\u201d\u000a\u000aGeorgia\u2019s other GOP Senator, Sen. Johnny Isackson, added: \u201cCongress should protect these young people while also working toward stronger measures to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws going forward.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe bottom line of it is, I don\u2019t think DACA as a clean bill can get through the Congress by itself,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the judiciary committee. The dispute is an \u201copportunity for compromise between people that want DACA plus a lot of other things dealing with legal immigration, and I suppose even some things dealing with illegal immigration, that can probably be packaged together.\u201d\u000a\u000aSen. Mitch McConnell, the GOP\u2019s leader in the Senate, pushed the same package approach; \u201cPresident Obama wrongly believed he had the authority to re-write our immigration law. Today\u2019s action by President Trump corrects that fundamental mistake \u2026 This Congress will continue working on securing our border and ensuring a lawful system of immigration that works.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will not be advancing legislation that doesn\u2019t have the support of President Trump because we are going to work with the president on how to do this legislation,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday. \u201cThe president also gave us the time and space we\u2019re going to need to find where that [immigration] compromise is,\u201d said Ryan who has a long history of pushing business-boosting cheap-labor immigration policies.

aVLong-time pro-mass immigration billionaires Charles and David Koch became the latest force to pressure congressional Republicans to nullify the end of DACA with a legislative amnesty Thursday.\u000a\u000aKoch spokespeople told the Daily Beast that the brothers\u2019 vast, ostensibly conservative and libertarian political empire will be brought to bear on Republican legislators. The Kochs will throw their weight behind the growing effort to force a two-house GOP majority that has refused to pass either funding for the southern border wall or the RAISE Act, a key nationalist immigration reform, to quickly pass an amnesty for those who were once exempted from federal immigration law under President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAs the Beast puts it, \u201cWith its formidable political and policy operation, the Koch network could provide more political cover to Republican members of Congress as they consider a replacement to the DACA program.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Koch amenability to open borders and amnesty is nothing new. For example, in 2013, the pair sponsored a Buzzfeed \u201cImmigration Summit\u201d featuring the likes of admitted illegal alien Jose Antonia Vargas and a half dozen other open borders fundamentalists with only the most token immigration restrictionist opposition. In 2016, Charles Koch compared then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s immigration proposals to \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d Even left-wing presidential candidate phenomenon Bernie Sanders came to refer to open borders as \u201ca Koch brothers proposal\u201d during his campaign for the Democratic nomination.\u000a\u000aThis year, Koch-funded groups stepped up their pro-illegal alien rhetoric. In April, the LIBRE Initiative, a Hispanic-outreach wing of the Koch political empire, launched a campaign to pressure Congress to grant driver\u2019s licenses and other government benefits to illegal aliens. In August, the same group issued a press release calling for amnesty and saying so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u201crepresent some of the best and brightest in our country.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the phased end of DACA, the group doubled down, calling for Congress to pass amnesty for illegals who violated American immigration laws when they were young. \u201cIt is more important than ever that Congress act to remove this barrier that stands between these Dreamers and their full potential,\u201d LIBRE President Daniel Garza said. \u201cIt is long overdue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Daily Beast, for its part, was uncharacteristically charitable in describing the Kochs for its DACA-replacement piece, calling them merely \u201clibertarian billionaires.\u201d In the recent past, the Beast portrayed the pair as little better than Nazi collaborators, referring to them as \u201cthe industrial interests\u201d behind \u201cmorally bankrupt Republican leadership,\u201d \u201cwho want all environmental restraints on fossil fuels destroyed\u2014just as in Nazi Germany the Krupp, Volkswagen, and I.G. Farben (later Bayer) industries saw the vast profits to be made in Hitler\u2019s war and rode with the devil all the way.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the Daily Beast points out, pro-amnesty politics are hardly unusual among America\u2019s business elite. Facebook founding billionaire Mark Zuckerberg is very much in tune with the Koch network over DACA, as is the Chamber of Commerce.\u000a\u000aWith 18 Congressional Republicans clamoring to quench the business elite\u2019s thirst for young illegal alien labor even before the end of DACA was announced, the Koch\u2019s and their ilk in that world are unlikely to have trouble finding allies in their push for amnesty.

They have an economic interest in unlimited immigration, unlimited illegal immigration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe statement that the Catholic Church has \u201can economic interest in unlimited immigration, unlimited illegal immigration\u201d is factually correct as it pertains to both unlimited immigration and unlimited illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aAs for the Catholic Church\u2019s economic interest in unlimited legal immigration, one need look no further than the hundreds of millions of dollars paid each year by the federal government to Catholic Charities, one of the nine leading voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) who resettle the tens of thousands of refugees who arrive in the country each year under the Refugee Admissions Program.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn FY 2015, the State Department, through the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, spent more than $1 billion on these programs, which settled international refugees \u2018vetted\u2019 by the United Nations High Commission on International Refugees in all 50 states and the District of Columbia,\u201d Breitbart News reported:\u000a\u000aMuch of this $1 billion in annual revenue goes to voluntary agencies (VOLAGs), several of which are Christian non-profits, such as Catholic Charities, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, World Relief Corporation, Church World Service, and Domestic and Foreign Missionary Service of the Episcopal Church of the USA. (also referred to as Episcopal Migration Ministries), who are contracted on behalf of the government to help these refugees get settled in their new homes in America.\u000a\u000aImmigration from Mexico and Latin America\u2013both legal and illegal\u2013has provided a needed boost in the membership of the Catholic Church, though not enough to offset the departure of native born Americans and legal immigrants from other countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cCatholics appear to be declining both as a percentage of the population and in absolute numbers. The new survey indicates there are about 51 million Catholic adults in the U.S. today, roughly 3 million fewer than in 2007,\u201d Pew Research reported in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe Catholic Church\u2019s economic interest in unlimited illegal immigration arises from the fact that the majority of the estimated 11 million illegal aliens currently living in the United States are from Mexico and other Latin American countries, which are largely Catholic, though an increasing number have left the Catholic Church for a variety of Evangelical Christian churches.\u000a\u000a\u201cNearly 790,000 young unauthorized immigrants have received work permits and deportation relief through the federal government\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program since it was created five years ago by President Barack Obama, according to the latest data released by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,\u201d Jens Manuel Krogstad wrote at Pew Research last week.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnauthorized immigrants from Mexico make up more than three-quarters of all DACA recipients. Since the program started, 78% of approved applications \u2013 both initial (618,342) and renewals (622,170) \u2013 have come from Mexicans,\u201d Krogstad noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn 2014, 5.8 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico lived in the U.S. . . about half of the nation\u2019s 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants (52% in 2014),\u201d Pew Research reported in March.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were 11.7 million immigrants from Mexico living in the U.S. in 2014, and about half of them were in the country illegally, according to Pew Research Center estimates. Mexico is the country\u2019s largest source of immigrants, making up 28% of all U.S. immigrants,\u201d Pew Research added.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe face of Catholic America is changing. Today, immigrants make up a considerable share of Catholics, and many are Hispanic. At the same time, there has been a regional shift, from the Northeast (long home to a large percentage of the Catholic faithful) and Midwest to the Western and Southern parts of the U.S,\u201d Michael Lipka wrote at Pew Research in 2014, noting that \u201cOur research also has documented the decline of Catholics as a share of the U.S. population.\u201d\u000a\u000aCatholics are more likely than other Americans to be immigrants or children of immigrants. Indeed, more than a quarter of U.S. Catholic adults (27%) were born outside the country, compared with 15% of U.S. adults overall; most of these Catholic immigrants (22% of all U.S. Catholics) are from elsewhere in the Americas. As of 2014, an additional 15% of Catholic Americans have at least one foreign-born parent. That leaves 57% of Catholics who were born in the U.S. to two native-born parents. By comparison, nearly three-quarters (74%) of American adults overall were born in the country to two U.S.-born parents. The share of U.S. Catholics who are Hispanic has grown by 5 percentage points since 2007 (from 29% to 34%), while the percentage of all U.S. adults who are Hispanic has grown by 3 points (from 12% to 15%). And the share of Catholics who are Hispanic is likely to continue to grow; among Catholic millennials, as many are Hispanic (46%) as are white (43%).\u000a\u000aIn a report issued this week by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Changing Religous Identity: Findings from the 2016 American Values Atlas,\u201d researchers Robert P. Jones and Daniel Cox found that \u201cThe Catholic Church is experiencing an ethnic transformation. Twenty-five years ago, nearly nine in ten (87%) Catholics were white, non-Hispanic, compared to 55% today. Fewer than four in ten (36%) Catholics under the age of 30 are white, non-Hispanic; 52% are Hispanic.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor most of the past 25 years, American Catholics have been overwhelmingly white. In 1991, more than eight in ten (87%) U.S. Catholics were white, non-Hispanic.16 Today, 55% of Catholics identify as white, non-Hispanic, and more than one-third (36%) are Hispanic. Notably, much of the shift in the ethnic composition of the American Catholic community occurred over just the last couple of decades. Generational differences in the ethnic and racial make-up of American Catholics also suggest that a substantial cultural shift is underway. Fewer than four in ten (36%) Catholics under the age of 30 are white, non-Hispanic, compared to a majority (52%) who are Hispanic. In contrast, more than three-quarters (76%) of Catholic seniors (age 65 or older) are white, while only 17% are Hispanic. Demographic differences between Hispanic and white Catholics also suggest that the Hispanic Catholic community is poised to make further gains. First, Hispanic Catholics are nearly twice as likely as white Catholics to be parents of children under the age of 18 (30% vs. 16%, respectively). The discrepancy in parental status is driven largely by age differences between Hispanic Catholics and white Catholics. Second, Hispanic Catholics are more likely to have larger families: Close to three in ten (28%) Hispanic Catholic parents have at least three children under the age of 18 living at home, while 21% of white Catholic families report the same.\u000a\u000aIn his interview with CBS\u2019s Charlie Rose, Bannon then followed up with this:\u000a\u000aAs much as I respect Cardinal Dolan and the bishops on doctrine, this is not doctrine. This is not doctrine at all. I totally respect the pope and I totally respect the Catholic bishops and cardinals on doctrine. This is not about doctrine. This is about the sovereignty of a nation. And in that regard, they\u2019re just another guy with an opinion.\u000a\u000aDolan conceded that Bannon was probably correct when he stated the position of the Catholic bishops supporting the continuation of the unconstitutional DACA program was \u201cprobably not Catholic doctrine.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, rather than accepting the Constitution of the United States as the ultimate authority of law in this country, Dolan offered his particular interpretation of several phrases in the Bible as the ultimate source of jurisprudence in America.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do appreciate the attempt to clarify his [Bannon\u2019s] statement this is not an issue of Catholic doctrine and that the bishops are only giving opinion here,\u201d Dolan said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a matter of fact he may be right. It\u2019s not an issue of Catholic doctrine because it comes from the Bible itself. We Catholics are people of the book,\u201d he continued in his interview with Fulwiler:\u000a\u000aThe Bible is so clear, so clear, to treat the immigrant with dignity and respect. To make sure that society is just in its treatment of the immigrant is Biblical mandate. It\u2019s clear in the Old Testamentmy Jewish neighbors remind me of that all the time. And it\u2019s clear from the lips of Jesus when he said \u201cWhatsoever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me . . . When I was a stranger\u2013meaning an immigrant or a refugee\u2013 you welcomed me.\u201d As a matter of fact that\u2019s one of the questions he\u2019s going to ask us when we stand before him in final judgment. So,there\u2019s a moral imperative to treat the immigrant with dignity and respect that we have a sacred duty to preach.\u000a\u000aDuring his entire 17 minute interview with Fulwiler, Cardinal Dolan never mentioned the Constitution. Nor did he acknowledge that the United States of America is a sovereign country governed under a constitutional republic established in 1789 when the Constitution was ratified by two-thirds of the thirteen states.\u000a\u000aBut legal experts agree that President Obama\u2019s establishment of the DACA program was unconstitutional.\u000a\u000a\u201cDefenders of DACA are ignoring the fact that it violated two federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution. President Donald Trump was legally required to end it, and doing so helps restore the rule of law on the vitally important issue of immigration policy,\u201d Breitbart\u2019s Legal Editor Ken Klukowski noted on Tuesday:\u000a\u000aVirtually everyone who met those minimal standards [of the DACA program] was granted this deferred status, which could be renewed every two years, and received work permits to have an American job. Many of the affected individuals are now adults\u2014the average age of a so-called \u201cDREAMer\u201d is 25\u2014seeking work reauthorization to stay in this country indefinitely. Pundits can argue about the politics of DACA, and they can argue about the policy. President Trump made clear that he empathized with those who were brought here as children, and that on humanitarian and equitable grounds what to do about DACA was a difficult challenge for him. But no one should debate whether DACA is legal. The bottom line is that only Congress can make immigration law. Because DACA was a purely executive action, the program violates two federal statutes\u2014the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\u2014as well as the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\u000a\u000aMany Christians also disagree with Cardinal Dolan and the Catholic bishops when it comes to their interpretation of Biblical scriptures as they relate to illegal immigrants and the DACA program.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe agree that immigration reform and DACA are difficult subjects,\u201d Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration wrote in a September 4 letter addressed to President Trump and Speaker of the House Ryan and signed by Kelly Kulburg of the American Association of Christian Evangelicals, best selling Christian author and radio host Eric Metaxas, David Barton, Founder of Wall Buildersand several other Christian leaders.\u000a\u000a\u201cGod loves the foreigner. Indeed, God loves us all. It takes time to discern the balance of mercy and justice by which a nation survives,\u201d the letter continues:\u000a\u000aThe Church is called to serve all people, and our Government leaders are elected to defend and uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. Though there are tragic stories on every side of illegal migration, for our elected officials, responsibilty to oaths must prevail. Law and order sustain stability and peace. A nation of wise rule grows strong enough to sustain care for the vulnerable in our midst. While some faith groups use selective Bible words for open borders and amnesty, we consider the whole counsel of Scripture. We find that the Bible does not teach open borders, but wise welcome. We are to welcome the lawful foreigner, who, like a convert, comes as a blessing (eg.s Ruth and Rahab). We also find Nehemiah building walls to protect citizens from harm. In Isaih 1, we see God condemning the destruction of borders and indigenous culture.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn policy decisions ahead, while treating undocumented people kindly, we ask that you would first and foremost honor often forgotten American citizens whose families have served our nation for many generations, and the patient people who have applied lawfully to come here and to become citizens of the United States. These lives also matter. These people also dream,\u201d (emphasis added), the letter concluded.

aVFor years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter.\u000a\u000aNow, however, facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire\u2019s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire\u2019s four electoral college votes in the presidential election.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aNew Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he\u2019s a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote.\u000a\u000aNew Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire\u2019s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes.\u000a\u000aNow there\u2019s proof.\u000a\u000aAccording to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver\u2019s license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesn\u2019t prove that any fraud occurred \u2013 theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license.\u000a\u000aSo if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driver\u2019s license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017 \u2013 nearly ten months after the election \u2013 only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire.\u000a\u000aSo 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver\u2019s licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State.\u000a\u000a5,513 is a big number \u2013 more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. That\u2019s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also possible that New Hampshire\u2019s four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well.\u000a\u000aIf the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result.\u000a\u000aAnd that is already having consequences for the nation. If the 52-48 Republican-Democrat balance in the Senate were 53-47, it could change the balance in any number of votes \u2013 not the least of which would be the effort to repeal Obamacare.\u000a\u000aBut the mainstream media will tell us, \u201cMove along, there\u2019s nothing to see here.\u201d\u000a\u000aKris W. Kobach is the elected Secretary of State of Kansas. An expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the Arizona SB-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the 10 ICE agents who sued to stop Obama\u2019s 2012 executive amnesty.

aVCONCORD, N.H. (AP) \u2014 The annual Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac, which claims an 80 percent accuracy rate in its forecasts, predicted the possibility of a major hurricane along the Atlantic Seaboard, but didn\u2019t have the same insight about the Gulf Coast.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhen it came out a year ago, the venerable guide to weather, planting and homespun advice said the best chances for a major hurricane this year would be in the early part of September, from Florida to North Carolina. As of Friday, there were three active hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, with Hurricane Irma remaining a powerful threat to Florida. And the hurricane season still has two more months to go.\u000a\u000aAlmanac compilers in Dublin, New Hampshire, base predictions on a \u201csecret formula\u201d going back to 1792 that\u2019s influenced by sunspots, climatology and meteorology and refined by modern scientific calculations.\u000a\u000aAlmanac editor Janice Stillman said a hurricane the size and scope of Harvey would\u2019ve been difficult to forecast.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Gulf Coast was not in our direct line of sight, so to speak,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was not a named area, although, it\u2019s certainly a normal target, if you will, for hurricanes at any time.\u201d\u000a\u000aStillman said that while it is normal that hurricanes happen, Harvey was \u201cabnormal in scale, which is unpredictable by just about anybody.\u201d\u000a\u000aBelieved to be North America\u2019s oldest continuously published periodical, the almanac is not to be confused with The Farmer\u2019s Almanac based in Maine, which is in its 200th year and came out last month.\u000a\u000aThe 226th edition of the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac comes out Tuesday, with predictions for 2018.\u000a\u000aAlthough scientists don\u2019t trust its unconventional weather formula, it\u2019s still a tradition that remains popular with loyal readers.

aVWASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Former United States Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton warned on Breitbart News Daily Thursday that a potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack from North Korea \u201cabsolutely is a threat\u201d and suggested considering military action against Pyongyang.\u000a\u000a\u201cA high-altitude nuclear detonation that could bring down a substantial part of the electrical grid of the United States, at least in particular geographic regions, would have a huge impact on us,\u201d Bolton told Sirius XM host and Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aA successful EMP attack would overheat vital transformers and ultimately take out that region\u2019s electric grid, leaving the population vulnerable to cyber and physical attacks. The lives of large swaths of the population would be at great risk.\u000a\u000aBolton said that, while people have suggested North Korea does not have the range to attack in its missiles, the thermonuclear capacity, the reentry vehicle, or guidance systems, \u201cwith EMP you don\u2019t need really precise guidance systems. If you just detonate something, let\u2019s say, over the West Coast of the United States, the EMP effects could be significant.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added, \u201cIt ties into the strategic question of what happens if North Korea fires an EMP weapon over the United States.\u201d He said an EMP attack would cause minimal damage on the ground and possibly would not even produce any immediate casualties. \u201cBut the knock-on effects of impairing the electrical grid could be very substantial. What do you do then?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe United States is not prepared for a potential EMP attack against it. The GRID Act and SHIELD Act have been sitting in both the House and Senate but no progress has been made in passing them.\u000a\u000aCenter for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney also discussed a potential EMP attack with Marlow on Wednesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt may or may not be true today\u201d that North Korea can launch a nuclear warhead with intercontinental range, Gaffney said, \u201cBut it\u2019s for sure the case that that\u2019s imminent, if not actually true now.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the first time, North Korea has openly threatened to wage an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack against the United States.\u000a\u000aAlthough North Korea threatens to wipe out the United States on a regular basis through its state media, this is the first time the closed-off country has openly threatened to use an EMP weapon.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Associated Press, shortly after North Korea launched its sixth nuclear test, North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un issued a statement through its state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) saying claiming the weapon \u201cis a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack according to strategic goals.\u201d\u000a\u000aKim reportedly claimed that \u201call components of the H-bomb were homemade \u2026 thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is why I think we\u2019ve got to consider the military option against North Korea first,\u201d Bolton said. He referred back to a statement President Franklin Delano Roosevelt made on September 11, 1941, when he said, \u201cWhen you see a rattlesnake poised to strike, you do not wait until it has struck before you crush it.\u201d\u000a\u000aBolton added:\u000a\u000aPeople say, but my goodness if you use a military option, terrible things will happen on the Korean peninsula. And I agree that this is an enormous concern and we would have to do everything possible to mitigate that. But these same people also say, well of course if North Korea attacked the United States, then we should respond with devastating force, which would likely have the same consequences in South Korea.\u000a\u000aHe asked, \u201cWhat is the difference between their position and mine if they\u2019re insistent that before we strike there have to be dead Americans? I reject that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News. Follow her on Facebook and Twitter.

North Korea has since continued to threaten a nuclear attack on the United States and South Korea on a nearly daily basis in its state media outlets.\u000a\u000aThe parade is the latest such event following the \u201cDay of the Sun\u201d parade in April. The \u201cDay of the Sun\u201d is a holiday established to celebrate the birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the founder of the repressive communist regime, which current dictator and grandson Kim Jong-un has used annually to showcase the nation\u2019s military equipment in lavish parades. This year\u2019s parade featured numerous intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), used in tests later in the year. \u201cWe will respond to an all-out war with an all-out war and a nuclear war with our style of a nuclear attack,\u201d Choe Ryong Hae, a high-ranking North Korean official, said during that parade.\u000a\u000aWhile the parades should ebullient crowds supportive of the Kim family cult, some reports suggest growing discontent in the nation, organized under a strict caste system that forbids families with relatives who oppose communism from entering its capital. The Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported on Friday that sources within North Korea had said \u201csome members of the North Korean public are beginning to voice their discontent with leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s policy of military provocation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAccording to the source, North Korean authorities have been cracking down on those who make remarks to the effect that \u2018military buildup does not help in obtaining food,\u2019 while at least one military researcher appears to have attempted to flee the country, fearing war with the United States,\u201d the newspaper reported.\u000a\u000aIn response to the latest nuclear test, reports indicate the United Nations is seeking to implement sanctions on North Korea\u2019s oil trade.

Certified cooperative agencies will receive \u201cpriority consideration in funding decisions\u201d for the fiscal year 2017 COPS grant program.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe requirements for certification roughly mirror the requirements DOJ put in place in July to prevent non-cooperative sanctuary cities from participating in the department\u2019s Bryne Grant program. Agencies will pledge that DHS officials will have access to their correctional and detention facilities in order to check aliens\u2019 immigration status. They also must certify that they will give at least 48-hours notice to federal authorities before releasing aliens for which DHS requests such notification.\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a press release accompanying the new standards:\u000a\u000aCities and states that cooperate with federal law enforcement make all of us safer by helping remove dangerous criminals from our communities. This cooperation is supported by the vast majority of the American people, and jurisdictions with these policies in place should be acknowledged for their commitment to ending violent crime, including violent crime stemming from illegal immigration. Today, the Justice Department announced it will recognize jurisdictions that commit to the rule of law by awarding additional points in the application scoring process for COPS Office grants. My hope is that this recognition will further incentivize every jurisdiction in America to collaborate with federal law enforcement and help us make this country safer.\u000a\u000aRefusal to, or even outright policy prohibiting officers from meeting these requirements is one the hallmarks of \u201csanctuary cities\u201d like Chicago, IL. Departments in these jurisdictions will, therefore, not be able to apply for the special consideration of their cooperative sister agencies.\u000a\u000aAccording to the documents acquired by Breitbart News, agencies will only have until September 19 to make their certification of cooperation. Additional time will be given to law enforcement agencies involved in assisting the victims of Hurricane Harvey. These affected departments will have until September 29 to apply.

You had these state attorney generals who were bearing down and getting ready to bring this case. I think the president\u2019s hand was forced with the prospect of those AGs bringing the lawsuit.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen he did it, how the media has reacted, how most politicians \u2013 Democrats and even a lot of Republicans \u2013 react; the sole focus is on what can Congress do to benefit an illegal immigrant?\u201d DeSantis complained.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re getting an amnesty, an amnesty recipient, yeah, they\u2019re going to want that; that\u2019s good for them. There is zero talk, or very little talk, about how any of these immigration policies will affect the American people. Are you going to do things that are going to further incentivize illegal immigration? Are you going to do things that are expanding chain migration?\u201d he asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe argument with DACA is that these folks were minors when they came, so it\u2019s not their fault. I think that much is true, but under things like the amnesty proposals because of chain migration, someone that is given amnesty can then bring in the parents who did knowingly violate the law,\u201d he observed.\u000a\u000a\u201cNone of that stuff is really discussed very much. I\u2019m surprised the president hasn\u2019t highlighted some of that because I think his immigration program was popular when he ran. He was always seeing it through the prism of what is best for the American people. It\u2019s not just what is best for the person who is in the country illegally,\u201d he maintained.\u000a\u000aDeSantis said it was also important to consider the effect of amnesty programs on legal immigrants and naturalized citizens who have \u201cgone through a painstaking process.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen they see calls to create new processes for people who didn\u2019t follow the rules that they do \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ve talked to a lot of those folks in Florida, and that really gets them at their core. They feel like doing it the right way is not the smart thing to do, which is not what you want for our country. So there\u2019s very little perspective from the legal immigrant community,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut when Obama did his executive amnesties, both DACA and DAPA, it was reported, I think conclusively, that diverted so many resources, to try to give the executive amnesty to as many people as you could, that the people who were in line to be legal immigrants, their processes were noticeably slowed down,\u201d he pointed out.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is just proof in the pudding that there are all kinds of effects on American citizens, on would-be legal immigrants who will be American citizens, and the focus is never on any of that, but for a few outlets,\u201d he lamented.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the thing: the American people, when you talk to them about immigration, they want to know how it\u2019s best for the country and how it\u2019s best for the American people. They\u2019re not against immigration, but they don\u2019t want policies that have no connection to what\u2019s good for American workers and what\u2019s good for American society,\u201d said DeSantis.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.\u000a\u000aListen:

aVThe communist government of North Korea staged a massive parade in its capital, Pyongyang, on Wednesday, in celebration of its allegedly \u201cperfect\u201d hydrogen bomb test on Sunday.\u000a\u000aThe regime forced large crowds to gather in the streets to greet the scientists responsible for constructing the bomb, waving flags and tossing flowers.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThose participating in the design of the weapon \u201cvisited the statues of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il on Mansu Hill to make a report about their success and vow to successfully conclude their research and development campaign to attain the final-phase goals for perfecting the state nuclear force advanced at the Seventh Congress of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, true to the guidance of respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un,\u201d according to the state newspaper Rodong Sinmun.\u000a\u000a\u201cAlong the routes of streets Pyongyangites gave warm welcome to the contributors, waving flags of the DPRK, red flags and bouquets,\u201d the newspaper added.\u000a\u000aNorth Korean state youtube channel Uriminzokkiri posted an hour-long video of the event featuring speeches from military leaders and showcasing the throngs of residents forced to express extreme joy or face legal retribution. North Korea has executed officials, including dictator Kim Jong-un\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek, for crimes such as \u201cclapping half-heartedly\u201d at the alleged successes of the communist regime.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea announced that it had conducted a \u201cperfect\u201d hydrogen fusion bomb test\u2014a significant improvement in its nuclear development program if true.\u201d All components of the H-bomb were homemade and all the processes ranging from the production of weapons-grade nuclear materials to precision processing of components and their assembling were put on the Juche basis, thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants,\u201d Rodong Sinmun announced this weekend.\u000a\u000aThe nuclear test followed the launch of a missile over northern Japan, triggering nuclear warnings throughout that region of the country and eliciting global condemnation. North Korea has since continued to threaten a nuclear attack on the United States and South Korea on a nearly daily basis in its state media outlets.\u000a\u000aThe parade is the latest such event following the \u201cDay of the Sun\u201d parade in April. The \u201cDay of the Sun\u201d is a holiday established to celebrate the birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the founder of the repressive communist regime, which current dictator and grandson Kim Jong-un has used annually to showcase the nation\u2019s military equipment in lavish parades. This year\u2019s parade featured numerous intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), used in tests later in the year. \u201cWe will respond to an all-out war with an all-out war and a nuclear war with our style of a nuclear attack,\u201d Choe Ryong Hae, a high-ranking North Korean official, said during that parade.\u000a\u000aWhile the parades should ebullient crowds supportive of the Kim family cult, some reports suggest growing discontent in the nation, organized under a strict caste system that forbids families with relatives who oppose communism from entering its capital. The Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported on Friday that sources within North Korea had said \u201csome members of the North Korean public are beginning to voice their discontent with leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s policy of military provocation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAccording to the source, North Korean authorities have been cracking down on those who make remarks to the effect that \u2018military buildup does not help in obtaining food,\u2019 while at least one military researcher appears to have attempted to flee the country, fearing war with the United States,\u201d the newspaper reported.\u000a\u000aIn response to the latest nuclear test, reports indicate the United Nations is seeking to implement sanctions on North Korea\u2019s oil trade. Breitbart News obtained a copy of a draft UN resolution that would impose a complete embargo on the nation\u2019s oil and textile industries.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

aVWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 North Korea has, for the first time, threatened to wage an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack against the United States. Such an attack has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to North America, Canada, the West, and many of its neighbors.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea threatens to wipe out the United States on a regular basis through its state media. However, this is the first time North Korea has openly threatened to use an EMP weapon.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAccording to the Associated Press, shortly after North Korea launched its sixth nuclear test using an H-bomb, the \u201cHermit Kingdom\u2019s\u201d leader Kim Jong-un issued a statement through its state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claiming the weapon \u201cis a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack according to strategic goals.\u201d\u000a\u000aKim reportedly claimed that \u201call components of the H-bomb were homemade \u2026 thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart News reported in June that \u201can EMP attack can be caused by the sun, by a nuclear EMP (NEMP), or a non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP).\u201d\u000a\u000aAn NEMP is an abrupt pulse of electromagnetic radiation that occurs as a result of a nuclear explosion. An NNEMP is virtually the same except it does not include the nuclear component. The currents caused by these charges the atmosphere with electromagnetic waves that travel down onto the earth\u2019s surface at super speeds hitting everything within their line of sight, sending high-voltage energy through the electricity grid and frying them, causing massive disarray.\u000a\u000aAnthony Furey\u2019s book Pulse Attack: The Real Story Behind the Secret Weapon That Can Destroy North America is the first of its kind to outline the A-Z effects of a potential EMP attack on North America. The book also presents several simple and straightforward ways North America can protect against such a devastating scenario.\u000a\u000aFurey is a national columnist for the Toronto Sun and a fellow at True North Initiative, a Canada-based think tank dedicated to advancing sound immigration and security policies.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wrote the book and of course it talks about how this could be a possibility for North America,\u201d Furey told Breitbart News. \u201cBut I would have always preferred that not be true. And then I read the statement and my jaw just dropped.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth America\u2019s grid is currently not protected against an EMP disruption or attack. Furey told Breitbart News that this recent statement from North Korea will likely increase public interest in the potential for an EMP attack. \u201cAnd politics is, of course, downstream from culture. It will change the way we look at the issue culturally because for a long time there were people who were dismissive of it\u201d by downplaying the probability of an EMP attack.\u000a\u000aFurey noted how \u201cparticularly over the last six months, analysts have underestimated North Korea\u2019s abilities. And right now, the main underestimation is that, sure, they have some degree of ICBMs, sure they have some degree of nukes and some degree of miniaturized nukes. They just don\u2019t have the guidance systems and the precision to do it. The problem with an EMP attack \u2013 or, from the perspective of someone using it, the benefit of an EMP attack \u2013 is you don\u2019t need as much precision. You\u2019re just detonating it above a general area. Whereas, if you want to strike a target, you have to get within a few kilometers of it. That is not the case with EMP.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said that, while \u201cEMP has always been possible, that\u2019s never been doubted. The probability has always been minor. But that probability has now just increased.\u201d\u000a\u000aFurey noted that, if the Koreans can fly over Japan or any other nation, they can fly and detonate an EMP over it. Furey, who is Canadian, noted that the Canadian government is also not prepared for an EMP attack.\u000a\u000aProtecting North American\u2019s electrical grid against the most devastating consequences of an EMP disruption or attack is simple and would require, at its most basic, a minimal amount of resources. State by state protections are likely.\u000a\u000aIn his book, Furey notes that former President Obama released several hundreds of millions of dollars to harden the Cheyenne Mountain Complex against an EMP attack. \u201cPresident Obama was able to sign onto something, probably in a very implicit small way; there wasn\u2019t large fanfare about it. But there has been movement on it. So I think it\u2019s completely reasonable to expect movement from President Trump on an executive level and definitely from Congress.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

aVThe United States will deploy 3,500 American troops to Afghanistan as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s strategy to end the 16-year-old war, bringing the number of U.S. service members there to more than 14,000, according to American officials.\u000a\u000aUntil the end of August, the Pentagon had been reporting that only about 8,300 American service members were serving in Afghanistan, rather than the recently unveiled figure of 11,000.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAs of May, another 6,575 military personnel from 39 NATO allies and non-NATO partner nations were also operating in Afghanistan. NATO has said it is \u201cfully committed\u201d to Trump\u2019s strategy in Afghanistan. On August 30, Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie argued that the intention of excluding about 2,600 troops was to avoid providing \u201cdirect information to the enemy, and sort of preclude telegraphing some of the things that we want to d0.\u201d\u000a\u000aGen. McKenzie revealed that about 11,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Afghanistan, noting, \u201cSo we believe it\u2019s not in our interest to actually parse this out in great detail, which is why we\u2019re adopting a single number. And I\u2019m again emphasizing that\u2019s an approximate number, and that\u2019s the number that you\u2019ll get from the department from now on.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters last week that he had approved the deployment orders for some American troops, noting that the United States would unveil the specific number after the Pentagon briefed Congress.\u000a\u000aDuring a closed-door session Wednesday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. met with lawmakers to discuss the number of U.S. troops expected to deploy soon.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on condition of anonymity, U.S. officials claimed that the Pentagon had approved the nearly 3,500 it long been considering sending, bringing the number of American troops to be stationed in Afghanistan to more than 14,000.\u000a\u000aIt remains unclear what that task of the additional American troops is expected to be and how long their mission will take, given that President Trump has been hesitant to advertise his plans to the enemy.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News asked whether President Trump will officially resume the combat mission that former President Obama prematurely declared over at the end of 2014, resulting in a Taliban resurgence and the Islamic State\u2019s (ISIS/ISIL) establishing a presence, but the Pentagon refused to say.\u000a\u000aAfter ending the combat mission, Obama drastically changed the rules of engagement (ROEs), taking away the U.S. military\u2019s authority to aggressively target the Afghan Taliban, forcing them to respond in self-defense only.\u000a\u000aFaced with an undeniable Taliban resurgence within a year after ending the combat mission, Obama was compelled to once again allow U.S. troops to offensively target the Taliban, rather than waiting to be shot at first, changing the rules of engagement near the end of his tenure in June 2016.\u000a\u000aSo far, the U.S. military is still fighting the Afghanistan war under the ROEs approved by Obama in June 2016, although Trump is expected to implement them differently, allowing commanders on the ground to independently make decisions faster, rather than waiting for micromanaging decisions from the White House\u000a\u000aHowever, the Trump administration has yet to implement the new Afghan strategy, meaning the Obama-era authority remains in place.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported:\u000a\u000aWhile President Barack Obama approved more aggressive airstrikes against the Taliban in 2016, Trump\u2019s new rules of engagement could allow U.S. forces to target Taliban forces faster than they have in the past and attack them even if they are not directly threatening Afghan forces, according to U.S. officials familiar with the possible changes who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the changes had not yet been authorized. The Obama-era change, dubbed \u201cstrategic effects,\u201d allowed U.S. forces to strike Taliban fighters if the airstrike would change the outcome of a ground battle. Trump\u2019s adjustments to the rules of engagement would \u2014 in short \u2014 allow American aircraft to strike the Taliban wherever they might appear.\u000a\u000aAccording to the U.S. Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency, the United States had no clue how many U.S.-funded Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) were serving alongside their American counterparts as of the end of April 2016.\u000a\u000aDespite the U.S. investing an estimated $714 billion in American taxpayer funds on security and reconstruction in corruption-laden Afghanistan since the war began in October 2001, the United States government appeared to keep Americans in the dark about what they were getting for their money as far as security troops and reconstruction projects.

aVThe communist government of China is once again imposing itself on the nation\u2019s growing religious community, passing new regulations to \u201csinicize\u201d (make more Chinese) religion to conform to Chinese communism.\u000a\u000aAn article in the nation\u2019s government-run Global Times newspaper Thursday announced the new regulations as if they were the result of an agreement between leaders of all faiths. The Chinese government officially allows only five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Christianity (identified as a separate religion from Catholicism). \u201cLeaders of China\u2019s five main religious groups have agreed Wednesday to sinicize their religions by integrating religious doctrines into Chinese culture,\u201d the article proclaims, praising government-approved religious leaders for embracing the new reforms.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe article quotes Fu Xianwei, the head of China\u2019s \u201cThree-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches,\u201d as approving of the integration of religion into \u201cChinese culture.\u201d \u201cTheology shall reflect Chinese culture,\u201d Fu is quoted as saying.\u000a\u000aThe Global Times also cites an Islamic leader\u2014\u201dMu Kefa, the deputy chairman of the China Islamic Association\u201d\u2014who approves of reforming Islam into a more Chinese religion. \u201cOnly by sinicizing religion can Islam be prosperous and healthy,\u201d Mu says in the article.\u000a\u000aThe newspaper does not define what \u201csinicizing\u201d is or would look like for the nation\u2019s religious communities. President Xi Jinping has placed a strong emphasis on Chinese nationalism during his tenure and under his leadership, the Communist Party has repeatedly attempted to reform various parts of society with \u201cChinese characteristics.\u201d Beijing\u2019s rampant human rights violations are merely human rights \u201cwith Chinese characteristics.\u201d A communist dictatorship is \u201cdemocracy with Chinese characteristics.\u201d A communist dictatorship that allows for business ownership for cronies within the party is \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\u000a\u000aReligion \u201cwith Chinese characteristics,\u201d then, may likely be religion that promotes the well-being of the elites in power. According to a Reuters report published Thursday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang adopted new regulations reportedly meant to curb the spread of religious extremism in the country. \u201cReligious affairs maintenance should persist in a principle of maintaining legality, curbing illegality, blocking extremism, resisting infiltration and attacking crime,\u201d according to the text of the new regulation.\u000a\u000aBeijing appears particularly concerned with Islam, due to the presence of Islamic extremist movements in western Xinjiang province, and Christianity, which has seen a rapid surge in popularity and fueled human rights and anti-communist movements across the country.\u000a\u000aChina has passed significant legislation to contain both religions in the past year. A year ago, the Chinese Communist Party passed laws to reform early education, encouraging students to tell government officials if their parents or neighbors introduce them to any religious content. China also uses building and zoning regulations to prevent Christians from building new churches and to demolish old ones, as well as aggressively targeting \u201chouse churches,\u201d underground Bible study groups where clergy do not have to use pro-government sermons or encourage support for Xi.\u000a\u000aIn April, Chinese officials ordered the installation of security cameras in churches to ensure they could monitor Christians during their worship activities.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

aVCap-Haïtien (Haiti) (AFP) \u2013 Hurricane Irma ripped through the Caribbean on Friday, leaving a trail of devastation and killing 17 as it barrelled towards the United States where up to a million people have been told to flee.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aSo far, 1.2 million people have been affected by Irma, the Red Cross said.\u000a\u000aBut that number looks set to rise \u2014 and could reach as high as 26 million, the agency said.\u000a\u000aWith the monster storm expected to reach the American south by the weekend, coastal areas of Florida and Georgia were battening down the hatches and carrying out their biggest evacuation since 2005.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention,\u201d warned US federal emergency chief Brock Long. \u201cIt will be truly devastating.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoaring across the Caribbean, the rare Category Five hurricane laid waste to a series of tiny islands like St Martin, where 60 percent of homes were wrecked, before slamming into the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aBy Friday morning, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) had downgraded Irma to Category Four with maximum wind speeds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 kilometres per hour) while warning it was still extremely dangerous.\u000a\u000aOn many islands, violent winds have ripped roofs and facades off buildings, hurling lumps of concrete, cars and even shipping containers aside.\u000a\u000a\u2013 Death and destruction \u2013\u000a\u000aAt least two people were killed in Puerto Rico, and more than half of its three million residents were without power after rivers broke their banks in the center and north of the island.\u000a\u000aAnother four people were killed on the US Virgin Islands, with the governor\u2019s office saying a number of badly injured people had been airlifted to Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aOne person died in tiny Barbuda which also suffered \u201cabsolute devastation,\u201d with 300 people evacuated to Antigua and up to 30 percent of properties demolished.\u000a\u000aSt Martin, a pristine island resort divided between France and the Netherlands, also suffered the full fury of the storm, as did the French island of St Barthelemy.\u000a\u000aFrance said at least nine people had been killed across its Caribbean territories and seven more were missing. There were 112 people injured, including two seriously, said Interior Minister Gerard Collomb.\u000a\u000aSix out of 10 homes were left uninhabitable, with insurers in Paris estimating their overall costs would likely be \u201cmuch higher\u201d than 200 million euros ($240 million).\u000a\u000aOn the Dutch side of St Martin, one person died, officials said.

aVIn a preview of Sunday\u2019s 60 Minutes interview with former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, CBS released a segment in which Bannon is asked a question by Charlie Rose that no one in the media ever asks pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion Democrats.\u000a\u000aBannon was asked to reconcile his Catholic faith with those political beliefs in opposition to the church. In this case, it was about the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) strident and, as I wrote Wednesday, hypocritical support of DACA.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTranscript courtesy of CBS News:\u000a\u000aRose: Can I remind you, a good Catholic, that Cardinal [Timothy] Dolan is opposed to what\u2019s happened with DACA? Cardinal Dolan. Bannon: The Catholic Church has been terrible about this. \u2026 The bishops have been terrible about this \u2026 Because [they\u2019re] unable to really come to grips with the problems in the church, they need illegal aliens, they need illegal aliens to fill the churches. \u2026 They have \u2013 they have an economic interest. They have an economic interest in unlimited immigration, unlimited illegal immigration. Rose: Boy, that\u2019s a tough thing to say about your church. Bannon: As much as I respect Cardinal Dolan and the bishops on doctrine, this is not doctrine.\u000a\u000aIn response, the UCSSB quickly released a statement that is even more absurd than the original one:\u000a\u000aResponse from U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on Care for Migrants and Refugees: pic.twitter.com/orZPuCGf3b \u2014 US Catholic Bishops (@USCCB) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000a\u2014\u000a\u000aAs you can see, a whole lot of scripture is quoted, but there is absolutely nothing quoted about how Jesus said it was okay to burden others with your personal religious and political beliefs, which is exactly what the legalizing of illegal immigration does. In other words\u2026\u000a\u000aSorry, but I fail to see the Christian or Catholic compassion here.\u000a\u000aIt is very easy to call for the legalizing of 800,000 or two million or 11 million or 25 million illegal immigrants when you will only personally benefit from these policies, both through fuller pews and the love of the mainstream media. The problem with this thinking is that it shows ZERO compassion for the victims of this sort of immigration policy \u2014 you know, those who lose their jobs to illegals, those whose wages are lowered by a flood of cheap labor, those whose children cannot get a decent education due to classrooms burdened with illegal children who cannot speak English. Good heavens, where to begin with the wave of crime these illegals have brought with them?\u000a\u000aAnd do you want to know who disproportionately suffers the negative and sometime tragic consequences of all this Catholic compassion?\u000a\u000aThe poor.\u000a\u000aThe working poor.\u000a\u000aAnd this includes legal immigrants trying to get their lives jump-started.\u000a\u000aThe already-disenfranchised in America, the struggling working class, those who follow the rules, they are the ones disproportionately damaged by legalizing and incentivizing illegal immigration. And isn\u2019t it interesting how the advocates of these policies always seem to be above it all, above the consequences of their own advocacy \u2013 how they never seem to be in the demographic that takes it in the neck because a bunch of do-gooders are doing good at someone else\u2019s expense.\u000a\u000aDid Jesus not tell us to do unto others as you would have them do unto you?\u000a\u000aPlease explain to me, then, exactly who would want the very real world consequences of legalizing illegal immigration \u201cdone to them,\u201d and why are my Catholic leaders (I am a practicing Catholic) doing this \u201cto others?\u201d\u000a\u000aI am all in favor of treating illegal immigrants with compassion and mercy. I am all in favor of feeding those who are hungry, clothing those who are naked, offering medical help to those who are sick or injured. But as a good Catholic and Christian who cares about the poor, I am most certainly not in favor of using whatever influence I have on public opinion to virtue-signal at the expense of my neighbor\u2019s job, wages, education, or safety.\u000a\u000aIt simply is not compassion on your part when others pay the price for this so-called compassion.\u000a\u000aWhy not do both? Why not show mercy for the migrant without hurting an innocent person? Because it is certainly within the teachings of Jesus to welcome, feed, clothe, and show compassion to those as we repatriate them back into their own country.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m sorry, but calling for anything else is selfish, is vain, is screwing your neighbor, and is a violation of Christ\u2019s teachings.\u000a\u000aFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

aVViktor Orbán, Hungary\u2019s redoubtable Prime Minister, has made it clear that Hungary has no intention of caving into pressures from the European Union (EU) to become an \u201cimmigrant country,\u201d in a new letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.\u000a\u000aIn his September 6 letter, Orbán tells Mr. Juncker that unlike other European nations, \u201cHungary is not an immigrant country, does not want to become an immigrant country and cannot accept being forced to change this.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhereas other European nations have become immigrant countries due to obligations stemming from their colonial legacy, Hungary \u201chas no colonial past\u201d and thus feels no such obligation toward nations it has tried to dominate, he said.\u000a\u000aFrance, for example, held territories in enormous geographical areas throughout Africa comprising over a dozen countries. Some of their local currencies are still directly linked to the French Central Bank.\u000a\u000aIn his letter, Orbán takes issue with Juncker\u2019s definition of solidarity, saying that the transformation of Hungary into an immigrant country against the will of Hungarian citizens, \u201cis not solidarity\u201d but \u201cviolence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prime minister also expressed his consternation with the European Commission\u2019s unwillingness to aid Hungary in defending Europe\u2019s borders.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was stunned and puzzled to read that you and the European Commission refuse to provide funds for the fence,\u201d Orbán writes. \u201cI am convinced that those who do not support the fence cannot and do not want to protect the citizens of the European Union.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Orbán went on to question the effectiveness of current immigration strategies of the EU, suggesting that present policies seem aimed at encouraging mass migration rather than reducing it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf instead of defending our borders, the European Commission is willing to finance solely measures and organisations that aim to facilitate the admission of migrants, then we will only give incentives to hundreds of thousands of migrants who wish to move to Europe, instead of curbing migration,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aEarlier this summer, the prime minister asserted that the EU has adopted migration plans drafted by left-wing billionaire George Soros to bring in a million migrants per year, which militates against Europe\u2019s best interests. Soros has proposed the creation of an EU immigration authority to remove the responsibility for immigration from individual EU Member States, he said.\u000a\u000aNot long afterward, Italian media exposed a Soros-sponsored \u201cImmigration Network\u201d in Italy by tracing the provenance of pro-immigration funding back to dozens of organizations financed by Soros\u2019 Open Society. Journalist Luca Donadel uncovered direct ties to Soros money in a web of 41 different groups linked to immigration.\u000a\u000aAccording to Orbán, many European leaders agree with Hungary\u2019s policy on migration but are afraid to say so publicly.\u000a\u000aHe also said that due to the recent surge of migration into Italy, the southern European nation may soon join Hungary and others in looking to secure their national borders.\u000a\u000aFollow Thomas D.

The priorities discussed were tax reform, the FY-18 budget, funding for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, raising the debt ceiling and the continuing resolution to keep the government funded. The President looks forward to working together with Congress on bipartisan solutions to improve the lives of all Americans.\u000a\u000aWhile the House has passed a rollback of some provisions of Obamacare, the Senate has failed to pass the House bill or a bill of its own. Some pushed the idea that if the Senate could pass some form of Obamacare repeal, the two chambers of congress could work in conference to agree on a version of Obamacare repeal.\u000a\u000aNotably absent from the list of items the official mentioned was the repeal of Obamacare. Trump took a very active role in overseeing the passage of the Obamacare rollback bill in the House, having made many of the appeals to members himself. Vice President Mike Pence held frequent meetings on the Hill, working towards passage of a bill. Members of the House Freedom Caucus were also instrumental in negotiating provisions of the bill that finally secured its passage.\u000a\u000aIt is not clear if funding for the southern border wall was explicitly discussed in Thursday evening\u2019s meeting between Trump and Ryan.\u000a\u000aRyan has faced increasing pressure from members of his own party to make real progress on conservative issues.

aVAn open borders organization funded by globalist billionaire George Soros is demanding that House and Senate Democrats attach amnesty for illegal aliens to \u201cevery single\u201d piece of legislation moving over the next six months.\u000a\u000aAfter President Trump\u2019s administration announced it would be ultimately ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program giving temporary amnesty to nearly 800,000 illegal aliens, Trump sat down with House and Senate Democrats to strike a deal on an unrelated issue, leaving the open borders lobby fuming.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn a news release by the Soros-funded United We Dream organization, Advocacy Director Greisa Martinez, along with Kamal Essaheb of the National Immigration Law Center and Angel Padilla with the Indivisible Project, demanded Democrats force a vote on the DREAM Act, which would give amnesty to all illegal aliens covered by DACA.\u000a\u000aThe open borders activists said:\u000a\u000aTime and time again, Democratic leaders tell immigrants that relief from deportation would come someday down the road \u2014 and that someday never comes. We are tired of waiting. That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on Democrats to attach the Dream Act \u2013 without dangerous enforcement add-ons \u2013 to every single must-pass bill, without delay. Immigrants and progressive activists are doing our part to protect immigrant young people \u2013 it is time that you do yours.\u000a\u000aUnited We Dream also laid into Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for meeting with Trump and striking a deal with him that did not include amnesty for DACA recipients.\u000a\u000aToday, Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi celebrated a political win: they got Trump to side with them instead of Republicans on must-pass September bills,\u201d the open borders activists said. \u201cTheir deal with Trump just one day after he killed the DACA program is not consistent with the commitment they made to immigrant youth to do everything they could to protect them. When the lives of 800,000 immigrant youth are on the line, it is no time for political games. Following Trump\u2019s decision to eliminate the DACA program, Democrats had a rare opportunity to force congressional action on the Dream Act to protect immigrant youth. They had the leverage of a packed September agenda, full of must-pass bills and momentum of an activated grassroots base that is doing their part to fight for immigrants targeted by Trump. The world\u2019s attention is focused on DACA and public sympathy for the many young immigrants whose worst fears had been realized is at an all time high. And yet Democratic leaders Schumer and Pelosi instead chose to make a deal with Trump, with a vague promise of action on the Dream Act down the road.\u000a\u000aUnited We Dream is funded by a slew of social justice and open borders organizations, including Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation, which grants money to a number of pro-migration groups, like the Center for Popular Democracy.\u000a\u000aIn July, the Soros-funded organization began lobbying members of the Republican establishment to put forward legislation that would grant amnesty and potentially a pathway to citizenship for the 800,000 illegal aliens currently protected by DACA, as Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aMore than a week after beginning their lobbying efforts, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) announced they would be resurrecting the infamously failed DREAM Act that does exactly what the Soros-funded group had been demanding, as Breitbart Texas reported.

aVLong-time pro-mass immigration billionaires Charles and David Koch became the latest force to pressure congressional Republicans to nullify the end of DACA with a legislative amnesty Thursday.\u000a\u000aKoch spokespeople told the Daily Beast that the brothers\u2019 vast, ostensibly conservative and libertarian political empire will be brought to bear on Republican legislators. The Kochs will throw their weight behind the growing effort to force a two-house GOP majority that has refused to pass either funding for the southern border wall or the RAISE Act, a key nationalist immigration reform, to quickly pass an amnesty for those who were once exempted from federal immigration law under President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAs the Beast puts it, \u201cWith its formidable political and policy operation, the Koch network could provide more political cover to Republican members of Congress as they consider a replacement to the DACA program.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Koch amenability to open borders and amnesty is nothing new. For example, in 2013, the pair sponsored a Buzzfeed \u201cImmigration Summit\u201d featuring the likes of admitted illegal alien Jose Antonia Vargas and a half dozen other open borders fundamentalists with only the most token immigration restrictionist opposition. In 2016, Charles Koch compared then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s immigration proposals to \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d Even left-wing presidential candidate phenomenon Bernie Sanders came to refer to open borders as \u201ca Koch brothers proposal\u201d during his campaign for the Democratic nomination.\u000a\u000aThis year, Koch-funded groups stepped up their pro-illegal alien rhetoric. In April, the LIBRE Initiative, a Hispanic-outreach wing of the Koch political empire, launched a campaign to pressure Congress to grant driver\u2019s licenses and other government benefits to illegal aliens. In August, the same group issued a press release calling for amnesty and saying so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u201crepresent some of the best and brightest in our country.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the phased end of DACA, the group doubled down, calling for Congress to pass amnesty for illegals who violated American immigration laws when they were young. \u201cIt is more important than ever that Congress act to remove this barrier that stands between these Dreamers and their full potential,\u201d LIBRE President Daniel Garza said. \u201cIt is long overdue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Daily Beast, for its part, was uncharacteristically charitable in describing the Kochs for its DACA-replacement piece, calling them merely \u201clibertarian billionaires.\u201d In the recent past, the Beast portrayed the pair as little better than Nazi collaborators, referring to them as \u201cthe industrial interests\u201d behind \u201cmorally bankrupt Republican leadership,\u201d \u201cwho want all environmental restraints on fossil fuels destroyed\u2014just as in Nazi Germany the Krupp, Volkswagen, and I.G. Farben (later Bayer) industries saw the vast profits to be made in Hitler\u2019s war and rode with the devil all the way.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the Daily Beast points out, pro-amnesty politics are hardly unusual among America\u2019s business elite. Facebook founding billionaire Mark Zuckerberg is very much in tune with the Koch network over DACA, as is the Chamber of Commerce.\u000a\u000aWith 18 Congressional Republicans clamoring to quench the business elite\u2019s thirst for young illegal alien labor even before the end of DACA was announced, the Koch\u2019s and their ilk in that world are unlikely to have trouble finding allies in their push for amnesty.

aVWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 President Donald Trump sat down for dinner with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday night to discuss a packed list of fall legislative goals.\u000a\u000aA White House official said of the meeting:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aPresident Trump and Speaker Ryan had a productive working dinner to review the fall legislative agenda. The priorities discussed were tax reform, the FY-18 budget, funding for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, raising the debt ceiling and the continuing resolution to keep the government funded. The President looks forward to working together with Congress on bipartisan solutions to improve the lives of all Americans.\u000a\u000aWhile the House has passed a rollback of some provisions of Obamacare, the Senate has failed to pass the House bill or a bill of its own. Some pushed the idea that if the Senate could pass some form of Obamacare repeal, the two chambers of congress could work in conference to agree on a version of Obamacare repeal.\u000a\u000aNotably absent from the list of items the official mentioned was the repeal of Obamacare. Trump took a very active role in overseeing the passage of the Obamacare rollback bill in the House, having made many of the appeals to members himself. Vice President Mike Pence held frequent meetings on the Hill, working towards passage of a bill. Members of the House Freedom Caucus were also instrumental in negotiating provisions of the bill that finally secured its passage.\u000a\u000aIt is not clear if funding for the southern border wall was explicitly discussed in Thursday evening\u2019s meeting between Trump and Ryan.\u000a\u000aRyan has faced increasing pressure from members of his own party to make real progress on conservative issues. On Wednesday three members of the influential Freedom Caucus brought their concerns and a warning to Ryan that if he doesn\u2019t make that progress, his position could be in jeopardy.\u000a\u000aFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana

aVOn the Jennifer Fulwiler Show on Sirius XM\u2019s Channel 129 Thursday, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan falsely characterized Breitbart Executive Chairman Steve Bannon\u2019s comments to CBS\u2019s Charlie Rose about why Catholic bishops \u201chave been terrible\u201d in their support of the unconstitutional Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals [DACA] program President Obama enacted by fiat in 2012.\u000a\u000a\u201cI didn\u2019t hear Steve Bannon\u2019s comments this morning. Joe was kind enough to give me the transcript of it. You might imagine I was rather befuddled to see it,\u201d the New York Cardinal told Fulwiler on Thursday (beginning at the 1:33 mark of the interview, which can be heard here).\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t really care to go into what I think is a preposterous and rather insulting statement that the only reason we bishops care for immigrants is for the economic, because we want to fill our churches and get more money. That\u2019s insulting and that\u2019s just so ridiculous that it doesn\u2019t merit a comment,\u201d Dolan continued (emphasis added).\u000a\u000aBut Dolan mischaracterized Bannon\u2019s actual comments, as a look at the transcript of Bannon\u2019s interview with CBS\u2019s Charlie Rose on that topic clearly shows.\u000a\u000aBannon did not say \u201cthe only reason [Catholic] bishops care for immigrants is for the economic, because we want to fill our churches and get more money,\u201d as Dolan incorrectly asserted.\u000a\u000aBannon\u2019s actual words were: \u201cThe [Catholic] bishops have been terrible about this [DACA]. You know why? Because unable to really . . . come to grips with the problems in the church, they need illegal aliens, they need illegal aliens to fill the churches. . . They have an economic interest in unlimited immigration, unlimited illegal immigration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe statement that the Catholic Church has \u201can economic interest in unlimited immigration, unlimited illegal immigration\u201d is factually correct as it pertains to both unlimited immigration and unlimited illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aAs for the Catholic Church\u2019s economic interest in unlimited legal immigration, one need look no further than the hundreds of millions of dollars paid each year by the federal government to Catholic Charities, one of the nine leading voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) who resettle the tens of thousands of refugees who arrive in the country each year under the Refugee Admissions Program.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn FY 2015, the State Department, through the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, spent more than $1 billion on these programs, which settled international refugees \u2018vetted\u2019 by the United Nations High Commission on International Refugees in all 50 states and the District of Columbia,\u201d Breitbart News reported:\u000a\u000aMuch of this $1 billion in annual revenue goes to voluntary agencies (VOLAGs), several of which are Christian non-profits, such as Catholic Charities, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, World Relief Corporation, Church World Service, and Domestic and Foreign Missionary Service of the Episcopal Church of the USA. (also referred to as Episcopal Migration Ministries), who are contracted on behalf of the government to help these refugees get settled in their new homes in America.\u000a\u000aImmigration from Mexico and Latin America\u2013both legal and illegal\u2013has provided a needed boost in the membership of the Catholic Church, though not enough to offset the departure of native born Americans and legal immigrants from other countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cCatholics appear to be declining both as a percentage of the population and in absolute numbers. The new survey indicates there are about 51 million Catholic adults in the U.S. today, roughly 3 million fewer than in 2007,\u201d Pew Research reported in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe Catholic Church\u2019s economic interest in unlimited illegal immigration arises from the fact that the majority of the estimated 11 million illegal aliens currently living in the United States are from Mexico and other Latin American countries, which are largely Catholic, though an increasing number have left the Catholic Church for a variety of Evangelical Christian churches.\u000a\u000a\u201cNearly 790,000 young unauthorized immigrants have received work permits and deportation relief through the federal government\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program since it was created five years ago by President Barack Obama, according to the latest data released by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,\u201d Jens Manuel Krogstad wrote at Pew Research last week.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnauthorized immigrants from Mexico make up more than three-quarters of all DACA recipients. Since the program started, 78% of approved applications \u2013 both initial (618,342) and renewals (622,170) \u2013 have come from Mexicans,\u201d Krogstad noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn 2014, 5.8 million unauthorized immigrants from Mexico lived in the U.S. . . about half of the nation\u2019s 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants (52% in 2014),\u201d Pew Research reported in March.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were 11.7 million immigrants from Mexico living in the U.S. in 2014, and about half of them were in the country illegally, according to Pew Research Center estimates. Mexico is the country\u2019s largest source of immigrants, making up 28% of all U.S. immigrants,\u201d Pew Research added.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe face of Catholic America is changing. Today, immigrants make up a considerable share of Catholics, and many are Hispanic. At the same time, there has been a regional shift, from the Northeast (long home to a large percentage of the Catholic faithful) and Midwest to the Western and Southern parts of the U.S,\u201d Michael Lipka wrote at Pew Research in 2014, noting that \u201cOur research also has documented the decline of Catholics as a share of the U.S. population.\u201d\u000a\u000aCatholics are more likely than other Americans to be immigrants or children of immigrants. Indeed, more than a quarter of U.S. Catholic adults (27%) were born outside the country, compared with 15% of U.S. adults overall; most of these Catholic immigrants (22% of all U.S. Catholics) are from elsewhere in the Americas. As of 2014, an additional 15% of Catholic Americans have at least one foreign-born parent. That leaves 57% of Catholics who were born in the U.S. to two native-born parents. By comparison, nearly three-quarters (74%) of American adults overall were born in the country to two U.S.-born parents. The share of U.S. Catholics who are Hispanic has grown by 5 percentage points since 2007 (from 29% to 34%), while the percentage of all U.S. adults who are Hispanic has grown by 3 points (from 12% to 15%). And the share of Catholics who are Hispanic is likely to continue to grow; among Catholic millennials, as many are Hispanic (46%) as are white (43%).\u000a\u000aIn a report issued this week by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Changing Religous Identity: Findings from the 2016 American Values Atlas,\u201d researchers Robert P. Jones and Daniel Cox found that \u201cThe Catholic Church is experiencing an ethnic transformation. Twenty-five years ago, nearly nine in ten (87%) Catholics were white, non-Hispanic, compared to 55% today. Fewer than four in ten (36%) Catholics under the age of 30 are white, non-Hispanic; 52% are Hispanic.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor most of the past 25 years, American Catholics have been overwhelmingly white. In 1991, more than eight in ten (87%) U.S. Catholics were white, non-Hispanic.16 Today, 55% of Catholics identify as white, non-Hispanic, and more than one-third (36%) are Hispanic. Notably, much of the shift in the ethnic composition of the American Catholic community occurred over just the last couple of decades. Generational differences in the ethnic and racial make-up of American Catholics also suggest that a substantial cultural shift is underway. Fewer than four in ten (36%) Catholics under the age of 30 are white, non-Hispanic, compared to a majority (52%) who are Hispanic. In contrast, more than three-quarters (76%) of Catholic seniors (age 65 or older) are white, while only 17% are Hispanic. Demographic differences between Hispanic and white Catholics also suggest that the Hispanic Catholic community is poised to make further gains. First, Hispanic Catholics are nearly twice as likely as white Catholics to be parents of children under the age of 18 (30% vs. 16%, respectively). The discrepancy in parental status is driven largely by age differences between Hispanic Catholics and white Catholics. Second, Hispanic Catholics are more likely to have larger families: Close to three in ten (28%) Hispanic Catholic parents have at least three children under the age of 18 living at home, while 21% of white Catholic families report the same.\u000a\u000aIn his interview with CBS\u2019s Charlie Rose, Bannon then followed up with this:\u000a\u000aAs much as I respect Cardinal Dolan and the bishops on doctrine, this is not doctrine. This is not doctrine at all. I totally respect the pope and I totally respect the Catholic bishops and cardinals on doctrine. This is not about doctrine. This is about the sovereignty of a nation. And in that regard, they\u2019re just another guy with an opinion.\u000a\u000aDolan conceded that Bannon was probably correct when he stated the position of the Catholic bishops supporting the continuation of the unconstitutional DACA program was \u201cprobably not Catholic doctrine.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, rather than accepting the Constitution of the United States as the ultimate authority of law in this country, Dolan offered his particular interpretation of several phrases in the Bible as the ultimate source of jurisprudence in America.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do appreciate the attempt to clarify his [Bannon\u2019s] statement this is not an issue of Catholic doctrine and that the bishops are only giving opinion here,\u201d Dolan said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a matter of fact he may be right. It\u2019s not an issue of Catholic doctrine because it comes from the Bible itself. We Catholics are people of the book,\u201d he continued in his interview with Fulwiler:\u000a\u000aThe Bible is so clear, so clear, to treat the immigrant with dignity and respect. To make sure that society is just in its treatment of the immigrant is Biblical mandate. It\u2019s clear in the Old Testamentmy Jewish neighbors remind me of that all the time. And it\u2019s clear from the lips of Jesus when he said \u201cWhatsoever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me . . . When I was a stranger\u2013meaning an immigrant or a refugee\u2013 you welcomed me.\u201d As a matter of fact that\u2019s one of the questions he\u2019s going to ask us when we stand before him in final judgment. So,there\u2019s a moral imperative to treat the immigrant with dignity and respect that we have a sacred duty to preach.\u000a\u000aDuring his entire 17 minute interview with Fulwiler, Cardinal Dolan never mentioned the Constitution. Nor did he acknowledge that the United States of America is a sovereign country governed under a constitutional republic established in 1789 when the Constitution was ratified by two-thirds of the thirteen states.\u000a\u000aBut legal experts agree that President Obama\u2019s establishment of the DACA program was unconstitutional.\u000a\u000a\u201cDefenders of DACA are ignoring the fact that it violated two federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution. President Donald Trump was legally required to end it, and doing so helps restore the rule of law on the vitally important issue of immigration policy,\u201d Breitbart\u2019s Legal Editor Ken Klukowski noted on Tuesday:\u000a\u000aVirtually everyone who met those minimal standards [of the DACA program] was granted this deferred status, which could be renewed every two years, and received work permits to have an American job. Many of the affected individuals are now adults\u2014the average age of a so-called \u201cDREAMer\u201d is 25\u2014seeking work reauthorization to stay in this country indefinitely. Pundits can argue about the politics of DACA, and they can argue about the policy. President Trump made clear that he empathized with those who were brought here as children, and that on humanitarian and equitable grounds what to do about DACA was a difficult challenge for him. But no one should debate whether DACA is legal. The bottom line is that only Congress can make immigration law. Because DACA was a purely executive action, the program violates two federal statutes\u2014the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\u2014as well as the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\u000a\u000aMany Christians also disagree with Cardinal Dolan and the Catholic bishops when it comes to their interpretation of Biblical scriptures as they relate to illegal immigrants and the DACA program.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe agree that immigration reform and DACA are difficult subjects,\u201d Evangelicals for Biblical Immigration wrote in a September 4 letter addressed to President Trump and Speaker of the House Ryan and signed by Kelly Kulburg of the American Association of Christian Evangelicals, best selling Christian author and radio host Eric Metaxas, David Barton, Founder of Wall Buildersand several other Christian leaders.\u000a\u000a\u201cGod loves the foreigner. Indeed, God loves us all. It takes time to discern the balance of mercy and justice by which a nation survives,\u201d the letter continues:\u000a\u000aThe Church is called to serve all people, and our Government leaders are elected to defend and uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. Though there are tragic stories on every side of illegal migration, for our elected officials, responsibilty to oaths must prevail. Law and order sustain stability and peace. A nation of wise rule grows strong enough to sustain care for the vulnerable in our midst. While some faith groups use selective Bible words for open borders and amnesty, we consider the whole counsel of Scripture. We find that the Bible does not teach open borders, but wise welcome. We are to welcome the lawful foreigner, who, like a convert, comes as a blessing (eg.s Ruth and Rahab). We also find Nehemiah building walls to protect citizens from harm. In Isaih 1, we see God condemning the destruction of borders and indigenous culture.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn policy decisions ahead, while treating undocumented people kindly, we ask that you would first and foremost honor often forgotten American citizens whose families have served our nation for many generations, and the patient people who have applied lawfully to come here and to become citizens of the United States. These lives also matter. These people also dream,\u201d (emphasis added), the letter concluded.

aVCONCORD, N.H. (AP) \u2014 The annual Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac, which claims an 80 percent accuracy rate in its forecasts, predicted the possibility of a major hurricane along the Atlantic Seaboard, but didn\u2019t have the same insight about the Gulf Coast.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhen it came out a year ago, the venerable guide to weather, planting and homespun advice said the best chances for a major hurricane this year would be in the early part of September, from Florida to North Carolina. As of Friday, there were three active hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, with Hurricane Irma remaining a powerful threat to Florida. And the hurricane season still has two more months to go.\u000a\u000aAlmanac compilers in Dublin, New Hampshire, base predictions on a \u201csecret formula\u201d going back to 1792 that\u2019s influenced by sunspots, climatology and meteorology and refined by modern scientific calculations.\u000a\u000aAlmanac editor Janice Stillman said a hurricane the size and scope of Harvey would\u2019ve been difficult to forecast.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Gulf Coast was not in our direct line of sight, so to speak,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was not a named area, although, it\u2019s certainly a normal target, if you will, for hurricanes at any time.\u201d\u000a\u000aStillman said that while it is normal that hurricanes happen, Harvey was \u201cabnormal in scale, which is unpredictable by just about anybody.\u201d\u000a\u000aBelieved to be North America\u2019s oldest continuously published periodical, the almanac is not to be confused with The Farmer\u2019s Almanac based in Maine, which is in its 200th year and came out last month.\u000a\u000aThe 226th edition of the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac comes out Tuesday, with predictions for 2018.\u000a\u000aAlthough scientists don\u2019t trust its unconventional weather formula, it\u2019s still a tradition that remains popular with loyal readers. The almanac, founded by Robert B. Thomas, prints 3 million copies a year, and has 1.5 million Facebook followers. It also produces garden guides, newsletters, cookbooks as well as a special almanac for children every two years.\u000a\u000aAmong its articles this year are 33 \u201cstellar\u201d moments in time, little-known facts about parsley, and a salute to chiffons, such as the fabric, the singing group, and the baked goods. Trends getting attention include stylists re-creating hairstyles of ancient Romans, real estate agents using neighborhood \u201cwalk scores\u201d to sell houses, and \u201cdoga\u201d class \u2014 for dogs doing yoga with their owners.\u000a\u000aAlmanac reader Kate Bowen, 35, of Putney, Vermont, is among a group of farmers profiled in its main article on the growing number of ethnically, racially and culturally diverse farmers in the United States.\u000a\u000aBowen, who with her husband expanded the farm from just selling forest products to raising livestock, is an advocate for protecting farms, helping veterans on the farm, and getting a fair price for food.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve actually always loved the almanac and we\u2019ve always had a copy around our farm and found it interesting, especially the stuff about the moon cycles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always enjoyed hoping for a lot of snow.\u201d\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aOnline:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.almanac.com/

He said:\u000a\u000aIt is going to open up a whole new category of people who could get legal status, namely their parents who violated the law by bringing them here, and it\u2019s going to encourage other people to bring their children across the border in the future, which is a very dangerous thing to do \u2026 You really can\u2019t dispute, just as a logical matter if we give legal status to these people in their 20s and 30s, that it is going to encourage more illegal immigration and it wil open up legal status for the very people that violated the law \u2026 we should have an open, common sense discussion about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe nation of 320 million Americans already includes a population of at least 11 million illegals, many of whom are former temporary workers and tourists who overstay their visas.\u000a\u000aThe same amnesty-invites-illegals point was made by Dan Horowitz, the editor of Conservative Review:\u000a\u000aThe 2014 border surge as a result of #DACA should have ended any debate for amnesty https://t.co/5PjPzzaJVj pic.twitter.com/2ox1580nfI \u2014 Daniel Horowitz (@RMConservative) September 5, 2017\u000a\u000aMickey Kaus, a left-winger who oppose cheap-labor immigration, makes the same point:\u000a\u000aGreen cards 4 children who've been smuggled is "surest way to guarantee a never-ending supply" of smuggled children https://t.co/hK6Lz7lTbW \u2014 Mickey Kaus (@kausmickey) September 5, 2017\u000a\u000aCotton told CBS that he\u2019s working with President Donald Trump to combine his RAISE Act merit immigration reform, plus tighter border enforcement, to any revival of the DACA amnesty which now provides work permits to 800,000 younger illegals. Cotton also wants to include some form of mandatory \u201cemployment verification\u201d legislation to deter companies from hiring illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aThe RAISE Act, in cooperation with improved border enforcement and better oversight of employers\u2019 hiring, is intended to offset the economic damage caused by mass immigration of low-skilled foreigners into U.S. society. Unsurprisingly, polls show the public strongly favors the provisions in the RAISE Act.\u000a\u000aAmnesty Will Cost Americans Hundreds of Billions of Dollars\u000a\u000aFormer President Barack Obama\u2019s DACA amnesty covers 800,000 younger illegals, but there are another 1.1 million younger illegals who might try to claim the same DACA status, as they grow older or return to school to get a High School qualification.\u000a\u000aAdd in their illegal-immigrant parents, and the number of people who gain from a formal DACA amnesty could reach 2.5 million. Once the 2.5 million gain citizenship, they can petition to bring in yet more relatives, most of whom will be unskilled and also dependent on the Democratic party\u2019s welfare policies.\u000a\u000aThe direct cost of mass immigration has been gauged by Robert Rector at the Heritage Foundation. For example, he recently calculated a $1 trillion taxpayer-saving for cutting the annual inflow of unskilled migrants by roughly 50 percent or by 5 million people per decade.\u000a\u000aA back-of-the-envelope calculation based on Rector\u2019s data suggests that the cost of providing an amnesty to Obama\u2019s young illegals \u2014 plus their lower-skilled peers and parents \u2014 will add up to $500 billion over the next 75 years.\u000a\u000aUnskilled immigrants \u2013 both illegal and legal \u2014 cost taxpayers much money because the taxes that they can pay into the state, local and federal treasuries are far below the benefits they do receive in the form of education, health care, retirement and income support. The details are included in the September 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, which also showed that recent immigrants are failing to integrate into the United States\u2019 society.\u000a\u000aThat Washington-imposed policy of mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families.\u000a\u000aThose problems are echoed in nation\u2019s increasingly turbulent politics, which featured the unprecedented election of a New York real-estate developer to the White House in 2016 because of his popular opposition to the mass-immigration policies favored by the business and political establishment.\u000a\u000aRector\u2019s calculations do not include the hidden cost of companies\u2019 continued reliance on cheap imported labor instead of new, labor-saving machinery. In contrast to the United States, both Japan and China have national economic policies that oppose immigration and instead favor increased automation and robotics \u2014 and they have growing economies and rising per-person productivity and income.\u000a\u000aUnder current rules, 4 million young Americans enter the workforce each year to search for decent jobs. But each year, the government also hands out 1 million green cards to new immigrants who compete against Americans for good jobs.\u000a\u000aThe government also hands out almost 3 million short-term work permits to foreign workers. These permits include roughly 330,000 one-year OPT permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, roughly 200,000 three-year H-1B visas for foreign white-collar professionals, and 400,000 two-year permits to DACA illegals.\u000a\u000aUnderstandably, business groups strongly favor high levels of immigration because the taxpayers\u2019 huge costs become business revenues once the immigrants buy food, lodging, transport services, and education services. The immigrants also provide federally subsidized labor for new business operations, so reducing pressure on companies to hire labor-saving, American-made machinery, such as crop-picking robots.\u000a\u000aAmnesty Will Push the GOP Towards Extinction\u000a\u000aAny amnesty for the younger illegals damages the GOP\u2019s support among the millions of ordinary Americans voters who backed Trump in 2016 because he promised a reform that would benefit Americans, not illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aEnding DACA now gives chance 2 restore Rule of Law. Delaying so R Leadership can push Amnesty is Republican suicide. https://t.co/iYOLxFWp7V \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) September 4, 2017\u000a\u000aThe damage would be greater if the GOP also failed to push through other GOP priorities, such as a reform of the failing Obamacare government-run medical system.\u000a\u000aIf GOP congress fixes DACA but doesn't repeal/replace Obamacare\u2026 hoo boy. Big chunk of GOP voters are going to be mad as hell. https://t.co/DTMBOekYty \u2014 Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) September 4, 2017\u000a\u000aIt would also contradict Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d inauguration slogan, damaging his influence in 2018 and his reelections chances in 2020.\u000a\u000aIf President Trump wants to put America first\u2026 he will end DACA and work for the passage of the #RAISEAct https://t.co/QhRn0PflrP \u2014 NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) September 5, 2017\u000a\u000aThe public wants to be nice to the young illegals, but polls show that voters strongly prefer immigration policies that help Americans and their children earn a good living in an increasingly turbulent, globalizing economy. That preferences deeply shaped the GOP primaries and the 2016 election, much to the advantage of Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aAlready, multiple business groups admit that Trump\u2019s popular RAISE Act immigration and economic reform would raise Americans\u2019 salaries. Higher salaries allow people to buy houses, get married and create families \u2014 all of which tend to nudge them towards voting GOP.\u000a\u000aThe mass immigration of mostly unskilled government-dependent migrants is also gradually expanding Democratic power throughout the nation. This process is most clear in California, where pro-immigration Democrats now hold all state-wide elected offices. That huge advantage is also helping Democrats move step-by-step towards federal dominance. Democrats now hope to use expanding Latino populations in Florida and Texas to gain political dominance in those two states, so ending GOP hopes of winning presidential elections.\u000a\u000aThere is little or no evidence that the DACA illegals \u2014 or their future children \u2014 will vote Republican. In contrast, there is much evidence that some DACA youths are more loyal to their foreign families than they are to the Americans whom they want to live with.\u000a\u000aLate in the game, and only after the rise of Donald Trump, GOP leaders now seem to be slowly recognizing how their decades-long deference to their cheap-labor business allies is wrecking their party\u2019s future. This week, multiple GOP leaders have said they oppose a no-strings DACA and prefer some sort of package deal that helps Americans \u2014 perhaps the RAISE act which is being pushed by Trump, Cotton, and Georgia Sen. David Perdue.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot repeat the mistakes of the past with a comprehensive immigration bill that does not work,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cThe RAISE Act\u2019s changes to our legal immigration system should be part of the solution.\u201d\u000a\u000aGeorgia\u2019s other GOP Senator, Sen. Johnny Isackson, added: \u201cCongress should protect these young people while also working toward stronger measures to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws going forward.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe bottom line of it is, I don\u2019t think DACA as a clean bill can get through the Congress by itself,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the judiciary committee. The dispute is an \u201copportunity for compromise between people that want DACA plus a lot of other things dealing with legal immigration, and I suppose even some things dealing with illegal immigration, that can probably be packaged together.\u201d\u000a\u000aSen. Mitch McConnell, the GOP\u2019s leader in the Senate, pushed the same package approach; \u201cPresident Obama wrongly believed he had the authority to re-write our immigration law. Today\u2019s action by President Trump corrects that fundamental mistake \u2026 This Congress will continue working on securing our border and ensuring a lawful system of immigration that works.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will not be advancing legislation that doesn\u2019t have the support of President Trump because we are going to work with the president on how to do this legislation,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday. \u201cThe president also gave us the time and space we\u2019re going to need to find where that [immigration] compromise is,\u201d said Ryan who has a long history of pushing business-boosting cheap-labor immigration policies.

aVSouth Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has warned that North Korea may be planning to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Saturday, the latest in a series of increasingly belligerent military actions that culminated in the nation\u2019s sixth and most powerful nuclear test last weekend.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome believe North Korea may launch another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on the 9th; this time at an ordinary angle,\u201d Lee reportedly said on Thursday, according to CNN. \u201cA special measure is urgently needed to stop their recklessness.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe report follows a similar one from South Korean intelligence published this week in the nation\u2019s Asia Business Daily, which cited an unnamed intelligence official claiming there was evidence that Pyongyang was planning yet another ICBM test. According to Reuters, the report claimed that South Korean officials had spotted a rocket being moved towards its launch facilities, indicating it may be planning to test its capabilities. Reuters notes that South Korea\u2019s defense ministry did not confirm the report in Asia Business Daily, which takes on heightened significance given Lee\u2019s comments Thursday.\u000a\u000aSuch an ICBM test would follow the testing of a bomb Pyongyang claimed in its official state media was a hydrogen fusion bomb, a weapon the state newspaper Rodong Sinmun called \u201cperfect\u201d and caused an earthquake the United States Geological Survey rated a 6.3 magnitude. North Korea has threatened to reduce South Korea to \u201cashes\u201d in its state media since the test, calling its leaders \u201cgangsters\u201d and warning, \u201cIf we fire, they will die. This is the inescapable fate of the puppet warmongers.\u201d\u000a\u000aCommunist dictator Kim Jong-un, both in quotes and through state media, has threatened to attack the United States with a nuclear weapon once the nation\u2019s program is fully developed. While North Korea appeared to possess both nuclear warheads and ICBMs, the program appears to be struggling to miniaturize a warhead so that it fits onto an ICBM and has the reach necessary to strike the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aSeoul has already begun preparing for the possibility of such a missile targeting South Korean territory, with the government abruptly announcing that it had allowed the installation of new launchers, part of the U.S.-provided Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system. President Moon Jae-in, a leftist, had vocally opposed the installation of new THAAD launchers in the country, as neighboring countries like China and Russia have opposed the THAAD system arguing that its extensive reach deep into their territories proved it was not meant to defend from only North Korea.\u000a\u000aSeoul\u2019s defense ministry nonetheless confirmed Thursday that it had approved the installation of four more THAAD launchers, according to South Korea\u2019s Joongang Daily. The ministry insisted the installation was \u201ctemporary\u201d and necessary to prevent the possibility of civilian death should North Korea fire. \u201cWith the deployment of the four launchers, the U.S. military secured the field operation capability of one Thaad battery. We will make necessary preparations to use the capability as soon as the internal procedures are completed on the U.S. side,\u201d defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told reporters Thursday.

aVUC Santa Cruz Professor Elizabeth Stephens, a pioneer in the \u201cecosexual\u201d movement, is encouraging the public to engage in environmentalism by having sex with the Earth.\u000a\u000aStephens, the Chair of the Art Department at UC Santa Cruz, a public university, first garnered public attention four years ago with the release of her documentary Ecosexual Love Story, in which she and others licked trees, rolled around in mud, and engaged in vaguely sexual acts with elements of nature.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aStephens is still promoting her brand of ecosexuality.

We are aquaphiles, teraphiles, pyrophiles and aerophiles. We shamelessly hug trees, massage the earth with our feet and talk erotically to plants. We are skinny dippers, sun worshippers, and stargazers. We caress rocks, are pleasured by waterfalls, and admire the Earth\u2019s curves often. We make love with the Earth through our senses. We celebrate our E-spots. We are very dirty.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an email to The College Fix, Stephens says she her experience with ecosexuality grew out of her childhood in West Virginia.\u000a\u000a\u201cI grew up around farmers, hunters, fishermen and miners. They all loved the earth and in fact, their health and livelihoods depended on loving the earth,\u201d she wrote.\u000a\u000a\u201cEcosexual art is an art project,\u201d she finished. \u201cIt really depends on the audiences\u2019 reception as to whether it is cultural or political form of art. \u2026 An ecosexual is someone who loves the earth.\u201d

Mike McCaul has emerged as a leading candidate in the White House\u2019s search for a homeland security secretary, according to three people familiar with the conversations.\u000a\u000aThe report provides no information about whether McCaul is a serious candidate, of if the \u201cthree people\u201d are merely McCaul\u2019s aides. This is McCaul\u2019s second run for the job, which he lost to retired Marine Corp General John Kelly in December 2016. But Politico reported that McCaul really wants the job:\u000a\u000aMcCaul worked with the White House on its response to Hurricane Harvey, which affected parts of his district, and greeted the president on the tarmac when he touched down in Texas last weekend.

That inflow was scorched by President Donald Trump during his campaign. In a September 2016 economics speech, Trump declared that \u201cevery policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?\u201d\u000a\u000aOnce Trump was elected, McCaul edited his speeches to include a few references to Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire\u201d American policies.\u000a\u000aIn February 2014, McCaul even endorsed a doomed proposal by then-House Speaker John Boehner which would have amnestied 11 million illegals. The proposal tried to hide the very unpopular amnesty under a barrage of poll-tested nouns and adjectives, saying:\u000a\u000aThese persons could live legally and without fear in the U.S., but only if they were willing to admit their culpability, pass rigorous background checks, pay significant fines and back taxes, develop proficiency in English and American civics, and be able to support themselves and their families (without access to public benefits).\u000a\u000aMcCaul also has shown very little interest in Trump\u2019s top border priority \u2014 fulfilling his promise to build a wall along the southern border. In fact, McCaul pushed a 2015 border security bill, grandly titled \u201cSecure Our Border First Act of 2015\u201d which approved the construction of 27 extra miles of double-fencing along the 2,000-mile border. The bill also called for the removal and upgrade of 66 miles of older fencing instead of just adding 66 miles of new fencing further along the border.\u000a\u000aThat bill was so weak that it was publicly denounced by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee.\u000a\u000aThanks to house of Rep not moving ahead w BorderSecurity bill. It wld not secure border. Now House has time to marry that w Judiciary bill \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 27, 2015\u000a\u000aA 2013 border bill drafted by McCaul was so lax that it was embraced by Democrats. The do-nothing bill, according to a credulous article in the Washington Post:\u000a\u000adoesn\u2019t set an exact price or timeline or mandate a certain number of hires. Instead, it instructs the Department of Homeland Security to write a plan that could ensure the apprehension of 90 percent of illegal border-crossers in high-traffic areas within 33 months and across the entire southern border within five years. The measure directs the department to find ways to deploy existing U.S. military radar, cameras and unmanned aerial drones used recently in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress would need to review and approve the plan before appropriating any money. Detailed decisions about equipment, manpower and suggested costs would be left to career Homeland Security officials, who would consult with border-state governors and government experts who track security and immigration flows. The independent, nonpartisan Government Accountability Office would be required to assess the proposed strategy and report back to Congress on its implementation.\u000a\u000aMcCaul\u2019s lack of attention to the interests of American employees was made clear in McCaul\u2019s 2015 State of Homeland Security Address. His speech was overwhelmingly focused on the threat of \u201cterror\u201d \u2014 which was mentioned 54 times in the 2015 speech \u2014 but his text did not include any mention of the words that won the election for Trump \u2014 \u201cwall,\u201d \u201cfence,\u201d \u201cworker,\u201d \u201cemployee,\u201d \u201cjob,\u201d \u201cwage,\u201d or \u201csalary.\u201d The speech did not even use the words \u201cimmigration,\u201d \u201cillegal,\u201d or \u201calien.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn November 2012, McCaul called for a law to help companies import more foreign workers instead of hiring American workers. \u201cI think we can have immigration reform,\u201d McCaul told the Texas Tribune. \u201cSome policies we\u2019ve advocated with, for instance, is doing away with the lottery and increasing the cap on high-skilled worker visas.\u201d Currently, the U.S. government offers temporary work-permits to more than 2 million foreigners each year, sharply reducing pressure on Americans companies to recruit, train and pay the four million younger Americans who enter the job market each year.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, McCaul said white-collar outsourcing is needed because \u201cthe fact is that there\u2019s not an interest\u201d among Americans in high-tech training.\u000a\u000aMcCaul defended record at a press event in November. \u201cTo say somehow I am not strong on immigration is laughable because, whether it is sanctuary cities to every vote on the floor of the House, I have strongly voted against illegal immigration,\u201d he said, according to the Washington Times. \u201cI have co-sponsored virtually every bill. I introduced the SAFE Act, which would stop the flow of Syrian refugees into this country. I also strongly support the Secure Fence Act,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMcCaul\u2019s record on Islamic infiltration also clashes with Trump\u2019s plans to protect the nation from immigrants whose \u201chostile attitudes\u201d should prevent them from integrating into Americans\u2019 society.\u000a\u000aMcCaul\u2019s policy has been so focused on external threats that McCaul found himself in 2013 shaking hands with a U.S.-based Islamic political advocate who had declared Muslims were above the law of the land. The activist\u2019s name is Mustafaa Carroll, and he was a member of a national Islamic group. The Texas Tribune reported:\u000a\u000a\u201cFollowing the law of the land is part of Sharia,\u201d Carroll said, according to the video. \u201cAnd we follow the law of the land. In fact, Muslims, if we\u2019re practicing Muslims, we are above the law of the land. The law doesn\u2019t affect us at all.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCaul signed the photograph with a statement saying \u201cthe moderate Muslim is our most effective weapon.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite that experience, McCaul still supported the \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d policy set by the former President Barack Obama. That policy failed because it did what it sought to do \u2014 delegate some counter-intelligence roles to explicitly Islamic political groups instead of to government officials, police officers, and Americans.\u000a\u000aIn March 2016, McCaul overtly endorsed Obama\u2019s tacit alliance with U.S-based Islamic religious groups, many of which share overlapping umbrella networks that are exempt from normal FBI anti-terror monitoring. \u201cThe effective thing is \u2026 effective outreach to the Muslim community, so you can pull the religious leaders really on to our team, if you will, to protect us from radicalization from within those communities,\u201d he said March 27. \u201cI think we can get good intelligence from the Muslim communities in our outreach efforts, in our working with the religious leaders in the communities in the United States,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, candidate Trump has called for more oversight over the Islamic networks. \u201cWe have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we don\u2019t solve it, it\u2019s going to eat our country alive,\u201d he said during his June 15 campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s first pick to run the DHS, Gen. John Kelly, implemented Trump\u2019s skeptical policy. In July, Kelly excluded Islamic political groups from some DHS programs.\u000a\u000aObama\u2019s McCaul-backed CVE plan failed, in large part, because Islamic political activists did not want to do what they were asked, and instead kept raising their demands in negotiations with Obama\u2019s deputies. For example, some Islamic advocates demanded the FBI stay out of Muslim neighborhoods. Many activists also refused to admit the role of Islamic texts in motivating Islamic believers to launch Islamic jihad attacks, despite the repeated use of Islamic texts by U.S-based Islamic clerics to urge Islamic attacks.\u000a\u000aIn December, Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA, an immigration reform group, said:\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s our whole problem. Mike McCaul is completely focused on terrorism, which is a tiny but important slice of the immigration problem, and a tiny slice of what Trump campaigned on. But the idea that you could just drop someone into the most important immigration slot in our government and expect them to push Trump\u2019s agenda is just fantasy.\u000a\u000aIn November 2016, as McCaul was trying to land the DHS job, he was publicly backed Johnson. \u201cOn his behalf, I don\u2019t know anybody who is stronger on border security in Congress that I have dealt with,\u201d Johnson told an audience at the business-funded Bipartisan Policy Center.\u000a\u000aThat praise \u201cshould be the kiss of death in the Trump administration,\u201d Jessica Vaughan, the policy director at the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. It \u201csignals that in Johnson\u2019s estimation, McCaul is not likely to carry out the [pro-American] policies Trump won on.\u201d

aV\u201cWords, words, words, I\u2019m so sick of words, is that all you blighters can do?\u201d Eliza Doolittle asked in My Fair Lady.\u000a\u000aPro-life voters ask the same of Republican leaders in Congress. We helped elect a pro-life President, a pro-life House and a pro-life Senate and who is smiling right now? Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood. How can that be?\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhile many important pro-life legislative initiatives face the hurdle of requiring a super majority to avoid a filibuster in the Senate, it only takes a simple majority to stop taxpayer subsidies to Planned Parenthood through a Budget Reconciliation bill which cannot be filibustered. Yet, after eight months in power, GOP leaders have failed to defund Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000aPro-life voters and activists have worked long and hard for this moment of possibility. We have proved that opposing abortion is not only the right thing, it is a winning issue. Even Democrats are now admitting they cannot carve a national majority without pro-life voters. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, admitted Democrats need prolife voters to forge a winning majority.\u000a\u000aThe pro-life grassroots have worked hard to educate Americans about Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider. Lila Rose\u2019s Live Action demonstrated that Planned Parenthood clinics will cater to sex traffickers abusing underage girls, no question asked. Prolife heroes like David Daleiden risk their freedom to expose the evil Planned Parenthood is doing. (Even the LA Times criticized the 15 felony charges he faces for exposing Planned Parenthood sale of fetal tissue.)\u000a\u000aPro-lifers have exposed the lie that Planned Parenthood is an important provider of women\u2019s health care. Even Fact Check admitted that Pres. Obama was wrong to claim on national TV that Planned Parenthood does mammograms. Live Action recently called Planned Parenthood clinics and found 92 of 97 admitted they don\u2019t do any prenatal care at all. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t do prenatal services. I mean, it\u2019s called Planned Parenthood, I know it\u2019s kind of deceiving,\u201d a Merrillville, Indiana Planned Parenthood clinic workers confessed.\u000a\u000aPlanned Parenthood does not do women\u2019s health care. But Planned Parenthood is big abortion. A recent Charlotte Lozier Institute report found that Planned Parenthood provides just 1% of HIV tests and PAP tests, but dominates the abortion market carrying out over 35% of all abortions in America.\u000a\u000aAmericans agree: Federal health care dollars are best spent on real community health care centers, not bankrolling the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider masquerading as a woman\u2019s health care provider.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, whether Congress acts or doesn\u2019t, Planned Parenthood is going to raise big bucks to defeat Republicans. Planned Parenthood just pledged $3 million to elect the next Virginia governor, for example. A rich couple (who wished to avoid stigma by remaining anonymous) just gave Planned Parenthood $6.5 million for new abortion clinics. In Denver a series of X-rated sex toy shops have even been set up explicitly to fund Planned Parenthood. \u201cHaving a partner like Vibrant is critical to our future,\u201d said Vicki Cowart, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.\u000a\u000aSo why are taxpayers still footing a bill for this wealthy corrupt corporation? The worst of all worlds for the GOP is to face the well-funded wrath of Planned Parenthood without the support of prolife voters, donors and activists.\u000a\u000aPlanned Parenthood is the swamp. It donates millions to politicians to buy politicians to vote for taxpayer funding, which it spends to maintain the nation\u2019s largest abortion network, which in turn provides services to sex traffickers and supplements that income by illegally selling off the body parts of the unborn babies it kills.\u000a\u000aHere is our message to politicians who campaigned as prolife: Now is the time to show us\u2014and yourself\u2014you meant what you said about valuing every human life. Lives are at stake. Planned Parenthood self-reports taking the innocent lives of 328,348 unborn children each year. That is 900 lives snuffed out before their first breath every single day by a single taxpayer funded abortion chain. The pro-life majority that now controls both chambers of Congress and the White House must pass a reconciliation bill stopping federal funding for Planned Parenthood. If not in healthcare reform, then in tax reform.\u000a\u000aIf elected officials want prolife voters\u2019 love or our votes: Show us now.

aVBillionaire real estate mogul Guo Wengui is currently visiting the United States on a tourist visa, but he decided he would like to stay a little longer after top officials back in his homeland declared him an enemy of the Communist regime.\u000a\u000aGuo applied for asylum in the United States this week, while the Chinese government has filed notices with Interpol seeking his arrest on charges of corruption and rape.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aGuo earned the enmity of powerful officials back in his homeland by accusing them of extravagant corruption, including the top official on the Communist Party\u2019s anti-corruption board, Wang Qishan.\u000a\u000a50-year-old Guo has been working out of a $78 million penthouse in New York City for the past two years, flooding Twitter and YouTube with his allegations against Chinese officials. He often uses the name \u201cMiles Kwok\u201d on social media. Both his Facebook and Twitter accounts were mysteriously wiped out within a week of each other earlier this year, but eventually restored after he complained, and his followers began muttering about the willingness of social media giants to play ball with Chinese censors.\u000a\u000aHis videos and tweets include allegations of everything from \u201ctop leaders\u2019 secret homes in California to their bank account information and hidden stakes in business empires,\u201d according to the Associated Press. He has also accused the Chinese government of arresting his relatives to use as leverage against him.\u000a\u000aHe attempted to sell his apartment in July, but the deal was blocked by a Hong Kong hedge fund that argued he might move the cash from his liquidated asset outside the United States to evade his creditors.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of the evidence he presents to back his claims is easily refuted or simply difficult to believe. But some of his accusations, such as those made against the family of Mr. Wang\u2019s immediate predecessor, can be corroborated,\u201d the New York Times observes.\u000a\u000aGuo\u2019s crusade does not appear to have weakened Wang\u2019s position much, according to the Times, since Beijing has signaled he still enjoys \u201cstrong backing from his peers,\u201d and some of them have taken pains to appear with Wang at ceremonial events such as the 100th anniversary commemoration of his father-in-law\u2019s birth. Also, Wang is still secure in his anti-corruption seat well after the age when Chinese officials normally retire.\u000a\u000aThe counterattack from Chinese authorities and their state-run media has been fierce. The Associated Press kicks off its list of the charges against Guo with allegations that he sexually assaulted his 28-year-old personal assistant, then adds 19 more criminal complaints, including \u201cbribing a top Chinese intelligence official, kidnapping, fraud and money laundering.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe rape charge is exceptionally lurid, as the woman who filed the complaint charged Guo with assaulting her repeatedly in locations around the world over the course of two years while she traveled with him. She said she was occasionally held prisoner in Guo\u2019s luxury accommodations, with her phone, computer, and passport confiscated.\u000a\u000aGuo\u2019s rags-to-riches story contains a good deal of the corruption he is crusading against, which an optimistic supporter might say qualifies him to know it when he sees it. In one colorful example provided by the Associated Press, Guo befriended an up-and-coming Chinese intelligence official named Ma Jian, who supplied him with a sex tape of a vice-mayor in Beijing who was blocking Guo\u2019s bid for major project. Ma himself eventually became the top Chinese counterintelligence official, only to be accused of taking $8.8 million in bribes from Guo.\u000a\u000aThe AP notes that Chinese officials were extraordinarily eager to discuss the details of the ostensibly sensitive cases against Guo. The Chinese have discussed Guo\u2019s case with senior U.S. officials and asked for his visa to be canceled\u2014the strongest demand they could make, since the United States does not have an extradition treaty with China.\u000a\u000aThe New York Times points out a few hitches in Guo\u2019s asylum application, beginning with the fact that it\u2019s not entirely clear which country he is currently a citizen of. He has an impressive collection of passports, but the one nation he definitely lacks valid paperwork from is China. His lawyer said he doesn\u2019t want to retire to any of the other nations he enjoy some form of citizenship from because he only feels safe from China in the United States. (His concerns about being kidnapped or killed by agents of Beijing are not unfounded; inconvenient Chinese billionaires have a habit of disappearing.)\u000a\u000aAnother problem is that granting Guo\u2019s asylum request might interfere with the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to secure Beijing\u2019s assistance with North Korea. \u201cMr. Guo is arguably China\u2019s most-wanted man, and giving him asylum would almost certainly antagonize Beijing, which may interpret the move as tacit approval of Mr. Guo\u2019s tactics to undermine China\u2019s leadership,\u201d the New York Times speculates.\u000a\u000aIn the short term, that conflict might be avoided by allowing Guo to stay put while his asylum request is processed, which his lawyer noted could take years.\u000a\u000aNPR reports that Guo met with Obama-era Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson a few months ago, in which Johnson evidently served as an unofficial emissary of the Trump administration. Leaked recordings of the meeting indicate Guo was told he would not be given to China as a bargaining chip. The recording also captured Guo taking pains to remind Johnson that he is a longtime member of President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort club.

Bin Laden contended that the world would be better off fighting climate change than waging what he claimed was a war against Islam. \u201c\u2026the world should put its efforts into attempting to reduce the release of gases,\u201d said the undated, unsigned letter to someone identified as Shaykh Mahmud that U.S. intelligence officials said they believed was written by bin Laden. \u201cThis is a struggle between two of the largest cultures on Earth, and it is in the shadow of catastrophic climate conditions.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile in Florida\u2026 (H/T Paul Joseph Watson).

In Denver a series of X-rated sex toy shops have even been set up explicitly to fund Planned Parenthood. \u201cHaving a partner like Vibrant is critical to our future,\u201d said Vicki Cowart, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.\u000a\u000aSo why are taxpayers still footing a bill for this wealthy corrupt corporation? The worst of all worlds for the GOP is to face the well-funded wrath of Planned Parenthood without the support of prolife voters, donors and activists.\u000a\u000aPlanned Parenthood is the swamp. It donates millions to politicians to buy politicians to vote for taxpayer funding, which it spends to maintain the nation\u2019s largest abortion network, which in turn provides services to sex traffickers and supplements that income by illegally selling off the body parts of the unborn babies it kills.\u000a\u000aHere is our message to politicians who campaigned as prolife: Now is the time to show us\u2014and yourself\u2014you meant what you said about valuing every human life. Lives are at stake. Planned Parenthood self-reports taking the innocent lives of 328,348 unborn children each year. That is 900 lives snuffed out before their first breath every single day by a single taxpayer funded abortion chain. The pro-life majority that now controls both chambers of Congress and the White House must pass a reconciliation bill stopping federal funding for Planned Parenthood. If not in healthcare reform, then in tax reform.\u000a\u000aIf elected officials want prolife voters\u2019 love or our votes: Show us now.

aVMissouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt has agreed to an appropriations bill that will deeply undermine President Donald Trump\u2019s stated pro-life agenda.\u000a\u000aThe bill will allow Planned Parenthood to be eligible for Title X family planning grants, and will also continue funding the Obama administration\u2019s sex-education program which also provided grants to Planned Parenthood \u2014 unless it is reversed in the closed-door conference negotiations between the House and Senate late this year.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aBlunt is the chairman of the Senate\u2019s Appropriations subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and he agreed to the provisions which were requested by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA).\u000a\u000aBlunt is also chairman of the Senate Values Action Team and claims to be a pro-life advocate. The Republican Party told its conservative, pro-life base that \u2013 once a Republican was in the White House \u2013 that Planned Parenthood would finally be defunded.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump promised his pro-life constituents he would defund Planned Parenthood if the organization continued to perform abortions, and reallocate its funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care for women and families.\u000a\u000aThe organization \u2013 founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger \u2013 has faced possible elimination of its taxpayer funds following years of scandals, including Medicaid fraud, allegations of child sex abuse cover-up, and, most recently, alleged profiteering from the sale of body parts of babies aborted in its clinics.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the face of the horrors of Planned Parenthood\u2019s activities, Sen. Blunt allowed his own bill to move forward in a way that continues Obama Administration policy to protect the abortion industry,\u201d said Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement to Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aA source close to Breitbart News with knowledge of the appropriations bill said Blunt entered into an agreement with Murray, the ranking member of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Murray said in her statement about the bill:\u000a\u000aThis is a bipartisan compromise and not the bill that either of us would have written on our own, but I am glad that Senator Blunt and I were able to work together to protect many critical investments in students, workers, women, families, and the economy. I am especially pleased that this bill doesn\u2019t include a single new damaging policy rider \u2026 this bill is a good first step and a strong foundation for continued bipartisan work.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the bill would continue to fund the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Title X family planning grants and Obama-era Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, with \u201cnew bill language that directs HHS to administer the program as it was during the Obama Administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe two key provisions are as follows:\u000a\u000aFamily Planning Clinics. The bill includes $287 million for the Title X program, the same level of funding as in fiscal year 2017. Grantees rely on these funds to provide comprehensive family planning and preventive health services to nearly 5 million people. The bill also includes new bill language that directs HHS to administer the program as it was during the Obama Administration. Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP). The bill includes $108 million for the TPP program, which provides funding for evidence-based interventions that reduce teen pregnancy and are medically accurate as well as age appropriate. This is level with fiscal year 2017. The program was proposed for elimination in the President\u2019s budget. The bill also includes new bill language directing HHS to administer the program as it was during the Obama Administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is completely undermining Trump\u2019s pro-life agenda and Secretary Price\u2019s pro-life agenda,\u201d said the source to Breitbart News. \u201cIf Murray wanted to offer this stuff as amendments and you have a debate and a vote is one thing, but for Blunt to allow this in the base bill, this is not how a Republican, pro-life Senate should be acting. It\u2019s unilateral disarmament.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe source told Breitbart News that Planned Parenthood obtains a significant amount of the TPP program funds which is used, in turn, to create agreements with Title X family planning clinics. Students receive TPP \u201csex ed\u201d in schools \u2013 which is heavily focused on the use of contraception \u2013 and are then referred to Planned Parenthood for contraception, abortions, and other services.\u000a\u000aThe appropriations bill clears the subcommittee following President Donald Trump\u2019s signature on a resolution in April that overturns former President Barack Obama\u2019s rule that forced states to provide family planning grants under Title X to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers.\u000a\u000aPlanned Parenthood receives about $70 million per year in Title X grants to subsidize birth control.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, Trump has proposed to defund the Obama-era TPP programs that have been shown to be ineffective. Trump\u2019s budget funds, instead, Sexual Risk Avoidance (SRA) programs which incorporate more parental involvement and emphasize abstinence from sex. Obama \u2013 a champion for Planned Parenthood \u2013 had not requested any funding for SRA programs in his 2017 budget.\u000a\u000aThe Teen Pregnancy Prevention grants are \u201cmore than disappointing,\u201d Valerie Huber, the chief of staff for the assistant secretary for health told Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aAscend \u2013 an organization that promotes SRA programs and was previously run by Huber \u2013 noted research that shows more than 80 percent of students in the Obama-era TPP either fared worse or no better than their peers.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, Ascend observed, the numerous studies supporting TPP-type programs have produced results that \u201care not as compelling as they first appear.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe group cites weaknesses in the research, as well as flawed metrics and ignorance of common research protocols.\u000a\u000aSen. James Lankford (R-OK) \u2013 a member of the appropriations subcommittee, voted against the bill. DJ Jordan, a spokesman for Lankford, says Blunt has agreed to a base bill that will tie the hands of the Trump administration in the issuance of Title X grants:\u000a\u000aAs written, the bill does not just provide funding for family planning programs, it also prohibits the Secretary of the Health and Human Services Department from changing the current rules for the issuance of Title X grants. Through this bill, Congress requires the current administration to use the same rules as used by the Obama administration. This comes on the heels of a successful vote under the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of an Obama-era rule prohibiting states from denying Title X funds to Planned Parenthood. Placing this kind of limitation on the current administration is completely unacceptable. Senator Lankford voted no on passage of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee bill and as the bill moves forward, will continue to fight for removal of this harmful language and prioritize pro-life policies.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, the House approved H.J. Res. 43, introduced by Rep. Diane Black (R-TN). The resolution used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to rescind the Obama administration Title X rule, enacted during the last days of the former president\u2019s term as a means to provide protection for Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000aSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) sponsored the measure in the Senate. Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote at the end of March to enable approval in that chamber after Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against it.\u000a\u000aBlunt\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment from Breitbart News.

aVA former financial analyst at Amazon has been charged with insider trading.\u000a\u000aFederal prosecutors and securities regulators said Thursday that Brett D. Kennedy stole confidential information about Amazon\u2019s earnings and gave it to his college friend who was a stock trader.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe scheme alleged by the government was relatively straight-forward. Kennedy had a job at Amazon that gave him access to the company\u2019s financial results. He was only supposed to access the results of one division but managed to get the entire company\u2019s results for the first quarter of 2015.\u000a\u000aHis friend Maziar Rezakhani had formerly run a a business that resold iPhones and other computer products. But sometime in early 2015, he became a full time stock trader. He had another friend, Sam Sadeghi, do stock research for him in exchange for 10 percent of Rezakhani\u2019s monthly trading profits. Apparently, they planned to build up a record of successfully trading stocks and then move to New York to start a hedge fund.\u000a\u000aPart of that plan allegedly involved using non-public information to trade Amazon stock. The SEC complaint says Kennedy looked up the quarterly results in April of 2015, wrote them down on a slip of paper, and then gave the paper to Rezakhani.\u000a\u000aWall Street analysts had expected Amazon to report first quarter revenue of $22.4 billion and a net loss of 14 cents. The information Kennedy obtained, however, showed Amazaon\u2019s revenue would be $22.7 billion and the loss would be just 12 cents. Anticipating that this \u201cbeat\u201d would push up the stock price, Rezakhani bought a bunch of shares of Amazon. To be precise, he bought 4,400 shares for $1.75 million. It\u2019s not clear where the iPhone reseller came up with that kind of money.\u000a\u000aIn a somewhat unique twist to the case, Rezahkani decided against stealthily concealing his possession of Amazon\u2019s non-public information. He took to online message boards and posted the figures as if they were a forecast. Maybe that was part of his plan to move to New York and start a hedge fund: he would be the guy who successfully predicted Amazon\u2019s first quarter 2015 share price. What investor could resist?\u000a\u000aWhen Amazon released its earnings, the share price jumped and Rezahkani sold out of his position. Total profits: $116,000, or a little less than a 10 percent gain. He then allegedly paid $10,000 to Kennedy for his part in the scheme.\u000a\u000aIf Rezahkani had simply bought the Amazon shares and held them, he\u2019d be much wealthier today. The share price has risen 156 percent since Rezahkani\u2019s trading. Simply buying and holding would have made Rezahkani $2.7 million.

aVThe communist government of China is once again imposing itself on the nation\u2019s growing religious community, passing new regulations to \u201csinicize\u201d (make more Chinese) religion to conform to Chinese communism.\u000a\u000aAn article in the nation\u2019s government-run Global Times newspaper Thursday announced the new regulations as if they were the result of an agreement between leaders of all faiths. The Chinese government officially allows only five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Christianity (identified as a separate religion from Catholicism). \u201cLeaders of China\u2019s five main religious groups have agreed Wednesday to sinicize their religions by integrating religious doctrines into Chinese culture,\u201d the article proclaims, praising government-approved religious leaders for embracing the new reforms.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe article quotes Fu Xianwei, the head of China\u2019s \u201cThree-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches,\u201d as approving of the integration of religion into \u201cChinese culture.\u201d \u201cTheology shall reflect Chinese culture,\u201d Fu is quoted as saying.\u000a\u000aThe Global Times also cites an Islamic leader\u2014\u201dMu Kefa, the deputy chairman of the China Islamic Association\u201d\u2014who approves of reforming Islam into a more Chinese religion. \u201cOnly by sinicizing religion can Islam be prosperous and healthy,\u201d Mu says in the article.\u000a\u000aThe newspaper does not define what \u201csinicizing\u201d is or would look like for the nation\u2019s religious communities. President Xi Jinping has placed a strong emphasis on Chinese nationalism during his tenure and under his leadership, the Communist Party has repeatedly attempted to reform various parts of society with \u201cChinese characteristics.\u201d Beijing\u2019s rampant human rights violations are merely human rights \u201cwith Chinese characteristics.\u201d A communist dictatorship is \u201cdemocracy with Chinese characteristics.\u201d A communist dictatorship that allows for business ownership for cronies within the party is \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\u000a\u000aReligion \u201cwith Chinese characteristics,\u201d then, may likely be religion that promotes the well-being of the elites in power. According to a Reuters report published Thursday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang adopted new regulations reportedly meant to curb the spread of religious extremism in the country. \u201cReligious affairs maintenance should persist in a principle of maintaining legality, curbing illegality, blocking extremism, resisting infiltration and attacking crime,\u201d according to the text of the new regulation.\u000a\u000aBeijing appears particularly concerned with Islam, due to the presence of Islamic extremist movements in western Xinjiang province, and Christianity, which has seen a rapid surge in popularity and fueled human rights and anti-communist movements across the country.\u000a\u000aChina has passed significant legislation to contain both religions in the past year. A year ago, the Chinese Communist Party passed laws to reform early education, encouraging students to tell government officials if their parents or neighbors introduce them to any religious content. China also uses building and zoning regulations to prevent Christians from building new churches and to demolish old ones, as well as aggressively targeting \u201chouse churches,\u201d underground Bible study groups where clergy do not have to use pro-government sermons or encourage support for Xi.\u000a\u000aIn April, Chinese officials ordered the installation of security cameras in churches to ensure they could monitor Christians during their worship activities.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
