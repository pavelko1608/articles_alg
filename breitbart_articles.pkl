VGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai defended the dismissal of former Google employee James Damore in a blog post on Tuesday, where he called Damore\u2019s manifesto \u201charmful.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFirst, let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it,\u201d Pichai opined in the blog post. \u201cHowever, portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cTo suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects \u2018each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination,'\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aPichai then claimed that the manifesto \u201cclearly impacted our co-workers, some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender,\u201d and added, \u201cOur co-workers shouldn\u2019t have to worry that each time they open their mouths to speak in a meeting, they have to prove that they are not like the memo states, being \u2018agreeable\u2019 rather than \u2018assertive,\u2019 showing a \u2018lower stress tolerance,\u2019 or being \u2018neurotic.'\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the same time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent. So to be clear again, many points raised in the memo\u2014such as the portions criticizing Google\u2019s trainings, questioning the role of ideology in the workplace, and debating whether programs for women and underserved groups are sufficiently open to all\u2014are important topics. The author had a right to express their views on those topics\u2014we encourage an environment in which people can do this and it remains our policy to not take action against anyone for prompting these discussions. The past few days have been very difficult for many at the company, and we need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree\u2014while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct. I\u2019d encourage each of you to make an effort over the coming days to reach out to those who might have different perspectives from your own. I will be doing the same.\u000a\u000aAfter the manifesto had gone viral online, news outlets reported that some \u201cupset\u201d women at Google took the following day off.\u000a\u000aA former Google software engineer says some women at the company skipped work today, upset by the leaked memo. https://t.co/Uuvd5CBKv7 \u2014 NPR (@NPR) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThis week, Susan Wojcicki, CEO of Google\u2019s YouTube, claimed she had faced discrimination in the tech industry for being a woman, and added that \u201cimplicit biases\u201d still exist within.\u000a\u000aOver 60 women, consisting of both former and current Google employees, are currently considering a lawsuit against the company, alleging gender pay differences and sexism.\u000a\u000aIt is also expected that Damore himself is preparing a lawsuit against Google over his dismissal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m sure a lawsuit will be forthcoming,\u201d predicted Inc writer Suzanne Lucas following Damore\u2019s firing, adding that it was in her opinion illegal in numerous ways for Google to fire the employee.\u000a\u000aIn a series of interviews this week, Damore explained his experiences attending \u201csecret\u201d Google diversity programs.\u000a\u000a\u201cA month and a half ago I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it unrecorded and super secret, and they told me a lot of things that I thought were just not right,\u201d Damore revealed. \u201cThey were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices that they\u2019d been doing in order to increase diversity\u2026 Basically treating people differently based on their race or gender.\u201d

aVFired Google employee James Damore appeared in interviews with Professor Jordan Peterson and Stefan Molyneux this week to discuss his dismissal from the company after he published a viewpoint diversity manifesto.\u000a\u000aDamore discussed details on the secret diversity programs he attended at Google, \u201cpotential racism\u201d at the company, virtue signalling, and the way Silicon Valley employees that aren\u2019t progressive feel the need to stay in the ideological closet.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aDuring an interview with psychologist Jordan Peterson, Damore was quick to reassure viewers that his dismissal had nothing to do with performance.\u000a\u000a\u201cI got promoted twice, my last review was the highest possible, superb, which is the top few percentile,\u201d he claimed. \u201cSo it definitely wasn\u2019t based on performance that they fired me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA month and a half ago I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it unrecorded and super secret, and they told me a lot of things that I thought were just not right,\u201d Damore continued. \u201cThey were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices that they\u2019d been doing in order to increase diversity\u2026 Basically treating people differently based on their race or gender.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo you mean racism,\u201d asked Peterson.\u000a\u000a\u201cYeah, basically,\u201d Damore confirmed. \u201cMost meetings at Google are recorded, anyone at Google can watch it, we\u2019re trying to be really open about everything, except for this. They don\u2019t want any paper trail for any of these things\u2026 because I think it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\u000a\u000aDamore elaborated to Peterson that there\u2019s \u201ca lot of ways in which they pressure people to \u2018increase the diversity\u2019 of their team, and there\u2019s no way to do that besides actually choosing someone based on their race or gender.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe former Google employee also claimed that his manifesto was published around one month ago, and that the company only started to care after it was leaked to the public and started to go viral online.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was only after it went viral and got leaked to the news that Google started caring,\u201d Damore declared. \u201cIt sucks, but at least I was proven right. The whole culture just tries to silence any dissenting view\u2026 I don\u2019t know how they can expect to silence engineers and intelligent people and just deny science like this.\u201d\u000a\u000aDamore also joined podcaster and YouTuber Stefan Molyneux for an interview.\u000a\u000aDuring the interview, Damore continued to discuss the diversity program he attended at Google.\u000a\u000a\u201cI heard things that I definitely disagreed with in some of our programs. I had some discussions there, there was lots of just shaming, and \u2018No you can\u2019t say that, that\u2019s sexist\u2019 and \u2018You can\u2019t do this,'\u201d he explained. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much hypocrisy in the things they are saying. I decided to create the document to clarify my thoughts.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the topic of support, Damore claimed, \u201cThere may be a lot of negative responses in the public. But very few of them actually send me messages. They just want to virtue signal to all their followers, \u2018I\u2019m a great person, I share your morals. This person is bad.\u2019 But they don\u2019t really want to have a debate on why I\u2019m wrong, or even confront me, they just want to show how self-righteous they are.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a ton of personal messages of support which has been really nice,\u201d he continued. \u201cI got that at Google before all of this leaked. Lots of upper management were shaming me.\u201d\u000a\u000aDamore also added that there are \u201ca lot\u201d of conservative and anti-SJW employees in Silicon Valley \u201cthat feel like they need to stay in the closet and not really reveal themselves, and mask and say things they don\u2019t believe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of libertarians, which would sort of be independent of the left and right, because at least according to Jonathan Haidt\u2019s work, the libertarian mindset is actually very logical, which would fit with coding,\u201d he explained.\u000a\u000aGoogle fired Damore this week after he published a viewpoint diversity manifesto, which explained why there are not more women in tech jobs and called for more ideological diversity in Google\u2019s workplace.\u000a\u000aIn a memo, the company claimed Damore had advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d despite the fact that numerous psychologists, male and female, deemed the manifesto to be scientifically accurate.\u000a\u000aDamore is currently \u201cexploring all possible legal remedies\u201d against Google.

aVPresident Donald Trump defied political and media critics of his \u201cfire and fury\u201d warning to North Korea, suggesting that perhaps it wasn\u2019t a tough enough statement.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly, the people who were questioning that statement, was it too tough?\u201d Trump asked reporters during a brief press conference at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aTrump repeated his frustration with politicians failing to address the North Korea threat, vowing strength and resolve in the negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s tougher than fire and fury?\u201d one reporter asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019ll see. You\u2019ll see,\u201d Trump replied.\u000a\u000aAnother reporter asked Trump to address Americans who were currently \u201canxious\u201d about Trump\u2019s statement to North Korea.\u000a\u000aTrump advised Americans to be \u201cvery comfortable,\u201d adding that it should be North Korean leaders who should be worried.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey should be very nervous,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause things will happen to them like they never thought possible, OK?\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump declined to signal to reporters about whether he was considering a preemptive military strike against North Korea.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that. I never do,\u201d he explained.

aVA Virginia judge was left speechless after he heard the case of a man accused of performing sex acts on one of eight dogs.\u000a\u000a\u201cI just don\u2019t have words,\u201d Judge James Stephen Yoffy said, according to the New York Post. \u201cThis is disgusting.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aStephen Matthew Taylor, 31, was convicted of two different animal cruelty charges at Tuesday\u2019s hearing in Henrico County, Virginia, after he reportedly told police he performed oral sex on a Rottweiler, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.\u000a\u000aTaylor entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor animal cruelty charge and an Alford plea to the felony charge of inflicting pain on an animal and causing its death. An Alford plea means the defendant does not admit guilt but recognizes that the prosecution has enough evidence to prove guilt.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Times-Dispatch, Taylor said the allegations against him are \u201clies\u201d but entered pleas because he was not confident he could get a fair trial.\u000a\u000aInvestigators say a search of Taylor\u2019s hard drive brought up 171 images of bestiality, including ten pictures of a man performing oral sex on a dog.\u000a\u000aTaylor\u2019s lawyer, however, argued that his client was not the man in those images.\u000a\u000aAuthorities say officials seized the eight dogs and added that two of them had to be put down.\u000a\u000aJudge Yoffy ordered that Taylor undergo a psychosexual evaluation and not have any contact with pets while he is out on bond before his sentencing hearing.\u000a\u000aTaylor is scheduled to be sentenced November 14. He faces up to five years behind bars.\u000a\u000aInstances of people accused of bestiality are commonplace in the news.\u000a\u000aA Minnesota mail carrier was accused of bestiality in March after prosecutors say he broke into someone\u2019s garage to have sex with a dog.\u000a\u000aIn February, a Georgia man accused of having sex with a dog turned himself into police.

It didn\u2019t even recess so he could appoint recess appointments. That\u2019s what the Democrats would have done.

aVSen. John McCain (R-AZ) announced Thursday that he will submit a plan for more U.S. troops in Afghanistan when Congress drafts its annual defense policy bill.\u000a\u000aMcCain\u2019s statement, described by the Associated Press as \u201ca rebuke to President Donald Trump,\u201d comes after the Commander-in-Chief rejected Afghan war plans from the Pentagon and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. Those strategies, though not revealed to the public, have been described with proposals similar to McCain\u2019s.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aPolitico\u2018s Susan B. Glasser reported in late July that Laurel Miller, former Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP), took part in McMaster\u2019s Afghanistan planning and \u201cbelieves that is has produced essentially a status-quo, stay-the-course proposal.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe primary suggestions in the rejected strategy include increased troop deployment and at least four more years of engagement:\u000a\u000a[T]he president\u2019s hesitation is also, according to multiple current and former senior U.S. officials I\u2019ve spoken with in recent days, a striking vote of no-confidence in his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who has been trying and failing for months to sell the president on a new plan for Afghanistan. McMaster has made a major policy review of America\u2019s long, failed war there his personal mission, according to the sources, and he pushed hard to get a new strategy that would include the relatively modest troop increases and a commitment to at least another four-year timeline approved in advance of Trump\u2019s May summit with NATO allies. \u2026 Hawks like Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, until his recent health troubles, had been urging the administration to commit to seeking an outright victory in Afghanistan, but Miller says it\u2019s simply not doable. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any serious analyst of the situation in Afghanistan who believes that the war is winnable. It\u2019s possible to prevent the defeat of the Afghan government and prevent military victory by the Taliban, but this is not a war that\u2019s going to be won, certainly not in any time horizon that\u2019s relevant to political decision-making in Washington,\u201d Miller says. Miller watched and participated in McMaster\u2019s Afghan policy review up close for months and she believes that it has produced essentially a status-quo, stay-the-course proposal for a president unlikely to favor it. As Trump\u2019s remarks the other day made clear, \u201che has not been persuaded,\u201d Miller says.\u000a\u000aNow, AP\u2019s Richard Lardner writes, an \u201cincreasingly impatient\u201d McCain wants more troops deployed and \u201clong-term, open-ended\u201d engagement:\u000a\u000a\u201cNearly seven months into President Trump\u2019s administration, we\u2019ve had no strategy at all as conditions on the ground have steadily worsened,\u201d said McCain, a leading voice in Congress on national security matters. \u201cBut we must face facts: We are losing in Afghanistan and time is of the essence if we intend to turn the tide.\u201d McCain, R-Ariz., said he\u2019ll seek a vote on his \u201cstrategy for success\u201d in Afghanistan when the Senate returns in September and takes up the annual defense policy bill. His plan calls for sending in more U.S. combat forces, although he doesn\u2019t say how many. But McCain wants them to be less constrained in carrying out missions against the Taliban, al-Qaida, a growing Islamic State affiliate and other extremists. The plan, McCain said, is to \u201cdeny, disrupt, degrade, and destroy the ability of terrorist groups to conduct attacks against the United States, its allies, or its core interests.\u201d \u2026 The amendment he plans to propose adding to the defense policy bill calls for a \u201clong-term, open-ended\u201d U.S.-Afghanistan partnership that includes an \u201cenduring U.S. counterterrorism presence.\u201d He also recommends expanding U.S. training assistance to the Afghan security forces so they can capably fight the Taliban and other militant groups. McCain proposes longer-term support that will allow the Afghans to develop and expand their own intelligence, logistics, special forces and airlift operations.\u000a\u000aRead the rest of the story here.

aV\u201cScientists behind a bombshell new report revealing global warming to be worse than ever are now worried that the Trump administration may try to change or suppress it because it contradicts the president\u2019s denialist agenda.\u201d\u000a\u000aOr so the New York Times has claimed. And also, in its wake, papers including the London Evening Standard and the Guardian.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThis is worse than mere #fakenews.\u000a\u000aThis is #fakenews with icing and cherries on top, rings on its fingers, bells on its toes, a specially commissioned foreword by Al Gore and a rave review (\u201cI love these lies. I could not have written better ones myself\u201d) written from hell by the tormented shade of Josef Goebbels.\u000a\u000aNo, actually, it might even be worse than that.\u000a\u000aFirst, the New York Times initially claimed \u2014 before being embarrassed by the Daily Caller into a retraction\u2014 that this draft report from a National Climate Assessment by scientists from 13 federal agencies had \u201cnot yet been made public.\u201d\u000a\u000aNope. As even some of the scientists who had contributed to it had to admit, draft versions of this report had been available on the internet for months.\u000a\u000aImportant to point out that this report was already accessible to anyone who cared to read it during public review & comment time. Few did. https://t.co/eYgsj09Z97 \u2014 Katharine Hayhoe (@KHayhoe) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aPerhaps this was simply a mistake by the New York Times. But the suspicion arises that what it was actually doing was trying to sex up a tired old story as part of a concerted drive by the climate alarmist establishment to embarrass the Trump administration in the wake of its withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, if you believe the New York Times version events, this is still dynamite:\u000a\u000aIt directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain, and that the ability to predict the effects is limited.\u000a\u000aand\u000a\u000aThe authors note that thousands of studies, conducted by tens of thousands of scientists, have documented climate changes on land and in the air. \u201cMany lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate change,\u201d they wrote.\u000a\u000aand\u000a\u000aOne government scientist who worked on the report, Katharine Hayhoe, a professor of political science at Texas Tech University, called the conclusions among \u201cthe most comprehensive climate science reports\u201d to be published. Another scientist involved in the process, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, said he and others were concerned that it would be suppressed.\u000a\u000aYeah right. There\u2019s only one plausible reason why anyone would wish to have this report \u201csuppressed\u201d: sheer ruddy embarrassment.\u000a\u000aAs both Steven Goddard and Paul Homewood have comprehensively demonstrated, the draft report is riddled with the most basic errors, lies, and distortions. It is a political document not a scientific one\u2014 thrown together in order to ramp up public hysteria about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and entrench the power of the climate mafia.\u000a\u000aHere, Goddard points out one of its most outrageous cheats:\u000a\u000aYes, those federal scientists really are that brazen. They created a fake upward trend in temperatures by starting in 1980 \u2014 the coldest point of the last century. And they have such contempt for those outside their climate alarmist bubble they thought no one would notice.\u000a\u000aIn fact, as Homewood notes, it\u2019s even worse than that.\u000a\u000aThe actual temperatures measured show that the US climate is no warmer now than prior to 1960. It is only by adjusting the measured temperatures that NOAA can come up with their \u201chotter than ever\u201d claims.\u000a\u000aHomewood goes on to demonstrate that this doomsday report cobbled together by the politicised scientists of the National Climate Assessment is actually a farrago of wild claims backed up by no evidence.\u000a\u000aNo, global warming hasn\u2019t continued in recent years.\u000a\u000aNo, current temperatures are NOT \u2014 as this report astoundingly claims \u2014 much higher than in \u201cat least the last 1700 years.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo, there have not been record droughts in the US recently: in fact quite the opposite is true.\u000a\u000aNo, there has not been dramatically increased recent rainfall in the US.\u000a\u000aNo, there have not been more hurricanes and tornadoes: again, quite the opposite, actually.\u000a\u000aNo, there has not been more extreme heat in the US \u2013 as even the report itself quietly admits. But only buried in the small print:\u000a\u000aNo the rate of sea level rise has not increased since the mid-19th century.\u000a\u000aNo, there has not been unprecedented Arctic warming.\u000a\u000aHomewood concludes:\u000a\u000aAlthough the world has warmed up since the 19thC, evidence strongly shows that it is no warmer than other recent warm periods. Far from temperatures becoming more extreme, the opposite appears to be the case. Meanwhile weather is also not getting more extreme. Indeed, in the US evidence clearly shows that the weather has been more benign in recent decades.\u000a\u000aWhen future historians write about the lunacy of the great global warming scare, one of the things they will marvel at is the fact that you could find more objective truth and scientific integrity in the work of two relatively obscure bloggers \u2014 Goddard and Homewood \u2014 than you could in either America\u2019s most famous newspaper or, indeed, in a National Climate Assessment produced by some of the most expert scientists from 13 federal agencies.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s your swamp right there, Mr President. Get draining. Fast.

aVMexico, Chile, and Peru are among 11 Latin American nations, plus Canada, that announced they will not recognize the new \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d created by socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.\u000a\u000aThe group of foreign ministers assembled in Peru said they would only recognize legal agreements approved by the real Venezuelan parliament, the National Assembly, in accordance with the Venezuelan constitution.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Foreign Minister of Chile, Heraldo Muñóz, said he and his colleagues wanted to send a \u201cfirm statement\u201d that they \u201cwill not tolerate military coups,\u201d but also wished to maintain an \u201copening for dialogue\u201d with the Maduro government. He also expressed a desire to work with the Venezuelan government to deliver humanitarian aid to its starving population.\u000a\u000aPeruvian Foreign Minister Ricardo Luna said the Venezuelan Constituent Assembly is \u201cincompatible with international law, human rights and democracy in this region.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fading out of democratic institutions in recent times has reached its culmination and what we have in Venezuela is a dictatorship,\u201d Luna declared.\u000a\u000aMexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said the declaration \u201cvalidates our position in favor of democracy and democratically elected institutions in Venezuela.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis week, Videgaray called Maduro a \u201ccoward\u201d who \u201cuses the power of the State to dismantle democracy and lash out against his people.\u201d He was responding to a taunt from Maduro that Mexico\u2019s president was acting like an \u201cabused employee of Donald Trump\u201d for not offering more vigorous resistance to the American president\u2019s plan for a wall on the southern border of the United States.\u000a\u000aSome observers speculate that Mexico has taken an especially strong stance against Maduro because it has its own left-wing populist leader to deal with, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. López Obrador is seen as a significant candidate for Mexico\u2019s 2018 presidential race. The party currently in power has been ominously referring to him as \u201cMexico\u2019s Maduro,\u201d much as they compared him to Maduro\u2019s mentor Hugo Chávez when he ran for president in 2005.\u000a\u000aOther left-wing leaders in Latin American countries have sought to rally support by holding up Maduro as a hero and denouncing his critics as right-wing fascists. However, the more moderate left is worried that viral Maduroism is infecting parties in their countries and threatening to split militant factions away from decades-old political coalitions.\u000a\u000aArgentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Paraguay joined Mexico, Chile, and Peru in signing the pronouncement refusing to recognize the Constituent Assembly and calling upon Maduro to shut it down. Canada also signed on.\u000a\u000aThe Maduro regime has accused several of these nations of working with the United States to topple the Venezuelan government. As for its domestic opponents, the regime has taken to describing them as \u201cviolent fascists\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d who are waging war against the Venezuelan people.\u000a\u000aGrenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Santa Lucia, and Uruguay sent ministers to the conference but did not sign the denunciation of the Constituent Assembly. Some of these reluctant nations have experienced severe schisms in their left-wing parties over Venezuela.

aVA top school lunch reformer for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), who received praise from former first lady Michelle Obama, has been charged with 15 felony counts, including embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds.\u000a\u000aDavid Binkle, 55, a former chef who ultimately oversaw a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars as he implemented Michelle Obama\u2019s school lunch program in the LAUSD, pleaded not guilty to all the counts during an appearance in court on Tuesday and posted $220,000 bail, reports the L.A. Times.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aProsecutors allege that Binkle \u2013 who railed against childhood obesity with appearances on Tedx Talks \u2013 illegally directed about $65,000 of the school district\u2019s funds into his private consulting firm, some of which eventually ended up in his own pocket.\u000a\u000aThe news report continues:\u000a\u000aAccording to court documents, Binkle repeatedly misappropriated district funds in amounts ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 between 2010 and 2014. Prosecutors also allege that he forged an application to become a vendor with the district and failed to disclose outside financial interests.\u000a\u000aBinkle, who became known for his use of the phrase \u201cnasty, rotty\u201d food, led the former first lady\u2019s unpopular school lunch reform in the district even as students established their own black market of favorite \u2013 albeit \u201cunhealthy\u201d \u2013 foods.\u000a\u000aIn his efforts to implement the school lunch reform, Binkle offered lengthy contracts to providers such as Tyson Foods Inc., Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales, Goldstar Foods, and Five Star Gourmet Foods. Some of the vendors also agreed to annual donations of $500,000 to a healthy eating marketing program in the school district.\u000a\u000aProblems with Binkle\u2019s management, however, were noted as early as 2011 by George Beck, a former food-services deputy branch budget director, who reportedly brought his concerns to the district but was ignored and then laid off.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, in 2014, the LAUSD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) accused Binkle of failing to disclose his ownership of California Culinary Consulting or payments from vendors who appeared at school nutrition events.\u000a\u000aThe OIG audit noted his firm presented \u201cat minimum an appearance of a conflict of interest,\u201d and his marketing program was \u201cbeing mismanaged and at worst being consistently abused\u201d by Binkle, who said he was \u201cfrustrated and baffled\u201d by the allegations.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, since my actions were approved and encouraged from senior district officials, general counsel or the ethics office,\u201d Binkle emailed the Times. \u201cI am confident the truth and facts will show the allegations are unsubstantiated.\u201d\u000a\u000aBeck, however, reportedly said Binkle\u2019s activity was a symptom of larger problems within LAUSD:\u000a\u000aHe negotiated these contracts with these firms with no oversight, nobody else participating. It was a huge procurement bureaucracy. There was one contract for vegetarian entrees, and I remember sitting in a meeting with 35 people. Binkle was there. He had one entrée that was $2.25 per item, and our reimbursement was less than the cost of the meal. Every meal that we sold, we were losing money.\u000a\u000aBeck added he was surprised it took so long for prosecutors to uncover the problems with Binkle.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll these internal control entities that were supposed to be exercising internal control were not doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought it to their attention, and they did nothing about it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile recognizing that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, the charges against Mr. Binkle are extremely upsetting as they do not reflect the professionalism, ethics and character we expect of all L.A. Unified employees,\u201d the school district said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIn October of 2014, Breitbart News also reported a major scandal in the LAUSD in which former superintendent John Deasy \u2013 a former employee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 resigned after pushing a $1.3 billion iPad buy for every child in the district from joint sellers Apple and Pearson, the latter of which had designed a companion iPad curriculum. The program was a huge failure and led to further scrutiny of Deasy\u2019s close personal ties with Apple and Pearson.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, Deasy ultimately joined a training academy funded by one of his supporters, philanthropist Eli Broad. He became a consultant and the superintendent-in-residence for the Broad Academy, which trains urban public education leaders.

aVChina appears to be souring on the decision to invest heavily in Venezuela, now arguably the world\u2019s worst economy, with its state media suggesting Wednesday that keeping commitments to Venezuela \u201cis at the cost of great risk\u201d and the nation\u2019s banks should reconsider business there.\u000a\u000aChina developed close ties to the socialist regime of late dictator Hugo Chávez which persist to this day. Favorable loans from Beijing have helped keep the plummeting economy under current dictator Nicolás Maduro afloat.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s state-run Global Times suggested in two articles Wednesday that this relationship was no longer profitable for China. While adding the caveat that \u201cit is impossible for China to pull out\u201d and \u201cLatin America should not be seen as the frontier of China\u2019s influence,\u201d the Times warned that Venezuela\u2019s downward spiral \u201cmay impact China severely.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor a long time, Venezuela has been a hot investment destination in South America for Chinese firms. The country\u2019s economy and social unrest exposes China\u2019s commercial interests to huge risks. If a civil war really breaks out in Venezuela, then those Chinese business interests will be gone,\u201d the Times warns.\u000a\u000aThe state newspaper estimates that China\u2019s state banks \u201chave offered 17 batches of loans worth $65 billion in total to Venezuela in terms of oil refining, gold mining, logistics, trade and railways projects,\u201d and it notes that the Chinese state is \u201cthe country\u2019s biggest creditor.\u201d This number coincides with independent estimates that put the figure at $63 billion between 2007 and 2013. China has allowed Venezuela to pay this debt back with oil, given the nation\u2019s vast oil reserves, but the bolívar and oil prices have fallen so far that Foreign Policy estimates Venezuela \u201cmust now ship two barrels of oil for every one it originally agreed to\u201d before 2014.\u000a\u000aA separate Global Times article suggests that Beijing should view Venezuela as a cautionary tale regarding its longstanding policy to invest heavily in underdeveloped leftist countries. While Venezuela was certainly not an underdeveloped country before Hugo Chávez \u2013 on the contrary, it was the wealthiest country in Latin America \u2013 socialism has collapsed its economy and left its society without access to food goods, medicine, hygienic products, and other basic products. The Times essentially implores Beijing to be more careful in its next ventures.\u000a\u000a\u201cProjects in political risky and unstable countries could present unexpected challenges. Abrupt deterioration of the political situations in these countries could easily turn investments into bad loans,\u201d the column reads. \u201cTherefore, security threats in certain parts of the world should be considered thoroughly before investment is made in these areas.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the case of Venezuela \u2026 the situation in the South American country would be of less concern if Chinese regulators had conducted a thorough evaluation of the risk involved in continuing to put money into the country and issued investment warnings accordingly,\u201d it suggests.\u000a\u000aThe alarmist tone of the Global Times Wednesday is a stark shift from even last week when a column in the state newspaper appeared to excuse Venezuela for its own woes. \u201cWithout a fully developed industrialization, Latin American economies depend heavily on resources. Many countries are mired in problems, such as sharp wealth gaps and social rifts, yet the political system they adopted from the West has failed to address these problems,\u201d a column dated August 1 reads.\u000a\u000aUnlike its state media, which often provides a more candid view of the Chinese government\u2019s perception of world affairs, the Foreign Ministry has remained supportive of the Venezuelan regime. Claiming to adhere to \u201cnon-intervention,\u201d the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement congratulating Maduro for hosting proven fraudulent elections on July 30.\u000a\u000a\u201cChina believes that the Venezuelan government and people have the ability to properly handle their internal affairs. A stable developing Venezuela accords with all sides interests,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cWe sincerely hope that all sides in Venezuela can orderly resolve the relevant issue with peaceful dialogue within a legal framework, and protect the country\u2019s stability and socio-economic development.\u201d\u000a\u000aLess than a year ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders\u2019 Meeting, looking for more investment opportunities in the region.\u000a\u000aIn the 2000s \u2013 the heyday of Chávez and leftist leaders like Brazil\u2019s Lula da Silva and Argentina\u2019s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner \u2013 the atmosphere on the continent was significantly more favorable towards communist Chinese investment. Even much later in 2013, following Chávez\u2019s death, China pledged full commitment to an alliance with Maduro. Maduro, in turn, promised a \u201cnew geopolitics\u201d featuring a \u201cmultipolar, balanced world,\u201d suggesting a world where China eclipsed the United States in influence.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

aVFrom FrontPage Magazine:\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a textbook style for a media piece defending NSC boss McMaster.\u000a\u000aRefer to him as a \u201cwarrior and a scholar\u201d. Or maybe, if you want to mix it up a little, \u201ca scholar and a warrior\u201d. Mention that he\u2019s brilliant and a deep thinker. (Or the other way around.)\u000a\u000aDismiss all the criticism as an \u201calt-right conspiracy\u201d or a war waged by Bannon. Ignore anyone who doesn\u2019t fit that template. Mention staff firings as little as possible. Mention hirings even less. (Especially if you are, sort of, on the right.) Close by reminding everyone that McMaster is a deeply brilliant warrior scholar being harassed by Twitter trolls. Finale.\u000a\u000aNone of this amounts to any kind of argument. It\u2019s shoddy propaganda.\u000a\u000aI would be interested in a defense piece that delves into the history of the personnel that McMaster hired and fired the way my own article did. And I\u2019m still waiting. There are no fact-based defenses of McMaster. There is just hagiography. And that\u2019s how you know something is wrong.

aVThe Department of Interior, under Secretary Ryan Zinke, has announced the current federal mineral valuation rule is being repealed \u201cto create more workable oil, gas and mineral valuation regulations and avoid costly litigation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Consolidated Federal Oil and Gas and Federal and Indian Coal Valuation Reform Rule (Valuation Rule) has \u201ccreated confusion and uncertainty regarding how companies report and pay royalties on energy and other mineral resources from federal onshore and offshore areas and American Indian lands,\u201d the DOI announcement said.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe repeal of the rule, posted in the Federal Register on Sunday and effective as of September 6, \u201cwill provide certainty and clarity to the regulated community by continuing to require compliance with lawful and well-known oil, gas, and coal regulations in force for more than a decade.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis move will benefit both the energy industry and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), which oversees payments from the industry.\u000a\u000a\u201cRepealing the Valuation Rule provides a clean slate to create workable valuation regulations,\u201d Zinke said. \u201cWe are committed to working closely with stakeholders and the newly chartered Royalty Policy Committee to explore options for future rulemakings and to avoid the structural defects that were found in the prior rule.Department of Interior Kills Regulation to Help Oil, Gas, and Indian Coal Resources\u000a\u000aZinke said the move does not change the agency commitment to \u201ccollecting every dollar due.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are taxpayer and American Indian assets, and the public and American Indians deserve an accurate accounting and valuation,\u201d Zinke said, adding that the move also increases national security.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe United States is a safer and more sustainable nation when we rely on our own natural resource development,\u201d Zinke said. \u201cRepealing the Valuation Rule restores our economic freedom by ensuring our energy independence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Valuation Rule is not only costly but could impair the \u201cproduction on federal lands, both onshore and offshore, making us rely more and more on foreign imports of oil and gas.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI support Interior\u2019s decision to repeal this rule and provide greater certainty to companies seeking to produce our valuable domestic resources, from Alaska to the Atlantic,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said in the press release announcing the decision.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the federal government will continue to collect its fair share of revenues from responsible development, the repeal of this rule will help prevent negative impacts to exploration and production that would put our energy dominance at stake,\u201d Murkowski said.\u000a\u000aRep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, also praised the action.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis rescindment is another important step by the Trump administration to position Interior as a facilitator of responsible energy development,\u201d Bishop said.\u000a\u000aRep. David McKinley (R-WV), chairman of the Congressional Coal Caucus, said the Obama administration had used the royalties rule as a barrier to energy production on federal lands.\u000a\u000a\u201cReturning to the more reasonable previous standards paves the way for further investment and development of energy resources,\u201d McKinley said.\u000a\u000aRep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, agrees.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis Obama-era rule was another misguided attack on affordable energy that would have caused significant harm to tribal, rural and Western economies,\u201d Gosar said. \u201cThis burdensome new regulation would have bankrupt small businesses, discouraged responsible energy production and hit the pocketbooks of hard-working American families.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Department intends to further evaluate changes that may be warranted to the long-established oil, gas and coal regulations through the Royalty Policy Committee and publicly-vetted rulemaking, ensuring that valuation and revenue collection for the nation\u2019s mineral and hydrocarbon resources remain transparent and consistent, while the taxpayers receive every dollar due from resources on their public lands and offshore areas,\u201d the DOI press release said.

aVA course entitled \u201cFat Studies\u201d at Oregon State University argues that \u201cweightism\u201d is a civil rights issue, making it harder for overweight Americans to get ahead.\u000a\u000aThe course, which will be offered in the spring, will examine \u201cbody weight, shape, and size as an area of human difference subject to privilege and discrimination that intersects with other systems of oppression based on gender, race, class, age, sexual orientation, and ability.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe course will be taught by instructor Patti Lou Watkins, who penned an article in European Health Psychologist, which argued that humans can be healthy at any body weight, an endorsement of the widely-panned \u201cHealth At Any Size\u201d movement. Body size isn\u2019t a good indicator of health, she argues. To Watkins, even individuals who can be classified as morbidly obese could be healthy.\u000a\u000aWatkins also dismissed the effectiveness in dieting. \u201cThe validity of HAES is supported by research over the past decade that reveals the continued ineffectiveness of dieting interventions targeting weight loss along with the potential for harm associated with these strategies,\u201d she writes. Surely, thousands of Americans who have lost weight and lowered their risk for certain medical conditions beg to differ with Watkin\u2019s argument.\u000a\u000a\u201cI grew to embrace feminist pedagogy in terms of course content as well as classroom practices,\u201d Watkins explains. \u201cMy course now frames body image disturbances more as a function of oppressive societal structures than of individual pathology.\u201d\u000a\u000aOddly enough, Watkin\u2019s is not the only class at Oregon State University on \u201cfatphobia.\u201d Another course, entitled \u201cWomen, Weight, and Body Image,\u201d exams \u201cweightism\u201d through the intersectionality lens. This means that individuals who are both overweight and a member of another minority group (female, Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ, etc.) are subjected to a system of oppression directed both at their body size and their minority status.\u000a\u000aActivists have been arguing for several years that Western culture is \u201cfatphobic\u201d for the ways in which overweight people are treated. Advocates for this line of thinking about weight often argue that airplanes seats are not built for overweight individuals. They use this and other examples such as the social stigma around being overweight as evidence of the \u201cfatphobia\u201d that they believe permeates throughout Western society.

aVThe latest freedom of navigation patrol for the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea brought the destroyer USS John S. McCain to within 12 nautical miles of a Chinese artificial island off the Philippine coast on Thursday.\u000a\u000aUSNI News notes this is the third patrol under the schedule presented to President Trump by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and U.S. Pacific Command. Or at least it was theoretically the third patrol, since the Pentagon has been rather coy about confirming it happened, and the Chinese have forgone their customary complaints.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe muted response is interesting because, as USNI News points out, this was \u201cthe least ambiguous challenge to China\u2019s artificial island campaign\u201d yet, although a U.S. defense official plausibly argued that a similar operation in May was more aggressive, since it involved a guided-missile destroyer coming within six nautical miles of the Chinese base and hanging around for 90 minutes, long enough to conduct a man-overboard drill.\u000a\u000aAnonymous U.S. officials told Reuters the John S. McCain passed through a string of islets, reefs, and shoals in territory claimed by China before approaching Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands.\u000a\u000aCBS News reports \u201cnothing happened that the U.S. Navy considers unsafe or unprofessional.\u201d The Philippine government was notified in advance of the patrol, although Filipino forces were not directly involved. The Philippine military is thought to have monitored the freedom of navigation operation from a marine base located in a marooned ship on a nearby shoal, which sounds like one of the less appealing postings a Filipino marine could draw.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese government might be relatively quiescent about this latest patrol, but the Communist Party organ Global Times was moved to complain about it on Thursday. Chinese analysts are quoted portraying freedom of navigation operations as a bullying tactic designed to make China more cooperative on dealing with North Korea\u2014a silly strategy, the Global Times explained, because everyone knows China has already done a magnificent job with North Korea.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe US is the trouble maker in the South China Sea and has undermined regional stability,\u201d declared Zhang Junshe of the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute.\u000a\u000aThe South China Morning Post ran an editorial in late July denouncing U.S. freedom of navigation patrols as \u201cineffective\u201d because they don\u2019t seem to have influenced Beijing\u2019s behavior at all, and yet also \u201crisky\u201d because they might push Beijing too far. The problem with suspending them, as even this editorial acknowledges, is that many of America\u2019s regional allies see the operations as tangible reminders of the U.S. commitment to keeping the South China Sea open for business.

aVPresident Donald Trump paid close attention to the threat posed by North Korea throughout his career, clearly viewing modern presidents as too weak or stupid to stop it.\u000a\u000aFrom when he was toying a run for president in 1999, Trump appeared knowledgeable about the subject, urging the United States to take a harder stance to prevent the rogue regime from obtaining nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea is out of control. Everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it. They\u2019re developing weapons of every kind, of every shape and form,\u201d Trump said in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Geraldo Rivera in 1999.\u000a\u000aHe criticized politicians in Washington, D.C. for failing to take the threat seriously.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur weak politicians are too afraid to do anything. They come up with these phony treaties that don\u2019t mean a damn thing and North Korea\u2019s going to town,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBack then, Trump predicted that North Korea\u2019s nuclear program would be a major problem five years into the future, condemning President Bill Clinton\u2019s treaty struck with the regime.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re trying to bribe them. We\u2019re saying: Listen, take our reactors. We\u2019re going to build you reactors, we\u2019re going to give you free fuel, we\u2019re going to give you everything, please don\u2019t build anymore,\u201d Trump told Tony Snow on Fox News Sunday in 1999. \u201cThey\u2019re building them anyway!\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump traveled the circuit of television news shows in Fall of 1999, speaking about the threat with NBC\u2019s Tim Russert, Fox News Sunday\u2019s Tony Snow, CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, and ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer.\u000a\u000aIn each interview, he expressed his frustration with the lack of political will to react strongly to the threat.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of saps. There\u2019s no question that North Korea is developing missiles,\u201d he told Blitzer.\u000a\u000aWhile he admitted that a military strike would be among the last remaining options, Trump insisted that it was impossible to rule it out\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can never rule it out,\u201d he insisted when Blitzer asked if he would consider a military response, explaining that it was essential to negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you ruled it out, you couldn\u2019t talk to them. Why would they? The only thing they\u2019re afraid of is exactly what you just said \u2026 That\u2019s what they\u2019re concerned with,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aAt the time, he was keenly aware of the importance of China to negotiating with North Korea, including an understanding of trade policies as leverage.\u000a\u000a\u201cChina is whipping us big league on trade, and if they want to continue to rip us, they\u2019re going to have to do something with respect to North Korea,\u201d Trump said to Sawyer. \u201cBecause North Korea\u2019s totally out of control, but China controls North Korea very beautifully.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Trump repeated his thoughts about North Korea\u2019s relationship with China on Twitter.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea is reliant on China,\u201d he wrote in 2013. \u201cChina could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea can\u2019t survive, or even eat, without the help of China. China could solve this problem with one phone call,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey love taunting us!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs a candidate for president in 2016, Trump repeatedly brought up the threat of North Korea in presidential debates.\u000a\u000aAt the second Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in 2015, Trump pointed to North Korea during a discussion about the Iran deal.\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody ever mentions North Korea, where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe argued that while it was important to stop Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, it was important to focus on North Korea.\u000a\u000a\u201c[I]n the meantime, you have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, \u2018I\u2019m ready to use them.\u2019 And we don\u2019t even mention it.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump repeatedly pointed to the threat in North Korea on the campaign trail, focusing on the topic in January 2016 in Ottumwa, IA.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis guy, I mean, he\u2019s like a maniac,\u201d Trump said, referring to Kim Jong Un, pointing to his violent rule in the regime. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t play games, and we can\u2019t play games with him because he really does have missiles and he really does have nukes.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s solution on the campaign trail was to get China to thwart the North Korean threat, an issue he discussed with Chinese President Xi Jingping during his April visit to Mar-a-lago in the United States.\u000a\u000aTrump continued pressing the Chinese to act, phoning the president in July to threaten trade sanctions on the country if they did not take on the North Korean threat.\u000a\u000aDespite Trump\u2019s efforts, the Chinese have not acted significantly to stop North Korea\u2019s bellicose rhetoric, missile tests, and ongoing efforts to produce nuclear weapons capable of striking the United States.\u000a\u000aAfter North Korea conducted another missile test at the end of July, Trump signaled his frustration with the diplomatic effort.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very disappointed in China,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThey do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump and his United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley pursued sanctions from the UN Security Council. The 15-0 vote, including China and Russia, was a victory but hasn\u2019t abated North Korea\u2019s hostile activity.\u000a\u000aUltimately, Trump is relying on his last option on the table \u2014 the threat of military force and \u201cfury and fire\u201d should North Korea continue threatening the United States.\u000a\u000aBut his statement triggered alarm among critics of the president, who fretted that his aggressive language wasn\u2019t vetted by his national security staff.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe words were his own.

aVThe Associated Press reported Wednesday that the Canadian government is sending \u201cabout 100\u201d soldiers to assist police and border guards at the remote road on the Quebec-New York border that has become the nexus of an outpouring of illegal aliens living in America.\u000a\u000aThe back road crossing, with no official border post, near Champlain, New York, and Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, has seen thousands of people, mostly Haitians residing in the United States, come by taxi and other conveyences to try to illegally enter Canada. Typically, the outflow is reported as resulting from \u201cfear\u201d of the climate created for illegals in the United States.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHaitians in particular may be agitated because the \u201ctemporary protective status\u201d (TPS) many of them were granted in the aftermath of that country\u2019s devastating 2011 earthquake may be coming to an end. The status, granted by the Department of Homeland Security to specific groups of people suffering from war or natural disaster, has been extended time and again over the last seven years from its original six-month grant. TPS was never meant to grant the Haitians covered by it permanent residence in the United States, and they were expected to return to Haiti when the disaster had passed.\u000a\u000aIn May, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly announced TPS for Haitians would be extended one more time, until January 2018, with a strong indication that this will be the final extension. The Haitians now illegally entering Canada hope to avoid going back to their home country after the end of their special protection. Others, including Africans in America on tourist visas, are trying to find permanent homes in Canada under the same asylum seeker system loophole. If they crossed at an official border post, their claim would be adjudicated immediately, but since they cross at this back road, they can stay in Canada while their applications pend.\u000a\u000aMore than 5,000 people have taken advantage so far. Canadian officials told the AP they estimated 400 illegals crossed the border at the Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle this Sunday alone. The flood is beginning to overwhelm the resources devoted to the problem so far, with Montreal\u2019s iconic Olympic Stadium already being transformed into a refugee center to handle the influx.\u000a\u000aThe soldiers from the Canadian Forces have deployed to assist the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency. According to the AP report, the soldiers are there to set up a more permanent border crossing, including a tent camp for up to 500 migrants who are being arrested as soon as they set foot on Canadian soil. The migrants hope is to gain legal status through the relatively forgiving Canadian asylum laws.\u000a\u000aLiberal Party Member of Parliment Brenda Shanahan, who represents the district in which the crossing lies, tried to tamp down the migrants\u2019 expectations when she spoke to reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not a free ticket for refugee status\u201d she said. \u201cWe would actually like to make that very clear, that regardless of what people are reading on social media and so on, crossing the border here does not guarantee an automatic entry.\u201d

aVTwo political groups for \u201ctransgender\u201d soldiers have asked a court to enshrine the transgender ideology in the military and in the constitution, despite the lack of laws from Congress or support from the public.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit was filed in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s July 26 directive which ended Pentagon acceptance of the claim that people should be treated as members of the opposite sex if they say they have a \u201cgender identity\u201d that does not match their male or female body. Trump directed:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s directive does not exclude people who want to live quietly as members of the opposite sex, but ended President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 official endorsement of the transgender claim that people\u2019s biological sex is legally subordinate to their personal sense of male or female \u201cgender.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the lawsuit:\u000a\u000aPresident Trump\u2019s directive to exclude transgender people from military service discriminates against Plaintiffs based on their sex and transgender status, without lawful justification, in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The categorical exclusion of transgender people from military service lacks a rational basis, is arbitrary, and cannot be justified by sufficient federal interests \u2026 From the implementation of its June 2016 policy until the President\u2019s June 26, 2017 announcement, Defendants provided Plaintiffs with ongoing support for their continued service in the military as openly transgender persons \u2026 In reliance upon that promise from Defendants, Plaintiffs have undergone medical treatment for the purpose of gender transition\u2026 Defendants [should be] estopped from rescinding the rights, benefits, and protections promised to Plaintiffs.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit was filed by National Center for Lesbian Rights and by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders on behalf of five anonymous soldiers who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit is one of many legal efforts which transgender advocates are launching to persuade the Supreme Court to establish the legal and social claim that a person\u2019s self-declared \u201cgender\u201d is more important than their biological sex. If approved, that ambitious demand would sweep away the many evolved and popular laws and civic practices which help the two sexes compete, cooperate and complement each other. For example, sports leagues normally include women or men, but not both. Similarly, childhood is build around the idea that boys and girls should try to become an ideal male or female adult, not a member of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000aTo win that unpopular and revolutionary goal, transgender activists \u2014 and their allies in the Democratic party and in the media \u2014 downplay the political process and instead portray the political dispute as a legal battle for unrecognized-but-real constitutional rights which should instantly trump all federal, state and local laws, as well as public and private civic practices.\u000a\u000aIn this case, the transgender activists say that each soldiers\u2019 supposed right to switch their legal sex trumps the orders of the nation\u2019s elected President and commander-in-chief. Thus the lawsuit plays up the soldiers\u2019 individuals hopes and fears, and ignores the huge impact of a Supreme Court decision saying that even one soldier\u2019s declared gender is more important than his or her biological sex. For example, the lawsuit relies on the personal priorities of five soldiers who insist they are members of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000aAccording to the lawsuit:\u000a\u000aPlaintiffs are active duty servicemembers in the United States military who serve openly as transgender people. They proceed under pseudonyms here for fear of retribution. Jane Doe 1 has served with distinction in the United States Coast Guard for more than a decade. In or around June 2016, in reliance on the issuance of the policy permitting open service by transgender servicemembers, Jane Doe 1 notified her command that she is transgender. Since that time, she has continued to serve without incident and has furthered her gender transition in reliance on the Department of Defense\u2019s policy permitting open service by transgender servicemembers. Following President Trump\u2019s tweets, Jane Doe 1 submitted a prospective letter of resignation stating that she would resign rather than be involuntarily terminated on account of her transgender status. Were the Department of Defense to retreat from the policy announced by President Trump, Jane Doe 1 would withdraw her resignation and continue to serve\u2026 In or around June of 2016, in reliance on the Department of Defense policy permitting transgender people to serve openly in the military, Jane Doe 3 notified her command that she is transgender. Since then, she has continued serving her post without incident. Jane Doe 3\u2019s current contract with the military extends through December 2018. She plans to renew her contract, but fears that she will not be allowed to do so because of the ban.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Commander in Chief has said that transgender service members \u2014 people who have served our nation with honor and distinction \u2014 are no longer welcome to serve,\u201d said a statement from Jennifer Levi, Director of GLAD\u2019s Transgender Rights Project. \u201cThis unjustifiable reversal of policy is devastating to these soldiers and harmful to our country. These plaintiffs put their lives on the line every day for all of us. We can\u2019t afford to lose a single one of them,\u201d Levi added.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit marks a change of strategy for transgender groups. Before Trump\u2019s revocation of Obama\u2019s endorsement of the gender-identity-beats-biology claim, they had hopes to use the Pentagon\u2019s validation to win more lawsuits before making their decisive appeal to the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000aThat strategy worked rapidly for gay activists, who persuaded the Supreme Court in 2015 to approve the Obergefell decision. The decision changed marriage laws to include single-sex couples, and it redefined marriage around the needs of adults, instead of children\u2019s need to be raised in a stable family.\u000a\u000aThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender\u201d has already attacked and cracked popular social rules for how Americans handle the many differences between different, complementary and equal men and women. These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women\u2019s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.\u000a\u000aThat transgender goal is also opposed some gays, by some former transgender people, and some feminists.

If he had been there 5 years, he would be receiving the full salary \u2014 for doing nothing.\u000a\u000aThe Chronicle notes the outrage of Assemblyman Phil Ting, (D-San Francisco), whose call for an audit of UC\u2019s finances last year rocked the liberal establishment, uncovering a $175 million slush fund that UC President Napalitano kept hidden.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe keep asking for more access for California students. UC tells us we have to find state funding for it, but they seem to have all the funding they need when comes to executive compensation and executive parachutes,\u201d Ting told the Chronicle.\u000a\u000aDirks\u2019s tenure as chancellor was rocked by numerous scandals, including a $150 million budget deficit, a series of sexual harassment scandals within the university, and a number of riots on campus.\u000a\u000aBut it was Dirks\u2019s persistent mishandling of sexual harassment claims against an assistant chancellor and numerous professors that proved his undoing, irking the embattled Napolitano.\u000a\u000aIn spite of overwhelming evidence against a number of faculty members, Berkeleyside reports that Dirks allowed many to continue on in their positions for months without any disciplinary action. Even after one vice-chancellor was removed for cause, Dirks reportedly approved his paid leave while transitioning back to teaching.\u000a\u000aTim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and Author, currently on a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless.

aVAn Oregon school district has decided to remove the word \u201clynch\u201d from three school names due to the negative association the word carries with lynching despite the fact that the schools were named after a family who donated land for the schools to be founded.\u000a\u000aLynch Meadows Elementary, Lynch Woods Elementary and Lynch View Elementary in the Centennial School District in Oregon will all undergo name changes after a successful campaign for change due to the negative associations of the word \u201clynch.\u201d The schools were named after Patrick Lynch, a benefactor who donated land to establish the schools in the late 1800s.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAt least in one case, the change is not drastic. Lynch View Elementary will be changed to Patrick Lynch Elementary. Despite this, some are questioning why the changes are necessary at all. \u201cI think my grandfather would have liked me to stand up for the family name a little bit,\u201d David Hayes, a descendant of Patrick Lynch, told a local news station. \u201c[Schools] are in the business of education so they should be able to educate people that a name and history have a certain meaning versus what other people have tried to turn it into.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m just disheartened because where will it stop?\u201d local resident Vicki Burnside told a local news station. \u201cAny moment someone could be offended by any name. Do we keep changing the name of everything? That would be the question, right?\u201d\u000a\u000aOthers in the community are behind the decision. District Superintendent Paul Coakley argues that because the district is has become increasingly diverse with regards to ethnicity, the change is necessary to ensure that they feel welcome. \u201cOur diversity is increasing every year, with families coming in from Northeast Portland and out of state, so [the names] needed to be looked at,\u201d Coakley said.\u000a\u000aA young student at one of the schools affected by the changes defended the decision: \u2018I know the majority of you guys are white and it\u2019s hard to know how that word could have an effect but it does. If a simple name change could make students feel safe, then why are we holding back?\u2019\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t the first time there has a push to change a public school name.

aVA new poll of the liberal sports media shows exactly what one might expect from reading their daily coverage of sports. Chiefly, it showed that only a tiny four percent of members of the sports media are supporters of President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThe folks at The Big Lead Sports decided to poll members of the sports media to see just how far left they are, and the results are about what you would expect.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Big Lead polled 51 members of the sports media, allowing their answers to remain anonymous, to encourage the media to fill out the survey without fear of being \u201couted\u201d as liberals. The site also polled 312 readers as a control group to see if the media was more, less, or the same politically as the site\u2019s readers.\u000a\u000aThe poll revealed that most considered themselves Democrats or \u201cindependents,\u201d with 58 percent calling themselves Democrats and 37 percent claiming to be \u201cindependents.\u201d As to the GOP, well, only three respondents (a measly 6 percent) said they were Republican.\u000a\u000aThe Big Lead points out that a recent Gallop poll said the breakdown above is far out of whack compared to the general population which sees 31 percent each claiming to be Democrat or Republican and 37 percent claiming to be \u201cindependent.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, party affiliation was the least of the site\u2019s poll finding, when asked if they were socially liberal, 76.5 percent said they were extremely liberal.\u000a\u000aWhen the question turned to how they cast their vote in 2016, a whopping 80.4 percent said they voted for 2016 loser Hillary Clinton. While only a few said they cast their ballot for Donald Trump. In fact, more sports reporters said they didn\u2019t vote at all (9.8 percent) than said they voted for Trump.\u000a\u000aFor its control group, the site\u2019s readers voted for Clinton at 50.3 percent, while Trump and a third party candidate each got 20 percent.\u000a\u000aThe sports reporters also favored abortion (86.3 percent) while the general readers were closer to the middle (55.8 percent). In addition, 88.2 percent called themselves firm believers in global warming, while the readers only accepted climate change at 48 percent.\u000a\u000aGun ownership was also rejected by the sports reporters at a number far higher than that of regular Americans. Of all the reporters asked, only three polled said they owned a gun. Meanwhile, national average fro gun ownership in America is 36 percent.\u000a\u000aThe reporters also self-identified as leftists in other ways. All but one chose left-wing news sources as their main sources of news, 78.4 percent agreed that sports media should be \u201cvery liberal,\u201d and 76.5 percent wanted to see pot legalized.\u000a\u000aIn its conclusion, The Big Lead makes a point that has been echoed by other members of the sports media recently\u2026 not that this conclusion helps the matter.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sports media clearly leans left. But, it may be a stretch to say that alienates a significant portion of the audience,\u201d Ty Duffy wrote. \u201cThe sports media is clustered in major cities and along the coasts because that\u2019s where much of its audience is.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis makes sense, most sports writers work for big media outfits in places like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\u000a\u000aHowever, this also means that a relatively small community of liberal sports writers in liberal enclaves, are writing for a massive percentage of the country. Which, according to the numbers in this poll, do not hold the same values or opinions. While that has probably always been true in media, to some extent, given that media has always been coastal and liberal. However, one wonders if 50 years ago the ideological gap between scribe and fan was quite this stark.\u000a\u000aIn any event, this is a large part of the reason why outlets like ESPN have lost viewers. No one is serving half the number of sports fans in the country, and many of those fans are simply walking away from their once fervent love of sports because of it.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.

aV\u201cHistory shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000aThose words were written by former National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Thursday in the New York Times, in arguing for appeasement towards Kim Jong-un.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIt was also the perfect symbol of everything that was wrong with Barack Obama\u2019s feckless foreign policy \u2014 and it explains why the world that President Donald Trump inherited is so dangerous and unstable.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration believed it was worth living in the shadow of terror and nuclear aggression as long as the U.S. could maintain a dignified posture that could not provoke anyone.\u000a\u000aThat is why they abandoned missile defense in Europe, allowed Russia to invade Ukraine, dismantled international sanctions against Iran, and let the Chinese build fake islands in the South China Sea.\u000a\u000aBut everywhere, their policy has only invited more aggression.\u000a\u000aRice\u2019s arguments reprise exactly the case that Winston Churchill\u2019s opponents made against him throughout the 1930s \u2014 that Britain could learn to live in the shadow of fascist Europe, and that it did not have the ability to fight back in any case.\u000a\u000aIn blaming Trump\u2019s rhetoric for escalating the crisis, she repeats what Churchill\u2019s opponents said about his war talk. They only realized he had been right all along when it was almost too late to save the country.\u000a\u000aIn her long and disastrous career, Rice has advocated inaction when intervention would have saved lives. During the Rwandan genocide, she counseled President Bill Clinton to avoid using that term, and helped stop the U.S. from responding.\u000a\u000aIn Benghazi, the Obama administration failed to make any effort to save U.S. diplomats and security personnel \u2014 and then Rice lied shamelessly to the American people, blaming a YouTube video for the attack.\u000a\u000aRice complains that Trump told North Korea that \u201cthey will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d if they threaten the U.S.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s warning is no different from what John F.

In explaining his decision to veto the minimum wage increase, he said the wage hike would devastate the economy in Montgomery County.\u000a\u000aPFM, the Philadelphia-based consulting group that carried out the study, found that a minimum wage hike to $15 would lead to a $396.5 million loss of income in Montgomery County by 2022.

You can\u2019t discount ­it all.\u201d\u000a\u000aCounty council member Marc Elrich, however, remains unconvinced of the study\u2019s findings. Elrich proposed a bill that would raise the minimum wage in Montgomery County to $15 by 2022 a week before the study was due.\u000a\u000aHe called the PFM study \u201cnonsense,\u201d saying it was impossible to predict how a wage increase would impact the future.

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 In a speech following Israel\u2019s defensive 2014 war against the Hamas terrorist group, embattled White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster sidestepped a question about whether the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted itself in an ethical manner, instead providing what McMaster admitted was a \u201cnon-answer.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IDF is known to go to extreme lengths to operate ethically and protect civilians when fighting Palestinian jihadists who use civilians as human shields, launch rocket attacks from civilian zones and house their terrorist infrastructures in densely populated civilian areas.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAudio of the speech can be heard here. (McMaster\u2019s Israel comments start at the 56 minute mark).\u000a\u000aAt a December 4, 2014 speech to the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, an audience member asked McMaster a direct question about the ethics of the IDF\u2019s conduct in that year\u2019s war against Hamas and in other wars.\u000a\u000aMcMaster was asked: \u201cFirstly, would you consider the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] conduct of the recent war and prior wars as a template for the ethical conduct of war?\u201d\u000a\u000aHere is a transcript of McMaster\u2019s reply, which he admitted was a \u201cnon-answer\u201d:\u000a\u000aOkay. So quickly on that, in terms of the IDF actions and how to evaluate them, I think you could evaluate them based on jus ad bellum sort of criteria of proportionality and distinction and so forth. I\u2019m not the best judge of it. I\u2019ve been following it in the media. I can\u2019t really tell. I do know that they\u2019re responding to attacks. What you\u2019re asking is, was the response proportional? Now, there\u2019s different kinds of proportionality. There\u2019s proportionality in war, and then there\u2019s a broader sort of humanitarian standard that I think, at times, doesn\u2019t apply as a complete transfer over to wartime situations. So that\u2019s kind of a non-answer, sorry, to your first question.\u000a\u000aA defender of Israel or even an objective observer would have noted that Israel goes beyond what almost any other country does to protect civilians and that the IDF is one of the most ethical militaries in the world. The IDF operates under the guidelines of international law, including the Law of Armed Conflict, and imposes its own, even stricter codes.\u000a\u000aThe IDF regularly warns those in civilian areas of incoming attacks with phone calls and text messages even though the terrorist targets will likely also learn about the warning. It employs \u201croof knocking\u201d \u2013 or firing warning shots before any aerial bombing where civilians may be present. If civilians still don\u2019t evacuate, the Israeli army many times makes announcements on loudspeakers. In the 2014 war, the IDF called off numerous military raids because civilians were in the way.\u000a\u000aDespite its enormous firepower, the IDF severely restrains itself in order to minimize civilian casualties. To protect Palestinian civilians, the IDF has many times risked the lives of its own soldiers on house-to-house missions and other urban combat instead of using aerial power.\u000a\u000aThe IDF relates of the 2014 war:\u000a\u000aThe IDF took various steps to mitigate the risk of harm to civilian objects and the civilian population, including measures not required by the Law of Armed Conflict. Precautionary measures included a multi-layered system of effective advance warnings, sophisticated verification procedures, and the careful choice of means and methods of warfare (including munitions, timing and angle of attack). \u2026 In addition, Israel requires that any means of warfare used during its military operations accord with Israel\u2019s obligations under international law. Thus, for example, high-explosive artillery was required by IDF directives to be used in accordance with the rules of the Law of Armed Conflict. Beyond these requirements, the IDF puts great efforts and resources into minimizing the possibility of harm to civilians that results from the use of such weaponry \u2013 for instance, by imposing stringent limitations on the use of certain weapons (including high-explosive artillery) in populated areas.\u000a\u000aThe 2014 war started after Hamas broke a ceasefire and launched multiple rockets into Israel aimed at civilian neighborhoods. Israel evacuated the Gaza Strip in 2005 in hopes that the territory would be used to create a moderate coastal enclave. Instead, Hamas took over and has since utilized Gaza to build an enormous terrorist infrastructure \u2013 much of which utilizes civilian zones, including terror tunnels that snake under cities. Palestinian jihadist groups, including Hamas, have used Gaza to stage attacks against Israeli cities.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), the oldest pro-Israel group in the country, released an analysis of McMaster\u2019s policies and reported views, concluding that he should be reassigned outside the NSC after it found that McMaster may be undermining Trump\u2019s stated national security agenda.\u000a\u000aThe analysis states:\u000a\u000aWe find it hard to understand how someone who clearly has animus toward Israel, who supports the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, who opposes calling out radical Islamist terrorists, who fires Trump loyalists and supporters of Israel and opponents of Iran, who hires those opposed to President Trump\u2019s policies especially on Israel and Iran, who refused to acknowledge that the Western Wall is in Israel, who opposes Israeli counterterrorism measures, and who shuts down joint U.S. counterterrorism programs that are of enormous value to U.S. security, can faithfully serve President Trump as top national security advisor. President Trump made it crystal clear, both before and since his election, that supporting Israel and the U.S.-Israel alliance, abrogating or at least vigorously enforcing the Iran deal while calling out and sanctioning Iran\u2019s violations, confronting radical Islamist terrorism, and draining the Washington swamp were key, distinguishing policies of his administration.\u000a\u000aThe ZOA\u2019s analysis cited Breitbart News articles from this reporter on McMaster\u2019s background.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, Breitbart News reported that McMaster served at a UK-based think tank financed by a controversial, George Soros-funded group identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.\u000a\u000aFrom September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster was listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow. The IISS describes itself as a \u201cworld-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart also reported that IISS is bankrolled by multinational corporate firms doing billions of dollars in business in Iran.\u000a\u000aAnd IISS quietly took in about $32.5 million in funding from Bahrain, a country whose constitution explicitly enshrines Sharia Islamic law as its governing doctrine, Breitbart News documented.\u000a\u000aThe funding from Bahrain, a repressive regime with a dismal human rights track record but also an important regional U.S. ally, reportedly amounted to one quarter of the think tank\u2019s total income.\u000a\u000aA significant portion of the Bahraini funding reportedly pays for the think tank\u2019s annual conference in Bahrain, the Mamana Dialogue. The original agreement between IISS and Bahrain to finance the conference contained a clause calling for the memorandum of understanding to remain confidential, according to the document, which was leaked by a watchdog and published by the Guardian newspaper last year.\u000a\u000aAs a member of IISS, McMaster participated in the Sixth Mamana Dialogue summit in Bahrain from December 11 to December 13, 2009, Breitbart News found. He is listed in IISS literature as being part of the Mamana Dialogue\u2019s four-person panel that year on \u201cmilitary transformation, intelligence and security cooperation.\u201d\u000a\u000aAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

aVThe U.S. State Department confirmed Wednesday that several American diplomats left the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba, in May after complaining of \u201ca variety of physical symptoms\u201d triggered by unspecified \u201cincidents.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press and CNN reported spokeswoman Heather Nauert\u2019s comments at the agency\u2019s daily press briefing that unnamed sources had confirmed the symptoms included \u201cunexplained losses of hearing\u201d and symptoms similar to those of concussions. The AP notes that their sources believe a \u201ccovert sonic device\u201d triggered the symptoms, but there is no confirmation that the Cuban government possessed or used such a device.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe communist government in Cuba has denied any acts of physical hostility against American diplomats despite its long history of harassment and abuse of Americans on the island.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome U.S. government personnel who were working at our embassy in Havana, Cuba on official duty \u2026 reported some incidents which have caused a variety of physical symptoms,\u201d spokeswoman Nauert told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe asked two officials who were accredited in the embassy of Cuba in the United States to depart the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aNauert confirmed that the Cubans left Washington on May 23. She added a reminder that \u201cthe Cuban government has a responsibility and obligation to protect our diplomats.\u201d\u000a\u000aNauert refused, however, to expand upon what sorts of \u201csymptoms\u201d the \u201cincidents\u201d caused, what the \u201cincidents\u201d were, or who or how many people were involved. She also did not note whether the expulsion of Cuban diplomats from Washington was a move to balance the number of diplomats in each country or whether those expelled were involved in the \u201cincidents.\u201d The diplomats were not declared persona non grata, permitting them to return to the United States at a later date.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reported that the individuals who left the American embassy in Havana did so \u201cwith severe hearing loss attributed to a covert sonic device.\u201d The report estimated that \u201cabout five\u201d diplomats and spouses were affected and that American investigators had not yet concluded whether \u201cthe device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat investigators appear to have confirmed, according to the AP, is that \u201cthe diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences.\u201d\u000a\u000aA subsequent report from CNN compared the symptoms aside from the hearing loss as resembling those of a concussion, suggesting that the sonic devices can damage a brain in a way similar to a physical blow. CNN quotes an unnamed official who stated, \u201cWe have worked with the Cubans to try and find out what is going on. They insist they don\u2019t know, but it has been very worrying and troublesome.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Barack Obama reopened the U.S. embassy in Havana in 2015 following the announcement of a new, pro-Castro American policy that would allow American businesses to further enrich the Castro regime while accepting Raúl Castro\u2019s repeated demands that \u201cnothing\u201d would be expected from the regime in return, in particular, respect for international human rights norms.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry (MINREX) responded to the incident in a statement published in Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC).\u000a\u000a\u201cCuba addressed this matter with utmost seriousness and has acted with promptness and professionalim to clarify the situation,\u201d the statement read, \u201cinitiating an exhaustive, prioritized, and urgent investigation at the highest levels of the Cuban government.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe statement also complains about the expulsion of the Cuban diplomats, saying, \u201cOn May 23, the Department of State informed the Cuban embassy in Washington of the decision that two Cuban diplomats abandon the territory of the United States, which motivated a protest by the Foreign Relations Ministry against this unjustified and unfounded decision.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe objection to removing the Cuban agents suggests that American officials did not merely want to reduce the number of staff in the embassy to balance the numbers following the departure of American officials from Havana.\u000a\u000aThe incident is the first to occur since Obama officially reopened the embassy, but far from the only case of suspected harassment of American diplomats in Cuba. Before it became an official embassy again, the U.S. embassy building in Havana still hosted some American diplomats, who were reportedly treated to routine harassment by passersby and Cuban government agents alike.\u000a\u000aIn 2012, the Miami Herald quoted a U.S. State Department official who said American diplomats on the island were treated regularly to \u201charassment and contempt\u201d including Cuban government agents \u201cshouting insults at them from their cars, publishing photos of their vehicles,\u201d and harassing diplomats\u2019 children.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have reminded the Cuban government on various occasions that, under the Vienna Convention, this type of treatment of diplomatic personnel is unacceptable,\u201d the State Department official said at the time.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban government temporarily halted such treatment of Americans in March 2016, when then-president Obama embarked on his \u201chistoric\u201d visit to watch a baseball game with Raúl Castro on the island. While the Cubans refrained from insulting Obama in person, state media referred to Obama as a \u201cnegro\u201d who came to Cuba to \u201cincite rebellion and disorder\u201d shortly after his visit. By January 2017, Cuban soldiers were performing military exercises chanting slogans about putting \u201clead\u201d in Obama\u2019s head and body.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump has vowed to reverse Obama\u2019s Cuba policies, adopting strategies to ensure that American tourist money does not enrich the regime. Trump has made no moves to shut the Cuban embassy down, however, and Nauert did not make any remarks regarding an end to the dangerous diplomatic project begun under Obama in her press conference Wednesday.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

aVHOUSTON, Texas \u2014 A man who allegedly used a knife to rob a Walgreens drug store on the outskirts of Houston is in jail after police identified him from a very distinctive facial tattoo.\u000a\u000aA witness to the crime identified the man and described him as having a clown-like tattoo that resembled a mask of eyeliner and tears. Investigators with the Harris County Precinct 4 Constables Office used the description to identify the suspect as 25-year-old Christopher Breaker, according to a statement provided by Constable Mark Herman\u2019s office to Breitbart Texas.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aOn August 4, witnesses said Breaker took food from a shelf and began eating it. When clerks confronted Breaker about the food, he reportedly jumped over the pharmacy counter and brandished a knife. He then took a fire extinguisher and began pounding on the back door, ABC13 reported.\u000a\u000aAfter apparently becoming frustrated with not being able to open the door, Breaker then fled through the front.\u000a\u000aLaw enforcement officials eventually located the man and placed him under arrest.\u000a\u000aCourt records obtained by Breitbart Texas show that Breaker faces a felony charge of Aggravated Robbery with a Deadly Weapon. His criminal history includes one misdemeanor charge of theft ($50-$100) and two misdemeanor charges of evading arrest or detention.\u000a\u000aThe store clerk told police that Breaker had been behaving strangely before the incident began, according to a criminal complaint obtained by Breitbart Texas. The clerk said she observed Breaker taking food and opening the packaging and then eating the food. She informed him that he must pay for the food before eating it.\u000a\u000aShe described her fear as Breaker allegedly pulled the knife and began beating a window on the back door with the fire extinguisher.\u000a\u000aThe clerk said Breaker left through the front door \u2014 fire extinguisher and donuts in one hand and a knife in the other. She said she did not try to stop him because she was in fear of being attacked with the knife.\u000a\u000aInvestigators said store surveillance video confirmed the witnesses story.\u000a\u000aBreaker is currently in the Harris County jail.

aVA report in an Arabic newspaper this week cites Hezbollah media outlet al-Manar and unnamed \u201csources in the Arabic community\u201d as beginning a push to replace embattled dictator Nicolás Maduro with Tareck El Aissami, alleged drug lord and appointed vice president of Venezuela.\u000a\u000aReports have linked El Aissami to a variety of terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the Mexican Zetas cartel, and allies of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has designated El Aissami a \u201cSpecially Designated Narcotics Trafficker\u201d as per the Drug Kingpin act.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWith the international community almost universally condemning Maduro, in response to his imposition of a fabricated socialist lawmaking body in the country which annuls the powers of the democratically-elected legislature, Asharq Al-Awsat reports that \u201cmany have turned to the Venezuelan president\u2019s second in command, Tareck El Aissami.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMany see the Syrian native as Maduro\u2019s potential successor, describing him as the strong \u2018man in the shadows,\u2019 who has found himself in the spotlight,\u201d the report claims, noting that El Aissami \u201cbecame a member of the local Arab Baath socialist party in Venezuela,\u201d the party of Bashar al-Assad and Saddam Hussein, in his youth.\u000a\u000aThe Argentine outlet Infobae adds in their own report that \u201cgroups close to El Aissami in Venezuela and Syria have collaborated in the creation of a report surfacing on al-Manar television (the official press organ of Hezbollah) in Lebanon\u201d that appears to support the ascension of El Aissami to the top office in Venezuela.\u000a\u000aEl Aissami, promoted to the vice presidency this year following a tenure as governor of Aragua state, has been repeatedly accused of ties to Hezbollah. \u201cI believe Tareck El-Aissami is one of many political figures that Iran has courted and supported in Latin America over the years,\u201d Joseph Humire of the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS), a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, explained in a television report this year:\u000a\u000aThis illicit network managed by Hezbollah is believed to be connected to Mr. El Aissami\u2019s illicit network through a company called Importador Silvania, C.A. with offices in Venezuela and Colombia. This company was sanctioned by U.S. Treasury for laundering money for Hezbollah and its owner, Ali Hussein Harb, who was also sanctioned, is allegedly a close associate of the Venezuelan VP\u2019s brother Feras El Aissami.\u000a\u000aThe Gatestone Institute, another think tank, has accused El Aissami of \u201crecruiting young Venezuelan Arabs to be trained in Hezbollah camps in Southern Lebanon\u201d as well as having a hand in a complex passport procurement scheme in the Middle East. A former Venezuelan diplomat at the embassy in Iraq has accused the government of selling authentic Venezuelan passports to Shiite terrorists across the regime for up to $15,000 each, years after Spanish journalist Emili Blasco revealed that then-foreign minister Nicolás Maduro met Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Damascus in 2007 to discuss the execution of this very scheme.\u000a\u000aIn February, the U.S. Treasury branded El Aissami a \u201cSpecially Designated Narcotics Trafficker\u201d for ties to a variety of international drug traffickers:\u000a\u000aEl Aissami received payment for the facilitation of drug shipments belonging to Venezuelan drug kingpin Walid Makled Garcia. El Aissami also is linked to coordinating drug shipments to Los Zetas, a violent Mexican drug cartel, as well as providing protection to Colombian drug lord Daniel Barrera Barrera and Venezuelan drug trafficker Hermagoras Gonzalez Polanco\u000a\u000aThe sanctions against El Aissami froze $3 billion in assets in the United States, mostly in Florida, and banned Americans from doing business with him.

aVDemocrats are threatening to shutter many government agencies on October 1 unless President Donald Trump gives up his popular campaign promise to build the border wall against Mexico, according to Politico.\u000a\u000aIn response, Trump\u2019s deputies are offering political compromises to Democrats, including a rise in domestic spending, says Politico:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe White House is pushing a deal on Capitol Hill to head off a government shutdown that would lift strict spending caps long opposed by Democrats in exchange for money for President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexico, multiple sources said. Marc Short, the White House\u2019s director of legislative affairs, met with top staffers from both parties on the Senate Appropriations Committee last week to make a hard sell for the proposal, the sources said. Short \u2014 who said the border funding would be used for a \u201cdouble fence\u201d \u2014 stressed that the White House is insisting on a down payment for construction this fall. Short also lobbied for a big budget increase for the Pentagon, another priority for Trump.\u000a\u000aIf Democrats block the spending plan, many government agencies will have to send their employees home. But national security agencies, and various aid programs, such as the Social Security program, would keep operating.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s pending request for an October funding package of $1.6 billion would help build roughly 62 miles of border wall. In May, Democrats \u2014 aided by a passive GOP leadership \u2014 blocked a 2017 funding package that would have helped quickly build 42 miles of wall.\u000a\u000aLed by Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrats are hoping to block any wall construction, so protecting the northward flow of government-dependent workers to Democratic-run cities, and also breaking Trump\u2019s 2016 primary campaign promise.\u000a\u000aBut Democratic politicians are also being squeezed between their radical base and popular opinion, which favors Trump\u2019s immigration reform plans. For example, Politico reported that Sen. Tammy Baldwin is opposing the border fence. \u201cI do know for a fact that every [Democrat] considers wall funding to be a poison pill,\u201d she told Politico.\u000a\u000aBut a recent poll shows that Trump\u2019s immigration reform gets overwhelming support in Wisconsin where Baldwin must faced the voters in 2018. The June poll of 1,000 likely midterm voters was conducted for NumbersUSA, which favors Trump\u2019s merit immigration reform. For example, the poll asked:\u000a\u000aDo you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose setting up rules to ensure that businesses give first preference for jobs to American workers and legal immigrants already in this country before businesses can ask for new immigrant workers?\u000a\u000aThe proposal won 53 percent strong support, and only 6 percent strong opposition, said NumbersUSA.\u000a\u000aThe NumbersUSA group also polled in Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is also up for election in 2018. He suggested to Politico that he could support Trump\u2019s double-layer fence, saying: \u201cThere are places where the wall makes sense, and there are places where the wall doesn\u2019t make sense and there are better options \u2026 I\u2019ll just take a look at it and see.\u201d\u000a\u000aEight additional Democratic Senators are up for election in 2018 in states where Trump won.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, Schumer and Democrats lost 10 Senate seats after trying to push through the so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d cheap-labor and amnesty bill.\u000a\u000aUnder pre-Trump policies, the federal government annually imports 1 million legal immigrants into the United States, just as 4 million young Americans turn 18.\u000a\u000aThe federal government also awards roughly 1.5 million temporary work permits to foreigners, grants temporary work visas to roughly 500,000 new contract workers, such as H-1B workers, and also largely ignores the resident population of eight million employed illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aThe current annual flood of foreign labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families.

We\u2019re going to build you reactors, we\u2019re going to give you free fuel, we\u2019re going to give you everything, please don\u2019t build anymore,\u201d Trump told Tony Snow on Fox News Sunday in 1999. \u201cThey\u2019re building them anyway!\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump traveled the circuit of television news shows in Fall of 1999, speaking about the threat with NBC\u2019s Tim Russert, Fox News Sunday\u2019s Tony Snow, CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, and ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer.\u000a\u000aIn each interview, he expressed his frustration with the lack of political will to react strongly to the threat.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of saps. There\u2019s no question that North Korea is developing missiles,\u201d he told Blitzer.\u000a\u000aWhile he admitted that a military strike would be among the last remaining options, Trump insisted that it was impossible to rule it out\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can never rule it out,\u201d he insisted when Blitzer asked if he would consider a military response, explaining that it was essential to negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you ruled it out, you couldn\u2019t talk to them. Why would they? The only thing they\u2019re afraid of is exactly what you just said \u2026 That\u2019s what they\u2019re concerned with,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aAt the time, he was keenly aware of the importance of China to negotiating with North Korea, including an understanding of trade policies as leverage.\u000a\u000a\u201cChina is whipping us big league on trade, and if they want to continue to rip us, they\u2019re going to have to do something with respect to North Korea,\u201d Trump said to Sawyer. \u201cBecause North Korea\u2019s totally out of control, but China controls North Korea very beautifully.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Trump repeated his thoughts about North Korea\u2019s relationship with China on Twitter.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea is reliant on China,\u201d he wrote in 2013. \u201cChina could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea can\u2019t survive, or even eat, without the help of China. China could solve this problem with one phone call,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey love taunting us!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs a candidate for president in 2016, Trump repeatedly brought up the threat of North Korea in presidential debates.\u000a\u000aAt the second Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in 2015, Trump pointed to North Korea during a discussion about the Iran deal.\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody ever mentions North Korea, where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe argued that while it was important to stop Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, it was important to focus on North Korea.\u000a\u000a\u201c[I]n the meantime, you have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, \u2018I\u2019m ready to use them.\u2019 And we don\u2019t even mention it.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump repeatedly pointed to the threat in North Korea on the campaign trail, focusing on the topic in January 2016 in Ottumwa, IA.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis guy, I mean, he\u2019s like a maniac,\u201d Trump said, referring to Kim Jong Un, pointing to his violent rule in the regime. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t play games, and we can\u2019t play games with him because he really does have missiles and he really does have nukes.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s solution on the campaign trail was to get China to thwart the North Korean threat, an issue he discussed with Chinese President Xi Jingping during his April visit to Mar-a-lago in the United States.\u000a\u000aTrump continued pressing the Chinese to act, phoning the president in July to threaten trade sanctions on the country if they did not take on the North Korean threat.\u000a\u000aDespite Trump\u2019s efforts, the Chinese have not acted significantly to stop North Korea\u2019s bellicose rhetoric, missile tests, and ongoing efforts to produce nuclear weapons capable of striking the United States.\u000a\u000aAfter North Korea conducted another missile test at the end of July, Trump signaled his frustration with the diplomatic effort.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very disappointed in China,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThey do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump and his United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley pursued sanctions from the UN Security Council. The 15-0 vote, including China and Russia, was a victory but hasn\u2019t abated North Korea\u2019s hostile activity.\u000a\u000aUltimately, Trump is relying on his last option on the table \u2014 the threat of military force and \u201cfury and fire\u201d should North Korea continue threatening the United States.\u000a\u000aBut his statement triggered alarm among critics of the president, who fretted that his aggressive language wasn\u2019t vetted by his national security staff.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe words were his own. The tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement in response to multiple reports.\u000a\u000aAn examination of Trump\u2019s history on the subject shows he is doing exactly what he said he would do \u2014 if elected president of the United States.

aVLiberals all across the country are beginning to rally to force the National Football League to sign activist Colin Kaepernick to a new NFL contract. Though, at least one sports writer, has called that campaign a \u201cshakedown,\u201d and compares Kaepernick to fraudsters Al Sharpton and Tawana Brawley.\u000a\u000aAfter spending the whole of the 2016 season protesting the national anthem, Colin Kaepernick walked away from the 49ers and became a free agent. Yet, since announcing his availability to the league, not a single NFL team has signed him to a contract.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLiberal activists decided to focus on race, as the primary cause for Kaepernick\u2019s continuing unemployment. To that end, many Kaepernick supporters have tried to start a movement with the goal of forcing the NFL to hire the player.\u000a\u000aFilmmaker Spike Lee, for instance, announced support of a rally to be held in front of NFL headquarters in New York City to force the league to give Kap a new job.\u000a\u000aDespite that Lee doesn\u2019t seem to be aware that his favored quarterback\u2019s name is spelled with two e\u2019s and not just one, Lee pushed out a Tweet announcing a rally date of August 23:\u000a\u000apic.twitter.com/AejLPaaWHD \u2014 Spike Lee (@SpikeLee) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aHowever, at least for one sportswriter, the whole campaign looks like an Al Sharpton-styled shakedown.\u000a\u000aIn an appearance on Fox News, Fox Sports 1 host Jason Whitlock called the campaign an \u201cinvasion of progressive ideology and the progressive movement into the National Football League and sports.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe continued to disparage the effort saying, \u201cThis, to me, is starting to smell like a shakedown of the NFL and the NFL ownership. Colin Kaepernick, the false narrative, that he\u2019s out of the league because all the owners are racist and he\u2019s being blackballed. Listen, this is simply a case of a guy who\u2019s not good enough \u2014 his talents aren\u2019t good enough to justify all the attention and noise and controversy that comes along with him.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis has a ring of truth to it, if Kaepernick were the standout quarterback that his supporters think he is, he\u2019d be working right now whether he hates the U.S. or not. While Kaepernick isn\u2019t the worst quarterback in the NFL, his skills just aren\u2019t good enough to allow his profile to rise above the trouble he\u2019d bring to whatever team unfortunate enough to hire him.\u000a\u000aTo drive the Sharpton shakedown point home, Whitlock concluded by saying, \u201cThis is like the Tawana Brawley of football, this false narrative that we have going here.\u201d\u000a\u000aYou may recall that in 1987, the 15-year-old African American Brawley claimed six white men raped her. It was later discovered that she lied about the incident. Though, not before a then-rotund Al Sharpton used Brawley\u2019s case to burnish his community activist credentials, by stirring up near riotous protests. It was all a hoax, but Sharpton cashed in on the incident and used it to help bolster his national prominence.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com

A former Venezuelan diplomat at the embassy in Iraq has accused the government of selling authentic Venezuelan passports to Shiite terrorists across the regime for up to $15,000 each, years after Spanish journalist Emili Blasco revealed that then-foreign minister Nicolás Maduro met Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Damascus in 2007 to discuss the execution of this very scheme.\u000a\u000aIn February, the U.S. Treasury branded El Aissami a \u201cSpecially Designated Narcotics Trafficker\u201d for ties to a variety of international drug traffickers:\u000a\u000aEl Aissami received payment for the facilitation of drug shipments belonging to Venezuelan drug kingpin Walid Makled Garcia.

aVBallotpedia Editor-at-Large Scott Rasmussen highlights in an article why Obamacare remains so unpopular.\u000a\u000aObamacare requires that every American must have health insurance or pay a penalty. Last year, 6.5 million U.S. citizens chose to pay the Obamacare penalty rather than purchase health insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently revealed that 15 million Americans would drop their Obamacare insurance coverage if they were not mandated to purchase insurance.\u000a\u000aRasmussen notes that Americans do not necessarily want to forgo health insurance, they might just want to purchase more affordable health insurance that fits their specific needs. Obamacare requires that every insurance policy cover a wide range of services, otherwise known as essential health benefits. Rasmussen contends, \u201cThe more benefits that a plan covers, the more expensive it is. Some people might prefer to buy less comprehensive insurance at a lower cost. For example, one option might be to buy insurance only for major healthcare costs such as surgeries or hospitalizations.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeveral Republican bills tried to adjust some essential health benefits that a health insurer must provide. The House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA) contained waivers that would allow states to eliminate some essential health benefits. The Senate\u2019s Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) contained an amendment sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) that would have allowed health insurers to provide more affordable health insurance plans that do not comply with Obamacare\u2019s essential health benefits as long as they provided plans that did comply with the Obamacare regulations.\u000a\u000aThe Ballotpedia editor-at-large believes that the rising cost of health care due to Obamacare also drives down wage growth. Rasmussen charged, \u201cIf the cost of benefits were the same today as a generation ago, the average pay for full-time workers would be more than $3,300 higher annually. Some people might prefer a bigger paycheck and less comprehensive coverage.\u201d\u000a\u000aBob Laszewski, a healthcare policy analyst, argues that the unpopularity of Obamacare calls into question the long-term stability of the individual health insurance market. Laszewski pointed out that \u201conly about 40 percent of those eligible for subsidies have signed up for coverage. In what other business or government program would such a dismal acceptance by those it was targeted to serve be considered a success?\u201d

He notes that tens of thousands of Cuban soldiers, military officials, doctors, and bureaucrats keep the Venezuelan government functioning and help train the Venezuelan military, which in turn stands accused of myriad human rights abuses against peaceful protesters.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout the direct tutelage of Raúl Castro, his military junta, the Communist Party of Cuba, the Revolutionary Armed Forces, and the entire intelligence and counterintelligence apparatus of the Castro \u2026 the government of Maduro would have succumbed already,\u201d Alvarez argues.\u000a\u000aHe couches his conclusion in the sheer number of Cuban agents operating in Venezuela: three generals, 12 colonels/lieutenant colonels, six frigate captains, and 25 other military officials, for starters. Alvarez estimates that there are nine battalions worth of Cuban foot soldiers doing the bidding of these officials, a total of at least 4,500 troops occupying Venezuela. To these Alvarez adds \u201cover 34,000 doctors and Cuban health professionals with orders to defend the tyranny with firearms.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThousands of other Cubans play key roles\u201d in the bureaucracy and in the nation\u2019s intelligence services, he adds, noting that the Cuban government controls Maduro\u2019s personal security team.\u000a\u000aAlvarez is far from the first to note that the Cuban regime has essentially colonized Venezuela, entrenching itself in every facet of government power. \u201cThere are currently about 15,000 Cubans in Venezuela,\u201d Organization of American States (OAS) chief Luis Almagro told the U.S. Congress last month. \u201cIt\u2019s like an occupation army from Cuba in Venezuela.\u201d\u000a\u000aDiego Arria, a former U.N. Security Council chief, told Breitbart News in May that he estimated 50,000 Cuban agents, including civilians, had established themselves in Venezuela. \u201cThis is more than the number of forces that Spain had occupying Venezuela during our war of independence. I am not saying that these 50,000 Cubans are all soldiers, but thousands of them are trained for these ends,\u201d he noted. \u201cHow do you remove that simply with an election replacing one government with another?\u201d\u000a\u000aGiven Cuba\u2019s vested interest in keeping Maduro in power, the communist regime has been among the most vocal supporters of Maduro\u2019s July 30 election to establish the \u201cnational constituents\u2019 assembly\u201d (ANC), an illegal law making body Maduro created to usurp the power of the democratically elected National Assembly. In remarks this week, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez issued his \u201ccongratulations\u201d to Venezuela for installing the illegal legislature through a widely condemned fraudulent vote.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe reiterate all our loyalty\u201d to Venezuela, Rodríguez said. \u201cIt is undeniable that the people of Venezuela has [sic] made its voice heard and chosen their path \u2026 despite the unconventional war waged against Venezuela, its people have rendered an extraordinary lesson in democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCongratulations to the government and people of Venezuela for their extraordinary display of democracy, conviction, loyalty, and valor,\u201d he concluded.\u000a\u000aThe \u201cextraordinary display of democracy\u201d has elicited near-universal condemnation, including from the electoral technology company that lended its services to the Venezuelan government. Smartmatic officials say they have irrefutable evidence that Venezuelan officials tampered with the number of votes counted in the election.\u000a\u000aRodríguez\u2019s comments came during a regular meeting of the Bolivarian Alliance of the Peoples (ALBA), a radical Marxist regional body Cuba and Venezuela created to counter the influence of the democratic Organization of American States. At the ALBA meeting, those convened called sanctions by the U.S. on Maduro himself and other officials for widespread human rights abuses \u201ca clear violation of international rights and human rights.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn his study, Alvarez cites Cuban influence as a key concern but adds that Hezbollah terrorists, cocaine traffickers, and assorted international criminals have also found a friend in Caracas, citing reports that Venezuela\u2019s vice president Tareck El Aissami led an effort to provide up to 15,000 authentic Venezuelan passports to Hezbollah members ineligible to get them due to their status as Syrian, Lebanese, and other Mideast nation citizens.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

aVA course entitled \u201cFat Studies\u201d at Oregon State University argues that \u201cweightism\u201d is a civil rights issue, making it harder for overweight Americans to get ahead.\u000a\u000aThe course, which will be offered in the spring, will examine \u201cbody weight, shape, and size as an area of human difference subject to privilege and discrimination that intersects with other systems of oppression based on gender, race, class, age, sexual orientation, and ability.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe course will be taught by instructor Patti Lou Watkins, who penned an article in European Health Psychologist, which argued that humans can be healthy at any body weight, an endorsement of the widely-panned \u201cHealth At Any Size\u201d movement. Body size isn\u2019t a good indicator of health, she argues. To Watkins, even individuals who can be classified as morbidly obese could be healthy.\u000a\u000aWatkins also dismissed the effectiveness in dieting. \u201cThe validity of HAES is supported by research over the past decade that reveals the continued ineffectiveness of dieting interventions targeting weight loss along with the potential for harm associated with these strategies,\u201d she writes. Surely, thousands of Americans who have lost weight and lowered their risk for certain medical conditions beg to differ with Watkin\u2019s argument.\u000a\u000a\u201cI grew to embrace feminist pedagogy in terms of course content as well as classroom practices,\u201d Watkins explains. \u201cMy course now frames body image disturbances more as a function of oppressive societal structures than of individual pathology.\u201d\u000a\u000aOddly enough, Watkin\u2019s is not the only class at Oregon State University on \u201cfatphobia.\u201d Another course, entitled \u201cWomen, Weight, and Body Image,\u201d exams \u201cweightism\u201d through the intersectionality lens. This means that individuals who are both overweight and a member of another minority group (female, Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ, etc.) are subjected to a system of oppression directed both at their body size and their minority status.\u000a\u000aActivists have been arguing for several years that Western culture is \u201cfatphobic\u201d for the ways in which overweight people are treated. Advocates for this line of thinking about weight often argue that airplanes seats are not built for overweight individuals. They use this and other examples such as the social stigma around being overweight as evidence of the \u201cfatphobia\u201d that they believe permeates throughout Western society.

aVPollster and political analyst Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday regarding Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s complaints about President Trump\u2019s expectations for a Republican Congress and the president\u2019s tough talk on North Korea.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with an insane man, or kid, in North Korea,\u201d said Caddell, adding he is \u201cnot so sure\u201d President Trump\u2019s rhetoric was out of line in trying to make Kim Jong-un understand.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve listened to the moaning and the groaning\u201d about Trump\u2019s rhetoric, added Caddell, \u201cbut he got a message, and now Mattis has followed up. They need to understand the consequences. It doesn\u2019t mean [Trump] wants nuclear war.\u201d\u000a\u000aCaddell went on to say, \u201cThe answer is, we\u2019ve had failed negotiations with North Korea since we had Clinton, Bush, and Obama. And the Clinton one was a particular joke because Wendy Sherman, the architect of the sell-out to Iran, was the woman who negotiated the deal that President Clinton told us was going to solve everything; it was a wonderful arrangement. And the North Koreans just blew right through it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for issues with Congress, Caddell said, \u201cThe McConnell stuff, I found just amazing. I mean, McConnell\u2019s talk the other day, so condescending to the president.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat does he think we do here? Well, I don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d said Caddell, mimicking McConnell.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no idea what these people do there,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aCaddell also blasted Republicans in Congress for not having a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare on day one, saying they were caught off guard because they did not think Trump would win and have often been oppositional to him.\u000a\u000aSaid Caddell, \u201cLook at what the Senate did. It didn\u2019t even recess so he could appoint recess appointments. That\u2019s what the Democrats would have done. All these positions he can\u2019t move through the Senate, he could have appointed them the day they recessed. But they made sure he couldn\u2019t.

aVOn Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d Guam\u2019s Governor, Eddie Baza Calvo (R) argued that while war has to be the last resort, he wants a president who says that if any nation attacks the US, they\u2019ll be met \u201cwith hell and fury.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aCalvo said there is \u201cconcern and worry, but there is no panic.\u201d He cited prior threats by North Korea made against Guam.\u000a\u000aHe added, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, as an American citizen, I want a president that says that if any nation, such as North Korea, attacks Guam, attacks Honolulu, attacks the West Coast, that they will be met with hell and fury. What I\u2019m concerned about is if a US Senator, [Lindsey Graham (R-SC)] says initiate an attack, and causing alarm and remembering that there are in the Mariana Islands, this is American, sovereign soil. \u2026 So it\u2019s important that, as we make decisions, that those folks that are in a position of leadership that they understand, too, that war is the last option. Because not only will tens of thousands of American military forces and dependents be affected by a regional war, but because the western Pacific has American soil in it, that a couple hundred thousand Americans could get caught in the crosshairs. So, I think it\u2019s important to be very strong, at the same time, be calm. I\u2019ve had enough briefings with the military, that there is a multi-layered defense, starting from Korea and Japan as well as in the western Pacific, as well as our terrestrial assets here in Guam with the THAAD missile defense system that American communities\u2026will be protected.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

aVLast week we brought you word that ESPN\u2019s subscriber loss had continued, while rival FS1 had seen significant gains. So, perhaps it should come as no shock to learn, that ESPN is hemorrhaging money as well as subscribers.\u000a\u000aWhen tracing the origin of much of Disney\u2019s financial woes, Bloomberg lays much of the blame at the feet of the company\u2019s struggling cable division: \u201cProfits at the company\u2019s cable networks division fell 23 percent to $1.46 billion, due to higher programming costs and lower ad revenue.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhen industry analysts mention Disney\u2019s cable networks division, they\u2019re mentioning ESPN. Which makes up the lion share of all the \u201cMagic Kingdom\u2019s\u201d cable offerings.\u000a\u000aThose numbers add up to nothing short of a disaster for ESPN, who has embraced a failing business model. Not solely by infecting the airwaves with unsolicited and obnoxious leftist politics, but also by investing in the NBA. Which has seen their rights fees grow exponentially, while at the same time becoming an increasingly non-competitive sport dominated by personalities who have become unlikeable.\u000a\u000aBloomberg also notes, \u201cDisney set off a meltdown in media stocks two years ago when the company acknowledged that ESPN, its most profitable network, was losing business as consumers canceled their cable TV subscriptions. The company has since cut costs, terminating on-air personalities while also looking to stem the viewer losses by extending ESPN into new, lower-cost pay-TV packages. Disney plans to introduce an online-only, subscription version of ESPN this year.\u201d\u000a\u000aESPN has made much of their efforts to transition to online-only digital subscriptions and streaming, while this kind of talk no doubt tickles the fancy of murse carrying millennials in New York and Chicago. This effort is almost certainly doomed to fail. For any sports network to have success: whether the network\u2019s platform is television, radio, or internet, they must show games that people care about.\u000a\u000aNo sports network, in this day and age, would consent to letting their best product air on an online-only, subscription channel. Maybe twenty years from now, a futuristic version of Al Michaels and Chris Collinsworth will appear weekly on more mobile devices, than they do people\u2019s living rooms. However, that day is not now. EPSN\u2019s techy digital talk is nothing but a mask vainly hoping to disguise the fact that the network has no real plan to revive their business. Because they\u2019ve embraced failed policies and failed ideologies while insanely hoping those tried and failed methods produce a different result.\u000a\u000aBut of course, that\u2019s what liberals do.

Except when it isn\u2019t,\u201d declared Lucas. \u201cEaton points out that employees are allowed to talk among themselves about working conditions. This is why your boss can\u2019t ban you from sharing your salary with your co-workers. But working conditions aren\u2019t limited to salary discussions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe purpose of his essay was to talk about what he perceived as a need for change in the company.

When we talk about affirmative action, federal law allows you to hire a woman or minority candidate over a male or white candidate if both are equally qualified. But what it doesn\u2019t allow you to do is hire a less qualified female or minority candidate,\u201d she continued. \u201cDamore believed Google\u2019s policies were doing just that. To be protected, \u2018the engineer doesn\u2019t have to be right that some of Google\u2019s diversity initiatives are unlawful, only that he reasonably believes that they are.'\u201d\u000a\u000aYesterday we reported that Damore is reportedly exploring legal remedies.\u000a\u000aLucas then concluded her article, predicting, \u201cI\u2019m sure a lawsuit will be forthcoming.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

aVAug. 10 (UPI) \u2014 There is a shortage of available organs for all the patients waiting for organ transplants in the United States, but researchers at Harvard University say using organs from animal sources could help close that gap.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aResearchers at Harvard University report in a new study that they have used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique to enable pig-to-human organ transplantation without disease transfer, which could help lessen the number of patients who do not receive an organ transplant because of shortages.\u000a\u000aWhile there were 33,600 organ transplants in 2016, the 116,800 patients on organ transplant lists may not have to wait much longer.\u000a\u000aThe research, published today in Science, showed that some of the problems with xenotransplantation, the process of transplanting organs or tissue between different species, could be overcome with gene-editing techniques.\u000a\u000aA main concern with pig-to-human organ transplantation is not only immunological compatibility, but also the risk of cross-species transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses, or PERVs.\u000a\u000aPERVs have been shown to infect human cells and previous research has shown the horizontal transfer of PERVs among human cells.\u000a\u000aTo overcome this, researchers used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique to inactivate all the PERVs in a porcine primary cell line and generated PERV-inactivated pigs through somatic cell nuclear transfer.\u000a\u000aDr. David Klassen told The New York Times that if pig organs were safe and effective to transplant into humans \u201cthey could be a real game changer.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough pig heart valves are routinely transplanted into heart patients, xenotransplantation still faces some religious and ethical obstacles. While most major religious groups say pig organs are acceptable in the case of lifesaving transplantation, one example that could be a problem for Jewish and Muslim patients is accepting a kidney transplant, because dialysis is a viable alternative.

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 In a speech following Israel\u2019s defensive 2014 war against the Hamas terrorist group, embattled White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster sidestepped a question about whether the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted itself in an ethical manner, instead providing what McMaster admitted was a \u201cnon-answer.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IDF is known to go to extreme lengths to operate ethically and protect civilians when fighting Palestinian jihadists who use civilians as human shields, launch rocket attacks from civilian zones and house their terrorist infrastructures in densely populated civilian areas.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAudio of the speech can be heard here. (McMaster\u2019s Israel comments start at the 56 minute mark).\u000a\u000aAt a December 4, 2014 speech to the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, an audience member asked McMaster a direct question about the ethics of the IDF\u2019s conduct in that year\u2019s war against Hamas and in other wars.\u000a\u000aMcMaster was asked: \u201cFirstly, would you consider the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] conduct of the recent war and prior wars as a template for the ethical conduct of war?\u201d\u000a\u000aHere is a transcript of McMaster\u2019s reply, which he admitted was a \u201cnon-answer\u201d:\u000a\u000aOkay. So quickly on that, in terms of the IDF actions and how to evaluate them, I think you could evaluate them based on jus ad bellum sort of criteria of proportionality and distinction and so forth. I\u2019m not the best judge of it. I\u2019ve been following it in the media. I can\u2019t really tell. I do know that they\u2019re responding to attacks. What you\u2019re asking is, was the response proportional? Now, there\u2019s different kinds of proportionality. There\u2019s proportionality in war, and then there\u2019s a broader sort of humanitarian standard that I think, at times, doesn\u2019t apply as a complete transfer over to wartime situations. So that\u2019s kind of a non-answer, sorry, to your first question.\u000a\u000aA defender of Israel or even an objective observer would have noted that Israel goes beyond what almost any other country does to protect civilians and that the IDF is one of the most ethical militaries in the world. The IDF operates under the guidelines of international law, including the Law of Armed Conflict, and imposes its own, even stricter codes.\u000a\u000aThe IDF regularly warns those in civilian areas of incoming attacks with phone calls and text messages even though the terrorist targets will likely also learn about the warning. It employs \u201croof knocking\u201d \u2013 or firing warning shots before any aerial bombing where civilians may be present. If civilians still don\u2019t evacuate, the Israeli army many times makes announcements on loudspeakers. In the 2014 war, the IDF called off numerous military raids because civilians were in the way.\u000a\u000aDespite its enormous firepower, the IDF severely restrains itself in order to minimize civilian casualties. To protect Palestinian civilians, the IDF has many times risked the lives of its own soldiers on house-to-house missions and other urban combat instead of using aerial power.\u000a\u000aThe IDF relates of the 2014 war:\u000a\u000aThe IDF took various steps to mitigate the risk of harm to civilian objects and the civilian population, including measures not required by the Law of Armed Conflict. Precautionary measures included a multi-layered system of effective advance warnings, sophisticated verification procedures, and the careful choice of means and methods of warfare (including munitions, timing and angle of attack). \u2026 In addition, Israel requires that any means of warfare used during its military operations accord with Israel\u2019s obligations under international law. Thus, for example, high-explosive artillery was required by IDF directives to be used in accordance with the rules of the Law of Armed Conflict. Beyond these requirements, the IDF puts great efforts and resources into minimizing the possibility of harm to civilians that results from the use of such weaponry \u2013 for instance, by imposing stringent limitations on the use of certain weapons (including high-explosive artillery) in populated areas.\u000a\u000aThe 2014 war started after Hamas broke a ceasefire and launched multiple rockets into Israel aimed at civilian neighborhoods. Israel evacuated the Gaza Strip in 2005 in hopes that the territory would be used to create a moderate coastal enclave. Instead, Hamas took over and has since utilized Gaza to build an enormous terrorist infrastructure \u2013 much of which utilizes civilian zones, including terror tunnels that snake under cities. Palestinian jihadist groups, including Hamas, have used Gaza to stage attacks against Israeli cities.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), the oldest pro-Israel group in the country, released an analysis of McMaster\u2019s policies and reported views, concluding that he should be reassigned outside the NSC after it found that McMaster may be undermining Trump\u2019s stated national security agenda.\u000a\u000aThe analysis states:\u000a\u000aWe find it hard to understand how someone who clearly has animus toward Israel, who supports the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, who opposes calling out radical Islamist terrorists, who fires Trump loyalists and supporters of Israel and opponents of Iran, who hires those opposed to President Trump\u2019s policies especially on Israel and Iran, who refused to acknowledge that the Western Wall is in Israel, who opposes Israeli counterterrorism measures, and who shuts down joint U.S. counterterrorism programs that are of enormous value to U.S. security, can faithfully serve President Trump as top national security advisor. President Trump made it crystal clear, both before and since his election, that supporting Israel and the U.S.-Israel alliance, abrogating or at least vigorously enforcing the Iran deal while calling out and sanctioning Iran\u2019s violations, confronting radical Islamist terrorism, and draining the Washington swamp were key, distinguishing policies of his administration.\u000a\u000aThe ZOA\u2019s analysis cited Breitbart News articles from this reporter on McMaster\u2019s background.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, Breitbart News reported that McMaster served at a UK-based think tank financed by a controversial, George Soros-funded group identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.\u000a\u000aFrom September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster was listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow. The IISS describes itself as a \u201cworld-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart also reported that IISS is bankrolled by multinational corporate firms doing billions of dollars in business in Iran.\u000a\u000aAnd IISS quietly took in about $32.5 million in funding from Bahrain, a country whose constitution explicitly enshrines Sharia Islamic law as its governing doctrine, Breitbart News documented.\u000a\u000aThe funding from Bahrain, a repressive regime with a dismal human rights track record but also an important regional U.S. ally, reportedly amounted to one quarter of the think tank\u2019s total income.\u000a\u000aA significant portion of the Bahraini funding reportedly pays for the think tank\u2019s annual conference in Bahrain, the Mamana Dialogue. The original agreement between IISS and Bahrain to finance the conference contained a clause calling for the memorandum of understanding to remain confidential, according to the document, which was leaked by a watchdog and published by the Guardian newspaper last year.\u000a\u000aAs a member of IISS, McMaster participated in the Sixth Mamana Dialogue summit in Bahrain from December 11 to December 13, 2009, Breitbart News found.

aVTEL AVIV \u2013 The underground wall that Israel is building to stop the terror group Hamas\u2019 cross-border tunnels from Gaza will also stretch into the Mediterranean to prevent infiltration from the sea, the Jerusalem Post reported Wednesday.\u000a\u000aDuring the 50-day summer conflict with Gaza in 2014, five Hamas terror naval commandos attempted to enter Israel by sea but were caught and killed by the navy. Hamas has since expanded its naval commando unit significantly, with the number of frogmen swelling to 1,500.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aEven though Hamas has been keeping hostilities to a minimum in recent months, the construction of the barrier may provoke future attacks.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, head of the Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Eyal Zamir warned that even though the wall is being built solely on Israeli territory, it could \u201cpotentially lead to a dangerous escalation.\u201d He added, however, that Operation Protective Edge showed that Israel needs a solution to the tunnel problem.\u000a\u000aConstruction of the $530 million barrier began last summer and will take two years to complete. Embedded with advanced tunnel-detecting monitoring devices, the wall is made from European bentonite and stretches up to 20 feet above ground. Purpose-built sensors collect information from the ground, including the length and location of the tunnel, and transmit it to control systems where advanced algorithms decipher the data.\u000a\u000aThe IDF, the Shin Bet security agency and dozens of companies \u2013 including Iron Dome developers Elbit Systems and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems \u2014 are said to be involved in assembling the barrier.\u000a\u000aDuring the 2014 war against Hamas, Israel found and destroyed more than 30 Hamas tunnels.\u000a\u000aZamir said the terror group is continuing to expand its \u201cmetro system\u201d of tunnels, which, in addition to tunnels for the purposes of executing terror attacks on Israeli soil, include smuggling conduits into Egypt as well as command centers and weapons caches. Many of them, he said, stretch under residential homes in the Gaza Strip.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny civilians who stay in these buildings endanger their lives and the lives of their families. It\u2019s Hamas who endangers them first and foremost, but every building over a tunnel is a legitimate military target,\u201d Zamir said.\u000a\u000a\u201cPart of Hamas\u2019s combat strategy is to conduct itself within civilian areas, which is intended to make it difficult for the IDF to locate, attack and destroy the group\u2019s military infrastructure,\u201d Zamir stated, adding that by drawing Israeli fire to these buildings, Hamas aims to delegitimize Israel and the IDF.

aVNEW YORK, NY \u2014 This week, progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) joined Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) in opposing the bipartisan Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720), claiming the bill violates the First Amendment right to support boycotting Israel and the settlements by penalizing U.S. citizens.\u000a\u000aThe boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement is an anti-Israel effort that seeks to cripple the Middle Eastern democracy\u2019s legitimacy by targeting it financially and subjecting it to left-wing propaganda.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not support the boycott.

aVUNITED NATIONS \u2013 A top United Nations development agency is carrying out a project to make North Korea \u2013 a country where most residents are in the dark at night and where many of its people are starving \u2013 more ozone-friendly.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has been allocated a budget of $798,247 as part of a worldwide effort to phase out hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which an agency official tells Breitbart News are \u201cscientifically proven as ozone depleting substances and controlled under the Montreal Protocol.\u201d According to the project\u2019s website, it has already spent $466,375.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe funding was approved by the Executive Committee of Multilateral Fund for Implementation of Montreal Protocol (MLF EC), at which the U.S. has a representative. That fund is \u201cdedicated to reversing the deterioration of the Earth\u2019s ozone layer\u201d and was set up after the 1989 Montreal Protocol, which sought to reverse the damage done to the ozone layer.\u000a\u000aSince North Korea is a party to the Montreal Protocol, it is eligible to receive funding for a project for HCFC phase-out, and UNIDO was chosen as the lead implementing agency for the project.\u000a\u000aThe project, which looks to bring North Korea into the Montreal Protocol\u2019s compliance target of a 15 percent reduction of HCFCs by 2018, was approved in 2014. It includes a conversion of a number of factories that currently use HCFCs, an \u201cimprovement of recovery and recycling scheme,\u201d as well as money set aside for \u201cawareness-raising and public education.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne contract under the project hands a whopping $265,000 to a Chinese company for the replacement of HCFCs at a foam factory in Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aOther countries such as Saudi Arabia, India, and numerous others have also been implementing what is known as the \u201cHCFC Phase-out Management Plan,\u201d but such countries are not involved in a widely-condemned race to manufacture nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aA U.S.-drafted resolution Saturday slapped sanctions on North Korea\u2019s exports of iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore, and seafood, as well as limiting business collaborations with the rogue regime, in response to two intercontinental ballistic missile launches in July.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported Tuesday that the regime now has the capability to load miniature nuclear warheads into missiles, while Fox News reported that the regime has been loading cruise missiles onto ships \u2013 signs that North Korea has been undeterred by U.S. efforts and is pushing forward with its military escalation.\u000a\u000aPerhaps more jarring about the ozone-efficiency project is how the U.N. is focusing on making North Korea more energy efficient when it is already a country that not only starves its people but plunges its people into darkness at night.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News asked UNIDO if the contract was connected to possible rocket-building concerns. A NASA fact sheet notes that HCFC-141b, among its many domestic uses, can be used as a blowing agent to create a foam that can be used to coat rockets. However, UNIDO told Breitbart that environmental reasons were the sole reason for the contract, which is focused on the implementation of the Montreal Protocol.\u000a\u000a\u201cHence the project implemented by UNIDO will result in zero import/consumption of HCFC-141b in DPR Korea after 2018 while without the project the country would continue to import and consume the chemical,\u201d a UNIDO spokesperson said.\u000a\u000aAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

The AP notes that their sources believe a \u201ccovert sonic device\u201d triggered the symptoms, but there is no confirmation that the Cuban government possessed or used such a device.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe communist government in Cuba has denied any acts of physical hostility against American diplomats despite its long history of harassment and abuse of Americans on the island.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome U.S. government personnel who were working at our embassy in Havana, Cuba on official duty \u2026 reported some incidents which have caused a variety of physical symptoms,\u201d spokeswoman Nauert told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe asked two officials who were accredited in the embassy of Cuba in the United States to depart the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aNauert confirmed that the Cubans left Washington on May 23. She added a reminder that \u201cthe Cuban government has a responsibility and obligation to protect our diplomats.\u201d\u000a\u000aNauert refused, however, to expand upon what sorts of \u201csymptoms\u201d the \u201cincidents\u201d caused, what the \u201cincidents\u201d were, or who or how many people were involved. She also did not note whether the expulsion of Cuban diplomats from Washington was a move to balance the number of diplomats in each country or whether those expelled were involved in the \u201cincidents.\u201d The diplomats were not declared persona non grata, permitting them to return to the United States at a later date.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reported that the individuals who left the American embassy in Havana did so \u201cwith severe hearing loss attributed to a covert sonic device.\u201d The report estimated that \u201cabout five\u201d diplomats and spouses were affected and that American investigators had not yet concluded whether \u201cthe device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat investigators appear to have confirmed, according to the AP, is that \u201cthe diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences.\u201d\u000a\u000aA subsequent report from CNN compared the symptoms aside from the hearing loss as resembling those of a concussion, suggesting that the sonic devices can damage a brain in a way similar to a physical blow. CNN quotes an unnamed official who stated, \u201cWe have worked with the Cubans to try and find out what is going on. They insist they don\u2019t know, but it has been very worrying and troublesome.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Barack Obama reopened the U.S. embassy in Havana in 2015 following the announcement of a new, pro-Castro American policy that would allow American businesses to further enrich the Castro regime while accepting Raúl Castro\u2019s repeated demands that \u201cnothing\u201d would be expected from the regime in return, in particular, respect for international human rights norms.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry (MINREX) responded to the incident in a statement published in Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC).\u000a\u000a\u201cCuba addressed this matter with utmost seriousness and has acted with promptness and professionalim to clarify the situation,\u201d the statement read, \u201cinitiating an exhaustive, prioritized, and urgent investigation at the highest levels of the Cuban government.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe statement also complains about the expulsion of the Cuban diplomats, saying, \u201cOn May 23, the Department of State informed the Cuban embassy in Washington of the decision that two Cuban diplomats abandon the territory of the United States, which motivated a protest by the Foreign Relations Ministry against this unjustified and unfounded decision.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe objection to removing the Cuban agents suggests that American officials did not merely want to reduce the number of staff in the embassy to balance the numbers following the departure of American officials from Havana.\u000a\u000aThe incident is the first to occur since Obama officially reopened the embassy, but far from the only case of suspected harassment of American diplomats in Cuba. Before it became an official embassy again, the U.S. embassy building in Havana still hosted some American diplomats, who were reportedly treated to routine harassment by passersby and Cuban government agents alike.\u000a\u000aIn 2012, the Miami Herald quoted a U.S. State Department official who said American diplomats on the island were treated regularly to \u201charassment and contempt\u201d including Cuban government agents \u201cshouting insults at them from their cars, publishing photos of their vehicles,\u201d and harassing diplomats\u2019 children.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have reminded the Cuban government on various occasions that, under the Vienna Convention, this type of treatment of diplomatic personnel is unacceptable,\u201d the State Department official said at the time.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban government temporarily halted such treatment of Americans in March 2016, when then-president Obama embarked on his \u201chistoric\u201d visit to watch a baseball game with Raúl Castro on the island. While the Cubans refrained from insulting Obama in person, state media referred to Obama as a \u201cnegro\u201d who came to Cuba to \u201cincite rebellion and disorder\u201d shortly after his visit. By January 2017, Cuban soldiers were performing military exercises chanting slogans about putting \u201clead\u201d in Obama\u2019s head and body.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump has vowed to reverse Obama\u2019s Cuba policies, adopting strategies to ensure that American tourist money does not enrich the regime. Trump has made no moves to shut the Cuban embassy down, however, and Nauert did not make any remarks regarding an end to the dangerous diplomatic project begun under Obama in her press conference Wednesday.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

aVAs the surge of illegal aliens continues to mount in South Texas, Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector capped off a busy day by arresting one group of 86 illegal aliens and seizing more than $1 million worth of marijuana. Agents also carried out a rescue of an illegal alien lost in the brush and, unfortunately, recovered the remains of another migrant who was not as lucky. All of these incidents occurred in the RGV Sector on Monday.\u000a\u000aAgents working out of the Weslaco Border Patrol Station observed a large group of people walking up a trail from the Rio Grande River in Hidalgo, Texas, Monday evening. The scene was reminiscent of the 2014 border surge when the illegal immigrants could be seen walking up from the river border by the dozens. The agents apprehended the group without incident.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAgents determined the number of people in the group to be 86, all of whom admitted to having crossed the border illegally.\u000a\u000aAfter taking the migrants to the Weslaco station for processing, agents learned all 86 came from Guatemala. The group consisted of 36 adults and 50 juveniles. Of that, 32 of the adults were traveling with family members and four adults traveled alone. Thirty-four of the minors were traveling with an adult as part of a family unit, Border Patrol Supervisory Agent Marlene Castro told Breitbart Texas in an email response to a request for additional information. Sixteen of the minors were traveling as Unaccompanied Alien Children.\u000a\u000aThe apprehension of Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) and Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) increased in July for the third straight month, Breitbart Texas reported on Wednesday. FMUA apprehensions increased by 46 percent from June to July while UAC apprehensions increased by 29 percent. Total apprehensions increased by only 13 percent revealing how the numbers of families and children are increasing substantially again.\u000a\u000aThe day began for the RGV agents assigned to the Rio Grande City Station when they observed an SUV driving at a high rate of speed at about 1:30 Monday morning near the town of Los Arrieros, Texas. Agents pursued the vehicle which eventually crashed into a utility pole. The driver fled the scene but left behind 75 bundles of marijuana. Officials said the marijuana load weighed nearly 1,400 pounds and estimated the value to be in excess of $1 million. Agents turned the vehicle and drugs over to the Drug Enforcement Administration for investigation.\u000a\u000aLater that morning, dispatchers from the Brooks County Sheriff\u2019s Office received a call from an alien lost in the brush. Human smugglers frequently drop off their cargo south of the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint located in the middle of the county and lead them on a dangerous march through the ranch lands surrounding the checkpoint. Migrants frequently die when the smugglers leave them behind if they become injured or too weak to keep up.\u000a\u000aBorder Patrol agents went to the GPS location of the phone and found the man. Agents offered the man medical assistance but he declined. Officials did not indicate the man\u2019s nationality.\u000a\u000aLater that afternoon, agents assigned to the Kingsville Station received a call about an immigrant who was not as fortunate as the one in Brooks County. The Kenedy County Sheriff\u2019s Office contacted Border Patrol dispatchers and advised them that a local rancher discovered the remains of a migrant who died after being abandoned in the area. Agents recovered the remains after a local justice of the peace declared the man to be dead. Agents found identification documents of a Honduran national near the body.\u000a\u000aDespite the historically low number of border crossing this year, the numbers of illegal aliens dying while attempting to enter the U.S. is higher than last year, Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

aVThe CEO of YouTube, Susan Wojcicki, responded in Fortune to the recent viewpoint diversity memo by James Damore. She claims that she has faced massive discrimination for being a woman working in the technology industry, and that implicit biases still exist within it.\u000a\u000aThe memo in question was released late last week after Damore had circulated among his colleagues at Google. It suggested reasons why there were fewer women working in technology-related fields, and argued for a wider diversity of viewpoints in the company. \u201cWe need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,\u201d Damore wrote. He was swiftly fired as a result, with the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai claiming that he had violated their code of conduct by advancing \u201charmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d despite the fact that numerous psychologists, male and female, deemed the manifesto to be scientifically accurate.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn her piece, Wojcicki, claimed that time and time again she was questioned about her \u201cabilities and commitment,\u201d was left out of \u201ckey industry events and social gatherings,\u201d and had comments \u201cfrequently interrupted and my ideas ignored until they were rephrased by men.\u201d The memo brought up memories of this discrimination against her:\u000a\u000aWhen I saw the memo that circulated last week, I once again felt that pain, and empathized with the pain it must have caused others. I thought about the women at Google who are now facing a very public discussion about their abilities, sparked by one of their own co-workers. I thought about the women throughout the tech field who are already dealing with the implicit biases that haunt our industry\u2026 now confronting them explicitly. I thought about how the gender gap persists in tech despite declining in other STEM fields, how hard we\u2019ve been working as an industry to reverse that trend, and how this was yet another discouraging signal to young women who aspire to study computer science [and] I thought about how tragic it was that this unfounded bias was now being exposed to a new generation.\u000a\u000aAccording to Wojcicki, the decision to fire Damore did not breach his right to freedom of speech, as Google was also free to \u201ctake action\u201d against any comments that \u201cperpetuate negative stereotypes\u201d about women. She went on to posit that nobody would be defending him if his comments were made against other groups:\u000a\u000aWhat if we replaced the word \u201cwomen\u201d in the memo with another group? What if the memo said that biological differences amongst Black, Hispanic, or LGBTQ employees explained their underrepresentation in tech and leadership roles? Would some people still be discussing the merit of the memo\u2019s arguments or would there be a universal call for swift action against its author? I don\u2019t ask this to compare one group to another, but rather to point out that the language of discrimination can take many different forms and none are acceptable or productive.\u000a\u000aDespite this argument, Damore is currently exploring \u201cpossible legal remedies\u201d against Google, revealing to CNBC that he \u201csubmitted a charge to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accusing Google upper management of trying to shame him into silence,\u201d shortly before being fired. In an email, he explained that \u201cit\u2019s illegal to retaliate against an NLRB charge.\u201d He has also been offered employment by both Wikileaks and Gab, the free speech social network.\u000a\u000aIn an ironic twist, over 60 women are reportedly considering a sexism and \u201cpay gap\u201d lawsuit against Google, YouTube\u2019s parent company, according to an interview with James Finsberg, a civil rights attorney, that was published in the Guardian, with the employees \u201cconcerned that women are channeled to levels and positions that pay less than men with similar education and experience.\u201d

aVLast week we brought you word that ESPN\u2019s subscriber loss had continued, while rival FS1 had seen significant gains. So, perhaps it should come as no shock to learn, that ESPN is hemorrhaging money as well as subscribers.\u000a\u000aWhen tracing the origin of much of Disney\u2019s financial woes, Bloomberg lays much of the blame at the feet of the company\u2019s struggling cable division: \u201cProfits at the company\u2019s cable networks division fell 23 percent to $1.46 billion, due to higher programming costs and lower ad revenue.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhen industry analysts mention Disney\u2019s cable networks division, they\u2019re mentioning ESPN. Which makes up the lion share of all the \u201cMagic Kingdom\u2019s\u201d cable offerings.\u000a\u000aThose numbers add up to nothing short of a disaster for ESPN, who has embraced a failing business model. Not solely by infecting the airwaves with unsolicited and obnoxious leftist politics, but also by investing in the NBA. Which has seen their rights fees grow exponentially, while at the same time becoming an increasingly non-competitive sport dominated by personalities who have become unlikeable.\u000a\u000aBloomberg also notes, \u201cDisney set off a meltdown in media stocks two years ago when the company acknowledged that ESPN, its most profitable network, was losing business as consumers canceled their cable TV subscriptions. The company has since cut costs, terminating on-air personalities while also looking to stem the viewer losses by extending ESPN into new, lower-cost pay-TV packages. Disney plans to introduce an online-only, subscription version of ESPN this year.\u201d\u000a\u000aESPN has made much of their efforts to transition to online-only digital subscriptions and streaming, while this kind of talk no doubt tickles the fancy of murse carrying millennials in New York and Chicago. This effort is almost certainly doomed to fail. For any sports network to have success: whether the network\u2019s platform is television, radio, or internet, they must show games that people care about.\u000a\u000aNo sports network, in this day and age, would consent to letting their best product air on an online-only, subscription channel. Maybe twenty years from now, a futuristic version of Al Michaels and Chris Collinsworth will appear weekly on more mobile devices, than they do people\u2019s living rooms. However, that day is not now. EPSN\u2019s techy digital talk is nothing but a mask vainly hoping to disguise the fact that the network has no real plan to revive their business. Because they\u2019ve embraced failed policies and failed ideologies while insanely hoping those tried and failed methods produce a different result.\u000a\u000aBut of course, that\u2019s what liberals do.

aVU.S. District Judge William H. Walls delayed ruling on a motion to dismiss the public corruption charges against Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) until the trial of the senator and his co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, begins in a federal courtroom in New Jersey on September 6.\u000a\u000aMelgen was convicted in April on 67 felony counts of Medicare fraud, many of which are related to illegal billing practices. The public corruption charges brought against Menendez and Melgen by the Department of Justice allege that Menendez engaged in official acts to directly aid Melgen in his efforts to receive payments for the same sort of illegal billing practices for which he was convicted.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn return for his personal lobbying efforts on behalf of Melgen, the federal government alleges Menendez received $58,000 in free travel to the Dominican Republic and Florida (for which Menendez subsequently reimbursed Melgen) and nearly $1 million in direct and indirect campaign contributions to his re-election campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a motion filed July 18, attorneys for Menendez sought to dismiss the charges under a U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned the conviction of former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell in a similar case, narrowing the definition of \u2018official acts\u2019 required under the federal bribery statute,\u201d NJ.com reported:\u000a\u000aThe lawyers argued much of the current superseding indictment describes actions by Menendez\u2019s staffers, rather than the senator himself, \u201cand many involve trivial functions rather than official acts.\u201d \u201cDefendants believe the superseding indictment is hopelessly vague and defective if a jury can find that Senator Menendez took an official act based on everything charged in the \u2018official acts\u2019 section of the superseding indictment, ranging from acts taken by others or acts as innocent as meeting friends of Dr. Melgen, and there is no meaningful way to prepare for a trial involving what breaks down into literally hundreds of individual acts by the government\u2019s count,\u201d the attorneys wrote. Prosecutors allege the doctor provided Menendez with benefits ranging from luxury hotel stays to campaign donations in exchange for the senator lobbying government officials regarding a Medicare dispute and Melgen\u2019s efforts to obtain a port security contract in the Dominican Republic, among other matters.\u000a\u000aA Supreme Court case decided last year, McDonnell v. United States, established the standard of \u201cofficial act.\u201d As Scotus Blog described the McDonnell v. United States opinion announced on June 27, 2016:\u000a\u000aHolding: The federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, makes it a crime for a public official to \u201creceive or accept anything of value\u201d in exchange for being \u201cinfluenced in the performance of any official act.\u201d An \u201cofficial act\u201d is a decision or action on a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d; that question or matter must involve a formal exercise of governmental power, and must also be something specific and focused that is \u201cpending\u201d or \u201cmay by law be brought\u201d before a public official. To qualify as an \u201cofficial act,\u201d the public official must make a decision to take an action on that question or matter, or agree to do so. Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event \u2014 without more \u2014 does not fit that definition of \u201cofficial act.\u201d Because jury instructions in the case of former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell were erroneous, and those errors are not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, McDonnell\u2019s convictions are vacated. Judgment: Vacated and remanded, 8-0, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts on June 27, 2016.\u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court decision reversed a 2014 federal conviction of McDonnell on 11 counts of public corruption, when the jury concluded that he and his wife had \u201cperform[ed] or promise[d] to perform \u2018official acts\u2019 for Williams [a businessman with a line of vitamin products] in exchange for $177,000 in gifts and loans,\u201d the Washington Post reported:\u000a\u000aThose acts, they said, came in the form of meetings McDonnell arranged for Williams with state officials, a luncheon Williams was allowed to throw at the governor\u2019s mansion to help launch a product he was trying to sell, and a guest list Williams was allowed to shape at another mansion reception meant for health-care leaders. Defense attorneys argued otherwise, saying there was no evidence that McDonnell even knew what Williams wanted. And what he did want \u2014 state-funded studies of his company\u2019s dietary supplement, Anatabloc \u2014 he never got, defense attorneys stressed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether the acts alleged in the superseding indictment satisfy the definition of an \u2018official act\u2019 under McDonnell is a factual determination that cannot be resolved before the government has the opportunity to present evidence at trial,\u201d Judge Walls wrote in his court order announced on Wednesday, NJ.com reported:\u000a\u000aEven if the judge did determine some of Menendez\u2019s actions fell outside the definition, he could still allow the case to go to the jury. \u201cUnder McDonnell, evidence of non-official acts may still be relevant evidence in the prosecution of a federal bribery claim,\u201d Walls wrote.\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News reported, Menendez\u2019s conduct in directly lobbying then-Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius on behalf of Melgen\u2019s spurious and rejected $9 million billing claim for the period between 2005 and 2008 (prior to the timeframe of the felony crimes of which he was convicted in his trial) appears to be significantly different than the acts for which McDonnell was convicted, which conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court ruling.\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News reported, Menendez \u201cmet with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Director Marilyn Tavenner on June 7, 2012, in an apparent attempt to persuade her that his close friend and major donor, Dr. Salomon Melgen, did not owe the federal government $9 million for Medicare overbilling\u201d:\u000a\u000aIt was a pure New Jersey-style political power play on Menendez\u2019s part, since the CMS had carefully documented Melgen\u2019s egregious violation of clear and widely understood billing practices. Tavenner was unpersuaded by Menendez\u2019s pitch. He reportedly left the meeting frustrated he had not been able to deliver a solution to his friend\u2019s problems with the government.\u000a\u000aRebuffed by Tavenner, \u201cMenendez decided to turn up the political pressure by speaking to [her] boss, Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius\u201d:\u000a\u000aThe very next day \u2014 June 8, 2012 \u2014 Melgen (through Vitreo-Retinal Consultants, the company HHS said overbilled the federal government by $9 million) contributed $300,000 to the Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC closely aligned with Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). Reid was the Majority Leader then and is currently the Minority Leader. Founded in 2011, the super PAC is co-chaired by two former top staffers from Reid\u2019s office. Ironically, the funds for this generous contribution may well have come from the $9 million CMS says the federal government overpaid Melgen because of his overbilling. CMS has asked for Melgen to repay that money, but Melgen apparently has other uses for it and is fighting desperately to hang on to it. Shortly thereafter, Menendez began pressuring Reid to go over Tavenner\u2019s head and set up a meeting with Sebelius where he could again make the case that his friend really didn\u2019t owe the federal government that $9 million CMS said he had overbilled. The lobbying of Reid by Menendez and his friend Melgen soon became very personal.\u000a\u000a\u201cMelgen\u2019s private jet flew from Florida to Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 2012, presumably carrying Melgen. The next day, on June 18, Melgen\u2019s private jet flew Reid from Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. to Boston and back. It is unclear if Melgen accompanied Reid on that flight, but if he did, the two would have had plenty of time to discuss Melgen\u2019s Medicare overbilling problems, his potential future political donations to Reid\u2019s Senate Majority Super PAC, and what Reid might be willing to do to advance his business interests,\u201d Breitbart News reported:\u000a\u000aOn June 28, 2012, Melgen\u2019s Vitreo-Retinal Consultants contributed an additional $100,000 to Reid\u2019s Super Majority PAC. The next week, on July 2, 2012, Menendez spoke on the phone with CMS\u2019s Tavenner, but made no progress in ending Melgen\u2019s $9 million overbilling problem. Over the next several weeks, Menendez succeeded in persuading Reid to convince Secretary Sebelius to meet with him in person. Reid seems to have summoned Sebelius to Capitol Hill for a meeting with Menendez that he would host in his Senate Majority Leader\u2019s offices.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn August 2012, Sebelius had been summoned to Capitol Hill for a private meeting with Menendez in the office of Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), then the Senate majority leader,\u201d Politico reported in March 2015, one month before Menendez and Melgen were indicted on public corruption charges. It added, \u201cAccording to Sebelius, the topic of the meeting was a multimillion dollar billing dispute between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and a company run by Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.\u201d\u000a\u000aA spokesperson for Mendendez at the time told Politico, \u201cWe have said from the beginning that our office made inquiries regarding the ambiguities in CMS multi-dosing instructions and regulations and the public policy considerations of multi-dosing, continuing, \u201cThat was precisely what Sen. Menendez discussed with the secretary in 2012. It is also our understanding that the DOJ is fully aware that the senator did not mention Melgen during their meeting\u201d:\u000a\u000aBut Sebelius recalled that she had been told the purpose of the meeting was to discuss \u201cbilling issues with Dr. Melgen,\u201d raising red flags that prompted her to take the matter to the HHS counsel\u2019s office before sitting down with the senator. Sebelius said she was \u201cconcerned that I knew enough about the investigation\u201d into Menendez\u2019s actions that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to open the door to any inappropriate discussion\u201d during their meeting. But HHS attorneys assured her that she could meet with Menendez, and she said she told the senator the dispute was being handled by an outside administrative review board. \u2026 \u201cSen. Reid did the convening, but he really wasn\u2019t a participant,\u201d she said. \u201cSen. Menendez laid out concerns of what he thought were rules that had not been fairly or universally applied \u2013 that somehow the rules had changed along the way and the kinds of investigation and denial of billing procedures with this case had seemed different than other cases.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOn October 16, 2012, Melgen\u2019s Vitreo-Retinal Consultants donated another $300,000 to Reid\u2019s Super Majority PAC, bringing the company\u2019s total contributions in 2012 to $700,000. In November 2012, Menendez was easily re-elected to another six-year term in the Senate, defeating his Republican rival by a 58 percent to 39 percent margin, \u201d Breitbart News reported.\u000a\u000aIn the end, the Department of Health and Human Services denied Melgen\u2019s appeal on the $9 million improper billing dispute for the 2005 to 2008 period.\u000a\u000aMelgen continued those billing practices, however, and that conduct ultimately led to his conviction on the 67 felony counts in April.

Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), the Senate Budget Committee Chairman, requested the report to find wasteful spending in government.\u000a\u000aThe GAO detailed how federal agencies spend about $1 billion on public relations activities and roughly 5,000 federal public relations employees receive almost $500 million in annual salary. The GAO found that the CFPB spent the highest percentage of its budget over the last decade.\u000a\u000aSen Enzi said:\u000a\u000aWith increasing pressures on limited federal resources, it is crucial to know how much is spent across the federal government on public relations activities and which federal agencies are spending the most.

aVThe Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its alleged rival al-Qaeda are expanding their Sunni jihadi operations into the disputed Muslim-majority Himalayan region of Kashmir, claimed by Pakistan, India, and China, according to a report published Wednesday.\u000a\u000aCiting unnamed New Delhi intelligence officials, the India-based daily newspaper Mint suggests that ISIS and al-Qaeda are working together in Kashmir, echoing other assessments.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Al-Qaeda lost all ground after Osama bin Laden was killed. So the group has almost been razed to the ground. Any operations they now conduct in Kashmir or elsewhere will be in conjunction with the Islamic State. While the groups have been trying to get a foothold for a while now, we need to keep a hawk\u2019s eye on any change of trend in warfare in the valley,\u201d an Indian intelligence officer told Mint, which is affiliated with the U.S.-based Wall Street Journal (WSJ), on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aSome analysts believe that ISIS and al-Qaeda have indeed collaborated.\u000a\u000aIn Afghanistan, ISIS has been accused of working with Taliban jihadists who are strong al-Qaeda allies.\u000a\u000aA number of experts have forecasted that, should ISIS be defeated, al-Qaeda would incorporate the remnants of the terrorist organization.\u000a\u000aLate last month, al-Qaeda named Zakir Musa as chief of its newly created cell in Kashmir.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe appointment of Zakir Musa as head of the new group represents the first time militants linked to al-Qaida have operated openly in Kashmir, site of a decades-long separatist insurgency and the only Muslim-majority region under Indian control,\u201d reported the Guardian.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe new cell, named Ansar Ghawzat-Ul-Hind, is the deepest inroad al-Qaida has yet made in Kashmir. A 2014 video called on \u2018brothers\u2019 there to wage jihad against Indian authorities,\u201d the news outlet added.\u000a\u000aMusa has reportedly advocated that his fight in Kashmir is aimed at establishing a caliphate.\u000a\u000aDespite the unprecedented inroads ISIS and al-Qaeda have made into Kashmir, Indian defense experts have dismissed the claim that the security situation in the region is deteriorating.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Al-Qaeda is almost absent and the Islamic State is also on its way out. The bulk of terror activity in Kashmir is carried out by Punjabi Muslims who are sponsored by Pakistan. The Islamic State or Al-Qaeda will not find supporters for their cause who will finance them,\u201d H.S. Panag, a former Indian army officer and defense expert, told Mint.\u000a\u000aIn an edition of its propaganda magazine Dabiq published in early 2016, ISIS revealed that it was committed to \u201cexpanding\u201d into Kashmir.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is already known that the Islamic State has made inroads into Kashmir. However, in the next one or two years militancy in Kashmir will change to hardcore radicalization of the youth with these groups of militants aiming at internationalizing the Kashmir issue,\u201d an anonymous Indian senior intelligence officer told Mint.\u000a\u000aFor months, Indian authorities have been warning against the jihadist group\u2019s presence and threat in Kashmir.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the next 2-3 years, militancy in Kashmir will change to hardcore radicalization of youth, as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State are aiming to take the Kashmir issue international,\u201d notes Mint, adding, \u201c[Indian] intelligence units in the [Kashmir] state claim that emergent Islamic State factions will soon dominate the valley.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Pakistan-linked jihadist groups known as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Hizbul Mujahideen have been leading terrorist activities in Kashmir for years, engaging local security forces in firefights.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the LeT and the Hizbul\u2019s signature moves have been to engage security forces in gun battles, the Islamic State and the Al-Qaeda conduct large scale IED (improvised explosive devices) blasts and suicide missions,\u201d reveals Mint.\u000a\u000aIndia, Pakistan, and China have competing claims to Kashmir, but China has largely stayed in the shadows of disputes between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan over the region.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, China, which is stronger than India and Pakistan, has flexed its muscle, threatening to enter the Kashmir fray.\u000a\u000aAn editorial published by China\u2019s state-run Global Times this year urged Beijing to interfere in the \u201cturbulent\u201d Kashmir dispute, suggesting, \u201cIf New Delhi chooses to play dirty, however, Beijing should not hesitate to answer blows with blows.\u201d\u000a\u000aChina has long backed Pakistan in its rivalry with India. Both China and its ally Pakistan consider India to be their regional competitor.\u000a\u000aNew Delhi has long accused Islamabad of backing Islamic terrorists in Kashmir who are fighting for independence from India or in favor of a merger with Pakistan, a charge that Islamabad denies.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Pakistan often accuses New Delhi of human rights violations \u2014 namely cracking down on dissent in India-held Kashmir, a claim that New Delhi denies.

aVA new poll of the liberal sports media shows exactly what one might expect from reading their daily coverage of sports. Chiefly, it showed that only a tiny four percent of members of the sports media are supporters of President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThe folks at The Big Lead Sports decided to poll members of the sports media to see just how far left they are, and the results are about what you would expect.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Big Lead polled 51 members of the sports media, allowing their answers to remain anonymous, to encourage the media to fill out the survey without fear of being \u201couted\u201d as liberals. The site also polled 312 readers as a control group to see if the media was more, less, or the same politically as the site\u2019s readers.\u000a\u000aThe poll revealed that most considered themselves Democrats or \u201cindependents,\u201d with 58 percent calling themselves Democrats and 37 percent claiming to be \u201cindependents.\u201d As to the GOP, well, only three respondents (a measly 6 percent) said they were Republican.\u000a\u000aThe Big Lead points out that a recent Gallop poll said the breakdown above is far out of whack compared to the general population which sees 31 percent each claiming to be Democrat or Republican and 37 percent claiming to be \u201cindependent.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, party affiliation was the least of the site\u2019s poll finding, when asked if they were socially liberal, 76.5 percent said they were extremely liberal.\u000a\u000aWhen the question turned to how they cast their vote in 2016, a whopping 80.4 percent said they voted for 2016 loser Hillary Clinton. While only a few said they cast their ballot for Donald Trump. In fact, more sports reporters said they didn\u2019t vote at all (9.8 percent) than said they voted for Trump.\u000a\u000aFor its control group, the site\u2019s readers voted for Clinton at 50.3 percent, while Trump and a third party candidate each got 20 percent.\u000a\u000aThe sports reporters also favored abortion (86.3 percent) while the general readers were closer to the middle (55.8 percent). In addition, 88.2 percent called themselves firm believers in global warming, while the readers only accepted climate change at 48 percent.\u000a\u000aGun ownership was also rejected by the sports reporters at a number far higher than that of regular Americans. Of all the reporters asked, only three polled said they owned a gun. Meanwhile, national average fro gun ownership in America is 36 percent.\u000a\u000aThe reporters also self-identified as leftists in other ways. All but one chose left-wing news sources as their main sources of news, 78.4 percent agreed that sports media should be \u201cvery liberal,\u201d and 76.5 percent wanted to see pot legalized.\u000a\u000aIn its conclusion, The Big Lead makes a point that has been echoed by other members of the sports media recently\u2026 not that this conclusion helps the matter.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sports media clearly leans left. But, it may be a stretch to say that alienates a significant portion of the audience,\u201d Ty Duffy wrote. \u201cThe sports media is clustered in major cities and along the coasts because that\u2019s where much of its audience is.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis makes sense, most sports writers work for big media outfits in places like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\u000a\u000aHowever, this also means that a relatively small community of liberal sports writers in liberal enclaves, are writing for a massive percentage of the country. Which, according to the numbers in this poll, do not hold the same values or opinions. While that has probably always been true in media, to some extent, given that media has always been coastal and liberal. However, one wonders if 50 years ago the ideological gap between scribe and fan was quite this stark.\u000a\u000aIn any event, this is a large part of the reason why outlets like ESPN have lost viewers. No one is serving half the number of sports fans in the country, and many of those fans are simply walking away from their once fervent love of sports because of it.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.

aVCANBERRA, Australia \u2014 The Australian Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) has been forced to apologize for its coverage of the anti-Israel violence in Jerusalem at the start of the recent Temple Mount crisis.\u000a\u000aThe taxpayer-funded broadcaster was forced into the backdown after a TV news report on June 17 covered the terror stabbing of 23-year-old Israeli police officer Hadas Malka.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe SBS item began by stating \u201cIsraeli security forces have shot dead three Palestinians accused of carrying out shooting and stabbing attacks in Jerusalem.\u201d The voice-over only subsequently noted the \u201cstabbing [of] a border police officer\u201d without mentioning Staff Sgt. Malka had died.\u000a\u000aExecutive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) executive director Peter Wertheim noted the omission of Malka\u2019s death from the report, despite other media reporting it, in his written complaint to the SBS ombudsman.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis was an appalling omission \u2026 Nor does it appear that the omission was inadvertent, as it is entirely in keeping with the whole tenor of the report, which is to highlight only the deaths of those who instigated the attack,\u201d Wertheim wrote. \u201cThis is not only sloppy reporting, but also biased reporting.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn her response, SBS ombudsman Sally Begbie stated \u201cthe report was found to have breached the [SBS] code for accuracy and impartiality\u201d.\u000a\u000aBegbie admitted information Malka had died of her wounds \u201cwas available prior to broadcast and should have been included in the SBS report\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs this was the first time these incidents were reported in the SBS World News 6.30pm television bulletin, and given the error in not reporting the police fatality, I consider that the way in which this report was constructed could unintentionally have left the average viewer with an unfair impression of the incidents.\u201d Begbie admitted \u201cthe manner in which the incidents were reported lessened the impact of the initial actions\u201d.\u000a\u000aShe added that \u201cSBS apologises for this breach\u201d and staff have been reminded of the importance of fairness and accuracy.

aVWednesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his failure to repeal Obamacare as Republicans have control of the White House, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives.\u000a\u000aLimbaugh\u2019s criticism echoed that of President Donald Trump reacting to McConnell\u2019s statement that Trump had \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d when it came to the law\u2019s repeal.\u000a\u000aSenator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations," but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?\u000a\u000aPartial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh.com):\u000a\u000aLIMBAUGH: Okay. Here\u2019s Senator McConnell. This is in Florence, Kentucky. He was addressing the Rotary Club.\u000a\u000aMCCONNELL: I know everybody saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve been there, haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d which, uhhhh, I find extremely irritating.\u000a\u000aLIMBAUGH: Right.\u000a\u000aMCCONNELL: Part of the reason I think that the storyline is that we haven\u2019t done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point. Now, our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before.\u000a\u000aLIMBAUGH: Oh, here we go!\u000a\u000aMCCONNELL: Part of the reason I think people feel like we\u2019re under \u2014 underperforming is because too many kind of artificial deadlines unrelated to the reality or complexity of legislating may not have been fully understood.\u000a\u000aLIMBAUGH: There you go. He also said that the expectations were too high. But so you see here, \u201cWell, the president set these early timelines. He\u2019s a new president who has not been in this line of work before. Part of the reason I think people feel that we\u2019re underperforming, too me artificial\u2026\u201d No, no, no. Senator, it doesn\u2019t matter that Trump is president. It doesn\u2019t matter! For seven years, Republicans everywhere have been promising \u2014 except for Kasich (snorts) \u2014 to repeal and replace Obamacare. And with every election victory, another excuse was offered.\u000a\u000aWhen you get the House back? \u201cWell, we can\u2019t really do it \u2019til we get the Senate.\u201d (chuckling) So Republican voters gave you the Senate, and then after that the excuse was, \u201cWell, Obama\u2019s still gonna veto it. We really can\u2019t do anything.\u201d We started getting the idea you don\u2019t want to replace Obamacare. You don\u2019t want to repeal it or replace it because the excuses for not doing so were rapid fire. I mean, it didn\u2019t take long after each victory for another excuse to be launched.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, we need the Senate.\u201d\u000a\u000aGave you the Senate.\u000a\u000a\u201cWeeeeell, we don\u2019t have the White House.\u201d\u000a\u000aGave you the White House.\u000a\u000aNow it\u2019s, \u201cWe don\u2019t have 60 votes in the Senate.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s nothing to do with artificial timelines or the president not being in this line of work. I don\u2019t know how this is gonna fly. I don\u2019t know how the Rotary Club in Florence, Kentucky, took this. But I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ve had a thought. As I said, I know Senator McConnell and I\u2019ve spoken to him. He\u2019s been very helpful over the course of recent years. There have been phone calls not on the air, but about legislation, about Senate procedure and so forth. He\u2019s been educational in that regard. But I\u2019ll tell you, something I can\u2019t overlook.\u000a\u000aYou talk about Senate procedure?\u000a\u000aYou talk about leadership?\u000a\u000aOkay, we\u2019ve got Collins and Murkowski. Where is the effort to turn them? Where is the effort to go get\u2026? Okay, if you\u2019ve got 52 Republicans and, say, six of them are not really on board with the other 46, where\u2019s the leadership effort to go to them and do what you can to get \u2019em on team, get \u2019em on board? Or do you just sit there, \u201cWell, Collins, she\u2019s never going to vote for it. No way.\u201d Why have leadership? Maybe there are efforts to turn them; I don\u2019t know. But it just doesn\u2019t seem like there are. I mean, when you boil it all down, it just seems inescapable that the Senate and the House majority do not want to repeal Obamacare. That\u2019s what\u2019s obvious.

aVThe Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba published a report this week detailing the alarming extent to which the communist Cuban regime has entrenched itself in Venezuela, controlling every government function, from the nation\u2019s failing health care system to dictator Nicolás Maduro\u2019s private security.\u000a\u000aReproduced in the Cuban-American outlet Martí Noticias, the NGO\u2019s report, authored by Roberto Alvarez Quiñones, warns that the violent and increasingly oppressive political situation in Venezuela cannot be resolved without severing ties between Caracas and Havana. He notes that tens of thousands of Cuban soldiers, military officials, doctors, and bureaucrats keep the Venezuelan government functioning and help train the Venezuelan military, which in turn stands accused of myriad human rights abuses against peaceful protesters.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout the direct tutelage of Raúl Castro, his military junta, the Communist Party of Cuba, the Revolutionary Armed Forces, and the entire intelligence and counterintelligence apparatus of the Castro \u2026 the government of Maduro would have succumbed already,\u201d Alvarez argues.\u000a\u000aHe couches his conclusion in the sheer number of Cuban agents operating in Venezuela: three generals, 12 colonels/lieutenant colonels, six frigate captains, and 25 other military officials, for starters. Alvarez estimates that there are nine battalions worth of Cuban foot soldiers doing the bidding of these officials, a total of at least 4,500 troops occupying Venezuela. To these Alvarez adds \u201cover 34,000 doctors and Cuban health professionals with orders to defend the tyranny with firearms.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThousands of other Cubans play key roles\u201d in the bureaucracy and in the nation\u2019s intelligence services, he adds, noting that the Cuban government controls Maduro\u2019s personal security team.\u000a\u000aAlvarez is far from the first to note that the Cuban regime has essentially colonized Venezuela, entrenching itself in every facet of government power. \u201cThere are currently about 15,000 Cubans in Venezuela,\u201d Organization of American States (OAS) chief Luis Almagro told the U.S. Congress last month. \u201cIt\u2019s like an occupation army from Cuba in Venezuela.\u201d\u000a\u000aDiego Arria, a former U.N. Security Council chief, told Breitbart News in May that he estimated 50,000 Cuban agents, including civilians, had established themselves in Venezuela. \u201cThis is more than the number of forces that Spain had occupying Venezuela during our war of independence. I am not saying that these 50,000 Cubans are all soldiers, but thousands of them are trained for these ends,\u201d he noted. \u201cHow do you remove that simply with an election replacing one government with another?\u201d\u000a\u000aGiven Cuba\u2019s vested interest in keeping Maduro in power, the communist regime has been among the most vocal supporters of Maduro\u2019s July 30 election to establish the \u201cnational constituents\u2019 assembly\u201d (ANC), an illegal law making body Maduro created to usurp the power of the democratically elected National Assembly. In remarks this week, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez issued his \u201ccongratulations\u201d to Venezuela for installing the illegal legislature through a widely condemned fraudulent vote.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe reiterate all our loyalty\u201d to Venezuela, Rodríguez said. \u201cIt is undeniable that the people of Venezuela has [sic] made its voice heard and chosen their path \u2026 despite the unconventional war waged against Venezuela, its people have rendered an extraordinary lesson in democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCongratulations to the government and people of Venezuela for their extraordinary display of democracy, conviction, loyalty, and valor,\u201d he concluded.\u000a\u000aThe \u201cextraordinary display of democracy\u201d has elicited near-universal condemnation, including from the electoral technology company that lended its services to the Venezuelan government. Smartmatic officials say they have irrefutable evidence that Venezuelan officials tampered with the number of votes counted in the election.\u000a\u000aRodríguez\u2019s comments came during a regular meeting of the Bolivarian Alliance of the Peoples (ALBA), a radical Marxist regional body Cuba and Venezuela created to counter the influence of the democratic Organization of American States. At the ALBA meeting, those convened called sanctions by the U.S. on Maduro himself and other officials for widespread human rights abuses \u201ca clear violation of international rights and human rights.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn his study, Alvarez cites Cuban influence as a key concern but adds that Hezbollah terrorists, cocaine traffickers, and assorted international criminals have also found a friend in Caracas, citing reports that Venezuela\u2019s vice president Tareck El Aissami led an effort to provide up to 15,000 authentic Venezuelan passports to Hezbollah members ineligible to get them due to their status as Syrian, Lebanese, and other Mideast nation citizens.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

He also said that the expectations were too high. But so you see here, \u201cWell, the president set these early timelines. He\u2019s a new president who has not been in this line of work before. Part of the reason I think people feel that we\u2019re underperforming, too me artificial\u2026\u201d No, no, no. Senator, it doesn\u2019t matter that Trump is president. It doesn\u2019t matter! For seven years, Republicans everywhere have been promising \u2014 except for Kasich (snorts) \u2014 to repeal and replace Obamacare. And with every election victory, another excuse was offered.\u000a\u000aWhen you get the House back? \u201cWell, we can\u2019t really do it \u2019til we get the Senate.\u201d (chuckling) So Republican voters gave you the Senate, and then after that the excuse was, \u201cWell, Obama\u2019s still gonna veto it. We really can\u2019t do anything.\u201d We started getting the idea you don\u2019t want to replace Obamacare. You don\u2019t want to repeal it or replace it because the excuses for not doing so were rapid fire. I mean, it didn\u2019t take long after each victory for another excuse to be launched.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, we need the Senate.\u201d\u000a\u000aGave you the Senate.\u000a\u000a\u201cWeeeeell, we don\u2019t have the White House.\u201d\u000a\u000aGave you the White House.\u000a\u000aNow it\u2019s, \u201cWe don\u2019t have 60 votes in the Senate.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s nothing to do with artificial timelines or the president not being in this line of work. I don\u2019t know how this is gonna fly. I don\u2019t know how the Rotary Club in Florence, Kentucky, took this. But I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ve had a thought. As I said, I know Senator McConnell and I\u2019ve spoken to him. He\u2019s been very helpful over the course of recent years. There have been phone calls not on the air, but about legislation, about Senate procedure and so forth. He\u2019s been educational in that regard. But I\u2019ll tell you, something I can\u2019t overlook.\u000a\u000aYou talk about Senate procedure?\u000a\u000aYou talk about leadership?\u000a\u000aOkay, we\u2019ve got Collins and Murkowski. Where is the effort to turn them? Where is the effort to go get\u2026? Okay, if you\u2019ve got 52 Republicans and, say, six of them are not really on board with the other 46, where\u2019s the leadership effort to go to them and do what you can to get \u2019em on team, get \u2019em on board? Or do you just sit there, \u201cWell, Collins, she\u2019s never going to vote for it. No way.\u201d Why have leadership? Maybe there are efforts to turn them; I don\u2019t know. But it just doesn\u2019t seem like there are. I mean, when you boil it all down, it just seems inescapable that the Senate and the House majority do not want to repeal Obamacare. That\u2019s what\u2019s obvious.

aVThe current issue of Newsweek (yes, it\u2019s still in business!) has a picture of President Trump sitting in a recliner, with snacks and an iPad in his lap, pointing his TV remote at the viewer, blazoned with the headline, \u201cLazy Boy.\u201d\u000a\u000aLiberals only wish.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLast week, the president joined Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) to announce legislation that would make seminal changes to our immigration laws for the first time in nearly half a century, profoundly affecting the entire country.\u000a\u000aThe media have chosen not to cover the RAISE Act (Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment). This bill is their worst nightmare.\u000a\u000aInstead of admitting immigrants on the basis of often specious \u201cfamily\u201d ties, the bill would finally allow us to choose the immigrants we want, based on merit, with points granted for skills, English proficiency, advanced degrees, actual job offers and so on.\u000a\u000aMost Americans have no idea that we have zero say about the vast majority of immigrants pouring into our country. Two-thirds of all legal immigrants get in not because we want them \u2014 or even because Mark Zuckerberg wants them \u2014 but under idiotic \u201cfamily reunification\u201d laws.\u000a\u000aThe most important provision of the RAISE Act would define \u201cfamily\u201d the way most Americans think of it: your spouse and minor children.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, that\u2019s not how the Third World thinks of \u201cfamily.\u201d In tribal societies, \u201cfamily\u201d means the whole extended clan \u2014 adult siblings, elderly parents, and brothers-in-law, plus all their adult siblings and elderly parents, and so on, ad infinitum.\u000a\u000aEntire tribes of immigrants are able to bully their way in and, as legal immigrants, are immediately eligible for a whole panoply of government benefits. Suddenly, there\u2019s no money left in the Social Security Trust Fund, and Speaker Paul Ryan is telling Americans they\u2019re going to have to cut back.\u000a\u000aAt some point, American businesses are going to have to be told they can\u2019t keep bringing in cheap foreign labor, changing the country, and offloading the costs onto the taxpayer. But that\u2019s not this discussion. Business owners want cheap workers \u2014 not the disabled parents of cheap workers.\u000a\u000aIn a sane world, merely introducing such an important bill \u2014 with the imprimatur of a president elected on his immigration stance \u2014 would force the media to finally discuss the subject they have been deliberately hiding from the public.\u000a\u000aHas Trump personally endorsed any other legislation like this? He harangued congressional Republicans on Twitter to pass some Obamacare replacement, but he never endorsed a specific bill.\u000a\u000aBut, you see, there\u2019s a reason the media don\u2019t want to talk about immigration.\u000a\u000aWith a full public airing, Americans would finally understand why recent immigrants seem so different from earlier waves, why income inequality is approaching czarist Russia levels, why the suicide rate has skyrocketed among the working class, and why all our government benefits programs are headed toward bankruptcy.\u000a\u000aAs Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s inestimable speechwriter, said, some legislative proposals \u201ccan only succeed in the dark of night\u201d and some \u201ccan only succeed in the light of day.\u201d This is a light-of-day bill.\u000a\u000aSo, naturally, the media refuse to mention it, except to accuse Miller of being a white nationalist for knowing hate-facts about the Emma Lazarus poem not being part of the original Statue of Liberty. (It\u2019s the Statue of Liberty, not Statute of Liberty, media.)\u000a\u000aThey ignore this bill so they can get on to the important business of Trump\u2019s tweets, who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the White House, and Russia, Russia, Russia.\u000a\u000aAccording to my review of Nexis archives, there was only a single question about the RAISE Act on any of the Sunday morning shows: Chris Wallace\u2019s last question to his very important Republican guest. Unfortunately, his very important Republican guest was amnesty-supporting nitwit Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who sniped about Trump employing foreign guest workers at Mar-a-Lago.\u000a\u000aHowever that may be, guest workers have absolutely nothing to do with the RAISE Act, which, as Miller heroically tried to explain to clueless reporters, concerns only green-card holders, i.e., lawful permanent residents \u2014 not guest workers, not illegal aliens and not a poem Scotch-taped onto Lady Liberty in 1903.\u000a\u000aAt least the media aren\u2019t deluded about the popularity of their position. Discussing immigration is a total loser for them. They know what they want is not supported by anyone.\u000a\u000aLow-wage workers don\u2019t want hundreds of thousands of low-skilled immigrants being dumped on the country every year. Employers don\u2019t want the deadbeat cousins of their cheap workers. Americans on public assistance don\u2019t want foreigners competing with them for benefits. Boneheaded Scandinavian communities that welcomed refugees don\u2019t want to turn their entire town budgets over to various foreign tribes.\u000a\u000aIn a recent Numbers USA poll of voters in 10 swing states with vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election next year, only 22 percent of respondents thought immigrants should be allowed by right to bring in \u201cfamily\u201d other than spouses and minor children.\u000a\u000aMake the senators vote, Mr. President!\u000a\u000aDonald Trump was elected president, beating the smartest, most qualified woman in the world, by proposing to put Americans first on immigration. This bill makes good on that promise.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a reason the media won\u2019t discuss it. If Trump were smart, he\u2019d talk about nothing else.

They need to understand the consequences. It doesn\u2019t mean [Trump] wants nuclear war.\u201d\u000a\u000aCaddell went on to say, \u201cThe answer is, we\u2019ve had failed negotiations with North Korea since we had Clinton, Bush, and Obama. And the Clinton one was a particular joke because Wendy Sherman, the architect of the sell-out to Iran, was the woman who negotiated the deal that President Clinton told us was going to solve everything; it was a wonderful arrangement. And the North Koreans just blew right through it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for issues with Congress, Caddell said, \u201cThe McConnell stuff, I found just amazing. I mean, McConnell\u2019s talk the other day, so condescending to the president.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat does he think we do here? Well, I don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d said Caddell, mimicking McConnell.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no idea what these people do there,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aCaddell also blasted Republicans in Congress for not having a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare on day one, saying they were caught off guard because they did not think Trump would win and have often been oppositional to him.\u000a\u000aSaid Caddell, \u201cLook at what the Senate did. It didn\u2019t even recess so he could appoint recess appointments. That\u2019s what the Democrats would have done. All these positions he can\u2019t move through the Senate, he could have appointed them the day they recessed. But they made sure he couldn\u2019t.

An Alford plea means the defendant does not admit guilt but recognizes that the prosecution has enough evidence to prove guilt.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Times-Dispatch, Taylor said the allegations against him are \u201clies\u201d but entered pleas because he was not confident he could get a fair trial.\u000a\u000aInvestigators say a search of Taylor\u2019s hard drive brought up 171 images of bestiality, including ten pictures of a man performing oral sex on a dog.\u000a\u000aTaylor\u2019s lawyer, however, argued that his client was not the man in those images.\u000a\u000aAuthorities say officials seized the eight dogs and added that two of them had to be put down.\u000a\u000aJudge Yoffy ordered that Taylor undergo a psychosexual evaluation and not have any contact with pets while he is out on bond before his sentencing hearing.\u000a\u000aTaylor is scheduled to be sentenced November 14.

aVSouthern Methodist University (SMU) announced late Wednesday it reinstated the 9/11 flag memorial to its prominent place on campus, reversing a decision to relocate lawn displays.\u000a\u000aRecently, officials wanted to move the annual 9/11 tribute to avoid \u201ctriggering\u201d others.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cThe 9/11 display will be on the north portion of the lawn for one day,\u201d said senior Grant Wolf, SMU Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) chairman. He told Breitbart Texas SMU reached an agreement with student groups that will allow displays to continue on the lawn at historic Dallas Hall.\u000a\u000aIn a press release, the university stated one-day displays will remain on the northern section of the Dallas Hall lawn and those lasting up to three days will be situated on the hall\u2019s southern lawn to ensure one area remains open for other uses at all times.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thank the students from across campus who came together in the spirit of mutual respect and civil discourse to achieve this outcome,\u201d said SMU President R.

YAF and an amalgam of other student groups, representing a variety of political leanings, rallied on behalf of the First Amendment. They penned an open letter to SMU\u2019s president, expressing disappointment with the new display policy which they believed stifled free speech and expression. The students voiced concerns about other college campuses that \u201chave effectively shut down free speech.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe university apologized for the \u201cinappropriate wording\u201d in the emailed policy and removed references to \u201ctriggering or harmful messages,\u201d although SMU upheld the prohibitive memorial display policy.\u000a\u000aEven Texas Governor Greg Abbott weighed in on the flap, urging Turner to reinstate the 9/11 flag display to the Dallas Hall lawn, which Breitbart Texas reported. Instead, the SMU president responded by asserting the governor was given \u201cwrong\u201d information about the university\u2019s display policy.\u000a\u000aHowever, in learning that SMU had a change of heart and agreed to return the 9/11 display and others to the \u201cappropriate and traditional place of honor of the lawn of Dallas Hall,\u201d Abbott tweeted: \u201cProud of SMU faculty & students resolving this issue.

aVThe U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on eight individuals in Venezuela on Wednesday, citing them for \u201corganizing or otherwise supporting the creation of Venezuela\u2019s Constituent Assembly\u201d and \u201cparticipating in anti-democratic actions.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d is socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro\u2019s sham legislature, whipped up in an effort to disempower what remains of representative government in the country. The assembly was created in a July 30 election deemed illegitimate by the U.S. government and most of the states in the Western Hemisphere.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aMaduro himself was hit by sanctions last week, in what the Associated Press describes as \u201ca rare action against a foreign head of state.\u201d This was followed swiftly by a round of sanctions against 13 current and former officials from the Maduro government.\u000a\u000aSix of the eight people named in the new sanctions list are members or functionaries of the new Constituent Assembly. One of them, Adán Coromoto Chávez Frías, is the brother of the late Hugo Chávez, Maduro\u2019s mentor.\u000a\u000aAlso sanctioned were Tania D\u2019Amelio Cardiet, a rector of the Venezuelan National Electoral Council, who is believed to be under investigation in Venezuela for vote fraud; and military commander Bladimir Humberto Lugo Armas, who handles security for the original, legitimate National Assembly. Armas does not appear to have much enthusiasm for his job these days, since he stands accused of assaulting several Assembly members who oppose Maduro, including Assembly President Julio Borges.\u000a\u000aThe Miami Herald notes that one of the sanctioned individuals, Constituent Assembly delegate Hermann Escarra, has owned property in South Florida, as have members of his family. \u201cEscarra himself was spotted at a North Miami Mercedes-Benz dealership in April,\u201d the Herald reports.\u000a\u000aSanctions against Venezuela are still gaining steam. The Herald notes that the Trump administration is threatening to sanction all 545 members of the Constituent Assembly, one of whom is Nicolás Maduro\u2019s wife. Administration officials have said they intend to deploy sanctions slowly, carefully, and \u201cstrategically.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Maduro swore in this illegitimate Constituent Assembly to further entrench his dictatorship and continues to tighten his grip on the country. This regime\u2019s disregard for the will of the Venezuelan people is unacceptable, and the United States will stand with them in opposition to tyranny until Venezuela is restored to a peaceful and prosperous democracy,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in announcing the new sanctions.

Hamas has since expanded its naval commando unit significantly, with the number of frogmen swelling to 1,500.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aEven though Hamas has been keeping hostilities to a minimum in recent months, the construction of the barrier may provoke future attacks.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, head of the Southern Command Maj.-Gen.

Embedded with advanced tunnel-detecting monitoring devices, the wall is made from European bentonite and stretches up to 20 feet above ground. Purpose-built sensors collect information from the ground, including the length and location of the tunnel, and transmit it to control systems where advanced algorithms decipher the data.\u000a\u000aThe IDF, the Shin Bet security agency and dozens of companies \u2013 including Iron Dome developers Elbit Systems and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems \u2014 are said to be involved in assembling the barrier.\u000a\u000aDuring the 2014 war against Hamas, Israel found and destroyed more than 30 Hamas tunnels.\u000a\u000aZamir said the terror group is continuing to expand its \u201cmetro system\u201d of tunnels, which, in addition to tunnels for the purposes of executing terror attacks on Israeli soil, include smuggling conduits into Egypt as well as command centers and weapons caches. Many of them, he said, stretch under residential homes in the Gaza Strip.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny civilians who stay in these buildings endanger their lives and the lives of their families. It\u2019s Hamas who endangers them first and foremost, but every building over a tunnel is a legitimate military target,\u201d Zamir said.\u000a\u000a\u201cPart of Hamas\u2019s combat strategy is to conduct itself within civilian areas, which is intended to make it difficult for the IDF to locate, attack and destroy the group\u2019s military infrastructure,\u201d Zamir stated, adding that by drawing Israeli fire to these buildings, Hamas aims to delegitimize Israel and the IDF.

aVAs the surge of illegal aliens continues to mount in South Texas, Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector capped off a busy day by arresting one group of 86 illegal aliens and seizing more than $1 million worth of marijuana. Agents also carried out a rescue of an illegal alien lost in the brush and, unfortunately, recovered the remains of another migrant who was not as lucky. All of these incidents occurred in the RGV Sector on Monday.\u000a\u000aAgents working out of the Weslaco Border Patrol Station observed a large group of people walking up a trail from the Rio Grande River in Hidalgo, Texas, Monday evening. The scene was reminiscent of the 2014 border surge when the illegal immigrants could be seen walking up from the river border by the dozens. The agents apprehended the group without incident.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aAgents determined the number of people in the group to be 86, all of whom admitted to having crossed the border illegally.\u000a\u000aAfter taking the migrants to the Weslaco station for processing, agents learned all 86 came from Guatemala. The group consisted of 36 adults and 50 juveniles. Of that, 32 of the adults were traveling with family members and four adults traveled alone. Thirty-four of the minors were traveling with an adult as part of a family unit, Border Patrol Supervisory Agent Marlene Castro told Breitbart Texas in an email response to a request for additional information. Sixteen of the minors were traveling as Unaccompanied Alien Children.\u000a\u000aThe apprehension of Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) and Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) increased in July for the third straight month, Breitbart Texas reported on Wednesday. FMUA apprehensions increased by 46 percent from June to July while UAC apprehensions increased by 29 percent. Total apprehensions increased by only 13 percent revealing how the numbers of families and children are increasing substantially again.\u000a\u000aThe day began for the RGV agents assigned to the Rio Grande City Station when they observed an SUV driving at a high rate of speed at about 1:30 Monday morning near the town of Los Arrieros, Texas. Agents pursued the vehicle which eventually crashed into a utility pole. The driver fled the scene but left behind 75 bundles of marijuana. Officials said the marijuana load weighed nearly 1,400 pounds and estimated the value to be in excess of $1 million. Agents turned the vehicle and drugs over to the Drug Enforcement Administration for investigation.\u000a\u000aLater that morning, dispatchers from the Brooks County Sheriff\u2019s Office received a call from an alien lost in the brush. Human smugglers frequently drop off their cargo south of the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint located in the middle of the county and lead them on a dangerous march through the ranch lands surrounding the checkpoint. Migrants frequently die when the smugglers leave them behind if they become injured or too weak to keep up.\u000a\u000aBorder Patrol agents went to the GPS location of the phone and found the man. Agents offered the man medical assistance but he declined. Officials did not indicate the man\u2019s nationality.\u000a\u000aLater that afternoon, agents assigned to the Kingsville Station received a call about an immigrant who was not as fortunate as the one in Brooks County. The Kenedy County Sheriff\u2019s Office contacted Border Patrol dispatchers and advised them that a local rancher discovered the remains of a migrant who died after being abandoned in the area. Agents recovered the remains after a local justice of the peace declared the man to be dead. Agents found identification documents of a Honduran national near the body.\u000a\u000aDespite the historically low number of border crossing this year, the numbers of illegal aliens dying while attempting to enter the U.S. is higher than last year, Breitbart Texas reported.\u000a\u000aBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

aVA survey of 20 Democrats running for a House seat in the 2018 midterm election revealed only one vowed support for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) if elected.\u000a\u000a\u201cNancy Pelosi might actually be in trouble,\u201d the Sacramento Bee reported last week.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Bee reported that 18 of the 20 would not say if Pelosi should keep her job, while one said he would vote for someone else for the leadership position in the House.\u000a\u000aOnly one candidate \u2014 a former Senate staffer from Orange County, California \u2014 said he would support Pelosi, according to the Bee.\u000a\u000a\u201cTheir refusal is a remarkable development for an already embattled minority leader, even if other congressional leaders, like Republicans House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, are similarly unpopular in polls,\u201d the Bee reported.\u000a\u000aDemocrats feel they will have traction to win back the House because of what they see as the \u201cdeep disapproval\u201d of President Donald Trump. But Pelosi is also unpopular and is blamed by some for the many Democratic losses in recent House races.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are overdue for a new generation of leadership,\u201d said Kenneth Harbaugh, a candidate in Ohio\u2019s 7th Congressional District and the only candidate who said he wouldn\u2019t support Pelosi.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a remarkable opportunity in front of us, and it\u2019s going to take new thinking and new leadership to capitalize on it,\u201d Harbaugh said.\u000a\u000aThe Bee reported that a Pelosi aide dismissed the survey\u2019s findings.\u000a\u000a\u201cCandidates across the country are focused on issues that matter to their constituents, such as better jobs and better wages, not the latest Beltway gossip,\u201d Jorge Aguilar, a spokesman for Pelosi\u2019s campaign, said. \u201cLeader Pelosi has the overwhelming backing of the House Democratic Caucus because she continues to unify Democrats in our battle to defeat Trumpcare.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublicans hope to make the most of the debate on Pelosi and the future of Democrats in the House.\u000a\u000a\u201cDemocratic candidates and their ties to Nancy Pelosi will be an issue in every single competitive race next fall,\u201d Matt Gorman, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee,\u201d said. \u201cWhether or not they claim to vote for her as speaker, they\u2019ll be another vote for her and her big-spending policies in congress.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly one Democratic candidate contacted said he would support Pelosi \u2014 Kia Hamadanchy, running in California\u2019s 45th Congressional District,\u201d the Bee reported.\u000a\u000aThe Bee noted that current House Speaker Ryan is as unpopular as Pelosi, polls show. A May survey from Quinnipiac found 54 percent of voters had an unfavorable view of him, compared to just 27 percent who had a positive opinion.

aVU.S. Education Department Secretary Betsy DeVos says she regrets that she did not more vehemently condemn racism in the country when dealing with issues concerning the nation\u2019s historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I talked about it being a pioneer in choice it was because I acknowledge that racism was rampant and there were no choices,\u201d DeVos said in an interview with the Associated Press (AP) in her office. \u201cThese HBCUs provided choices for black students that they didn\u2019t have.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe secretary\u2019s comments come several months after DeVos referred to HBCUs as \u201creal pioneers when it comes to school choice,\u201d a statement that led to a deluge of criticism from leftwing groups.\u000a\u000aAfter her statement, these groups circulated an online petition demanding that HBCU Bethune-Cookman University (B-CU) rescind its invitation to DeVos to give its commencement address.\u000a\u000a\u201cBetsy DeVos doesn\u2019t understand that HBCUs were created in response to the exclusion of African Americans from mainstream institutions,\u201d said the petition. \u201cSecretary DeVos has no understanding of the importance, contributions, and significance of HBCUs.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe NAACP, teachers unions, and other leftist groups agitated the protests against DeVos and circulated the petition demanding the B-CU administration rescind the invitation to address the graduates. The NAACP called for the resignation of B-CU\u2019s president and board chairman if they did not disinvite DeVos. The same groups objected to DeVos\u2019s withdrawal of protections the Obama administration put in place for students who have mismanaged or are defaulting on their student loans.\u000a\u000aDuring commencement at B-CU, many of the 300 graduates also turned their backs on DeVos as she addressed them.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy intention was to say they were pioneering on behalf of students that didn\u2019t have another choice. This was their only choice,\u201d DeVos said during the AP interview. \u201cAt the same time I should have decried much more forcefully the ravages of racism in this country.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeVos\u2019s focus on school choice \u2013 specifically to help low-income students who are stuck in failing schools \u2013 has been condemned by teachers\u2019 unions, fearful of privatization of public education, and their media and political supporters.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s where my heart has been for three decades is to really empower and allow all families the same kind of opportunities I\u2019ve had for my kids,\u201d DeVos told AP.\u000a\u000aAP adds that DeVos \u201cacknowledged that she could have done more to reach out to African-American communities around the country to make her position more clear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve had these conversations with some of the African-American organizations that represent higher education, but probably not as explicitly as I am right now,\u201d DeVos said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the time she made the comments about school choice, I am certain she was trying to promote her school choice agenda,\u201d Marybeth Gasman, a professor of education at the University of Pennsylvania, reportedly said to AP in response to DeVos\u2019s regrets about her statements. \u201cI am glad she realizes the comments were offensive.

aVInc. writer Suzanne Lucas has predicted that a lawsuit against Google will be forthcoming, after explaining why the company\u2019s firing of employee James Damore was in her opinion illegal.\u000a\u000aDamore was fired from Google this week after publishing a viewpoint diversity manifesto, which explained why there are not more women in tech jobs and called for more ideological diversity in Google\u2019s workplace.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn a memo, the company claimed Damore had advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d despite the fact that numerous psychologists, male and female, deemed the manifesto to be scientifically accurate.\u000a\u000aReferencing an article written by employment attorney Dan Eaton before Damore\u2019s dismissal, Inc writer Suzanne Lucas explains why the company should never have fired the employee.\u000a\u000a\u201cCalifornia is an at-will state, and if a company doesn\u2019t want an employee to perpetuate any gender stereotypes, that\u2019s its right. Except when it isn\u2019t,\u201d declared Lucas. \u201cEaton points out that employees are allowed to talk among themselves about working conditions. This is why your boss can\u2019t ban you from sharing your salary with your co-workers. But working conditions aren\u2019t limited to salary discussions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe purpose of his essay was to talk about what he perceived as a need for change in the company. He shared it internally, with his co-workers. In other words, this just might be a protected activity,\u201d she explained, before also adding, \u201cIn most states, political views aren\u2019t protected in the workplace, but in California they are.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLove his views or hate them, they are definitely political in nature,\u201d Lucas proclaimed. \u201cCalifornia law prohibits employers from threatening employees in order to get them to change their political views.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe statute in question leaves some skeptical of Lucas\u2019 claims, but this view may have merit in the eyes of the court system.\u000a\u000aLucas also claimed that Damore could be protected under California\u2019s whistleblower laws.\u000a\u000a\u201cDamore claimed that some of Google\u2019s practices violate federal discrimination laws. When we talk about affirmative action, federal law allows you to hire a woman or minority candidate over a male or white candidate if both are equally qualified. But what it doesn\u2019t allow you to do is hire a less qualified female or minority candidate,\u201d she continued. \u201cDamore believed Google\u2019s policies were doing just that. To be protected, \u2018the engineer doesn\u2019t have to be right that some of Google\u2019s diversity initiatives are unlawful, only that he reasonably believes that they are.'\u201d\u000a\u000aYesterday we reported that Damore is reportedly exploring legal remedies.\u000a\u000aLucas then concluded her article, predicting, \u201cI\u2019m sure a lawsuit will be forthcoming.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

aVBELGRADE, Serbia (AP) \u2014 Evidence is piling up that this year\u2019s sizzling summer in central and southeastern Europe has decimated crops, drained rivers and hurt the animal world.\u000a\u000aAs the drought\u2019s costs become clearer, temperatures in Serbia, Romania, Hungary and Croatia were expected to reach 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) again on Thursday following a few days of less oppressive heat.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe region is enduring one of the hottest and driest summers in years, during which several people have died and dozens of wildfires have flared. The drought has also ratcheted up demand for water and electricity.\u000a\u000aSerbia has been one of the hardest hit countries, with experts saying an estimated 60 percent of corn crops destroyed. The ministry of ecology also says water levels across the country have dropped drastically, threatening fish stocks.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is really sad!\u201d said farmer Pavel Tordaj from the northern Serbian village of Padina, while showing withered corn and scorched sunflower on his land.\u000a\u000aTordaj said nearly all his corn, and half of his sunflowers have been destroyed by the drought, adding that it will be very hard for the farmers to make up for the loss.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho will pay for that?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe took loans from the bank.\u201d\u000a\u000aCorn accounts for around one million hectares (2.4 million acres) of Serbia\u2019s farmland, which is widely perceived as having a poor watering system.\u000a\u000aOverall, around 60 percent of corn crops have been destroyed, according to Zeljko Kaitovic from the state-run Maize Research Institute.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnfortunately, extreme drought conditions caught the corn in the most sensitive phase of development,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even heavy, longer rains could help now.\u201d\u000a\u000aSerbian government officials have said any shortages following this year\u2019s drought will be covered from state reserves to avoid further damage. The government has also urged consumers to be cautious with water usage and factories to refrain from depositing waste into drained rivers where the fish are already suffering.\u000a\u000aIn neighboring Hungary, the drought has reduced the number of birds hatching in a national park as many of the breeding areas have dried out.\u000a\u000aPreliminary state statistics have shown a predicted decline in Hungary\u2019s grain harvest of around seven percent. Rising temperatures have also prompted Hungary to set a stricter legal definition of what constitutes a drought, which will make it more difficult for farmers to get compensation from insurance companies.\u000a\u000aIn the country\u2019s Koros-Maros National Park, the majority of stork nests observed this year had only three young birds instead of the usual four and none had more than five. Many of the nests had only a single nestling.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in Romania, experts from the country\u2019s Academy of Agricultural and Forest Science were holding a conference Thursday on how the weather changes are affecting the crops. The academy said earlier this year that hot temperatures in recent years had killed off fruit trees and vines, including apple, pear, plum, cherry, apricot, peach and walnut trees.

aVChina appears to be souring on the decision to invest heavily in Venezuela, now arguably the world\u2019s worst economy, with its state media suggesting Wednesday that keeping commitments to Venezuela \u201cis at the cost of great risk\u201d and the nation\u2019s banks should reconsider business there.\u000a\u000aChina developed close ties to the socialist regime of late dictator Hugo Chávez which persist to this day. Favorable loans from Beijing have helped keep the plummeting economy under current dictator Nicolás Maduro afloat.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s state-run Global Times suggested in two articles Wednesday that this relationship was no longer profitable for China. While adding the caveat that \u201cit is impossible for China to pull out\u201d and \u201cLatin America should not be seen as the frontier of China\u2019s influence,\u201d the Times warned that Venezuela\u2019s downward spiral \u201cmay impact China severely.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor a long time, Venezuela has been a hot investment destination in South America for Chinese firms. The country\u2019s economy and social unrest exposes China\u2019s commercial interests to huge risks. If a civil war really breaks out in Venezuela, then those Chinese business interests will be gone,\u201d the Times warns.\u000a\u000aThe state newspaper estimates that China\u2019s state banks \u201chave offered 17 batches of loans worth $65 billion in total to Venezuela in terms of oil refining, gold mining, logistics, trade and railways projects,\u201d and it notes that the Chinese state is \u201cthe country\u2019s biggest creditor.\u201d This number coincides with independent estimates that put the figure at $63 billion between 2007 and 2013. China has allowed Venezuela to pay this debt back with oil, given the nation\u2019s vast oil reserves, but the bolívar and oil prices have fallen so far that Foreign Policy estimates Venezuela \u201cmust now ship two barrels of oil for every one it originally agreed to\u201d before 2014.\u000a\u000aA separate Global Times article suggests that Beijing should view Venezuela as a cautionary tale regarding its longstanding policy to invest heavily in underdeveloped leftist countries. While Venezuela was certainly not an underdeveloped country before Hugo Chávez \u2013 on the contrary, it was the wealthiest country in Latin America \u2013 socialism has collapsed its economy and left its society without access to food goods, medicine, hygienic products, and other basic products. The Times essentially implores Beijing to be more careful in its next ventures.\u000a\u000a\u201cProjects in political risky and unstable countries could present unexpected challenges. Abrupt deterioration of the political situations in these countries could easily turn investments into bad loans,\u201d the column reads. \u201cTherefore, security threats in certain parts of the world should be considered thoroughly before investment is made in these areas.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the case of Venezuela \u2026 the situation in the South American country would be of less concern if Chinese regulators had conducted a thorough evaluation of the risk involved in continuing to put money into the country and issued investment warnings accordingly,\u201d it suggests.\u000a\u000aThe alarmist tone of the Global Times Wednesday is a stark shift from even last week when a column in the state newspaper appeared to excuse Venezuela for its own woes. \u201cWithout a fully developed industrialization, Latin American economies depend heavily on resources. Many countries are mired in problems, such as sharp wealth gaps and social rifts, yet the political system they adopted from the West has failed to address these problems,\u201d a column dated August 1 reads.\u000a\u000aUnlike its state media, which often provides a more candid view of the Chinese government\u2019s perception of world affairs, the Foreign Ministry has remained supportive of the Venezuelan regime. Claiming to adhere to \u201cnon-intervention,\u201d the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement congratulating Maduro for hosting proven fraudulent elections on July 30.\u000a\u000a\u201cChina believes that the Venezuelan government and people have the ability to properly handle their internal affairs. A stable developing Venezuela accords with all sides interests,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cWe sincerely hope that all sides in Venezuela can orderly resolve the relevant issue with peaceful dialogue within a legal framework, and protect the country\u2019s stability and socio-economic development.\u201d\u000a\u000aLess than a year ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders\u2019 Meeting, looking for more investment opportunities in the region.\u000a\u000aIn the 2000s \u2013 the heyday of Chávez and leftist leaders like Brazil\u2019s Lula da Silva and Argentina\u2019s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner \u2013 the atmosphere on the continent was significantly more favorable towards communist Chinese investment. Even much later in 2013, following Chávez\u2019s death, China pledged full commitment to an alliance with Maduro. Maduro, in turn, promised a \u201cnew geopolitics\u201d featuring a \u201cmultipolar, balanced world,\u201d suggesting a world where China eclipsed the United States in influence.\u000a\u000aFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Although the dementia frequency was higher in the football group (3% vs 1.4%), the difference was not significant.\u201d\u000a\u000aA much smaller pilot study of youth football players actually found cognitive improvement by players over the course of a season. \u201cThe primary finding of this study is that there were no observed impairments in selected clinical measures of neurologic function in these 10 youth football players tested before and after a 12-week season,\u201d the group\u2019s Journal of Child Neurology article pointed out. \u201cThere were, in fact, significant improvements in some measures of postural stability, oculomotor performance, and neurocognitive function.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne can forgive Sports Illustrated for saying that people credit Omalu with discovering chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease referred to by that name in the medical literature long before the doctor\u2019s birth. At least one person does credit him with discovering CTE: Bennet Omalu. But playing stenographer to a pathologist masquerading as a brain expert who repeatedly makes false claims comes as a harder transgression to absolve.

aVBELGRADE, Serbia (AP) \u2014 Evidence is piling up that this year\u2019s sizzling summer in central and southeastern Europe has decimated crops, drained rivers and hurt the animal world.\u000a\u000aAs the drought\u2019s costs become clearer, temperatures in Serbia, Romania, Hungary and Croatia were expected to reach 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) again on Thursday following a few days of less oppressive heat.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe region is enduring one of the hottest and driest summers in years, during which several people have died and dozens of wildfires have flared. The drought has also ratcheted up demand for water and electricity.\u000a\u000aSerbia has been one of the hardest hit countries, with experts saying an estimated 60 percent of corn crops destroyed. The ministry of ecology also says water levels across the country have dropped drastically, threatening fish stocks.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is really sad!\u201d said farmer Pavel Tordaj from the northern Serbian village of Padina, while showing withered corn and scorched sunflower on his land.\u000a\u000aTordaj said nearly all his corn, and half of his sunflowers have been destroyed by the drought, adding that it will be very hard for the farmers to make up for the loss.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho will pay for that?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe took loans from the bank.\u201d\u000a\u000aCorn accounts for around one million hectares (2.4 million acres) of Serbia\u2019s farmland, which is widely perceived as having a poor watering system.\u000a\u000aOverall, around 60 percent of corn crops have been destroyed, according to Zeljko Kaitovic from the state-run Maize Research Institute.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnfortunately, extreme drought conditions caught the corn in the most sensitive phase of development,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even heavy, longer rains could help now.\u201d\u000a\u000aSerbian government officials have said any shortages following this year\u2019s drought will be covered from state reserves to avoid further damage. The government has also urged consumers to be cautious with water usage and factories to refrain from depositing waste into drained rivers where the fish are already suffering.\u000a\u000aIn neighboring Hungary, the drought has reduced the number of birds hatching in a national park as many of the breeding areas have dried out.\u000a\u000aPreliminary state statistics have shown a predicted decline in Hungary\u2019s grain harvest of around seven percent. Rising temperatures have also prompted Hungary to set a stricter legal definition of what constitutes a drought, which will make it more difficult for farmers to get compensation from insurance companies.\u000a\u000aIn the country\u2019s Koros-Maros National Park, the majority of stork nests observed this year had only three young birds instead of the usual four and none had more than five. Many of the nests had only a single nestling.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in Romania, experts from the country\u2019s Academy of Agricultural and Forest Science were holding a conference Thursday on how the weather changes are affecting the crops. The academy said earlier this year that hot temperatures in recent years had killed off fruit trees and vines, including apple, pear, plum, cherry, apricot, peach and walnut trees.

aVThe current issue of Newsweek (yes, it\u2019s still in business!) has a picture of President Trump sitting in a recliner, with snacks and an iPad in his lap, pointing his TV remote at the viewer, blazoned with the headline, \u201cLazy Boy.\u201d\u000a\u000aLiberals only wish.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLast week, the president joined Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) to announce legislation that would make seminal changes to our immigration laws for the first time in nearly half a century, profoundly affecting the entire country.\u000a\u000aThe media have chosen not to cover the RAISE Act (Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment). This bill is their worst nightmare.\u000a\u000aInstead of admitting immigrants on the basis of often specious \u201cfamily\u201d ties, the bill would finally allow us to choose the immigrants we want, based on merit, with points granted for skills, English proficiency, advanced degrees, actual job offers and so on.\u000a\u000aMost Americans have no idea that we have zero say about the vast majority of immigrants pouring into our country. Two-thirds of all legal immigrants get in not because we want them \u2014 or even because Mark Zuckerberg wants them \u2014 but under idiotic \u201cfamily reunification\u201d laws.\u000a\u000aThe most important provision of the RAISE Act would define \u201cfamily\u201d the way most Americans think of it: your spouse and minor children.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, that\u2019s not how the Third World thinks of \u201cfamily.\u201d In tribal societies, \u201cfamily\u201d means the whole extended clan \u2014 adult siblings, elderly parents, and brothers-in-law, plus all their adult siblings and elderly parents, and so on, ad infinitum.\u000a\u000aEntire tribes of immigrants are able to bully their way in and, as legal immigrants, are immediately eligible for a whole panoply of government benefits. Suddenly, there\u2019s no money left in the Social Security Trust Fund, and Speaker Paul Ryan is telling Americans they\u2019re going to have to cut back.\u000a\u000aAt some point, American businesses are going to have to be told they can\u2019t keep bringing in cheap foreign labor, changing the country, and offloading the costs onto the taxpayer. But that\u2019s not this discussion. Business owners want cheap workers \u2014 not the disabled parents of cheap workers.\u000a\u000aIn a sane world, merely introducing such an important bill \u2014 with the imprimatur of a president elected on his immigration stance \u2014 would force the media to finally discuss the subject they have been deliberately hiding from the public.\u000a\u000aHas Trump personally endorsed any other legislation like this? He harangued congressional Republicans on Twitter to pass some Obamacare replacement, but he never endorsed a specific bill.\u000a\u000aBut, you see, there\u2019s a reason the media don\u2019t want to talk about immigration.\u000a\u000aWith a full public airing, Americans would finally understand why recent immigrants seem so different from earlier waves, why income inequality is approaching czarist Russia levels, why the suicide rate has skyrocketed among the working class, and why all our government benefits programs are headed toward bankruptcy.\u000a\u000aAs Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s inestimable speechwriter, said, some legislative proposals \u201ccan only succeed in the dark of night\u201d and some \u201ccan only succeed in the light of day.\u201d This is a light-of-day bill.\u000a\u000aSo, naturally, the media refuse to mention it, except to accuse Miller of being a white nationalist for knowing hate-facts about the Emma Lazarus poem not being part of the original Statue of Liberty. (It\u2019s the Statue of Liberty, not Statute of Liberty, media.)\u000a\u000aThey ignore this bill so they can get on to the important business of Trump\u2019s tweets, who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the White House, and Russia, Russia, Russia.\u000a\u000aAccording to my review of Nexis archives, there was only a single question about the RAISE Act on any of the Sunday morning shows: Chris Wallace\u2019s last question to his very important Republican guest. Unfortunately, his very important Republican guest was amnesty-supporting nitwit Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who sniped about Trump employing foreign guest workers at Mar-a-Lago.\u000a\u000aHowever that may be, guest workers have absolutely nothing to do with the RAISE Act, which, as Miller heroically tried to explain to clueless reporters, concerns only green-card holders, i.e., lawful permanent residents \u2014 not guest workers, not illegal aliens and not a poem Scotch-taped onto Lady Liberty in 1903.\u000a\u000aAt least the media aren\u2019t deluded about the popularity of their position. Discussing immigration is a total loser for them. They know what they want is not supported by anyone.\u000a\u000aLow-wage workers don\u2019t want hundreds of thousands of low-skilled immigrants being dumped on the country every year. Employers don\u2019t want the deadbeat cousins of their cheap workers. Americans on public assistance don\u2019t want foreigners competing with them for benefits. Boneheaded Scandinavian communities that welcomed refugees don\u2019t want to turn their entire town budgets over to various foreign tribes.\u000a\u000aIn a recent Numbers USA poll of voters in 10 swing states with vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election next year, only 22 percent of respondents thought immigrants should be allowed by right to bring in \u201cfamily\u201d other than spouses and minor children.\u000a\u000aMake the senators vote, Mr. President!\u000a\u000aDonald Trump was elected president, beating the smartest, most qualified woman in the world, by proposing to put Americans first on immigration. This bill makes good on that promise.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a reason the media won\u2019t discuss it. If Trump were smart, he\u2019d talk about nothing else.

aVDemocrats are threatening to shutter many government agencies on October 1 unless President Donald Trump gives up his popular campaign promise to build the border wall against Mexico, according to Politico.\u000a\u000aIn response, Trump\u2019s deputies are offering political compromises to Democrats, including a rise in domestic spending, says Politico:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe White House is pushing a deal on Capitol Hill to head off a government shutdown that would lift strict spending caps long opposed by Democrats in exchange for money for President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexico, multiple sources said. Marc Short, the White House\u2019s director of legislative affairs, met with top staffers from both parties on the Senate Appropriations Committee last week to make a hard sell for the proposal, the sources said. Short \u2014 who said the border funding would be used for a \u201cdouble fence\u201d \u2014 stressed that the White House is insisting on a down payment for construction this fall. Short also lobbied for a big budget increase for the Pentagon, another priority for Trump.\u000a\u000aIf Democrats block the spending plan, many government agencies will have to send their employees home. But national security agencies, and various aid programs, such as the Social Security program, would keep operating.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s pending request for an October funding package of $1.6 billion would help build roughly 62 miles of border wall. In May, Democrats \u2014 aided by a passive GOP leadership \u2014 blocked a 2017 funding package that would have helped quickly build 42 miles of wall.\u000a\u000aLed by Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrats are hoping to block any wall construction, so protecting the northward flow of government-dependent workers to Democratic-run cities, and also breaking Trump\u2019s 2016 primary campaign promise.\u000a\u000aBut Democratic politicians are also being squeezed between their radical base and popular opinion, which favors Trump\u2019s immigration reform plans. For example, Politico reported that Sen. Tammy Baldwin is opposing the border fence. \u201cI do know for a fact that every [Democrat] considers wall funding to be a poison pill,\u201d she told Politico.\u000a\u000aBut a recent poll shows that Trump\u2019s immigration reform gets overwhelming support in Wisconsin where Baldwin must faced the voters in 2018. The June poll of 1,000 likely midterm voters was conducted for NumbersUSA, which favors Trump\u2019s merit immigration reform. For example, the poll asked:\u000a\u000aDo you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose setting up rules to ensure that businesses give first preference for jobs to American workers and legal immigrants already in this country before businesses can ask for new immigrant workers?\u000a\u000aThe proposal won 53 percent strong support, and only 6 percent strong opposition, said NumbersUSA.\u000a\u000aThe NumbersUSA group also polled in Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is also up for election in 2018. He suggested to Politico that he could support Trump\u2019s double-layer fence, saying: \u201cThere are places where the wall makes sense, and there are places where the wall doesn\u2019t make sense and there are better options \u2026 I\u2019ll just take a look at it and see.\u201d\u000a\u000aEight additional Democratic Senators are up for election in 2018 in states where Trump won.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, Schumer and Democrats lost 10 Senate seats after trying to push through the so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d cheap-labor and amnesty bill.\u000a\u000aUnder pre-Trump policies, the federal government annually imports 1 million legal immigrants into the United States, just as 4 million young Americans turn 18.\u000a\u000aThe federal government also awards roughly 1.5 million temporary work permits to foreigners, grants temporary work visas to roughly 500,000 new contract workers, such as H-1B workers, and also largely ignores the resident population of eight million employed illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aThe current annual flood of foreign labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families.

Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s directive does not exclude people who want to live quietly as members of the opposite sex, but ended President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 official endorsement of the transgender claim that people\u2019s biological sex is legally subordinate to their personal sense of male or female \u201cgender.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the lawsuit:\u000a\u000aPresident Trump\u2019s directive to exclude transgender people from military service discriminates against Plaintiffs based on their sex and transgender status, without lawful justification, in violation of the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The categorical exclusion of transgender people from military service lacks a rational basis, is arbitrary, and cannot be justified by sufficient federal interests \u2026 From the implementation of its June 2016 policy until the President\u2019s June 26, 2017 announcement, Defendants provided Plaintiffs with ongoing support for their continued service in the military as openly transgender persons \u2026 In reliance upon that promise from Defendants, Plaintiffs have undergone medical treatment for the purpose of gender transition\u2026 Defendants [should be] estopped from rescinding the rights, benefits, and protections promised to Plaintiffs.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit was filed by National Center for Lesbian Rights and by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders on behalf of five anonymous soldiers who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit is one of many legal efforts which transgender advocates are launching to persuade the Supreme Court to establish the legal and social claim that a person\u2019s self-declared \u201cgender\u201d is more important than their biological sex. If approved, that ambitious demand would sweep away the many evolved and popular laws and civic practices which help the two sexes compete, cooperate and complement each other. For example, sports leagues normally include women or men, but not both. Similarly, childhood is build around the idea that boys and girls should try to become an ideal male or female adult, not a member of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000aTo win that unpopular and revolutionary goal, transgender activists \u2014 and their allies in the Democratic party and in the media \u2014 downplay the political process and instead portray the political dispute as a legal battle for unrecognized-but-real constitutional rights which should instantly trump all federal, state and local laws, as well as public and private civic practices.\u000a\u000aIn this case, the transgender activists say that each soldiers\u2019 supposed right to switch their legal sex trumps the orders of the nation\u2019s elected President and commander-in-chief. Thus the lawsuit plays up the soldiers\u2019 individuals hopes and fears, and ignores the huge impact of a Supreme Court decision saying that even one soldier\u2019s declared gender is more important than his or her biological sex. For example, the lawsuit relies on the personal priorities of five soldiers who insist they are members of the opposite sex.\u000a\u000aAccording to the lawsuit:\u000a\u000aPlaintiffs are active duty servicemembers in the United States military who serve openly as transgender people. They proceed under pseudonyms here for fear of retribution. Jane Doe 1 has served with distinction in the United States Coast Guard for more than a decade. In or around June 2016, in reliance on the issuance of the policy permitting open service by transgender servicemembers, Jane Doe 1 notified her command that she is transgender. Since that time, she has continued to serve without incident and has furthered her gender transition in reliance on the Department of Defense\u2019s policy permitting open service by transgender servicemembers. Following President Trump\u2019s tweets, Jane Doe 1 submitted a prospective letter of resignation stating that she would resign rather than be involuntarily terminated on account of her transgender status. Were the Department of Defense to retreat from the policy announced by President Trump, Jane Doe 1 would withdraw her resignation and continue to serve\u2026 In or around June of 2016, in reliance on the Department of Defense policy permitting transgender people to serve openly in the military, Jane Doe 3 notified her command that she is transgender. Since then, she has continued serving her post without incident. Jane Doe 3\u2019s current contract with the military extends through December 2018. She plans to renew her contract, but fears that she will not be allowed to do so because of the ban.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Commander in Chief has said that transgender service members \u2014 people who have served our nation with honor and distinction \u2014 are no longer welcome to serve,\u201d said a statement from Jennifer Levi, Director of GLAD\u2019s Transgender Rights Project. \u201cThis unjustifiable reversal of policy is devastating to these soldiers and harmful to our country. These plaintiffs put their lives on the line every day for all of us. We can\u2019t afford to lose a single one of them,\u201d Levi added.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit marks a change of strategy for transgender groups. Before Trump\u2019s revocation of Obama\u2019s endorsement of the gender-identity-beats-biology claim, they had hopes to use the Pentagon\u2019s validation to win more lawsuits before making their decisive appeal to the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000aThat strategy worked rapidly for gay activists, who persuaded the Supreme Court in 2015 to approve the Obergefell decision. The decision changed marriage laws to include single-sex couples, and it redefined marriage around the needs of adults, instead of children\u2019s need to be raised in a stable family.\u000a\u000aThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender\u201d has already attacked and cracked popular social rules for how Americans handle the many differences between different, complementary and equal men and women. These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women\u2019s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.\u000a\u000aThat transgender goal is also opposed some gays, by some former transgender people, and some feminists.

aVTEL AVIV \u2013 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday slammed the left and the \u201cfake news\u201d media \u2013 which he said was \u201cthe same thing\u201d \u2013 for embarking on an \u201cobsessive hunting\u201d expedition and using corruption charges against him and his family to bring about \u201ca coup against the government.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey don\u2019t want to just take me down, they want to take us all down,\u201d he told a 3,000-strong crowd of supporters of his Likud party in Tel Aviv. \u201cThey know that they can\u2019t beat us at the ballot boxes, so they are trying to circumvent democracy and topple us in other ways.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cBut we keep winning in the ballots because we\u2019ve brought Israel to the best place it has ever been in Israel\u2019s history,\u201d he said, adding the the \u201cfake news media\u201d would have people believing that Israel is being increasingly treated as a pariah state when in fact the opposite is true.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe State of Israel is in an unprecedented political boom, and the flow of visits to Israel and my flow of invitations abroad is unprecedented: India, China, the United States of course, Africa \u2013 countless countries and continents,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aNetanyahu said keeping his national camp in power is critical to Israel\u2019s future, and that ousting rightwing leadership in the past has only led to disaster for Israel. Likud PM Yitzhak Shamir\u2019s removal from power in 1992 \u2013 on corruption charges \u2013 was followed by \u201cthe Oslo disaster and the exploding buses,\u201d he said, referring to the 1993 peace accords and subsequent explosion of Palestinian violence. He also said that when he himself was ousted in 1999 \u2013 on trumped up charges, he contended \u2013 the Second Intifada, which saw more than a 1,000 Israelis killed in suicide bombings, ensued.\u000a\u000aHe mocked the leftwing daily Haaretz for making him an \u201cexplicit offer\u201d in which the newspaper would \u201cleave him alone\u201d if he agreed to withdraw from the West Bank.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere\u2019s my answer: No! No, thank you! If the left wants to confront us with its political and economic outlook, it would be useful to do that at the ballot box. And in the next elections, with God\u2019s help and with their help, we won\u2019t get 30 seats, but 40 seats!\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know that the left and the media \u2014 and we know that it\u2019s the same thing \u2014 is on an unprecedented witch hunt against me and my family with the goal of achieving a coup against the government,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe thought police in the media work full-time to set the agenda, and woe to anyone who veers away from it,\u201d Netanyahu said, to which the assembled crowd cheered, \u201cdown with the media.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTheir goal is to put unremitting pressure on law enforcement agencies to file an indictment without any connection to the truth, regardless of justice,\u201d Netanyahu warned.\u000a\u000aNetanyahu ended the speech by thanking the crowd effusively, \u201cThank you for your support for me and my beloved wife Sara who has been with me all along. I love you all.\u201d

aVThe apprehension of illegal aliens by Border Patrol agents along the southwest border with Mexico increased for the third straight month. Figures rose from 16,087 in June to 18,198 in July \u2013 a 13.12 percent gain.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aApprehensions of illegal aliens by agents working the border region began to fall following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in November. The number dropped even more dramatically beginning in January and continued falling until April when they reached a historic low of 11,125. Many believe these numbers took a dramatic drop in anticipation of Trump\u2019s promise to build the walls along our border and to rigorously enforce immigration laws inside the country. However, the past three months\u2019 reports show the threat of increased border security and enforcement may not be enough.\u000a\u000aDuring the peak months of the summer heat when the number of apprehensions historically decline, Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) and Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) collars rose dramatically, according to the Southwest Border Migration Report released this week by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.\u000a\u000aThe Border Patrol defines UACs as a person apprehended who is under the age of 18 and is traveling without a parent or guardian. The number of UACs hit a low point in April at 997, \u2014 down from 7,345 in November. The number of UACs apprehended has increased each month since April, reaching 2,495 in July. On average, the number of border apprehensions declines when comparing June to July over the past six years. In 2017, the number of UAC apprehensions increased 28 percent from June to July (1,952 in June, 2,495 in July).\u000a\u000aSimilarly, the apprehension of FMUAs (defined as one or more minors traveling with a single parent or guardian) increased dramatically from June to July this year. FMUA apprehensions rose from 2,322 in June to 3,397 in July \u2013 a 46 percent increase. FMUA apprehensions fell from a high in December of 16,139 to a low-point in April of 1,118 before turning around and starting back up.\u000a\u000aThe Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector in South Texas continues to be the focal point for human smugglers to deliver their cargo of minors and families. Of the 13,115 FMUAs apprehended along the entire southwest border with Mexico in July, 8,718 occurred in the RGV sector (66 percent). Agents arrested 4,082 UACs in the RGV Sector in July. This represents 61 percent of the 6,705 UAC apprehensions in July. Of the 46,182 total apprehensions of illegal aliens along the southwest border, 22,642 occurred in the RGV Sector (49 percent).\u000a\u000aThe 35,517 UACs apprehended so far this fiscal year came to the U.S. from Guatemala (12,274) followed by El Salvador (8,526), Mexico (7,234), and Honduras (6,887). Of the 66,808 FMUAs apprehended in July, 22,510 came from El Salvador followed by 23,067 from Guatemala, 20,226 from Honduras, and 3,481 from Mexico.\u000a\u000aCBP officials point out the total number of apprehensions and inadmissible persons apprehended this fiscal year along the southwest border declined by 22 percent when compared to FY 2016 numbers. The July apprehension and inadmissible numbers are down by 47 percent from one year ago when they were at historic highs.\u000a\u000aBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

aVSouthern Methodist University (SMU) announced late Wednesday it reinstated the 9/11 flag memorial to its prominent place on campus, reversing a decision to relocate lawn displays.\u000a\u000aRecently, officials wanted to move the annual 9/11 tribute to avoid \u201ctriggering\u201d others.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cThe 9/11 display will be on the north portion of the lawn for one day,\u201d said senior Grant Wolf, SMU Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) chairman. He told Breitbart Texas SMU reached an agreement with student groups that will allow displays to continue on the lawn at historic Dallas Hall.\u000a\u000aIn a press release, the university stated one-day displays will remain on the northern section of the Dallas Hall lawn and those lasting up to three days will be situated on the hall\u2019s southern lawn to ensure one area remains open for other uses at all times.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thank the students from across campus who came together in the spirit of mutual respect and civil discourse to achieve this outcome,\u201d said SMU President R. Gerald Turner.\u000a\u000aSMU officials also indicated they intend to review and amend the lawn display policy and procedures, working alongside student government and campus organizations.\u000a\u000a\u201cThroughout these discussions, students have expressed their commitment to freedom of expression \u2013 a value the University shares,\u201d added Turner.\u000a\u000aLast week, Breitbart Texas reported that student groups rallied to support \u201cfree speech\u201d after YAF learned the university instituted a new lawn display policy that barred them and others from using the Dallas Hall lawn, the site of the group\u2019s yearly 9/11 Never Forget Project since 2015.\u000a\u000aWhile the university approved the upcoming 9/11 memorial, administrators told YAF in a July 24 email they relocated the commemorative display consisting of nearly 3,000 American flags to Morrison-McGinnis \u201cMoMac\u201d Park, a larger yet less prestigious area near the dormitories, to avoid \u201ctriggering\u201d others from \u201charmful\u201d or \u201charassing\u201d messages.\u000a\u000aAn uproar ensued. YAF and an amalgam of other student groups, representing a variety of political leanings, rallied on behalf of the First Amendment. They penned an open letter to SMU\u2019s president, expressing disappointment with the new display policy which they believed stifled free speech and expression. The students voiced concerns about other college campuses that \u201chave effectively shut down free speech.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe university apologized for the \u201cinappropriate wording\u201d in the emailed policy and removed references to \u201ctriggering or harmful messages,\u201d although SMU upheld the prohibitive memorial display policy.\u000a\u000aEven Texas Governor Greg Abbott weighed in on the flap, urging Turner to reinstate the 9/11 flag display to the Dallas Hall lawn, which Breitbart Texas reported.

aVGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai defended the dismissal of former Google employee James Damore in a blog post on Tuesday, where he called Damore\u2019s manifesto \u201charmful.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFirst, let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it,\u201d Pichai opined in the blog post. \u201cHowever, portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cTo suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects \u2018each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination,'\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aPichai then claimed that the manifesto \u201cclearly impacted our co-workers, some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender,\u201d and added, \u201cOur co-workers shouldn\u2019t have to worry that each time they open their mouths to speak in a meeting, they have to prove that they are not like the memo states, being \u2018agreeable\u2019 rather than \u2018assertive,\u2019 showing a \u2018lower stress tolerance,\u2019 or being \u2018neurotic.'\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the same time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent. So to be clear again, many points raised in the memo\u2014such as the portions criticizing Google\u2019s trainings, questioning the role of ideology in the workplace, and debating whether programs for women and underserved groups are sufficiently open to all\u2014are important topics. The author had a right to express their views on those topics\u2014we encourage an environment in which people can do this and it remains our policy to not take action against anyone for prompting these discussions. The past few days have been very difficult for many at the company, and we need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree\u2014while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct. I\u2019d encourage each of you to make an effort over the coming days to reach out to those who might have different perspectives from your own. I will be doing the same.\u000a\u000aAfter the manifesto had gone viral online, news outlets reported that some \u201cupset\u201d women at Google took the following day off.\u000a\u000aA former Google software engineer says some women at the company skipped work today, upset by the leaked memo. https://t.co/Uuvd5CBKv7 \u2014 NPR (@NPR) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThis week, Susan Wojcicki, CEO of Google\u2019s YouTube, claimed she had faced discrimination in the tech industry for being a woman, and added that \u201cimplicit biases\u201d still exist within.\u000a\u000aOver 60 women, consisting of both former and current Google employees, are currently considering a lawsuit against the company, alleging gender pay differences and sexism.\u000a\u000aIt is also expected that Damore himself is preparing a lawsuit against Google over his dismissal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m sure a lawsuit will be forthcoming,\u201d predicted Inc writer Suzanne Lucas following Damore\u2019s firing, adding that it was in her opinion illegal in numerous ways for Google to fire the employee.\u000a\u000aIn a series of interviews this week, Damore explained his experiences attending \u201csecret\u201d Google diversity programs.\u000a\u000a\u201cA month and a half ago I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it unrecorded and super secret, and they told me a lot of things that I thought were just not right,\u201d Damore revealed. \u201cThey were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices that they\u2019d been doing in order to increase diversity\u2026 Basically treating people differently based on their race or gender.\u201d

aVThe California State Assembly is now considering legislation that would postpone the start of public middle and high schools until 8:30 a.m. each day, after a large majority of the California State Senate passed the bill earlier this year.\u000a\u000aCalifornia Senate Bill 328 passed out of the Senate by a majority vote of 25 to 13. The legislation, titled \u201cPupil attendance: school start time,\u201d provides that the \u201cpublic school day for middle schools and high schools shall begin no earlier than 8:30 a.m. no later than July 1, 2020.\u201d The most recent version of the bill does provide a two-year waiver for rural districts, but all state public schools would be calendared to start at 8:30 a.m. by 2022.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhen the primary and secondary education system started in the 1800s, California public school districts were free to set school calendars and hours. City schools tended to go year-round, and rural schools were open for the equivalent of five months, with winter and summer sessions that allowed farm children to help with planting and harvesting crops.\u000a\u000aUnion concerns about the ill effects of too much schooling on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 health led to eliminating summer terms and setting a standardized statewide 180-day school year in the 1950s. The California Legislature cut the public school year calendar to 175 days in 2008. The change was described by unions as an effort to reduce environmental damage by reducing transportation, heating and cooling, and food service costs.\u000a\u000aBut with California public schools\u2019 National Assessment of Educational Progress standardized test scores for 4th- and 8th-grade student math and reading scores plunging to the bottom fifth of U.S. states, the 180-day school year was reestablished in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe justification for later school days is based on studies by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute that the daily recommendation for sleep is 16 to 18 hours for newborn babies, 11 to 12 hours for preschool children, 10 hours for school-age children, and 9 to 10 hours for teenagers. But with an individual\u2019s biological clock shifting forward in adolescence, teenagers tend to become more alert and have difficulty falling asleep in the evening and waking early in the morning, according to the National Sleep Foundation.\u000a\u000aSB-328 cleared the Assembly Education Committee by a 5-to-2 vote and is moving toward an Assembly floor vote. Governor Jerry Brown has not indicated whether he will sign the legislation if it is passed and moved to desk.

aVFired Google employee James Damore appeared in interviews with Professor Jordan Peterson and Stefan Molyneux this week to discuss his dismissal from the company after he published a viewpoint diversity manifesto.\u000a\u000aDamore discussed details on the secret diversity programs he attended at Google, \u201cpotential racism\u201d at the company, virtue signalling, and the way Silicon Valley employees that aren\u2019t progressive feel the need to stay in the ideological closet.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aDuring an interview with psychologist Jordan Peterson, Damore was quick to reassure viewers that his dismissal had nothing to do with performance.\u000a\u000a\u201cI got promoted twice, my last review was the highest possible, superb, which is the top few percentile,\u201d he claimed. \u201cSo it definitely wasn\u2019t based on performance that they fired me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA month and a half ago I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it unrecorded and super secret, and they told me a lot of things that I thought were just not right,\u201d Damore continued. \u201cThey were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices that they\u2019d been doing in order to increase diversity\u2026 Basically treating people differently based on their race or gender.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo you mean racism,\u201d asked Peterson.\u000a\u000a\u201cYeah, basically,\u201d Damore confirmed. \u201cMost meetings at Google are recorded, anyone at Google can watch it, we\u2019re trying to be really open about everything, except for this. They don\u2019t want any paper trail for any of these things\u2026 because I think it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\u000a\u000aDamore elaborated to Peterson that there\u2019s \u201ca lot of ways in which they pressure people to \u2018increase the diversity\u2019 of their team, and there\u2019s no way to do that besides actually choosing someone based on their race or gender.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe former Google employee also claimed that his manifesto was published around one month ago, and that the company only started to care after it was leaked to the public and started to go viral online.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was only after it went viral and got leaked to the news that Google started caring,\u201d Damore declared. \u201cIt sucks, but at least I was proven right.

I decided to create the document to clarify my thoughts.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the topic of support, Damore claimed, \u201cThere may be a lot of negative responses in the public. But very few of them actually send me messages. They just want to virtue signal to all their followers, \u2018I\u2019m a great person, I share your morals. This person is bad.\u2019 But they don\u2019t really want to have a debate on why I\u2019m wrong, or even confront me, they just want to show how self-righteous they are.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a ton of personal messages of support which has been really nice,\u201d he continued. \u201cI got that at Google before all of this leaked. Lots of upper management were shaming me.\u201d\u000a\u000aDamore also added that there are \u201ca lot\u201d of conservative and anti-SJW employees in Silicon Valley \u201cthat feel like they need to stay in the closet and not really reveal themselves, and mask and say things they don\u2019t believe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of libertarians, which would sort of be independent of the left and right, because at least according to Jonathan Haidt\u2019s work, the libertarian mindset is actually very logical, which would fit with coding,\u201d he explained.\u000a\u000aGoogle fired Damore this week after he published a viewpoint diversity manifesto, which explained why there are not more women in tech jobs and called for more ideological diversity in Google\u2019s workplace.\u000a\u000aIn a memo, the company claimed Damore had advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d despite the fact that numerous psychologists, male and female, deemed the manifesto to be scientifically accurate.\u000a\u000aDamore is currently \u201cexploring all possible legal remedies\u201d against Google.

aVNEW YORK, NY \u2014 This week, progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) joined Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) in opposing the bipartisan Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720), claiming the bill violates the First Amendment right to support boycotting Israel and the settlements by penalizing U.S. citizens.\u000a\u000aThe boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement is an anti-Israel effort that seeks to cripple the Middle Eastern democracy\u2019s legitimacy by targeting it financially and subjecting it to left-wing propaganda.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not support the boycott. I think the boycott is wrong, but I think outlawing protected free speech activity violates our basic Constitution,\u201d Warren said during her \u201c10th town hall of the year\u201d in Revere, Massachusetts on Saturday.\u000a\u000aBREAKING: @SenWarren supports our right to boycott and opposes the Israel Anti-Boycott Act to not "outlaw protected free speech" pic.twitter.com/WvunPwRIXd \u2014 JewishVoiceForPeace (@jvplive) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aWarren\u2019s statement came in response to a question asked by \u201cJewish Voice for Peace\u201d (JVP) member William Ruhm, who asked, \u201cSenator Warren will you stand with us in opposing the Israel Anti-Boycott Act?\u201d At an event in April, JVP hosted a convicted former Palestinian terrorist who is scheduled for deportation from the United States this month for lying on her immigration papers.\u000a\u000aThe Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which was introduced by Warren\u2019s fellow Democrat Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) in March and supported by 45 additional senators from the Republican and Democratic parties, \u201copposes the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution of March 24, 2016, which urges countries to pressure companies to divest from, or break contracts with, Israel\u201d and \u201cencourages full implementation of the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 through enhanced, government-wide, coordinated U.S.-Israel scientific and technological cooperation in civilian areas.\u201d\u000a\u000aLast week, Sen. Gillibrand came under fire from World Jewish Congress president Ron Lauder, who said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by her decision to withdraw her backing of the Act.\u000a\u000aGillibrand also cited the First Amendment as the basis for her choice; a position held by progressive groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\u000a\u000aBreitbart previously reported, \u201cIn an op-ed last month, the ACLU wrote, \u2018Last week, the ACLU came out against a bill that would criminalize constitutionally protected boycotts and certain speech targeting Israel. The Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which was introduced in both the House and Senate earlier this year, would expand a 1970s-era export law and expose a range of activity to sweeping penalties, including criminal prosecution.'\u201d\u000a\u000aThe ACLU has also targeted members of the Democratic Party over their support for Israel.\u000a\u000aLast month, they attacked Sen.

They are not interpreting the bill correctly. The bill is not dealing with personal speech, it\u2019s dealing with commercial activity.\u201d\u000a\u000aMillner added, \u201cThe ACLU is conveniently leaving out the fact that the 1979 Anti-Boycott bill has been upheld as constitutional. These bills have now passed in 22 states and it\u2019s important that we call out BDS for what it is; a hate campaign against Israel. It\u2019s economic warfare.

aVThe Chinese public is now able to \u201cbinge\u201d watch surveillance feeds like a reality TV show, even spying on young children, according to a report.\u000a\u000aIn an article for the Wall Street Journal, writer Josh Chin explains that \u201cChina\u2019s 751 million internet users can binge on real-time video streams of yoga studios, swimming lessons, alpaca ranches and thousands of other scenes captured by surveillance cameras.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cMuch of what\u2019s available would be unthinkable in the West, according to legal experts, because people dining out, taking dance classes or shopping for lingerie would likely object to having their live images beamed publicly, and doing so without their permission could invite litigation,\u201d Chin continued. \u201cIn China, however, surveillance is both pervasive and widely accepted.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cRelaxed popular attitudes toward privacy are one reason China\u2019s government has been able to push the boundaries of surveillance,\u201d elaborated Chin in his article. \u201cChina is unique in offering up such a trove of surveillance video, privacy advocates said. While sites exist elsewhere that provide live access to surveillance video, none do it on the scale of Chinese sites.\u201d\u000a\u000aChin also claimed that surveillance has even extended into schools and classrooms, where voyeuristic men can watch young students engaging in activities.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo [surveillance warning] notice was visible at the Shang Ya Dance School in northern Beijing last week as a white Qihoo camera live-streamed a dozen young girls in pastel leotards twirling around a cramped studio,\u201d Chin declared. \u201cParents and a staff member at the studio said they thought the feed was only visible in a private chat group for students\u2019 parents, but it was open to the public on the Shuidi site.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnonymous strangers allegedly commented throughout the dance class, making comments about the young girls, such as, \u201cThe first and second ones in the front row are the best dancers.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharles Farrier, the founder of British \u201cprivacy activist group\u201d No CCTV, claims public surveillance feeds \u201cnormalize\u201d the concept of spying on other people, \u201cthus making it more acceptable for the police or the state to spy on its citizens.\u201d\u000a\u000aHundreds of live surveillance feeds are currently available to watch on Chinese sites such as Shuidi.

aV\u201cScientists behind a bombshell new report revealing global warming to be worse than ever are now worried that the Trump administration may try to change or suppress it because it contradicts the president\u2019s denialist agenda.\u201d\u000a\u000aOr so the New York Times has claimed. And also, in its wake, papers including the London Evening Standard and the Guardian.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThis is worse than mere #fakenews.\u000a\u000aThis is #fakenews with icing and cherries on top, rings on its fingers, bells on its toes, a specially commissioned foreword by Al Gore and a rave review (\u201cI love these lies. I could not have written better ones myself\u201d) written from hell by the tormented shade of Josef Goebbels.\u000a\u000aNo, actually, it might even be worse than that.\u000a\u000aFirst, the New York Times initially claimed \u2014 before being embarrassed by the Daily Caller into a retraction\u2014 that this draft report from a National Climate Assessment by scientists from 13 federal agencies had \u201cnot yet been made public.\u201d\u000a\u000aNope. As even some of the scientists who had contributed to it had to admit, draft versions of this report had been available on the internet for months.\u000a\u000aImportant to point out that this report was already accessible to anyone who cared to read it during public review & comment time. Few did. https://t.co/eYgsj09Z97 \u2014 Katharine Hayhoe (@KHayhoe) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aPerhaps this was simply a mistake by the New York Times. But the suspicion arises that what it was actually doing was trying to sex up a tired old story as part of a concerted drive by the climate alarmist establishment to embarrass the Trump administration in the wake of its withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, if you believe the New York Times version events, this is still dynamite:\u000a\u000aIt directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain, and that the ability to predict the effects is limited.\u000a\u000aand\u000a\u000aThe authors note that thousands of studies, conducted by tens of thousands of scientists, have documented climate changes on land and in the air. \u201cMany lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate change,\u201d they wrote.\u000a\u000aand\u000a\u000aOne government scientist who worked on the report, Katharine Hayhoe, a professor of political science at Texas Tech University, called the conclusions among \u201cthe most comprehensive climate science reports\u201d to be published. Another scientist involved in the process, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, said he and others were concerned that it would be suppressed.\u000a\u000aYeah right. There\u2019s only one plausible reason why anyone would wish to have this report \u201csuppressed\u201d: sheer ruddy embarrassment.\u000a\u000aAs both Steven Goddard and Paul Homewood have comprehensively demonstrated, the draft report is riddled with the most basic errors, lies, and distortions. It is a political document not a scientific one\u2014 thrown together in order to ramp up public hysteria about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and entrench the power of the climate mafia.\u000a\u000aHere, Goddard points out one of its most outrageous cheats:\u000a\u000aYes, those federal scientists really are that brazen. They created a fake upward trend in temperatures by starting in 1980 \u2014 the coldest point of the last century. And they have such contempt for those outside their climate alarmist bubble they thought no one would notice.\u000a\u000aIn fact, as Homewood notes, it\u2019s even worse than that.\u000a\u000aThe actual temperatures measured show that the US climate is no warmer now than prior to 1960. It is only by adjusting the measured temperatures that NOAA can come up with their \u201chotter than ever\u201d claims.\u000a\u000aHomewood goes on to demonstrate that this doomsday report cobbled together by the politicised scientists of the National Climate Assessment is actually a farrago of wild claims backed up by no evidence.\u000a\u000aNo, global warming hasn\u2019t continued in recent years.\u000a\u000aNo, current temperatures are NOT \u2014 as this report astoundingly claims \u2014 much higher than in \u201cat least the last 1700 years.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo, there have not been record droughts in the US recently: in fact quite the opposite is true.\u000a\u000aNo, there has not been dramatically increased recent rainfall in the US.\u000a\u000aNo, there have not been more hurricanes and tornadoes: again, quite the opposite, actually.\u000a\u000aNo, there has not been more extreme heat in the US \u2013 as even the report itself quietly admits. But only buried in the small print:\u000a\u000aNo the rate of sea level rise has not increased since the mid-19th century.\u000a\u000aNo, there has not been unprecedented Arctic warming.\u000a\u000aHomewood concludes:\u000a\u000aAlthough the world has warmed up since the 19thC, evidence strongly shows that it is no warmer than other recent warm periods. Far from temperatures becoming more extreme, the opposite appears to be the case. Meanwhile weather is also not getting more extreme. Indeed, in the US evidence clearly shows that the weather has been more benign in recent decades.\u000a\u000aWhen future historians write about the lunacy of the great global warming scare, one of the things they will marvel at is the fact that you could find more objective truth and scientific integrity in the work of two relatively obscure bloggers \u2014 Goddard and Homewood \u2014 than you could in either America\u2019s most famous newspaper or, indeed, in a National Climate Assessment produced by some of the most expert scientists from 13 federal agencies.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s your swamp right there, Mr President.

aVBallotpedia Editor-at-Large Scott Rasmussen highlights in an article why Obamacare remains so unpopular.\u000a\u000aObamacare requires that every American must have health insurance or pay a penalty. Last year, 6.5 million U.S. citizens chose to pay the Obamacare penalty rather than purchase health insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently revealed that 15 million Americans would drop their Obamacare insurance coverage if they were not mandated to purchase insurance.\u000a\u000aRasmussen notes that Americans do not necessarily want to forgo health insurance, they might just want to purchase more affordable health insurance that fits their specific needs. Obamacare requires that every insurance policy cover a wide range of services, otherwise known as essential health benefits. Rasmussen contends, \u201cThe more benefits that a plan covers, the more expensive it is. Some people might prefer to buy less comprehensive insurance at a lower cost. For example, one option might be to buy insurance only for major healthcare costs such as surgeries or hospitalizations.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeveral Republican bills tried to adjust some essential health benefits that a health insurer must provide. The House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA) contained waivers that would allow states to eliminate some essential health benefits. The Senate\u2019s Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) contained an amendment sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) that would have allowed health insurers to provide more affordable health insurance plans that do not comply with Obamacare\u2019s essential health benefits as long as they provided plans that did comply with the Obamacare regulations.\u000a\u000aThe Ballotpedia editor-at-large believes that the rising cost of health care due to Obamacare also drives down wage growth. Rasmussen charged, \u201cIf the cost of benefits were the same today as a generation ago, the average pay for full-time workers would be more than $3,300 higher annually. Some people might prefer a bigger paycheck and less comprehensive coverage.\u201d\u000a\u000aBob Laszewski, a healthcare policy analyst, argues that the unpopularity of Obamacare calls into question the long-term stability of the individual health insurance market. Laszewski pointed out that \u201conly about 40 percent of those eligible for subsidies have signed up for coverage. In what other business or government program would such a dismal acceptance by those it was targeted to serve be considered a success?\u201d

aVUNITED NATIONS \u2013 A top United Nations development agency is carrying out a project to make North Korea \u2013 a country where most residents are in the dark at night and where many of its people are starving \u2013 more ozone-friendly.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has been allocated a budget of $798,247 as part of a worldwide effort to phase out hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which an agency official tells Breitbart News are \u201cscientifically proven as ozone depleting substances and controlled under the Montreal Protocol.\u201d According to the project\u2019s website, it has already spent $466,375.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe funding was approved by the Executive Committee of Multilateral Fund for Implementation of Montreal Protocol (MLF EC), at which the U.S. has a representative. That fund is \u201cdedicated to reversing the deterioration of the Earth\u2019s ozone layer\u201d and was set up after the 1989 Montreal Protocol, which sought to reverse the damage done to the ozone layer.\u000a\u000aSince North Korea is a party to the Montreal Protocol, it is eligible to receive funding for a project for HCFC phase-out, and UNIDO was chosen as the lead implementing agency for the project.\u000a\u000aThe project, which looks to bring North Korea into the Montreal Protocol\u2019s compliance target of a 15 percent reduction of HCFCs by 2018, was approved in 2014. It includes a conversion of a number of factories that currently use HCFCs, an \u201cimprovement of recovery and recycling scheme,\u201d as well as money set aside for \u201cawareness-raising and public education.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne contract under the project hands a whopping $265,000 to a Chinese company for the replacement of HCFCs at a foam factory in Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aOther countries such as Saudi Arabia, India, and numerous others have also been implementing what is known as the \u201cHCFC Phase-out Management Plan,\u201d but such countries are not involved in a widely-condemned race to manufacture nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aA U.S.-drafted resolution Saturday slapped sanctions on North Korea\u2019s exports of iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore, and seafood, as well as limiting business collaborations with the rogue regime, in response to two intercontinental ballistic missile launches in July.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported Tuesday that the regime now has the capability to load miniature nuclear warheads into missiles, while Fox News reported that the regime has been loading cruise missiles onto ships \u2013 signs that North Korea has been undeterred by U.S. efforts and is pushing forward with its military escalation.\u000a\u000aPerhaps more jarring about the ozone-efficiency project is how the U.N. is focusing on making North Korea more energy efficient when it is already a country that not only starves its people but plunges its people into darkness at night.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News asked UNIDO if the contract was connected to possible rocket-building concerns. A NASA fact sheet notes that HCFC-141b, among its many domestic uses, can be used as a blowing agent to create a foam that can be used to coat rockets. However, UNIDO told Breitbart that environmental reasons were the sole reason for the contract, which is focused on the implementation of the Montreal Protocol.\u000a\u000a\u201cHence the project implemented by UNIDO will result in zero import/consumption of HCFC-141b in DPR Korea after 2018 while without the project the country would continue to import and consume the chemical,\u201d a UNIDO spokesperson said.\u000a\u000aAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

We will address those.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cAt every step along the way, we\u2019re going to try to do as much communication, as this thing is progressing as possible so that you have some understanding of where it\u2019s going,\u201d Tillerson said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m kind of with you,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ll see it together and then we\u2019ll make some decisions about what we think is actually achievable, what we think we do need to go to the Congress to get some help on, and we\u2019ll work this thing together,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to take the time it takes up front to allow us to get to that answer.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreitbart News reported in February that President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2018 budget called for a 37 percent cut of the State Department\u2019s $50 billion-plus current budget.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople familiar with the deliberations said the Trump administration is examining the growth in spending by the State Department during the Obama administration, including that caused by the addition of special envoys, though they said that would not cover the proposed cuts,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne U.S. official said that the State Department is looking at development assistance to other countries as a significant source for the cuts,\u201d the Journal reported.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press quoted officials as saying that there would be \u201cdeep cuts in spending for diplomacy and foreign aid programs,\u201d while \u201cdevelopment assistance would take the biggest hit.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cStaff reductions would be required, \u2018including security contractors at diplomatic missions abroad,'\u201d according to these sources.\u000a\u000aTillerson concluded by calling the State Department \u201cpatriotic\u201d and committed to \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo the most important thing for me to leave you with, though, is again, what I learned out of that listening exercise is what a dedicated, patriotic organization I have the extreme honor to lead,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cAnd it is really an honor for me to be in this position leading you, because your commitment, your dedication to what you\u2019re doing came through loud and clear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd that is the most important thing to me is that we have an organization that is committed to doing the right thing, so we want to help you do that during my time that I\u2019m here,\u201d Tillerson said.

aVA new analysis, published by FiveThirtyEight, shows the congressional map for the 2018 midterm elections has a record-setting pro-GOP bias, which could mean more winning for President Donald Trump and his Republican party.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Cook Political Report\u2019s David Wasserman, things are not looking good for Democrats:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aEven if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points \u2014 a pretty good midterm by historical standards \u2014 they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats.\u000a\u000aWasserman attributes this partially to Republican gerrymandering and Democratic voters\u2019 clustering in urban areas, which he says, \u201chas moved the median House seat well to the right of the nation.\u201d\u000a\u000aTiming and a \u201cterrible Senate map\u201d for Democrats are also to blame, he says. While Democrats must defend 25 of their 48 seats in 2018, Republicans have just eight of their 52 seats up for grabs.\u000a\u000aAnother problem for Democrats that Wasserman points out is Democrats hold far more Republican seats on, what he calls, \u201cborrowed time\u201d: Democrats hold six Senate seats from the 26 Republican-leaning states \u2014 all six of which are at risk next year.\u000a\u000aThis bad news for Democrats goes well beyond 2018, the report says. \u201c[T]here\u2019s a larger, long-term trend at work too \u2014 one that should alarm Democrats preoccupied with the future of Congress and the Supreme Court.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the last few decades, Democrats have expanded their advantages in California and New York \u2014 states with huge urban centers that combined to give Clinton a 6 million vote edge, more than twice her national margin. But those two states elect only 4 percent of the Senate. Meanwhile, Republicans have made huge advances in small rural states \u2014 think Arkansas, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia \u2014 that wield disproportionate power in the upper chamber compared to their populations.\u000a\u000aBy quantifying the partisan bias of Congress over time, \u201cby measuring the distance between each national presidential result and each year\u2019s presidential result in the median House and Senate seats\u201d, Wasserman shows that today the pro-GOP bias in both the House and Senate are at historic highs. According to the report, the last time the Senate had such a strong Republican bias was in 1913 \u2014 the year direct Senate elections were ratified.\u000a\u000aWhile their odds don\u2019t look good, there may still be hope for Democrats in 2018. They did, after all, win back control of both chambers in 2006, despite a GOP bias that year. However, it\u2019s definitely a long-shot, Wasserman says, citing the 2010 scenario in which Democrats were able to obtain 60 senate seats, enabling them to pass Obamacare.\u000a\u000aWhat did it take for the party to be able to obtain 60 seats? The Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina and a stock market crash, which generated a huge backlash against President George W. Bush and Republicans in 2008. Today, it would take even more cataclysmic events under GOP rule to propel Democrats to a supermajority over the next six years.\u000a\u000aWhile it is still early in the cycle, one Republican Senate seat at risk of being lost to the Democrats is Dean Heller\u2019s Nevada seat.\u000a\u000aElected in 2012 with just 46 percent of the vote, Heller is the only Republican senator up for re-election from a state Clinton won last year. He is being targeted from both the right and left and has even been confronted by President Trump over his unease with the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal effort.\u000a\u000aAmanda House is Breitbart News\u2019 Deputy Political Editor.

aVU.S. District Judge William H. Walls delayed ruling on a motion to dismiss the public corruption charges against Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) until the trial of the senator and his co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, begins in a federal courtroom in New Jersey on September 6.\u000a\u000aMelgen was convicted in April on 67 felony counts of Medicare fraud, many of which are related to illegal billing practices. The public corruption charges brought against Menendez and Melgen by the Department of Justice allege that Menendez engaged in official acts to directly aid Melgen in his efforts to receive payments for the same sort of illegal billing practices for which he was convicted.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn return for his personal lobbying efforts on behalf of Melgen, the federal government alleges Menendez received $58,000 in free travel to the Dominican Republic and Florida (for which Menendez subsequently reimbursed Melgen) and nearly $1 million in direct and indirect campaign contributions to his re-election campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a motion filed July 18, attorneys for Menendez sought to dismiss the charges under a U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned the conviction of former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell in a similar case, narrowing the definition of \u2018official acts\u2019 required under the federal bribery statute,\u201d NJ.com reported:\u000a\u000aThe lawyers argued much of the current superseding indictment describes actions by Menendez\u2019s staffers, rather than the senator himself, \u201cand many involve trivial functions rather than official acts.\u201d \u201cDefendants believe the superseding indictment is hopelessly vague and defective if a jury can find that Senator Menendez took an official act based on everything charged in the \u2018official acts\u2019 section of the superseding indictment, ranging from acts taken by others or acts as innocent as meeting friends of Dr. Melgen, and there is no meaningful way to prepare for a trial involving what breaks down into literally hundreds of individual acts by the government\u2019s count,\u201d the attorneys wrote. Prosecutors allege the doctor provided Menendez with benefits ranging from luxury hotel stays to campaign donations in exchange for the senator lobbying government officials regarding a Medicare dispute and Melgen\u2019s efforts to obtain a port security contract in the Dominican Republic, among other matters.\u000a\u000aA Supreme Court case decided last year, McDonnell v. United States, established the standard of \u201cofficial act.\u201d As Scotus Blog described the McDonnell v. United States opinion announced on June 27, 2016:\u000a\u000aHolding: The federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, makes it a crime for a public official to \u201creceive or accept anything of value\u201d in exchange for being \u201cinfluenced in the performance of any official act.\u201d An \u201cofficial act\u201d is a decision or action on a \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d; that question or matter must involve a formal exercise of governmental power, and must also be something specific and focused that is \u201cpending\u201d or \u201cmay by law be brought\u201d before a public official. To qualify as an \u201cofficial act,\u201d the public official must make a decision to take an action on that question or matter, or agree to do so. Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event \u2014 without more \u2014 does not fit that definition of \u201cofficial act.\u201d Because jury instructions in the case of former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell were erroneous, and those errors are not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, McDonnell\u2019s convictions are vacated. Judgment: Vacated and remanded, 8-0, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts on June 27, 2016.\u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court decision reversed a 2014 federal conviction of McDonnell on 11 counts of public corruption, when the jury concluded that he and his wife had \u201cperform[ed] or promise[d] to perform \u2018official acts\u2019 for Williams [a businessman with a line of vitamin products] in exchange for $177,000 in gifts and loans,\u201d the Washington Post reported:\u000a\u000aThose acts, they said, came in the form of meetings McDonnell arranged for Williams with state officials, a luncheon Williams was allowed to throw at the governor\u2019s mansion to help launch a product he was trying to sell, and a guest list Williams was allowed to shape at another mansion reception meant for health-care leaders. Defense attorneys argued otherwise, saying there was no evidence that McDonnell even knew what Williams wanted. And what he did want \u2014 state-funded studies of his company\u2019s dietary supplement, Anatabloc \u2014 he never got, defense attorneys stressed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether the acts alleged in the superseding indictment satisfy the definition of an \u2018official act\u2019 under McDonnell is a factual determination that cannot be resolved before the government has the opportunity to present evidence at trial,\u201d Judge Walls wrote in his court order announced on Wednesday, NJ.com reported:\u000a\u000aEven if the judge did determine some of Menendez\u2019s actions fell outside the definition, he could still allow the case to go to the jury. \u201cUnder McDonnell, evidence of non-official acts may still be relevant evidence in the prosecution of a federal bribery claim,\u201d Walls wrote.\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News reported, Menendez\u2019s conduct in directly lobbying then-Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius on behalf of Melgen\u2019s spurious and rejected $9 million billing claim for the period between 2005 and 2008 (prior to the timeframe of the felony crimes of which he was convicted in his trial) appears to be significantly different than the acts for which McDonnell was convicted, which conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court ruling.\u000a\u000aAs Breitbart News reported, Menendez \u201cmet with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Director Marilyn Tavenner on June 7, 2012, in an apparent attempt to persuade her that his close friend and major donor, Dr. Salomon Melgen, did not owe the federal government $9 million for Medicare overbilling\u201d:\u000a\u000aIt was a pure New Jersey-style political power play on Menendez\u2019s part, since the CMS had carefully documented Melgen\u2019s egregious violation of clear and widely understood billing practices. Tavenner was unpersuaded by Menendez\u2019s pitch. He reportedly left the meeting frustrated he had not been able to deliver a solution to his friend\u2019s problems with the government.\u000a\u000aRebuffed by Tavenner, \u201cMenendez decided to turn up the political pressure by speaking to [her] boss, Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius\u201d:\u000a\u000aThe very next day \u2014 June 8, 2012 \u2014 Melgen (through Vitreo-Retinal Consultants, the company HHS said overbilled the federal government by $9 million) contributed $300,000 to the Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC closely aligned with Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). Reid was the Majority Leader then and is currently the Minority Leader. Founded in 2011, the super PAC is co-chaired by two former top staffers from Reid\u2019s office. Ironically, the funds for this generous contribution may well have come from the $9 million CMS says the federal government overpaid Melgen because of his overbilling. CMS has asked for Melgen to repay that money, but Melgen apparently has other uses for it and is fighting desperately to hang on to it. Shortly thereafter, Menendez began pressuring Reid to go over Tavenner\u2019s head and set up a meeting with Sebelius where he could again make the case that his friend really didn\u2019t owe the federal government that $9 million CMS said he had overbilled. The lobbying of Reid by Menendez and his friend Melgen soon became very personal.\u000a\u000a\u201cMelgen\u2019s private jet flew from Florida to Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 2012, presumably carrying Melgen. The next day, on June 18, Melgen\u2019s private jet flew Reid from Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. to Boston and back. It is unclear if Melgen accompanied Reid on that flight, but if he did, the two would have had plenty of time to discuss Melgen\u2019s Medicare overbilling problems, his potential future political donations to Reid\u2019s Senate Majority Super PAC, and what Reid might be willing to do to advance his business interests,\u201d Breitbart News reported:\u000a\u000aOn June 28, 2012, Melgen\u2019s Vitreo-Retinal Consultants contributed an additional $100,000 to Reid\u2019s Super Majority PAC. The next week, on July 2, 2012, Menendez spoke on the phone with CMS\u2019s Tavenner, but made no progress in ending Melgen\u2019s $9 million overbilling problem. Over the next several weeks, Menendez succeeded in persuading Reid to convince Secretary Sebelius to meet with him in person. Reid seems to have summoned Sebelius to Capitol Hill for a meeting with Menendez that he would host in his Senate Majority Leader\u2019s offices.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn August 2012, Sebelius had been summoned to Capitol Hill for a private meeting with Menendez in the office of Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), then the Senate majority leader,\u201d Politico reported in March 2015, one month before Menendez and Melgen were indicted on public corruption charges. It added, \u201cAccording to Sebelius, the topic of the meeting was a multimillion dollar billing dispute between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and a company run by Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.\u201d\u000a\u000aA spokesperson for Mendendez at the time told Politico, \u201cWe have said from the beginning that our office made inquiries regarding the ambiguities in CMS multi-dosing instructions and regulations and the public policy considerations of multi-dosing, continuing, \u201cThat was precisely what Sen. Menendez discussed with the secretary in 2012. It is also our understanding that the DOJ is fully aware that the senator did not mention Melgen during their meeting\u201d:\u000a\u000aBut Sebelius recalled that she had been told the purpose of the meeting was to discuss \u201cbilling issues with Dr. Melgen,\u201d raising red flags that prompted her to take the matter to the HHS counsel\u2019s office before sitting down with the senator. Sebelius said she was \u201cconcerned that I knew enough about the investigation\u201d into Menendez\u2019s actions that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to open the door to any inappropriate discussion\u201d during their meeting. But HHS attorneys assured her that she could meet with Menendez, and she said she told the senator the dispute was being handled by an outside administrative review board. \u2026 \u201cSen. Reid did the convening, but he really wasn\u2019t a participant,\u201d she said. \u201cSen. Menendez laid out concerns of what he thought were rules that had not been fairly or universally applied \u2013 that somehow the rules had changed along the way and the kinds of investigation and denial of billing procedures with this case had seemed different than other cases.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOn October 16, 2012, Melgen\u2019s Vitreo-Retinal Consultants donated another $300,000 to Reid\u2019s Super Majority PAC, bringing the company\u2019s total contributions in 2012 to $700,000. In November 2012, Menendez was easily re-elected to another six-year term in the Senate, defeating his Republican rival by a 58 percent to 39 percent margin, \u201d Breitbart News reported.\u000a\u000aIn the end, the Department of Health and Human Services denied Melgen\u2019s appeal on the $9 million improper billing dispute for the 2005 to 2008 period.\u000a\u000aMelgen continued those billing practices, however, and that conduct ultimately led to his conviction on the 67 felony counts in April.

aVThe U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on eight individuals in Venezuela on Wednesday, citing them for \u201corganizing or otherwise supporting the creation of Venezuela\u2019s Constituent Assembly\u201d and \u201cparticipating in anti-democratic actions.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d is socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro\u2019s sham legislature, whipped up in an effort to disempower what remains of representative government in the country. The assembly was created in a July 30 election deemed illegitimate by the U.S. government and most of the states in the Western Hemisphere.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aMaduro himself was hit by sanctions last week, in what the Associated Press describes as \u201ca rare action against a foreign head of state.\u201d This was followed swiftly by a round of sanctions against 13 current and former officials from the Maduro government.\u000a\u000aSix of the eight people named in the new sanctions list are members or functionaries of the new Constituent Assembly. One of them, Adán Coromoto Chávez Frías, is the brother of the late Hugo Chávez, Maduro\u2019s mentor.\u000a\u000aAlso sanctioned were Tania D\u2019Amelio Cardiet, a rector of the Venezuelan National Electoral Council, who is believed to be under investigation in Venezuela for vote fraud; and military commander Bladimir Humberto Lugo Armas, who handles security for the original, legitimate National Assembly. Armas does not appear to have much enthusiasm for his job these days, since he stands accused of assaulting several Assembly members who oppose Maduro, including Assembly President Julio Borges.\u000a\u000aThe Miami Herald notes that one of the sanctioned individuals, Constituent Assembly delegate Hermann Escarra, has owned property in South Florida, as have members of his family. \u201cEscarra himself was spotted at a North Miami Mercedes-Benz dealership in April,\u201d the Herald reports.\u000a\u000aSanctions against Venezuela are still gaining steam. The Herald notes that the Trump administration is threatening to sanction all 545 members of the Constituent Assembly, one of whom is Nicolás Maduro\u2019s wife. Administration officials have said they intend to deploy sanctions slowly, carefully, and \u201cstrategically.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Maduro swore in this illegitimate Constituent Assembly to further entrench his dictatorship and continues to tighten his grip on the country. This regime\u2019s disregard for the will of the Venezuelan people is unacceptable, and the United States will stand with them in opposition to tyranny until Venezuela is restored to a peaceful and prosperous democracy,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in announcing the new sanctions.

aVSen. John McCain (R-AZ) announced Thursday that he will submit a plan for more U.S. troops in Afghanistan when Congress drafts its annual defense policy bill.\u000a\u000aMcCain\u2019s statement, described by the Associated Press as \u201ca rebuke to President Donald Trump,\u201d comes after the Commander-in-Chief rejected Afghan war plans from the Pentagon and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. Those strategies, though not revealed to the public, have been described with proposals similar to McCain\u2019s.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aPolitico\u2018s Susan B. Glasser reported in late July that Laurel Miller, former Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP), took part in McMaster\u2019s Afghanistan planning and \u201cbelieves that is has produced essentially a status-quo, stay-the-course proposal.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe primary suggestions in the rejected strategy include increased troop deployment and at least four more years of engagement:\u000a\u000a[T]he president\u2019s hesitation is also, according to multiple current and former senior U.S. officials I\u2019ve spoken with in recent days, a striking vote of no-confidence in his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who has been trying and failing for months to sell the president on a new plan for Afghanistan. McMaster has made a major policy review of America\u2019s long, failed war there his personal mission, according to the sources, and he pushed hard to get a new strategy that would include the relatively modest troop increases and a commitment to at least another four-year timeline approved in advance of Trump\u2019s May summit with NATO allies. \u2026 Hawks like Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, until his recent health troubles, had been urging the administration to commit to seeking an outright victory in Afghanistan, but Miller says it\u2019s simply not doable. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any serious analyst of the situation in Afghanistan who believes that the war is winnable. It\u2019s possible to prevent the defeat of the Afghan government and prevent military victory by the Taliban, but this is not a war that\u2019s going to be won, certainly not in any time horizon that\u2019s relevant to political decision-making in Washington,\u201d Miller says. Miller watched and participated in McMaster\u2019s Afghan policy review up close for months and she believes that it has produced essentially a status-quo, stay-the-course proposal for a president unlikely to favor it. As Trump\u2019s remarks the other day made clear, \u201che has not been persuaded,\u201d Miller says.\u000a\u000aNow, AP\u2019s Richard Lardner writes, an \u201cincreasingly impatient\u201d McCain wants more troops deployed and \u201clong-term, open-ended\u201d engagement:\u000a\u000a\u201cNearly seven months into President Trump\u2019s administration, we\u2019ve had no strategy at all as conditions on the ground have steadily worsened,\u201d said McCain, a leading voice in Congress on national security matters. \u201cBut we must face facts: We are losing in Afghanistan and time is of the essence if we intend to turn the tide.\u201d McCain, R-Ariz., said he\u2019ll seek a vote on his \u201cstrategy for success\u201d in Afghanistan when the Senate returns in September and takes up the annual defense policy bill. His plan calls for sending in more U.S. combat forces, although he doesn\u2019t say how many. But McCain wants them to be less constrained in carrying out missions against the Taliban, al-Qaida, a growing Islamic State affiliate and other extremists. The plan, McCain said, is to \u201cdeny, disrupt, degrade, and destroy the ability of terrorist groups to conduct attacks against the United States, its allies, or its core interests.\u201d \u2026 The amendment he plans to propose adding to the defense policy bill calls for a \u201clong-term, open-ended\u201d U.S.-Afghanistan partnership that includes an \u201cenduring U.S. counterterrorism presence.\u201d He also recommends expanding U.S. training assistance to the Afghan security forces so they can capably fight the Taliban and other militant groups. McCain proposes longer-term support that will allow the Afghans to develop and expand their own intelligence, logistics, special forces and airlift operations.\u000a\u000aRead the rest of the story here.

aVA new analysis, published by FiveThirtyEight, shows the congressional map for the 2018 midterm elections has a record-setting pro-GOP bias, which could mean more winning for President Donald Trump and his Republican party.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Cook Political Report\u2019s David Wasserman, things are not looking good for Democrats:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aEven if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points \u2014 a pretty good midterm by historical standards \u2014 they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats.\u000a\u000aWasserman attributes this partially to Republican gerrymandering and Democratic voters\u2019 clustering in urban areas, which he says, \u201chas moved the median House seat well to the right of the nation.\u201d\u000a\u000aTiming and a \u201cterrible Senate map\u201d for Democrats are also to blame, he says. While Democrats must defend 25 of their 48 seats in 2018, Republicans have just eight of their 52 seats up for grabs.\u000a\u000aAnother problem for Democrats that Wasserman points out is Democrats hold far more Republican seats on, what he calls, \u201cborrowed time\u201d: Democrats hold six Senate seats from the 26 Republican-leaning states \u2014 all six of which are at risk next year.\u000a\u000aThis bad news for Democrats goes well beyond 2018, the report says. \u201c[T]here\u2019s a larger, long-term trend at work too \u2014 one that should alarm Democrats preoccupied with the future of Congress and the Supreme Court.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the last few decades, Democrats have expanded their advantages in California and New York \u2014 states with huge urban centers that combined to give Clinton a 6 million vote edge, more than twice her national margin. But those two states elect only 4 percent of the Senate. Meanwhile, Republicans have made huge advances in small rural states \u2014 think Arkansas, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia \u2014 that wield disproportionate power in the upper chamber compared to their populations.\u000a\u000aBy quantifying the partisan bias of Congress over time, \u201cby measuring the distance between each national presidential result and each year\u2019s presidential result in the median House and Senate seats\u201d, Wasserman shows that today the pro-GOP bias in both the House and Senate are at historic highs. According to the report, the last time the Senate had such a strong Republican bias was in 1913 \u2014 the year direct Senate elections were ratified.\u000a\u000aWhile their odds don\u2019t look good, there may still be hope for Democrats in 2018. They did, after all, win back control of both chambers in 2006, despite a GOP bias that year. However, it\u2019s definitely a long-shot, Wasserman says, citing the 2010 scenario in which Democrats were able to obtain 60 senate seats, enabling them to pass Obamacare.\u000a\u000aWhat did it take for the party to be able to obtain 60 seats? The Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina and a stock market crash, which generated a huge backlash against President George W. Bush and Republicans in 2008. Today, it would take even more cataclysmic events under GOP rule to propel Democrats to a supermajority over the next six years.\u000a\u000aWhile it is still early in the cycle, one Republican Senate seat at risk of being lost to the Democrats is Dean Heller\u2019s Nevada seat.\u000a\u000aElected in 2012 with just 46 percent of the vote, Heller is the only Republican senator up for re-election from a state Clinton won last year. He is being targeted from both the right and left and has even been confronted by President Trump over his unease with the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal effort.\u000a\u000aAmanda House is Breitbart News\u2019 Deputy Political Editor.

aVThe CEO of YouTube, Susan Wojcicki, responded in Fortune to the recent viewpoint diversity memo by James Damore. She claims that she has faced massive discrimination for being a woman working in the technology industry, and that implicit biases still exist within it.\u000a\u000aThe memo in question was released late last week after Damore had circulated among his colleagues at Google. It suggested reasons why there were fewer women working in technology-related fields, and argued for a wider diversity of viewpoints in the company. \u201cWe need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,\u201d Damore wrote. He was swiftly fired as a result, with the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai claiming that he had violated their code of conduct by advancing \u201charmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d despite the fact that numerous psychologists, male and female, deemed the manifesto to be scientifically accurate.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn her piece, Wojcicki, claimed that time and time again she was questioned about her \u201cabilities and commitment,\u201d was left out of \u201ckey industry events and social gatherings,\u201d and had comments \u201cfrequently interrupted and my ideas ignored until they were rephrased by men.\u201d The memo brought up memories of this discrimination against her:\u000a\u000aWhen I saw the memo that circulated last week, I once again felt that pain, and empathized with the pain it must have caused others. I thought about the women at Google who are now facing a very public discussion about their abilities, sparked by one of their own co-workers. I thought about the women throughout the tech field who are already dealing with the implicit biases that haunt our industry\u2026 now confronting them explicitly. I thought about how the gender gap persists in tech despite declining in other STEM fields, how hard we\u2019ve been working as an industry to reverse that trend, and how this was yet another discouraging signal to young women who aspire to study computer science [and] I thought about how tragic it was that this unfounded bias was now being exposed to a new generation.\u000a\u000aAccording to Wojcicki, the decision to fire Damore did not breach his right to freedom of speech, as Google was also free to \u201ctake action\u201d against any comments that \u201cperpetuate negative stereotypes\u201d about women. She went on to posit that nobody would be defending him if his comments were made against other groups:\u000a\u000aWhat if we replaced the word \u201cwomen\u201d in the memo with another group? What if the memo said that biological differences amongst Black, Hispanic, or LGBTQ employees explained their underrepresentation in tech and leadership roles? Would some people still be discussing the merit of the memo\u2019s arguments or would there be a universal call for swift action against its author?

aVMexico, Chile, and Peru are among 11 Latin American nations, plus Canada, that announced they will not recognize the new \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d created by socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.\u000a\u000aThe group of foreign ministers assembled in Peru said they would only recognize legal agreements approved by the real Venezuelan parliament, the National Assembly, in accordance with the Venezuelan constitution.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe Foreign Minister of Chile, Heraldo Muñóz, said he and his colleagues wanted to send a \u201cfirm statement\u201d that they \u201cwill not tolerate military coups,\u201d but also wished to maintain an \u201copening for dialogue\u201d with the Maduro government. He also expressed a desire to work with the Venezuelan government to deliver humanitarian aid to its starving population.\u000a\u000aPeruvian Foreign Minister Ricardo Luna said the Venezuelan Constituent Assembly is \u201cincompatible with international law, human rights and democracy in this region.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fading out of democratic institutions in recent times has reached its culmination and what we have in Venezuela is a dictatorship,\u201d Luna declared.\u000a\u000aMexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said the declaration \u201cvalidates our position in favor of democracy and democratically elected institutions in Venezuela.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis week, Videgaray called Maduro a \u201ccoward\u201d who \u201cuses the power of the State to dismantle democracy and lash out against his people.\u201d He was responding to a taunt from Maduro that Mexico\u2019s president was acting like an \u201cabused employee of Donald Trump\u201d for not offering more vigorous resistance to the American president\u2019s plan for a wall on the southern border of the United States.\u000a\u000aSome observers speculate that Mexico has taken an especially strong stance against Maduro because it has its own left-wing populist leader to deal with, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. López Obrador is seen as a significant candidate for Mexico\u2019s 2018 presidential race. The party currently in power has been ominously referring to him as \u201cMexico\u2019s Maduro,\u201d much as they compared him to Maduro\u2019s mentor Hugo Chávez when he ran for president in 2005.\u000a\u000aOther left-wing leaders in Latin American countries have sought to rally support by holding up Maduro as a hero and denouncing his critics as right-wing fascists. However, the more moderate left is worried that viral Maduroism is infecting parties in their countries and threatening to split militant factions away from decades-old political coalitions.\u000a\u000aArgentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Paraguay joined Mexico, Chile, and Peru in signing the pronouncement refusing to recognize the Constituent Assembly and calling upon Maduro to shut it down. Canada also signed on.\u000a\u000aThe Maduro regime has accused several of these nations of working with the United States to topple the Venezuelan government. As for its domestic opponents, the regime has taken to describing them as \u201cviolent fascists\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d who are waging war against the Venezuelan people.\u000a\u000aGrenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Santa Lucia, and Uruguay sent ministers to the conference but did not sign the denunciation of the Constituent Assembly. Some of these reluctant nations have experienced severe schisms in their left-wing parties over Venezuela. For example, Uruguay\u2019s President Tabaré Vázquez was attacked from the left for abandoning the \u201csister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\u201d by suspending it from Mercosur, the Common Market of the South.

The farmer made the comments after two asylum seekers from North Africa had stolen sheep from his property.\u000a\u000aThe two asylum seekers, aged 22 and 28, were investigated for the crime but the investigation was later dropped by the local prosecutor as they did not feel they had enough evidence to convict the men beyond a reasonable doubt.\u000a\u000aThe farmer himself, meanwhile, was convicted of hate speech and sentenced to a 1,350 euro fine. The farmer and his lawyer have appealed the fine and the process is still ongoing.\u000a\u000aHate speech laws in Germany have been the subject of intense discussion since the start of the migrant crisis, and many have criticised Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the Social Democrats (SPD) who hired former Stasi agent Anette Kahane to advise the government\u2019s censorship campaign.\u000a\u000aSince 2015, many Germans have been convicted of hate speech or incitement to racial hatred for comments often against asylum seekers. In one case, a couple in Vierkirchen were sentenced to a suspended prison sentence for the husband and a fine of over 1,000 euros for the wife for setting up an anti-asylum seeker Facebook group.\u000a\u000aOther Germans suspected of breaking the hate crime legislation have had their homes raided by police. In one operation alone, police raided the properties of 60 individuals last year.\u000a\u000aFederal Criminal Police president Holger Münch said after the raids: \u201cThe number of cases of right wing, politically motivated hate crimes on the Internet has increased significantly in the wake of the European refugee situation,\u201d adding that hate speech should not be allowed to \u201cpoison the social climate\u201d.\u000a\u000aIndividuals are not the only targets of the German hate speech laws as authorities passed new legislation in June that could see social networking sites fined up to 50 million euros for not removing hate speech content or \u201cfake news\u201d.

While most major religious groups say pig organs are acceptable in the case of lifesaving transplantation, one example that could be a problem for Jewish and Muslim patients is accepting a kidney transplant, because dialysis is a viable alternative.

They only realized he had been right all along when it was almost too late to save the country.\u000a\u000aIn her long and disastrous career, Rice has advocated inaction when intervention would have saved lives. During the Rwandan genocide, she counseled President Bill Clinton to avoid using that term, and helped stop the U.S. from responding.\u000a\u000aIn Benghazi, the Obama administration failed to make any effort to save U.S. diplomats and security personnel \u2014 and then Rice lied shamelessly to the American people, blaming a YouTube video for the attack.\u000a\u000aRice complains that Trump told North Korea that \u201cthey will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d if they threaten the U.S.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s warning is no different from what John F.

aVThe latest freedom of navigation patrol for the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea brought the destroyer USS John S. McCain to within 12 nautical miles of a Chinese artificial island off the Philippine coast on Thursday.\u000a\u000aUSNI News notes this is the third patrol under the schedule presented to President Trump by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and U.S. Pacific Command. Or at least it was theoretically the third patrol, since the Pentagon has been rather coy about confirming it happened, and the Chinese have forgone their customary complaints.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe muted response is interesting because, as USNI News points out, this was \u201cthe least ambiguous challenge to China\u2019s artificial island campaign\u201d yet, although a U.S. defense official plausibly argued that a similar operation in May was more aggressive, since it involved a guided-missile destroyer coming within six nautical miles of the Chinese base and hanging around for 90 minutes, long enough to conduct a man-overboard drill.\u000a\u000aAnonymous U.S. officials told Reuters the John S. McCain passed through a string of islets, reefs, and shoals in territory claimed by China before approaching Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands.\u000a\u000aCBS News reports \u201cnothing happened that the U.S. Navy considers unsafe or unprofessional.\u201d The Philippine government was notified in advance of the patrol, although Filipino forces were not directly involved. The Philippine military is thought to have monitored the freedom of navigation operation from a marine base located in a marooned ship on a nearby shoal, which sounds like one of the less appealing postings a Filipino marine could draw.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese government might be relatively quiescent about this latest patrol, but the Communist Party organ Global Times was moved to complain about it on Thursday. Chinese analysts are quoted portraying freedom of navigation operations as a bullying tactic designed to make China more cooperative on dealing with North Korea\u2014a silly strategy, the Global Times explained, because everyone knows China has already done a magnificent job with North Korea.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe US is the trouble maker in the South China Sea and has undermined regional stability,\u201d declared Zhang Junshe of the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute.\u000a\u000aThe South China Morning Post ran an editorial in late July denouncing U.S. freedom of navigation patrols as \u201cineffective\u201d because they don\u2019t seem to have influenced Beijing\u2019s behavior at all, and yet also \u201crisky\u201d because they might push Beijing too far. The problem with suspending them, as even this editorial acknowledges, is that many of America\u2019s regional allies see the operations as tangible reminders of the U.S. commitment to keeping the South China Sea open for business.

Why? Because he agrees with Trump! He\u2019d make it a grand total of three senators on Trump\u2019s side.\u201d\u000a\u000aCoulter added that if Brooks were elected, the total number of senators she could trust on immigration would increase, to three out of 100.\u000a\u000a\u201cI can count on one hand the number of politicians I trust on immigration and Mo Brooks is one of them.

The legislation, titled \u201cPupil attendance: school start time,\u201d provides that the \u201cpublic school day for middle schools and high schools shall begin no earlier than 8:30 a.m. no later than July 1, 2020.\u201d The most recent version of the bill does provide a two-year waiver for rural districts, but all state public schools would be calendared to start at 8:30 a.m. by 2022.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhen the primary and secondary education system started in the 1800s, California public school districts were free to set school calendars and hours. City schools tended to go year-round, and rural schools were open for the equivalent of five months, with winter and summer sessions that allowed farm children to help with planting and harvesting crops.\u000a\u000aUnion concerns about the ill effects of too much schooling on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 health led to eliminating summer terms and setting a standardized statewide 180-day school year in the 1950s. The California Legislature cut the public school year calendar to 175 days in 2008. The change was described by unions as an effort to reduce environmental damage by reducing transportation, heating and cooling, and food service costs.\u000a\u000aBut with California public schools\u2019 National Assessment of Educational Progress standardized test scores for 4th- and 8th-grade student math and reading scores plunging to the bottom fifth of U.S. states, the 180-day school year was reestablished in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe justification for later school days is based on studies by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute that the daily recommendation for sleep is 16 to 18 hours for newborn babies, 11 to 12 hours for preschool children, 10 hours for school-age children, and 9 to 10 hours for teenagers. But with an individual\u2019s biological clock shifting forward in adolescence, teenagers tend to become more alert and have difficulty falling asleep in the evening and waking early in the morning, according to the National Sleep Foundation.\u000a\u000aSB-328 cleared the Assembly Education Committee by a 5-to-2 vote and is moving toward an Assembly floor vote.

aVComedy superstar Kevin Hart is opening up about why he doesn\u2019t see the value of trashing President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe way that I see it, my job as a comedian is to spread positivity. To make people laugh,\u201d the highest-grossing comedian on the planet said in an interview with the Daily Beast. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to draw attention to what\u2019s already pissing us as a people off.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a sentiment the What Now star first explained earlier this month in an interview with Variety, in which he said avoiding politically-charged comedy keeps him from \u201calienating\u201d a portion of his audience.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you jump into that political realm you\u2019re alienating some of your audience,\u201d Hart said in May.\u000a\u000aNow, the comedy mogul says he\u2019d rather be \u201ca bright spot\u201d for people, instead of a political lightning rod.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to take your mind off of whatever may be going on in your life that could be wrong and give you a reason to say, you know what? It\u2019s going to be OK. That\u2019s being the positive, motivating, inspiring person that I am, that I always will be,\u201d Hart says.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody\u2019s not going to see things the way I want to see them. And they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d the Hartbeat Productions boss says. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes us individuals. In that particular realm, I keep my opinions to myself. And like I said, if I don\u2019t have anything nice to say, I shouldn\u2019t say it at all. I\u2019m not in the business of trashing people.\u201d\u000a\u000aHart is the king of stand-up comedy, recently dethroning comedic legend Jerry Seinfeld to become Forbes\u2019 highest-paid comedian with a 2016 haul of $87.5 million.\u000a\u000aHart\u2019s films, including 2016\u2019s Central Intelligence and the Ride Along franchise, have grossed nearly $1.5 billon domestically. The 37-year-old actor reportedly commands $10 million per film.\u000a\u000aThe A-lister\u2019s next venture is Laugh Out Loud, a new \u201c24/7 comedy\u201d streaming content service Hart has launched in partnership with Lionsgate Entertainment.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is not an individual, he is an organization. He is a force of nature,\u201d Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer says of Hart.\u000a\u000aWith a slew of successful theater-released stand-up specials under his belt and a bevy of blockbuster films slated for release \u2014 including a Jumanji remake debuting in December and a Great Outdoors remake in the works \u2014 Hart wants to give back, and wants Laugh Out Loud to be an \u201cartist-friendly\u201d destination for \u201cnew and hungry\u201d comedic talent.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want them to say, oh my god, the opportunities are large at Laugh Out Loud, because of what Kevin Hart is trying to do,\u201d Hart says. \u201cHe is a comedian\u2019s comedian.

aVSynchronized announcements by DeepMind and Blizzard move A.I. advancement from Go to the hit science fiction real-time strategy game Starcraft II.\u000a\u000aDeepMind\u2019s learning algorithms are moving from the ancient Chinese strategy board game to protecting Earth from alien races. In partnership with Blizzard, programmable A.I. agents are being implemented into the Starcraft II API.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhile a game like Go \u2014 despite its monolithic complexity \u2014 has only about ten simple actions that can be taken during the course of the game, Starcraft II starts with 300. Mastering Go is a question of understanding its more than a googol\u2019s worth of variations. Starcraft II, while on the surface a more simple game, has so many variances in information from moment to moment that it is a far greater challenge for any A.I. that hasn\u2019t been programmed specifically to play it within certain parameters.\u000a\u000aAdding to the complexity of the task is the \u201cfog of war\u201d that obscures an opponent\u2019s activity. This means that not only does the A.I. need to learn how to play the game itself, it needs to recognize general strategy, map variation, and predictive tactical reasoning. It cannot be overstated how much of a challenge it would be for anyone outside of Blizzard to program an A.I. specifically for this game, let alone an A.I. capable of teaching itself to play.\u000a\u000aAny hopeful researcher can customize a Starcraft II Deepmind A.I. agent for themselves, given the basic framework provided. The artificial intelligence can be educated using some of the thousands of in-game replays already made available by Blizzard, with hundreds of thousands more on the way.\u000a\u000aFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.

While sites exist elsewhere that provide live access to surveillance video, none do it on the scale of Chinese sites.\u201d\u000a\u000aChin also claimed that surveillance has even extended into schools and classrooms, where voyeuristic men can watch young students engaging in activities.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo [surveillance warning] notice was visible at the Shang Ya Dance School in northern Beijing last week as a white Qihoo camera live-streamed a dozen young girls in pastel leotards twirling around a cramped studio,\u201d Chin declared. \u201cParents and a staff member at the studio said they thought the feed was only visible in a private chat group for students\u2019 parents, but it was open to the public on the Shuidi site.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnonymous strangers allegedly commented throughout the dance class, making comments about the young girls, such as, \u201cThe first and second ones in the front row are the best dancers.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharles Farrier, the founder of British \u201cprivacy activist group\u201d No CCTV, claims public surveillance feeds \u201cnormalize\u201d the concept of spying on other people, \u201cthus making it more acceptable for the police or the state to spy on its citizens.\u201d\u000a\u000aHundreds of live surveillance feeds are currently available to watch on Chinese sites such as Shuidi.

aVThe apprehension of illegal aliens by Border Patrol agents along the southwest border with Mexico increased for the third straight month. Figures rose from 16,087 in June to 18,198 in July \u2013 a 13.12 percent gain.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aApprehensions of illegal aliens by agents working the border region began to fall following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in November. The number dropped even more dramatically beginning in January and continued falling until April when they reached a historic low of 11,125. Many believe these numbers took a dramatic drop in anticipation of Trump\u2019s promise to build the walls along our border and to rigorously enforce immigration laws inside the country. However, the past three months\u2019 reports show the threat of increased border security and enforcement may not be enough.\u000a\u000aDuring the peak months of the summer heat when the number of apprehensions historically decline, Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) and Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) collars rose dramatically, according to the Southwest Border Migration Report released this week by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.\u000a\u000aThe Border Patrol defines UACs as a person apprehended who is under the age of 18 and is traveling without a parent or guardian. The number of UACs hit a low point in April at 997, \u2014 down from 7,345 in November. The number of UACs apprehended has increased each month since April, reaching 2,495 in July. On average, the number of border apprehensions declines when comparing June to July over the past six years. In 2017, the number of UAC apprehensions increased 28 percent from June to July (1,952 in June, 2,495 in July).\u000a\u000aSimilarly, the apprehension of FMUAs (defined as one or more minors traveling with a single parent or guardian) increased dramatically from June to July this year. FMUA apprehensions rose from 2,322 in June to 3,397 in July \u2013 a 46 percent increase. FMUA apprehensions fell from a high in December of 16,139 to a low-point in April of 1,118 before turning around and starting back up.\u000a\u000aThe Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector in South Texas continues to be the focal point for human smugglers to deliver their cargo of minors and families. Of the 13,115 FMUAs apprehended along the entire southwest border with Mexico in July, 8,718 occurred in the RGV sector (66 percent). Agents arrested 4,082 UACs in the RGV Sector in July. This represents 61 percent of the 6,705 UAC apprehensions in July. Of the 46,182 total apprehensions of illegal aliens along the southwest border, 22,642 occurred in the RGV Sector (49 percent).\u000a\u000aThe 35,517 UACs apprehended so far this fiscal year came to the U.S. from Guatemala (12,274) followed by El Salvador (8,526), Mexico (7,234), and Honduras (6,887). Of the 66,808 FMUAs apprehended in July, 22,510 came from El Salvador followed by 23,067 from Guatemala, 20,226 from Honduras, and 3,481 from Mexico.\u000a\u000aCBP officials point out the total number of apprehensions and inadmissible persons apprehended this fiscal year along the southwest border declined by 22 percent when compared to FY 2016 numbers. The July apprehension and inadmissible numbers are down by 47 percent from one year ago when they were at historic highs.\u000a\u000aBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

aVA top school lunch reformer for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), who received praise from former first lady Michelle Obama, has been charged with 15 felony counts, including embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds.\u000a\u000aDavid Binkle, 55, a former chef who ultimately oversaw a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars as he implemented Michelle Obama\u2019s school lunch program in the LAUSD, pleaded not guilty to all the counts during an appearance in court on Tuesday and posted $220,000 bail, reports the L.A. Times.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aProsecutors allege that Binkle \u2013 who railed against childhood obesity with appearances on Tedx Talks \u2013 illegally directed about $65,000 of the school district\u2019s funds into his private consulting firm, some of which eventually ended up in his own pocket.\u000a\u000aThe news report continues:\u000a\u000aAccording to court documents, Binkle repeatedly misappropriated district funds in amounts ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 between 2010 and 2014. Prosecutors also allege that he forged an application to become a vendor with the district and failed to disclose outside financial interests.\u000a\u000aBinkle, who became known for his use of the phrase \u201cnasty, rotty\u201d food, led the former first lady\u2019s unpopular school lunch reform in the district even as students established their own black market of favorite \u2013 albeit \u201cunhealthy\u201d \u2013 foods.\u000a\u000aIn his efforts to implement the school lunch reform, Binkle offered lengthy contracts to providers such as Tyson Foods Inc., Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales, Goldstar Foods, and Five Star Gourmet Foods. Some of the vendors also agreed to annual donations of $500,000 to a healthy eating marketing program in the school district.\u000a\u000aProblems with Binkle\u2019s management, however, were noted as early as 2011 by George Beck, a former food-services deputy branch budget director, who reportedly brought his concerns to the district but was ignored and then laid off.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, in 2014, the LAUSD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) accused Binkle of failing to disclose his ownership of California Culinary Consulting or payments from vendors who appeared at school nutrition events.\u000a\u000aThe OIG audit noted his firm presented \u201cat minimum an appearance of a conflict of interest,\u201d and his marketing program was \u201cbeing mismanaged and at worst being consistently abused\u201d by Binkle, who said he was \u201cfrustrated and baffled\u201d by the allegations.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, since my actions were approved and encouraged from senior district officials, general counsel or the ethics office,\u201d Binkle emailed the Times. \u201cI am confident the truth and facts will show the allegations are unsubstantiated.\u201d\u000a\u000aBeck, however, reportedly said Binkle\u2019s activity was a symptom of larger problems within LAUSD:\u000a\u000aHe negotiated these contracts with these firms with no oversight, nobody else participating. It was a huge procurement bureaucracy. There was one contract for vegetarian entrees, and I remember sitting in a meeting with 35 people. Binkle was there. He had one entrée that was $2.25 per item, and our reimbursement was less than the cost of the meal. Every meal that we sold, we were losing money.\u000a\u000aBeck added he was surprised it took so long for prosecutors to uncover the problems with Binkle.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll these internal control entities that were supposed to be exercising internal control were not doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought it to their attention, and they did nothing about it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile recognizing that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, the charges against Mr. Binkle are extremely upsetting as they do not reflect the professionalism, ethics and character we expect of all L.A. Unified employees,\u201d the school district said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIn October of 2014, Breitbart News also reported a major scandal in the LAUSD in which former superintendent John Deasy \u2013 a former employee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 resigned after pushing a $1.3 billion iPad buy for every child in the district from joint sellers Apple and Pearson, the latter of which had designed a companion iPad curriculum. The program was a huge failure and led to further scrutiny of Deasy\u2019s close personal ties with Apple and Pearson.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, Deasy ultimately joined a training academy funded by one of his supporters, philanthropist Eli Broad. He became a consultant and the superintendent-in-residence for the Broad Academy, which trains urban public education leaders.

aVLiberals all across the country are beginning to rally to force the National Football League to sign activist Colin Kaepernick to a new NFL contract. Though, at least one sports writer, has called that campaign a \u201cshakedown,\u201d and compares Kaepernick to fraudsters Al Sharpton and Tawana Brawley.\u000a\u000aAfter spending the whole of the 2016 season protesting the national anthem, Colin Kaepernick walked away from the 49ers and became a free agent. Yet, since announcing his availability to the league, not a single NFL team has signed him to a contract.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLiberal activists decided to focus on race, as the primary cause for Kaepernick\u2019s continuing unemployment. To that end, many Kaepernick supporters have tried to start a movement with the goal of forcing the NFL to hire the player.\u000a\u000aFilmmaker Spike Lee, for instance, announced support of a rally to be held in front of NFL headquarters in New York City to force the league to give Kap a new job.\u000a\u000aDespite that Lee doesn\u2019t seem to be aware that his favored quarterback\u2019s name is spelled with two e\u2019s and not just one, Lee pushed out a Tweet announcing a rally date of August 23:\u000a\u000apic.twitter.com/AejLPaaWHD \u2014 Spike Lee (@SpikeLee) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aHowever, at least for one sportswriter, the whole campaign looks like an Al Sharpton-styled shakedown.\u000a\u000aIn an appearance on Fox News, Fox Sports 1 host Jason Whitlock called the campaign an \u201cinvasion of progressive ideology and the progressive movement into the National Football League and sports.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe continued to disparage the effort saying, \u201cThis, to me, is starting to smell like a shakedown of the NFL and the NFL ownership. Colin Kaepernick, the false narrative, that he\u2019s out of the league because all the owners are racist and he\u2019s being blackballed. Listen, this is simply a case of a guy who\u2019s not good enough \u2014 his talents aren\u2019t good enough to justify all the attention and noise and controversy that comes along with him.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis has a ring of truth to it, if Kaepernick were the standout quarterback that his supporters think he is, he\u2019d be working right now whether he hates the U.S. or not. While Kaepernick isn\u2019t the worst quarterback in the NFL, his skills just aren\u2019t good enough to allow his profile to rise above the trouble he\u2019d bring to whatever team unfortunate enough to hire him.\u000a\u000aTo drive the Sharpton shakedown point home, Whitlock concluded by saying, \u201cThis is like the Tawana Brawley of football, this false narrative that we have going here.\u201d\u000a\u000aYou may recall that in 1987, the 15-year-old African American Brawley claimed six white men raped her. It was later discovered that she lied about the incident. Though, not before a then-rotund Al Sharpton used Brawley\u2019s case to burnish his community activist credentials, by stirring up near riotous protests. It was all a hoax, but Sharpton cashed in on the incident and used it to help bolster his national prominence.\u000a\u000aFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com

What I\u2019m concerned about is if a US Senator, [Lindsey Graham (R-SC)] says initiate an attack, and causing alarm and remembering that there are in the Mariana Islands, this is American, sovereign soil. \u2026 So it\u2019s important that, as we make decisions, that those folks that are in a position of leadership that they understand, too, that war is the last option. Because not only will tens of thousands of American military forces and dependents be affected by a regional war, but because the western Pacific has American soil in it, that a couple hundred thousand Americans could get caught in the crosshairs. So, I think it\u2019s important to be very strong, at the same time, be calm. I\u2019ve had enough briefings with the military, that there is a multi-layered defense, starting from Korea and Japan as well as in the western Pacific, as well as our terrestrial assets here in Guam with the THAAD missile defense system that American communities\u2026will be protected.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

aVThe efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to officially label the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) a foreign terrorist organization has earned the support of various Arab allies of the United States, Fox News has learned.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would be a positive step forward indeed,\u201d declared Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta, the Egyptian Ambassador to the United Nations, in response to a question from Fox News last week.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe West is suffering from \u201claziness and must do its homework,\u201d Salman Al-Ansari, president of the Saudi American Public Affairs Committee, also told the news network, adding:\u000a\u000aThe U.S. needs to confront the evils of the Brotherhood as soon as possible. If you have Saudi Arabia saying the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist group, if you have Egypt and the United Arab Emirates [UAE] saying it\u2019s a terrorist group, then what should stop the U.S. from designating the MB as a terrorist group as long there are hundreds of pieces of evidence that prove this fact?\u000a\u000aU.S. Muslim-majority allies Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt have all banned MB as a terrorist organization.\u000a\u000aSoon after taking office in January of this year, a debate erupted within the Trump administration over adding the Muslim Brotherhood to the State Department and Treasury lists of foreign terrorist organizations (FTO).\u000a\u000aFox News learned that the debate to label MB a terrorist group continues inside the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fight is far from over,\u201d a senior administration official told the news network, noting, \u201cThe commitment inside the West Wing to the question of designating the Brotherhood has not waned.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration is acutely aware of MB\u2019s jihadist roots, according to the official.\u000a\u000aHe told Fox News, \u201cThe White House completely understands how the modern global jihadi threat, which the president has rightly described as radical Islamic terrorism, can be driven back at its roots to the Brotherhood.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver the tenure of the previous administration, Republicans in Congress offered legislation to label the Brotherhood a terror organization to no avail.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis president is unprepared to follow the disastrous policies of prior administrations, especially the Obama White House\u2019s empowering of the Brotherhood that led to the catastrophic consequences of the so-called Arab Spring and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people from the Sinai [in Egypt] to Sinjar [in Iraq],\u201d the Trump administration official told Fox News.\u000a\u000aBack in January, Reuters reported that some officials within the administration were hesitant at the time to back the designation.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump advisors, as well as many veteran national security, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence officials argue the Brotherhood has evolved peacefully in some countries,\u201d noted Reuters.\u000a\u000aThe embattled nation of Qatar has reportedly provided sanctuary to MB for years.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has come out in support of Saudi Arabia for condemning Qatar\u2019s relationship with Iran and terrorist groups like MB.\u000a\u000aDespite the strained links between the United States and Qatar, America\u2019s NATO ally Turkey has maintained its relationship with Doha.\u000a\u000aLike Qatar, Turkey is a known MB supporter.\u000a\u000aIn February, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came out in defense of MB, rebuking U.S. efforts to list the group as a terrorist organization.\u000a\u000aChristopher Holton of the Center for Security Policy told Fox News that it is essential to designate the Brotherhood a terrorist organization in the United States.\u000a\u000aThe Center for Security Policy has been a staunch supporter of labeling MB a terror group.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs the Egyptian ambassador well knows, the goals of the Muslim Brotherhood are identical to those of all the jihadist organizations, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Hamas: the establishment of an Islamic state ruled by Sharia,\u201d Holton told Fox News.\u000a\u000aHe blamed the \u201cthe Swamp in the State Department\u201d and Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster for preventing MB\u2019s terror designation so far.

aVSynchronized announcements by DeepMind and Blizzard move A.I. advancement from Go to the hit science fiction real-time strategy game Starcraft II.\u000a\u000aDeepMind\u2019s learning algorithms are moving from the ancient Chinese strategy board game to protecting Earth from alien races. In partnership with Blizzard, programmable A.I. agents are being implemented into the Starcraft II API.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aWhile a game like Go \u2014 despite its monolithic complexity \u2014 has only about ten simple actions that can be taken during the course of the game, Starcraft II starts with 300. Mastering Go is a question of understanding its more than a googol\u2019s worth of variations. Starcraft II, while on the surface a more simple game, has so many variances in information from moment to moment that it is a far greater challenge for any A.I. that hasn\u2019t been programmed specifically to play it within certain parameters.\u000a\u000aAdding to the complexity of the task is the \u201cfog of war\u201d that obscures an opponent\u2019s activity. This means that not only does the A.I. need to learn how to play the game itself, it needs to recognize general strategy, map variation, and predictive tactical reasoning. It cannot be overstated how much of a challenge it would be for anyone outside of Blizzard to program an A.I. specifically for this game, let alone an A.I. capable of teaching itself to play.\u000a\u000aAny hopeful researcher can customize a Starcraft II Deepmind A.I. agent for themselves, given the basic framework provided. The artificial intelligence can be educated using some of the thousands of in-game replays already made available by Blizzard, with hundreds of thousands more on the way.\u000a\u000aFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.

aVThe Department of Interior, under Secretary Ryan Zinke, has announced the current federal mineral valuation rule is being repealed \u201cto create more workable oil, gas and mineral valuation regulations and avoid costly litigation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Consolidated Federal Oil and Gas and Federal and Indian Coal Valuation Reform Rule (Valuation Rule) has \u201ccreated confusion and uncertainty regarding how companies report and pay royalties on energy and other mineral resources from federal onshore and offshore areas and American Indian lands,\u201d the DOI announcement said.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThe repeal of the rule, posted in the Federal Register on Sunday and effective as of September 6, \u201cwill provide certainty and clarity to the regulated community by continuing to require compliance with lawful and well-known oil, gas, and coal regulations in force for more than a decade.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis move will benefit both the energy industry and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), which oversees payments from the industry.\u000a\u000a\u201cRepealing the Valuation Rule provides a clean slate to create workable valuation regulations,\u201d Zinke said. \u201cWe are committed to working closely with stakeholders and the newly chartered Royalty Policy Committee to explore options for future rulemakings and to avoid the structural defects that were found in the prior rule.Department of Interior Kills Regulation to Help Oil, Gas, and Indian Coal Resources\u000a\u000aZinke said the move does not change the agency commitment to \u201ccollecting every dollar due.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are taxpayer and American Indian assets, and the public and American Indians deserve an accurate accounting and valuation,\u201d Zinke said, adding that the move also increases national security.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe United States is a safer and more sustainable nation when we rely on our own natural resource development,\u201d Zinke said. \u201cRepealing the Valuation Rule restores our economic freedom by ensuring our energy independence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Valuation Rule is not only costly but could impair the \u201cproduction on federal lands, both onshore and offshore, making us rely more and more on foreign imports of oil and gas.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI support Interior\u2019s decision to repeal this rule and provide greater certainty to companies seeking to produce our valuable domestic resources, from Alaska to the Atlantic,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said in the press release announcing the decision.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the federal government will continue to collect its fair share of revenues from responsible development, the repeal of this rule will help prevent negative impacts to exploration and production that would put our energy dominance at stake,\u201d Murkowski said.\u000a\u000aRep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, also praised the action.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis rescindment is another important step by the Trump administration to position Interior as a facilitator of responsible energy development,\u201d Bishop said.\u000a\u000aRep. David McKinley (R-WV), chairman of the Congressional Coal Caucus, said the Obama administration had used the royalties rule as a barrier to energy production on federal lands.\u000a\u000a\u201cReturning to the more reasonable previous standards paves the way for further investment and development of energy resources,\u201d McKinley said.\u000a\u000aRep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, agrees.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis Obama-era rule was another misguided attack on affordable energy that would have caused significant harm to tribal, rural and Western economies,\u201d Gosar said. \u201cThis burdensome new regulation would have bankrupt small businesses, discouraged responsible energy production and hit the pocketbooks of hard-working American families.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Department intends to further evaluate changes that may be warranted to the long-established oil, gas and coal regulations through the Royalty Policy Committee and publicly-vetted rulemaking, ensuring that valuation and revenue collection for the nation\u2019s mineral and hydrocarbon resources remain transparent and consistent, while the taxpayers receive every dollar due from resources on their public lands and offshore areas,\u201d the DOI press release said.

aVThe Associated Press reported Wednesday that the Canadian government is sending \u201cabout 100\u201d soldiers to assist police and border guards at the remote road on the Quebec-New York border that has become the nexus of an outpouring of illegal aliens living in America.\u000a\u000aThe back road crossing, with no official border post, near Champlain, New York, and Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, has seen thousands of people, mostly Haitians residing in the United States, come by taxi and other conveyences to try to illegally enter Canada. Typically, the outflow is reported as resulting from \u201cfear\u201d of the climate created for illegals in the United States.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHaitians in particular may be agitated because the \u201ctemporary protective status\u201d (TPS) many of them were granted in the aftermath of that country\u2019s devastating 2011 earthquake may be coming to an end. The status, granted by the Department of Homeland Security to specific groups of people suffering from war or natural disaster, has been extended time and again over the last seven years from its original six-month grant. TPS was never meant to grant the Haitians covered by it permanent residence in the United States, and they were expected to return to Haiti when the disaster had passed.\u000a\u000aIn May, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly announced TPS for Haitians would be extended one more time, until January 2018, with a strong indication that this will be the final extension. The Haitians now illegally entering Canada hope to avoid going back to their home country after the end of their special protection. Others, including Africans in America on tourist visas, are trying to find permanent homes in Canada under the same asylum seeker system loophole. If they crossed at an official border post, their claim would be adjudicated immediately, but since they cross at this back road, they can stay in Canada while their applications pend.\u000a\u000aMore than 5,000 people have taken advantage so far. Canadian officials told the AP they estimated 400 illegals crossed the border at the Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle this Sunday alone. The flood is beginning to overwhelm the resources devoted to the problem so far, with Montreal\u2019s iconic Olympic Stadium already being transformed into a refugee center to handle the influx.\u000a\u000aThe soldiers from the Canadian Forces have deployed to assist the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency. According to the AP report, the soldiers are there to set up a more permanent border crossing, including a tent camp for up to 500 migrants who are being arrested as soon as they set foot on Canadian soil. The migrants hope is to gain legal status through the relatively forgiving Canadian asylum laws.\u000a\u000aLiberal Party Member of Parliment Brenda Shanahan, who represents the district in which the crossing lies, tried to tamp down the migrants\u2019 expectations when she spoke to reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not a free ticket for refugee status\u201d she said. \u201cWe would actually like to make that very clear, that regardless of what people are reading on social media and so on, crossing the border here does not guarantee an automatic entry.\u201d

aVA Maryland county could lose an estimated 47,000 jobs by 2022 if it chooses to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to a new study released Tuesday evening.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reports that the study, which Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D) commissioned, found that the majority of positions that would be eliminated were low-wage jobs.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aLeggett decided to move forward with the study after he vetoed a minimum wage increase in January. In explaining his decision to veto the minimum wage increase, he said the wage hike would devastate the economy in Montgomery County.\u000a\u000aPFM, the Philadelphia-based consulting group that carried out the study, found that a minimum wage hike to $15 would lead to a $396.5 million loss of income in Montgomery County by 2022. The loss of income would come from businesses deciding to lay off employees, cut hours and benefits for those that remain, and nix plans to hire new workers and open new locations.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can\u2019t minimize some of the impacts outlined here,\u201d said Leggett, responding to the study\u2019s results. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not 47,000 jobs lost, even if it\u2019s half that, those are some startling numbers. You can\u2019t discount ­it all.\u201d\u000a\u000aCounty council member Marc Elrich, however, remains unconvinced of the study\u2019s findings. Elrich proposed a bill that would raise the minimum wage in Montgomery County to $15 by 2022 a week before the study was due.\u000a\u000aHe called the PFM study \u201cnonsense,\u201d saying it was impossible to predict how a wage increase would impact the future. Elrich also claimed that the study was biased because employers would be more likely to respond negatively.\u000a\u000aPFM\u2019s study was conducted from April to June using electronic surveys, phone, and in-person interviews with business and nonprofit owners and community leaders.\u000a\u000aSeveral studies on minimum wage hikes conclude that they are bad for business \u2014 both for employers and employees.\u000a\u000aA Harvard Business School study from April found that minimum wage laws increase the chance that non-elite restaurants will go out of business.\u000a\u000aA June study from the University of Washington found that Seattle\u2019s minimum wage hike is cutting employees\u2019 salaries by $125 a month.

If he had been there 5 years, he would be receiving the full salary \u2014 for doing nothing.\u000a\u000aThe Chronicle notes the outrage of Assemblyman Phil Ting, (D-San Francisco), whose call for an audit of UC\u2019s finances last year rocked the liberal establishment, uncovering a $175 million slush fund that UC President Napalitano kept hidden.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe keep asking for more access for California students. UC tells us we have to find state funding for it, but they seem to have all the funding they need when comes to executive compensation and executive parachutes,\u201d Ting told the Chronicle.\u000a\u000aDirks\u2019s tenure as chancellor was rocked by numerous scandals, including a $150 million budget deficit, a series of sexual harassment scandals within the university, and a number of riots on campus.\u000a\u000aBut it was Dirks\u2019s persistent mishandling of sexual harassment claims against an assistant chancellor and numerous professors that proved his undoing, irking the embattled Napolitano.\u000a\u000aIn spite of overwhelming evidence against a number of faculty members, Berkeleyside reports that Dirks allowed many to continue on in their positions for months without any disciplinary action.
