aVOn Thursday, March 31, CNN.com Tech writer Mark Milian wrote a story about Google's plans to introduce facial recognition technology into an application. After the story was published, Google issued a statement suggesting the story was a fabrication. Here is CNN's statement in response to Google's accusation:\u000a\u000a\u201cGoogle\u2019s claims do not fit the facts of the situation. This interview was prearranged \u2013 on the record \u2013 and staffed by a Google PR rep, who raised no objections at the time and did not deny what the engineer said.

aVMichelle Obama is the first lady of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Watch CNN Films' "We Will Rise: Michelle Obama's Mission to Educate Girls Around the World" on CNNgo.\u000a\u000aNeither of my parents and hardly anyone in the neighborhood where I grew up went to college. But thanks to a lot of hard work and plenty of financial aid, I had the opportunity to attend some of the finest universities in this country. That education opened so many doors and gave me the confidence to pursue my ambitions and have a voice in the world.\u000a\u000aFor me, education was power.\u000a\u000aAnd a few years ago, when I had the honor of meeting Malala Yousafzai , who was shot in the head just for trying to go to school, this issue got really personal for me. I saw that the terrorists who nearly killed her were trying to silence her voice, snuff out her ambitions, and take away her power.\u000a\u000aThat's why I decided to work on global girls' education as first lady: because right now, there are tens of millions of girls like Malala in every corner of the globe who are not in school -- girls who are so bright, hardworking and hungry to learn. And that's really the mission of the Let Girls Learn initiative we launched last year: It's a global effort to give these girls the education they need to fulfill their potential and lift up their families, communities and countries.\u000a\u000aNow, as first lady, I have no budget of my own for programs, and I have no authority to make or pass laws. That's why, when we first launched Let Girls Learn, many folks doubted that we could make a real impact on this global issue.\u000a\u000aBut over the past year and a half, we've established partnerships with some of the world's largest companies and organizations that are committing money, resources and expertise. We're collaborating with countries like Canada, Mexico and the Nordic countries on girls' education efforts. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have collectively pledged nearly $600 million.\u000a\u000aThe United States is investing over a billion dollars through new and ongoing efforts and running Let Girls Learn programs in more than 50 countries. The World Bank Group will be investing $2.5 billion over the next five years. And through social media campaigns, Let Girls Learn has rallied people across America and across the globe to step up and be champions for girls worldwide.\u000a\u000aAll this is happening because time and again, whether it's a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a 15-year-old girl here in the United States, when people hear the stories of girls who aren't in school, they want to help.\u000a\u000aThat's why CNN's new film on global girls' education, "We Will Rise," airing for the first time this week, is so critically important -- because it tells these girls' stories.\u000a\u000aThis powerful film chronicles the lives of some of the girls I visited this past summer in Liberia and Morocco, two countries in Africa where many girls struggle to get an education. I was joined in my travels by the actors and activists Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto , who are also passionate about girls' education, as well as CNN anchor Isha Sesay\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Why young girls in Morocco are missing school Replay More Videos ...

Like so many girls around the world, many of these girls come from families struggling with poverty. Some endure dangerous commutes to and from school each day. Others face cultural pressures to drop out, marry young and start having children of their own.\u000a\u000aBut these girls have big plans for their lives. They want to attend college and become doctors, teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs; and day after day, they do whatever it takes to get the education they need to fulfill their dreams. They get up before dawn, and spend hours harvesting crops, cooking for their families and tending to their younger siblings before heading to class. After school, they work as maids and in factories, and they study for hours late into the night.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED She studies and dares to dream Replay More Videos ...

aVStory highlights Thousands in Kentucky wonder how their insurance will change, if they can keep it\u000a\u000aMore than 1.3 million Kentuckians are on Medicaid, a third thanks to its expansion\u000a\u000a(CNN) As Congress debates the future of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians are waiting to find out how their health insurance could change -- or whether they can keep it at all.\u000a\u000a"When I got pregnant, I didn't have insurance," said Alondra Toribio, 24, who has a 3-year-old son. "I was looking at a $600 visit for whenever I was pregnant."\u000a\u000aFor the single mother, now making just over $1,000 a month while working for a Head Start program, the expense of raising a child is overwhelming. Toribio, of Owensboro, said her current employer offers insurance, but the employee contribution would eat up more than half her take-home pay.\u000a\u000a"If I were to get that insurance," she said, "I would only come home with like $100 a week."\u000a\u000aBoth she and her son have health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid benefits to millions of Americans who couldn't previously qualify.\u000a\u000aRead More

That shouldn't put anyone off.\u000a\u000aThis elegant venue is a favorite VIP haunt during the F1 weekend, when celebs and the glitterati crowd in to feast on lobster stir-fried with truffle sauce.\u000a\u000aDo\u000a\u000aYasalam, Abu Dhabi's free entertainment festival, provides heaps of art, music and F1-friendly events from November 24 to 27.\u000a\u000aThe F1 FanZone has race simulations, food and games.

aVAs a youth leader for the Buffalo, New York-based teen pregnancy prevention program HOPE Buffalo , Ely talks to not only other teens but also adults. She explains how they can help teens when it comes to their emotional, physical and sexual health, abstinence and birth control.\u000a\u000a"It's definitely made me more comfortable around health providers, because I was very nervous and not willing to talk about it, but then once I joined HOPE Buffalo, it's an easy subject to talk about. Well, not that easy, but it's easy enough to talk about that I don't feel so uncomfortable," said Ely, who will be entering her junior year in high school this month.\u000a\u000aBryanna Ely, third from the right, with other HOPE Buffalo youth leaders who help organize educational and community programs for teens in their community with a focus on emotional, physical, and sexual health.\u000a\u000aWhile volunteering with HOPE Buffalo at a local community center, Ely said, she remembered meeting another teenage girl, sharing sexual health information with her and feeling like she made a difference.\u000a\u000a"She took in all the information, and she said she would not get pregnant until she was 28 or 30," Ely said. "I joined HOPE Buffalo because I wanted to make a change in my community and make sure that these teenagers who didn't have a voice had a voice."\u000a\u000aYet federal funding for such teen pregnancy prevention programs in the United States is now on the chopping block.\u000a\u000aInstead, the US Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that it's continuing to review best approaches, which it says "will be guided by science and a firm commitment to giving all youth the information and skills they need to improve their prospects for optimal health outcomes."\u000a\u000aAmong the leadership within the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Tom Price and Valerie Huber, chief of staff to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, have been proponents of abstinence-only education programs.\u000a\u000a'Took me completely by surprise'\u000a\u000aAround the Fourth of July, Stan Martin, project director of HOPE Buffalo, received a notice from Health and Human Services' Office of Adolescent Health that indicated funding would end next June, after just three years, instead of continuing to fund the program for the expected five years.\u000a\u000aOther grant recipients of the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program across the country received the same notice.\u000a\u000aThe Office of Adolescent Health's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program currently funds 84 grants to reduce teen pregnancy across clinics, schools and communities, by implementing and evaluating prevention programs and supporting technology- and program-based approaches, according to the office's website. Their end date is now June 30.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, funding for "capacity-building" assistance providers that help organizations develop and deliver programs was eliminated effective immediately, said Lauren Ranalli, director of the Adolescent Health Initiative at the University of Michigan, which provides assistance to HOPE Buffalo and other teen pregnancy prevention programs across the country.\u000a\u000a"This news took me completely by surprise," Ranalli said.\u000a\u000a"My immediate thought was really about all of the incredible work that was in progress with grantees in South Carolina and Oklahoma and Baltimore and Buffalo and Los Angeles and so many other locations," she said.\u000a\u000aMartin said HOPE Buffalo will be turning to local partners for help. The organization already partners with community centers, public schools and faith-based groups.\u000a\u000a"The community itself, they're demanding that adolescents have access to these resources, to this information, regardless of funding," Martin said.\u000a\u000aMoving forward, "our youth leadership team, they're heavily involved in every decision that we make. They'll be educating the community in terms of what this program means to them," he said. "I think it's our duty as caring adults that we provide a sense of purpose or hope for adolescents."\u000a\u000aEly hopes HOPE Buffalo continues, she said. "It has changed my life completely."\u000a\u000aOfficials spar over teen pregnancy\u000a\u000aHealth and Human Services said in an emailed statement to CNN that an evaluation of previous first-round teen pregnancy prevention programs , which were active from 2010 to 2014, revealed that those programs were not as effective as thought.\u000a\u000a"The very weak evidence of positive impact of these programs stands in stark contrast to the promised results, jeopardizing the youth who were served, while also proving to be a poor use of more than $800 million in taxpayer dollars," the statement said.\u000a\u000a"The poor evaluation results were the reason that the Trump Administration, in its FY 2018 budget proposal, did not recommend continued funding for the TPP program and HHS hit the pause button on it," the statement said. "This action gives the Department time to continue its review of the program and the evidence, to ensure that should Congress continue it, the program provides positive reinforcement of the healthy decisions being made by a growing majority of teens."\u000a\u000aMany researchers, program directors and city health officials argue against hitting "the pause button."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Dr. Sanjay Gupta interviews Secretary Tom Price Replay More Videos ...

When analyzing the results from the first round of evaluations from a scientific perspective, those previous results were actually impressive, Albert said, "and(the Office of Adolescent Health) learned from the evaluation results and is using that knowledge to strengthen the current projects."\u000a\u000a"Once the first round of evaluation results were published, the Office of Adolescent Health transparently shared results and strongly encouraged grantees to shift to the most effective models . Grantees have done that, which means that the models that current grantees are implementing are very different and stronger than the mix of models used in the first round," Albert said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED '16 and Pregnant' = fewer pregnancies?

Our rates, for example, are twice as high as in England, about seven times as high as in Japan," Albert said.\u000a\u000a"With all the progress that has been made, there remains great and profound disparities in teen pregnancy and childbearing in this country, by race and ethnicity and by geography," he added.\u000a\u000aFor instance, parts of Texas, including Dallas, have higher teen birth rates than the rest of the country, according to an epidemiologic study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology in June\u000a\u000aThe study found that a cluster of teenage births in and around Fort Worth, Texas, between 2006 and 2012 represented a teen birth rate 58% higher than the rest of the contiguous country, even after adjusting for poverty differences.\u000a\u000aStatewide, Texas was found to have the highest prevalence of repeat teen births in the country in a CDC report from 2013\u000a\u000a"That alone demonstrates that funding is needed," said Zachary Thompson, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, who signed the Big Cities Health Coalition letter.\u000a\u000aRegarding the cuts in funding, he said, "I think it was short-sighted and really another attack on women as it relates to focusing on women's health."\u000a\u000aaccess to comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention programs and education due to the funding cuts, said Dr. Leana Wen, the city's health commissioner, who signed the Big Cities letter. As for other cities, Baltimore is expected to see about 20,000 students loseaccess to comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention programs and education due to the funding cuts, said Dr. Leana Wen, the city's health commissioner, who signed the Big Cities letter.\u000a\u000aWhen Wen learned about the cuts, she initially thought it was a mistake, she said, and now she disputes the conclusions that were put forth in the Department of Human and Health Services' statement.\u000a\u000a"This grant allowed us to have comprehensive reproductive health education in middle schools and high schools throughout our city. ... In terms of evaluation, we're only a few months into the implementation. So we don't know. We don't have the data yet about the full potential of what we can achieve," Wen said.\u000a\u000a"We see it as being irresponsible to cut this program now, especially because the justification from the older model is wrong, and so we highly contest this statement" from the Department of Health and Human Services, she said.\u000a\u000aPatty Hayes, director of public health for Seattle and King County, said she has seen the teen prevention programs have a positive impact in her community.\u000a\u000a"We have been so successful in King County with our teen pregnancy rates reducing by 55% " since 2008, said Hayes, who also signed the Big Cities Health Coalition letter.\u000a\u000a"If something works, you invest in it," she said. "We need for our community to respect science, to move forward with this and to make sure that we are not moving backwards. ... I'm very wound up about this."\u000a\u000aAs for the Department of Human and Health Services' statement, Hayes said she was shocked by the way the department characterized the program.\u000a\u000a"Their comments show they are not even aware of the focus of grantees who are doing research like ours. The point of evaluation is to learn what works, in what contexts and with which populations," Hayes said.\u000a\u000a"Clearly, evidence-based programs play an important role in reducing teen pregnancy," she said, adding that since the first round of the Teen Pregnancy Prevention grants were awarded in 2010, the teen birth rate has continued to fall\u000a\u000aLooming layoffs\u000a\u000aThe nation's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program was established in 2010 with a congressional mandate to fund not only youth-focused programs but also independent evaluation studies that contribute to the field's understanding of where, when and with whom programs are most effective.\u000a\u000aDr. Christine Dehlendorf, a family physician and associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, has been developing such research and evaluating a teen pregnancy prevention program called Speak Out\u000a\u000aThe program includes educating teens about intrauterine devices and other forms of long-acting reversible contraception. A survey published by the Urban Institute last year found that many adult women don't even know that much about IUDs.\u000a\u000aNow, Dehlendorf has to break the news to the teens involved in her research that Speak Out may no longer continue due to funding cuts.\u000a\u000a"I really feel like not being able to evaluate and disseminate this intervention is an insult to those young people who have put in their time and their expertise in helping us figure out how to accomplish our goals," Dehlendorf said, adding that she also will not be able to obtain scientifically valid results from the research.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Kids raising kids: How can we help?

"Science requires taking risks, doing formal evaluations and then applying the results. That is exactly what the TPP Program was designed to do, and it has had success in improving our understanding of how to improve teen's reproductive health."\u000a\u000aSarah Verbiest, executive director of the Center for Maternal & Infant Health in the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, pointed out that cutting funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs also could bring along layoffs.\u000a\u000a"When you think about it, that's a lot of people that are trained, that know these communities, that work in these communities and also who are now going to be needing to find work themselves," Verbiest said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWhile Verbiest has no personal connection to the funding cuts, she said that, as the mother of 17-year-old and 20-year-old children, she finds it difficult to see such teen pregnancy prevention programs disappear.\u000a\u000a"We talk about how parents should be having these conversations. As a parent of a 17-year-old, I can say that yes, it's really important I share my values with my children, and we definitely do, but it's not easy talking about specifics with them," Verbiest said, adding that this is where programs can play a role.\u000a\u000a"It's important for us all to think comprehensively about this," she said.

aV(CNN) It was a friendship first formed at the age of five over a nickname.\u000a\u000aEver since then, NJ and VJ have been inseparable, to the extent that friends, family and even the pair themselves call them brothers.\u000a\u000aVJ, so called by his mother when the initials popped into her head one day because he didn't initially like his first name, is also the fastest man in history.\u000a\u000aAnd as Usain Bolt - the eight-time Olympic champion -- for one more crack at global gold at the IAAF World Championships in London, NJ -- his best friend and manager Nugent 'NJ' Walker -- will once more proudly watching from the stands.\u000a\u000a"We've known each other a long time," Walker tells CNN, his Jamaican drawl accentuating the 'o' in long.\u000a\u000a"We were five years old and I remember he was taller than everyone else -- he was always taller. I was NJ and he was VJ, and that sort of drew us together."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Usain Bolt's legacy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Usain Bolt's legacy 02:59\u000a\u000aAt Waldensia Primary School, the two friends opened the batting together for the cricket team. "Bolt was the better one and would have been a successful cricketer if it hadn't been for track and field," explains Walker.\u000a\u000aOne day Bolt would shine with the bat, the next Walker. For the pair, the stand-out match was against Alberto Town Primary School, who set a 120-run total for victory, the batsmen picking off that total and remaining unbeaten at the crease.\u000a\u000aIn their other sporting passion, football, Bolt started in goal because of his size but quickly moved to the wing, providing the crosses for Walker to score.\u000a\u000a'I was fearful to take the job'\u000a\u000aBolt, aged 15, winning 200m at the IAAF Junior Athletics World Championships in 2002\u000a\u000aBut by the age of 11 or 12, it became clear to friends and families that Bolt's future lay on the track, with an ability to beat everyone even though cricket and football were his only training.\u000a\u000a"I remember thinking how good he could be if he actually did some training," adds his friend.\u000a\u000aDespite a friendship a quarter of a century in the making, the pair are still prone to arguments, although never about anything serious.\u000a\u000a"It's usually about sports, a game of basketball or something," says Walker.

"And I said 'no, dude, get someone else who knows what they're doing.'\u000a\u000a"But he said he wanted someone he could trust and that would have his back despite me not being trained for it. I was fearful because of that."\u000a\u000aEventually, Walker relented and now describes himself as the buffer between Bolt and the rest of his management around the world, enabling the athlete simply to focus on the job of running fast.\u000a\u000aEight years into that position, Walker says: "It's really been an honor and a privilege and I feel blessed.

He's done this a long time, 15/16 years and he needs to relax. He can do what he likes, and he'll be happy."\u000a\u000aA family is in the offing. Walker is himself a parent of a young son, NJ Junior, to whom Bolt is the godfather.\u000a\u000aDescribed as a doting godfather, there was a scare when the child was born early and had to be rushed to theater while Bolt was preparing to run at the World Championships in Beijing in 2015.\u000a\u000a"He was facing the biggest race of his career, people were saying he was going to lose to Justin Gatlin ," says Walker, "but he was ringing me five or six times a day. I was like 'focus on the race' and he wouldn't listen.\u000a\u000a"So while I'm there for him, he's there for me and always has been."\u000a\u000aAs an athletics observer, Walker has a clear No. 1 moment on the track with Bolt, namely the first 200m Olympic title.\u000a\u000a"That's my favorite," he adds. "This was his event, the one he always wanted, the dream, and to do that and break the world record, that was the best. The 100m was just a bonus ."\u000a\u000aAnd as for a best memory of their friendship? "There are just too many, and more to come."

aVOsan Air Base, South Korea (CNN) The first flight takes off from Osan Air Base just after daybreak, ascending high above the Korean Peninsula to collect and send critical data back to US military headquarters in South Korea.\u000a\u000aDubbed the "Dragon Lady" but also known as the Lockheed U-2, the sleek, ebony aircraft is capable of flying 70,000 feet above sea level -- in what's known as near space.\u000a\u000aAs North Korea boasts about advances in its nuclear weaponry and having missiles ready to hit near the US territory of Guam, the Dragon Lady is the spy plane of choice in helping Washington assess the true threat.\u000a\u000aA U-2 "Dragon Lady" pilot at Osan Air Base prepares to embark on a 12-hour mission over the Korean Peninsula.\u000a\u000a"We're busier here than we've been probably in the last 10 years," said Lt. Col. James Bartran, a veteran U-2 pilot who leads the 5th Reconnaissance Squadron at Osan Air Base, the US Air Force's closest base to North Korea, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from its border.\u000a\u000aThe mission is clear -- to keep their eyes and ears on North Korea.\u000a\u000a"Everything that this aircraft is sending is almost instantaneously sent down to people who can process, exploit and disseminate that information within minutes to our leadership," Bartran told CNN, which was granted access to Osan Air Base.\u000a\u000aThe control tower staff at Osan Air Base oversee the take-offs and landings of dozens of flights a day, on surveillance missions and training exercises to respond in the event of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula.\u000a\u000aHigh-altitude spy plane\u000a\u000aFirst taking flight during the Cold War in the 1950s, the Dragon Lady was built to fly so high that it couldn't be detected by Soviet planes.\u000a\u000aNewer models of the aircraft have been modernized with new sensors and cameras.\u000a\u000aAt $250 million a piece, the piloted spy planes are equipped to handle a variety of intelligence gathering tasks that newer unmanned aircraft like drones can't do alone. It makes the Dragon Lady a critical asset in detecting what the North Koreans are really up to.\u000a\u000a"We provide what's called multi-in (intelligence). We're the only true multi-in in the theater," Bartran explained. "We can both see and hear things at the same time."\u000a\u000aU-2 "Dragon Lady" spy planes fly 70,000 feet, so their pilots have to prepare the same way astronauts do before a flight.\u000a\u000aIn the months since Donald Trump became US President, the rhetoric between North Korea and the US has intensified. Both sides have threatened the other with total annihilation.\u000a\u000aBut the unpredictability of both leaders could mean tensions could escalate -- and possibly boil over -- at any time.\u000a\u000aThe Dragon Lady's presence over the Korean Peninsula, Bartran explained, is to ensure the US has the information it needs to act or respond. The intelligence the jet sends back to Washington could mean the difference between peace and war.\u000a\u000aUS Air Force crew stand in front of a U-2 spy plane at Osan Air Base, South Korea.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned it would be "game on " if North Korea sent a missile towards US territory or any of its allies.\u000a\u000a"I can assure you that, in close collaboration with our allies, there are strong military consequences if the DPRK initiates hostilities," Mattis said.\u000a\u000aSome of those "consequences" would likely originate from Osan Air Base. In addition to housing Dragon Lady spy planes, it's also the base for two squadrons of F-16 fighter jets -- whose pilots train with the motto to be "ready to fight tonight."\u000a\u000aOsan Air Base is home to two squadrons of F-16 fighter jets, which are capable of traveling 16 miles per minute.\u000a\u000a'Ferrari' of planes\u000a\u000aA third F-16 squadron is stationed at Kunsan, the other US Air Force base in South Korea.\u000a\u000a"This is Ferrari -- that is the best way to describe this thing," Maj. Daniel Trueblood, a F-16 pilot from the 36th Squadron said as he proudly showed off his fighter jet.\u000a\u000aHe boasted about the aircraft's supersonic speed -- saying it can move at 16 miles per minute.\u000a\u000aThat means that if either the US decided launch an attack or respond to one from North Korea, the F-16s -- which can carry long- and short-range missiles as well as bombs -- could in theory get from Osan Air Base into North Korean airspace in under three minutes.\u000a\u000aLike the spy plane pilots, the F-16 squadrons train daily over the Korean Peninsula -- simulating battles during both day and night. CNN watched as a dozen F-16s took off from Osan on a training exercise.\u000a\u000a"We don't know when something's going to happen or what we're going to called on to do, so we need to make sure that across the board we're ready to execute, pretty much at any time," Trueblood told CNN. "We prepare every day like tonight is the night."\u000a\u000aUS Patriot missile interceptors at Osan Air Base to guard against missile attacks from North Korea.\u000a\u000aHe compared the role the F-16s would play in a battle to that of an offensive lineman's in American football.\u000a\u000a"We go out as the overall package so load up the jet with both air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface missiles, with the HARM (High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile) we would shoot," Trueblood said.\u000a\u000a"Our job is to have the enemy target us with both their air-to-air threat and their surface-to-air threat, and we basically protect everybody else, so we want them to target us."\u000a\u000aDespite all the rumblings of potential combat, officials from South Korea and the US insist they'd rather talk than resume hostilities with North Korea.\u000a\u000aBut Pyongyang's defiant stance has caused concern among many that the current war of words could easily escalate into action.\u000a\u000aThe pilots at Osan Air Base say if it does, they're ready.\u000a\u000a"The mission has always been very clear and dictated down to me that we are ready to fight," Trueblood said.

aVOver 350 global business leaders gathered yesterday to discuss the theme \u201cBeyond Oil in a Changing World\u201d at the inaugural CNN Middle East Business Forum held at Four Seasons Abu Dhabi on Al Maryah Island.\u000a\u000aKeynote speeches were given by former President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso (pictured) and Mubadala\u2019s Group Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director H.E. Khaldoon Al Mubarak.\u000a\u000aPanel discussions and interviews with a stellar list of speakers were conducted by CNN\u2019s foremost experts on business and the Middle East \u2013 Anchor and Managing Editor, Abu Dhabi, Becky Anderson, CNNMoney Editor at Large Richard Quest, and CNNMoney Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios. A virtual reality \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 session from CNN\u2019s Jason Farkas closed proceedings.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis inaugural CNN Middle East Business Forum was a platform of informed and intelligent discussion amongst key influencers about the opportunities and challenges in the Middle East during a time of seismic change,\u201d said Rani R. Raad, President, CNN International Commercial. \u201cWe are proud to have worked with our partners Mubadala and twofour54 to bring together news-makers, agenda-setters and business leaders for meaningful debate about what the future holds.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Forum was held in association with Mubadala and twofour54 and with commercial supporting partners Al Maryah Island and Abu Dhabi Global Market on the weekend that eyes of the world turn to the UAE during the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\u000a\u000aHighlights show CNN Middle East Business Forum: Beyond Oil will first air on CNN International on 9 December at 2030 GST. Coverage from the Forum is also at money.cnn.com.\u000a\u000aKey quotes from the speakers at the CNN Middle East Business Forum include :\u000a\u000aIn conversation with José Manuel Barroso, H.E. Khaldoon Al Mubarak said: \u201cGlobal economic volatility is here for the foreseeable future; however, Abu Dhabi has acted to stay competitive and continue delivering against its economic development priorities.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe continued: \u201cStrong government to government relationships create a foundation for significant capital allocations in markets across the East and West, and we see incredible potential for significant investment in relatively new markets for us, such as China and Russia.\u201d\u000a\u000aJosé Manuel Barroso talked about the topic of diversification: \u201cLower oil prices is a job for all the GCC countries, but I believe the UAE is in a very good position. The GCC has turned from a net exporter to a net importer of capital with this focus on IPOs and privatisations. We are seeing here a very important change.\u201d\u000a\u000aTalking about Brexit, Barroso commented: \u201cIt is too soon to say what will happen with Brexit. Why? Because there is no strategy. Neither from the British or European side. The British haven\u2019t decided what they want. It was easy to vote no but the question is to vote how to do it. It is not clear how to do it\u2026. Frankly, nobody knows in London.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd on the US election result, Barroso said: \u201cPresident Elect Trump needs to adapt to the world and the world needs to adapt to him. In economic terms, investors are mainly happy about what he has announced so far \u2013 less regulation, lower taxes and huge programme of infrastructure\u2026 There is a question mark though on trade, where his rhetoric has been extremely negative. I believe that if the agenda of President Elect Trump is an agenda about growth, then he cannot do it without trade.\u201d\u000a\u000aH.E. Noura Al Kaabi, Chairwoman, Media Zone Authority-Abu Dhabi and twofour54 said: \u201ctwofour54, Abu Dhabi\u2019s content creation hub, and the Tourism and Culture Authority Abu Dhabi are working to drive the development of Abu Dhabi\u2019s cultural economy by bringing together the best of government, private sector and international partners to deliver major initiatives.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a location for blockbuster films such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the last stop on the global Formula 1 calendar, and home of international cultural collaborations such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi; we are creating an international brand and destination that appeals to a diverse global audience.\u000a\u000aShe further commented: \u201cAbu Dhabi organizations are working behind the scenes to incubate a sustainable media and cultural ecosystem by supporting infrastructure development, educational initiatives and legislative frameworks.\u201d\u000a\u000aH.E. Mohamed Al Mubarak, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority, said: \u201cBoth TCA Abu Dhabi and TwoFour54 play crucial roles in delivering Abu Dhabi\u2019s economic diversification ambitions. We have clear targets for the tourism sector, and our local cultural attractions and globally recognized events calendar are a major drivers of visitors.\u000a\u000a\u201cSuccess in particular sectors occurs when the home environment plays to its unique strengths \u2013 and that\u2019s what is happening in Abu Dhabi. We have a wealth of cultural and heritage assets which we are leveraging along with our values, natural environment, economic structure and creative and tourism institutions, to forge a reputation as a distinct and attractive destination.\u201d\u000a\u000aNotes to Editors:\u000a\u000aFor more information, please contact:\u000a\u000aDan Faulks\u000a\u000aVice President, Communications CNN International Commercial\u000a\u000aTel: + 44 20 7693 1362 Dan.Faulks@turner.com\u000a\u000aAbout CNN International\u000a\u000aCNN\u2019s portfolio of news and information services is available in seven different languages across all major TV, digital and mobile platforms reaching more than 420 million households around the globe.

aV(CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.\u000a\u000aBut as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.\u000a\u000aWhat began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.\u000a\u000aBut the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.\u000a\u000aGuatamala's past still haunts\u000a\u000aCifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual.\u000a\u000aMany women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.\u000a\u000aA 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.\u000a\u000aThere are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.\u000a\u000aSome 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.\u000a\u000aExplosion in violence\u000a\u000aMexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.\u000a\u000aPrevailing culture of machismo\u000a\u000aPerhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society.\u000a\u000aAccording to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, "80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed." This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.\u000a\u000aMake an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence\u000a\u000aU.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls\u000a\u000aThe political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.\u000a\u000a"Politicians don't think women are important," says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. "Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor."\u000a\u000aLack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.\u000a\u000aQuiroa says "They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade."\u000a\u000aSigns of progress\u000a\u000aAlthough the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.\u000a\u000aCifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.\u000a\u000aSince 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or "The Powerful," have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.\u000a\u000aFive Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or "The Powerful" share their stories and help other women get support.\u000a\u000aThe show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.\u000a\u000aThe taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or "Opening Opportunities". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.\u000a\u000aSenior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. "They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights."\u000a\u000aColom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.\u000a\u000aThe Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.\u000a\u000aPehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.\u000a\u000aAdelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence.\u000a\u000aBen Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, "We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women."\u000a\u000aBut the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.\u000a\u000aCifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.

aVWith billions of hours of video streaming online, it's hard enough to get discovered, let alone break out. But the 15 digital stars on THR's new Disrupters list all have managed to catch Hollywood's eye. Take Lilly Singh, one of YouTube's biggest comedic draws, with 12 million followers, who'll soon be stretching for a dramatic role in HBO's adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Or Adam Conover, who parlayed his snarky CollegeHumor series, Adam Ruins Everything, into a show for truTV. Or Liza Koshy, who after only two years of posting YouTube videos has a gig hosting the reboot of Total Request Live.\u000a\u000aFor Hollywood, this digital-first talent just might be the answer to the next-generation audience that is more likely to "Netflix and chill" than tune in for primetime or race to a theater \u2014 one reason summer box-office revenue is down more than 12 percent from last year. It's why CNN paid $25 million for vlogger Casey Neistat's video app, Beme. And why Food Network courted drunk cooking queen Hannah Hart for a new travel show.\u000a\u000aAltogether, the stars on this list \u2014 10 of whom gathered for an L.A. photo shoot in early August \u2014 easily have racked up more than 1 billion views, 100 million followers and thousands of web videos. All those zeros are hard to ignore.

aV(CNN) When does a child stop being a child and become a girl or a boy? A difficult question which can have serious consequences for children, according to a new report by Plan International , which has been gathering data and analyzing statistics on young adults.\u000a\u000aOver the next decade, an estimated 40 million youngsters in Sub-Saharan Africa will drop out of school, according to the World Bank\u000a\u000aGirls drop out of school more than boys, according to Plan, and researchers want governments to change the way they gather data and pay more attention to the reasons why this happens in order to fight gender inequality.\u000a\u000aStatistics on the under-15s tend not to differentiate between boys and girls, and this keeps the specific needs of young girls in the shadows, according to Plan International's CEO Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen.\u000a\u000a"You simply cannot target the program to the girl child, because you can't analyze the data in a way that will allow you to tailor your programs in an appropriate way," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000a"We have fairly good statistics that show us that there are more girls that drop out of secondary (high) school than boys, but what we don't know is why they do it."\u000a\u000aAlthough this is a blind spot in the official data, organizations like Plan have begun to investigate the causes and have found three key reasons: child marriage, menstruation and poverty.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Siphethangani, 18, pictured, finished secondary (high) school with flying colors and is now doing her A-Levels (college exams). "I love school because that's the foundation of a good life," she tells the researchers. But life looks very different for some girls. From poverty to child marriage, there are an array of reasons why many young Zimbabwean women drop out of school. These are their stories, as told to Plan International.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Siphiwe, 19, is a stay-at-home wife and mother who couldn't afford to finish school.

Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Siphiwe's days are now filled with household and childcare tasks.

Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Jenny, 13, could not afford to finish school. She took up work as a sex worker to make ends meet -- she earns a couple of dollars per client, according to Plan. Sometimes, clients reject her for being too young, she told Plan's researchers. Others are violent. "Sometimes the men use force. It's very painful." Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Jenny's friend Pauline has been working as a sex worker for three years, and has lost count of the number of men she has been with, according to Plan.

Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Melissa currently helps her aunt grow and sell vegetables. "It's hard to imagine," she tells Plan's researchers. "I only see a bleak future. I have to change it and go back to school." Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 To pass the time, Melissa plays netball with other girls who no longer go to school. According to Plan, there are hundreds of Zimbabwean girls out of school living unfulfilled lives. Hide Caption 10 of 10\u000a\u000aTake menstruation for example. Approaching puberty can be tough for everyone, but in some African countries girls skip school during their periods if they have nowhere to wash or change sanitary towels and tampons, according to Albrectsen.\u000a\u000a"We have literally hundreds of thousands of stories of that kind," she says.\u000a\u000a"One month they might stay away a week, and then another week next month. Then they start falling behind and they don't want to go back to school, and some may drop out altogether," she adds.\u000a\u000aWhile the most common reason given is money, forced marriage and pregnancy are other key factors, despite most governments having targets for all children to complete secondary education, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aChild marriage, periods and poverty are among barriers keeping girls out of education.\u000a\u000a"We see time and time again that some of those programs fail, because they are not based on enough evidence on where to target the investment."\u000a\u000aPlan International's researchers have been interviewing girls and young women in Zimbabwe about their education.\u000a\u000a"A girl might be forced into marriage, then get pregnant, and therefore can't go to school," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aChild marriage, poverty and education are all linked, the interviews suggested. Some girls get married early for family financial reasons and then quit school, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000a"Basically you marry the girl off, and so she is less of a burden to the family."\u000a\u000aOthers in the case study quit school for financial reasons and then got married.\u000a\u000a"Whether it's poverty that forces the girl out of school, or marriage, is inconclusive, but it's clear that a combination of the prevalence of early marriage and poverty has a devastating impact on girls being able to complete secondary education," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aDue to a lack of job opportunities for young women without an education, some young girls in Zimbabwe have turned to prostitution, according to Plan.\u000a\u000aThe UN's Global Sustainable Development Goals include targets for improving gender equality, and Plan's report is a wake-up call to governments trying to bridge the gender gap.\u000a\u000aThis gap goes beyond education. The day-to-day realities of young boys and girls can be very different even within the family, according to a recent UNICEF report , with gender roles forming already early on and young girls bearing the greater burden of household chores.\u000a\u000aThis form of inequality in the household could be detrimental to girls' development and self-image, according to UNICEF's report.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are 1.1 billion girls in the world under the age of 18. More than half live in Asia and a quarter in Africa. While many regions will have fewer or as many girls by 2030, the number of girls in Africa will grow by 30 percent, according to UNICEF.\u000a\u000a"There are almost 2 billion children in the world under the age of 15, and most of those live in developing countries," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aIf African governments are to improve the prospects for young girls, they need to tackle the blind spots in gender data for the under-15s, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aBut why in the eyes of data do children typically become men and women at the age of 15?\u000a\u000aAlbrectsen doesn't know the answer. But placing women's reproductive age between 15 and 49 is prevalent worldwide, she says, even though the actual reproductive age may begin earlier.\u000a\u000a"Fundamentally you're saying they are just children, and they are legally not allowed to, or shouldn't be, having sex," she says.\u000a\u000a"But they are."\u000a\u000aThis may mean that data on pregnancies and sexual activity under the age of 15 is not gathered, she says.\u000a\u000aCan a data revolution make the world a more equal place?\u000a\u000aThe result? Governments may be unable to tackle issues such as teenage pregnancies.\u000a\u000a"If you are not measuring it, how can you deal with the consequences?"\u000a\u000aHowever, data collection is expensive, and it can be hard for governments to justify spending money on this, at the expense of other areas, especially in developing countries.\u000a\u000aBut Albrectsen says it would pay off.\u000a\u000a"Initial investment in getting the data systems up and running will ultimately save money through better targeting of [equality] programs in the long run, and have a bigger impact."

aVLatakia, Syria (CNN) Children splashing in the Mediterranean, young men and women in swimwear smoking hookah -- this could be any holiday hot spot, but it's Latakia, a seaside town in war-torn Syria.\u000a\u000aOn our way here, we drove through Homs' al-Khaldeeye district -- its streets empty after being under siege for years. The concrete husks of former homes and businesses stretched out in front of us for as far as the eye could see, buildings riddled with bullet holes, floors collapsed from tank shells, bombs and mortar fire. The only living souls were us, an occasional car and the Syrian military posts every couple of blocks. It was difficult to imagine, despite years covering Syria, the amount of destructive effort that was needed to attain this result. Hours earlier, as guests of the Syrian government, we were on the front lines of the military's fight against ISIS in the country's central region, where devastation also reigns.\u000a\u000aThe contrast with Latakia -- in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's heartland, where his support is rock-solid and the Russians have an air base -- could not be more stark.\u000a\u000aOne of the beach resorts in Latakia.\u000a\u000aTucked safely away from the six-year-long Syrian war, Latakia is a seaside province that has escaped the fighting largely unscathed. Assad's ancestral hometown, Qardahah, is a short drive away. It has always been a bastion of relative peace during war; but now more than ever, as Assad's military gains are cemented.\u000a\u000a"We are tired from the war," says Michael Michael, who was taking a break from his job at the Syrian embassy in Sudan.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVOnly Fox News can bring down President Trump, a recent New York Times op-ed argued. "If Fox turns, it's inevitable," it said.\u000a\u000aFor a few moments on Tuesday, it seemed as if Fox News was turning. Several of the network's hosts and contributors either condemned or criticized Trump's remarks blaming "both sides" for the weekend violence in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aIn the 5pm hour, for instance, "Specialists" co-host Kat Timpf went as far as to say it was "honestly crazy" she had to comment in the immediate aftermath of the spectacle because she was "still in the phase" where she was "actually wondering" if what she watched "was real life."\u000a\u000a"It was one of the biggest messes I've ever seen," Timpf said.\u000a\u000aThen came prime time, and the return of pro-Trump TV.\u000a\u000aFor the better part of three hours, Tucker Carlson, the co-hosts of "The Five" and Sean Hannity went after liberals and the media instead of criticizing Trump for his decision to draw a moral equivalency between neo-Nazis and leftist counter-protestors.\u000a\u000aFox's programming stood in stark contrast to much of the rest of the media's coverage on the controversial nature of Trump's remarks. Instead, the night was heavy with "whataboutism." The average Fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the media's criticism of Trump and leftist protestors' toppling of some Confederate statues were far greater threats to America than white supremacism or the president's apparent defense of bigotry.\u000a\u000aYes, Carlson, Hannity and the hosts of "The Five" made clear that they condemned white supremacists.\u000a\u000a"Of course white supremacists are despicable human beings who shouldn't exist in America," Jesse Watters said, for instance.\u000a\u000aBut that throat-clearing was very quickly followed by monologues advancing Trump's thesis that "both sides" were to blame for what happened in Charlottesville, as well as attacks on the left and the media.\u000a\u000aCarlson began his show with a monologue about the history of slavery, noting that historical figures from Plato to Mohammed to Simon Bolivar had owned slaves. "None of this is a defense of the atrocity of human bondage," Carlson said. "The point, however, is that if we are going to judge the past by the standards of the present... we had better be prepared for the consequences of that."\u000a\u000aHe then dedicated half of his show to worrying about how the destruction of Confederate statues could lead to the destruction of the statues of Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, even Abraham Lincoln. The lesson of Charlottesville, Carlson seemed to be saying at times, is that we need to protect our statues.\u000a\u000aOne guest, John Daniel Davidson, a senior correspondent for The Federalist, compared the protestors tearing down statues to "Weimar thugs" and the Taliban. Later, Carlson asked: "What will [the left] feel empowered to destroy next?"\u000a\u000aOn "The Five," Watters called Trump's news conference "brave and honest." Though he later condemned the neo-Nazis as "degenerates," he said the media shouldn't be so focused on their efforts because, he said, there were "only 100,000" of them in America.\u000a\u000aWhile Five co-hosts Dana Perino and Juan Williams did criticize Trump's remarks at Tuesday's press conference, the bulk of their discussion centered on whether or not the left should bear equal blame for the violence in Charlottesville -- a debate that in its very premise advanced Trump's "both sides" narrative.\u000a\u000aThe Five spent the second half of its hour targeting other media organizations for unrelated issues, including The New York Times and CNN.\u000a\u000aFinally, Hannity. To his credit, Hannity condemned white supremacists. "The white supremacists provoked this, they are the ones who are most responsible." But he also credited the president for "setting the record straight about the violence in Charlottesville."\u000a\u000aThen, he moved on to a familiar target: the media. The "destroy Trump media" would never give Trump credit for condemning white supremacists and neo-Nazis, Hannity said, seemingly ignoring that Trump's remarks Tuesday stood in contrast to his less-enthusiastic condemnation of them on Monday.\u000a\u000aThe media's campaign against Trump was a central theme throughout Hannity's program -- until he pivoted, as he often does, to raising suspicions about Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Obama Justice Department.\u000a\u000aNone of what took place on Fox News Tuesday night was necessarily surprising. Fox News has become almost unfailingly loyal to Trump, and reflexively dismissive of his faults and missteps.\u000a\u000aAnd yet it showed that if Fox News has a line when it comes to Trump's presidency, it was not crossed on Tuesday.

aVCANTON, Ohio - A Canton man said he can\u2019t drive the car he just bought from a police auction because it was reported stolen and the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles refused to title it.\u000a\u000aRyan Rider said he purchased a 2002 Saab 9-3 convertible from the Canton Police impound auction earlier this summer for $450. At the time, police handed him the title, which shows the Canton Police Department as the vehicle owner.\u000a\u000aWhen he went to the BMV to have it titled in his name, they refused, he said, telling him it was reported stolen in Broward County, Florida. That\u2019s despite the fact that the car had already apparently been re-titled to Canton Police.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy because I bought this car from the police,\u201d Rider said. "If you sold this car and you didn\u2019t know it was stolen, you\u2019d be in jail for receiving stolen property. However, they\u2019re selling me a stolen car and it\u2019s sitting here in the driveway for two months not being driven.\u201d\u000a\u000aRider called the Broward County, FL Sheriff\u2019s Department who, he said, never returned his call. Then, he tried Canton.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lady did contact me saying later on in that day it would be handled, and here we are and it\u2019s still not handled,\u201d Rider said.\u000a\u000aOver the phone Thursday night, a police spokesman referred News 5 to the impound lot.\u000a\u000aA Broward County Sheriff\u2019s department report confirms the car was stolen from a home there in 2016. Rider said he wants someone to take his concerns seriously and he wants to finally drive the car he legally purchased.\u000a\u000a"I\u2019m sitting here with a stolen car that I can't do nothing with,\u201d he said.

He seemed to be suggesting that this is part of a plot to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. Your response?[TRUMP JR] Well, it just goes to show you their exact moral compass. I mean, they will say anything to be able to win this. I mean, this is time and time again, lie after lie. You notice he won't say, well, I say this. We hear experts. You know, here\u2019s (INAUDIBLE) at home once said that this is what's happening with the Russians. It's disgusting. It's so phony. I watched him bumble through the interview, I was able to hear it on audio a little bit. I mean, I can't think of bigger lies, but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win.You hear it with the DNC where they're leaking emails about Bernie Sanders and his Jewish heritage, to be able to try to destroy him in the south. It's a rigged system. It's disgusting and the people who should be fed up because when I heard it I certainly was.[TAPPER] President Obama \u2013There\u2019s nothing wrong with a fair fight, Jake. I don't mind a fair fight, but these lies and the perpetuating of that kind of nonsense to try, you know, gain some political capital is just outrageous and he should be ashamed of himself. If a Republican did that\u2026[TAPPER] President Obama \u2013[TRUMP JR]: \u2026 they would be calling for people to bring out the electric chair.\u000a\u000aDonald Trump Jr. on the possibility of Roger Ailes joining the campaign: [TAPPER] Your father raised the prospect of bringing on Roger Ailes the former chairman and CEO of FOX News and the idea being Mr. Trump said something along the lines of people are talking about maybe he would run my campaign. Is that actually in play, roger Ailes coming on board and running the campaign? [TRUMP JR.] Not that I\u2019m aware of. I mean, I know they are friends and have a long-term relationship but I\u2019m happy with the work that Paul Manafort is doing, I think our team is really coming into place and swing, it's been exciting to be a fly on the wall watching a lot of this stuff go down. Because - you know, again, we're trying to give a voice to the people who have been forgotten and I think the campaign is doing a wonderful job of that.\u000a\u000aFULL POST

aVHong Kong (CNN) A Hong Kong court has jailed Joshua Wong and two other leaders of the 2014 "Umbrella Movement," three years after they helped organize the largest pro-democracy protests ever held in the city.\u000a\u000aWong, 20, was sentenced to eight months in prison Thursday, reduced to six months on account of previous community service, while fellow defendants Nathan Law, 24, and Alex Chow, 26, were sentenced to 10 months, reduced to eight, and eight months, reduced to seven, respectively.\u000a\u000aNathan Law (L), Joshua Wong (C) and Alex Chow, leaders of Hong Kong's 'Umbrella Movement', gesture as they address the media before their sentencing in Hong Kong on August 17, 2017.\u000a\u000aAfter the verdict was read out the gallery fell silent, until the judge banged his gavel to end proceedings and supporters broke out into chants of "shame" and "political persecution."\u000a\u000aThe case marks a dramatic turnaround from 2014, when the trio helped bring out hundreds of thousands of people to the streets to call for a more direct form of democracy in the former British colony.\u000a\u000aWong, Law and Chow were initially given, and completed, community service sentences, but the Department of Justice appealed, arguing these were an insufficient deterrent.\u000a\u000aJonathan Man, the lawyer representing Law and Chow, said he wasn't surprised by the verdict but it was "very harsh."\u000a\u000aHe pointed out the three had already served community service sentences, and the prison terms represented a major increase in punishment.\u000a\u000aImmediately following the verdict, Wong said on Twitter that the government "can lock up our bodies, but not our minds!"\u000a\u000asee you soon. \u2014 Joshua Wong Chi-fung (@joshuawongcf) August 17, 2017\u000a\u000a"They can silence protests, remove us from the legislature and lock us up," he said. "But they will not win the hearts and minds of Hong Kongers."\u000a\u000aSophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch, described the verdict as a "nakedly calculated political prosecution."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Hong Kong voters elect pro-democracy activists Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hong Kong voters elect pro-democracy activists 02:39\u000a\u000a'Face of protest'\u000a\u000aThe events of 2014 led Wong to be dubbed the "face of protest" by Time Magazine, an image burnished by regular appearances in the international press.\u000a\u000aIn the city itself, there was a surge in optimism as hordes of young Hong Kongers, previously written off as apathetic about politics slept in the streets for weeks on end and clashed with police to demand their rights.\u000a\u000aThe aftermath of the protests saw many new political parties formed , led by young former protesters and advocating so-called "localist" ideas spanning the gamut of greater self-determination for Hong Kong to full independence from China -- an idea Beijing has angrily opposed and called for it to be controlled.\u000a\u000aSeptember 2016 legislative elections saw record-level turnout , as voters "thumbed their noses at Beijing" and returned a raft of localist and localist-leaning politicians, including Law, then 23, the youngest-ever person elected to the city's parliament.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Thousands march for democracy in Hong Kong Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Thousands march for democracy in Hong Kong 02:18\u000a\u000aOathgate\u000a\u000aBut by late 2016, the sense of hope among the pro-democracy movement had begun to sour as the Hong Kong government moved to disqualify two pro-independence lawmakers who staged an anti-China protest while taking their oaths of office.\u000a\u000aBeijing also weighed in, issuing a "reinterpretation" of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, Basic Law, which ruled oaths must be taking "sincerely" and "solemnly."\u000a\u000aBased on the new requirements, officials sought to eject more lawmakers who had strayed from the standard text during their oaths -- despite a history of protests during the ceremony.\u000a\u000aThe jailing of Wong, Law and Chow represents a continuation of those efforts, suggested Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and author of "City of Protest: A recent history of dissent in Hong Kong."\u000a\u000a"Recent events ... suggest that Beijing is doubling down on its attempts to crush dissent in Hong Kong," said Dapiran. "The future is looking a lot more bleak now than it was even just a few months ago."\u000a\u000aSince being handed back to Chinese control in 1997, Hong Kong has been governed under the framework of "one country, two systems," an agreement, outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, that was intended to preserve the rule of law, freedom of speech and the right to protest until 2047.\u000a\u000aLawmaker Eddie Chu told local broadcaster RTHK earlier this week the government is "trying to raise the bar of political dissent to long term imprisonment in order to deter future actions by the citizens of Hong Kong."\u000a\u000aIn a statement, the Department of Justice dismissed accusations the case against Wong, Law and Chow was politically motivated, and argued they broke the law with "disorderly and intimidating behavior."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED China's President issues 'red line' warning Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China's President issues 'red line' warning 00:46\u000a\u000a'Political prosecutions'\u000a\u000aIf Beijing was seeking to suppress dissent in Hong Kong, the tactic appeared to pay off in June this year, when mass protests expected to greet Chinese President Xi Jinping during his first official visit to the city failed to materialize.\u000a\u000aThose protesters who did attempt to reach Xi were attacked by counter demonstrators waving the Chinese flag and eventually bundled into police vans, unable to get anywhere near the Chinese leader.\u000a\u000aAn annual pro-democracy march on July 1 -- when Hong Kong marked 20 years of Chinese rule -- was able to go ahead, after Xi had already left the city.\u000a\u000aShortly after Xi's visit, Law and four other pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified . Following Thursday's verdict, neither Law nor Wong will be able to stand in the by-elections to fill those seats, as anyone jailed for more than 3 months is banned from standing for office for five years.\u000a\u000aIn an editorial this week, the New York Times warned jailing the three would create Hong Kong's first "political prisoners."\u000a\u000aIn a statement, US Senator Marco Rubio, chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), denounced the "political prosecutions" of Wong and others as "further evidence that Hong Kong's cherished autonomy is precipitously eroding."\u000a\u000a"Beijing's heavy hand is on display for all to see as they attempt to crush the next generation of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and undermine the 'one country, two systems' arrangement."

aVThe 33-year-old Georgia resident doesn't currently get her health insurance through the exchanges, although she has in the past, nor is she on Medicaid. Both could be impacted by the Republican legislation proposed as a replacement to Obamacare.\u000a\u000aStill, she is watching that legislation closely because she, like 117 million Americans, has a chronic condition. It has no cure and requires expensive care. She worries about whether her husband's job will still come with benefits and whether they'll be able to avoid penalties by maintaining consistent coverage.\u000a\u000aTo Daniel, the health care debate is not political, it's personal.\u000a\u000aDaniel has Crohn's disease, which is inflammation of her GI tract. Sometimes she feels fine and can go about her day as if she is well. Other times, the condition leaves her in such pain and with so little energy, she is confined to bed for days at a time. She's had bouts when she can't swallow. Sometimes her body rejects all food. Once, when she was in college, she spent an entire weekend on the bathroom floor, too sick to eat, drink or move, she said.\u000a\u000aIt's been rough, particularly since she is a busy mother with two young children who demand a lot of her time.\u000a\u000a"It's been really hard, especially this year, on my kids," Daniel said. "They can't comprehend what's really going on with me. They just know that I'm sick. Thankfully, they're really great kids, and I have a lot of friends and a lot of family who have volunteered to help."\u000a\u000aShe said the help comes in handy when she gets her treatments. Her doctors have had her try nearly every medication that's out there. She's also had to have surgery to remove part of her colon. None of it worked permanently, so her doctors put her on Remicade. The drug comes in the form of an infusion that she must get at a hospital that's a 40-minute drive away. She gets it every few weeks. Without insurance, the drug would cost about $20,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe good news is, it seems to be working.\u000a\u000a"This type of medicine is a lifetime commitment," she said. That means she can't afford to go without insurance if she wants to stay well.\u000a\u000aHer husband, Justin, rarely gets sick, she said, so he might be able to get away without insurance, but her daughter may also have an autoimmune disease, so the family has to keep its coverage, which they get through his work.\u000a\u000aThe absolute need for insurance is something that keeps Daniel focused on what is going on with the GOP health care bill.\u000a\u000a"What are they going to do for people like me who have chronic illness?" she asked. "There is a little bit of nervousness here."\u000a\u000aThe current GOP bill does not bring health care back to the way it was before Obamacare.\u000a\u000aBefore the Affordable Care Act, if you shopped for a plan on the individual market, companies often wouldn't sell a plan to someone who had a chronic or pre-existing condition. There were also lifetime caps on how much a company would spend on your care. With an expensive drug like Remicade, Daniel could have easily maxed out a policy in the old system.\u000a\u000aObamacare eliminated lifetime caps and made it so insurance companies couldn't discriminate against you if you had a pre-existing condition. The current bills do not change either issue, but the bills do incentivize people to have continuous coverage. And large employers would no longer be required to offer affordable insurance to their employees, like they do now.\u000a\u000aThat means if the bills become law and her husband's company decides to drop its benefits, Daniel could lose her insurance. And although the family has done everything in its power to keep coverage, she said, she could easily see when there could be a gap.\u000a\u000aThat nearly happened a few years ago, when her husband lost his job. For the three months he was out of work, the family went on COBRA, which is not subsidized. It cost $900 a month. It was such a steep expense, Daniel said, they had to ask family members to help them cover their bills. Without generous family, they could have taken their chances and skipped insurance coverage to keep afloat financially.\u000a\u000aBut skipping coverage would be an even tougher decision if they faced another job loss. With the proposed GOP health care plan in place, they could face a 30% penalty if they bought a plan on the individual market for the rest of that year.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aDaniel said she hopes, whatever Obamacare replacement goes into law, that she and others with chronic conditions will be OK. Until then, she'll be thinking constantly about what could happen to her insurance.\u000a\u000a"I'm nervous not knowing the future," Daniel said. "You never know how much you're going to end up with that you're responsible for. You never know how bad it's going to get."

aVManchester, England (CNN) If Manchester City used to be the club boasting high-profile signings on provocative billboards, these days this northern English city's "noisy neighbor" is taking a more softly, softly approach.\u000a\u000aAhead of Saturday's Premier League derby against rival Manchester United, it's all about the grand scheme for a club that was once written off for having "a small mentality."\u000a\u000a"It's been a bit like an iceberg coming out of the water," says Manchester City's chief infrastructure officer, Jon Stemp. "People only see the tip of it."\u000a\u000aGiven City were playing in England's third tier in 1999, the club's ascent to English football's top table initially necessitated the acquisition of players -- an investment of just under $1 billion since the Abu Dhabi United Group took over.\u000a\u000aWithin hours of the club changing hands, City had smashed the British transfer record for Real Madrid's Robinho. City's transfer policy was denigrated -- the new kids on the block were branded oil rich and regarded by many as no more than a billionaire's plaything.\u000a\u000aBut Sheikh Mansour and his team have never lost sight of the bigger picture...\u000a\u000aYou can win anything with kids\u000a\u000a"People were measuring the investments in the short term without knowing there was a long-term plan coming," Stemp says.\u000a\u000aBeneath the surface, greater plans have been afoot ever since Mansour declared in 2008: "We are building a structure for the future, not just a team of all-stars."\u000a\u000aIn the heart of the Etihad Campus, deep within the area of Manchester known as "Sportscity," the 5,000-seater, 7,000-capacity Academy Stadium is the shining jewel in one of the finest youth complexes in the world.\u000a\u000aThe Academy Stadium is predominantly used by the Elite Development squad and Manchester City Women. "I like to think of us as pioneers ... not just in England, but globally," says Man City and England Ladies midfielder Izzy Christiansen.\u000a\u000aIn fixtures against United last season, City went unbeaten in every age group, from the Under-9s all the way up to the U18s.\u000a\u000aA 9-0 aggregate win at U14 level against the Red Devils will have been particularly galling for a club so proud of Ferguson's Class of '92 -- featuring the likes of David Beckham -- and the Busby Babes\u000a\u000aIn an age when many of the world's wealthiest clubs' academies are filled with many different nationalities, 75% of the players in City's Football Academy are drawn from the Greater Manchester area.\u000a\u000aAll in all, the club engages with "the best part of 50,000 young people in Manchester every year," according to former City goalkeeper Alex Williams -- now manager of club's City in the Community program.\u000a\u000aEven United luminaries Robin van Persie, Phil Neville, Andrew Cole and Darren Fletcher have opted to send their sons to the Etihad Campus instead of the Trafford Training Center in recent years.\u000a\u000aStemp allows himself a contented smile. "Now, eight years on, you see the rest of the investment plan emerging."\u000a\u000aThe Mission\u000a\u000aPart of the legacy of the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the Etihad Stadium was the "first brick in the wall," according to Stemp.\u000a\u000aEver since, City plots its expansion in terms of "building blocks of eureka moments," from the transformation of blighted lands with the construction of the training complex, to the development of commercial opportunities around the East Manchester site.\u000a\u000aWithin a stone's throw of the Etihad, remnants of Manchester's industrial past are still very much visible -- disused gas holders dot the landscape while a canal runs side-by-side with the city's new tram network.\u000a\u000a"East Manchester was all industrial, and therefore the ideal location for regeneration," Stemp tells CNN.\u000a\u000aBut 80 acres of contaminated brownfield land have been transformed by self-confessed "grass nerd" Stemp and his team; 46 acres now comprise managed grass and wildflower meadows; and more than 2,000 trees have been planted.\u000a\u000a"It was very derelict," reflects Stemp, gesturing to the work the club has done. "We put our arms around the land and took control of it."\u000a\u000aThe final piece in the puzzle\u000a\u000aAs well as the physical building blocks, City officials believe coach Pep Guardiola is the final piece in a complex puzzle.\u000a\u000a"I have no doubt about his positive impact," City's chief operating officer Omar Berrada tells CNN. "We've already expanded the stadium and we think (Guardiola) will bring the potential for continued expansion."\u000a\u000a"Pep delivers a culture of success and style of play that will be developed across everything that we're doing here," Berrada says. "I'm sure that will have long-lasting effects."\u000a\u000aPep Guardiola already seems at home at the Etihad.\u000a\u000aBerrada branded Guardiola "the best in the world" within days of his arrival in a reference to the success he brought to his former clubs, Bayern Munich and Barcelona.\u000a\u000aThe Spanish coach's reputation is also helping lure the world's finest players to Manchester as the club bids to win its third Premier League title in six seasons.\u000a\u000aGundogan\u000a\u000aGuardiola's first foray into the market was for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan -- a distinguished Germany international.\u000a\u000a"To have this possibility is amazing for me," Gundogan tells CNN. "We have the best manager in the world, and day-by-day I recognize I have made the right decision."\u000a\u000aIlkay Gundogan began his career at VFL Bochum, going on to star for FC Nurnberg & Borussia Dortmund\u000a\u000aThe 25-year-old may have only been at the club for a matter of months, but he already perceives the investment transforming not just City, but the city.\u000a\u000a"Everything is developing really fast. I love the mix between old buildings and the new buildings," Gundogan says.\u000a\u000a"Manchester has a real charm."\u000a\u000aBreaking the glass ceiling\u000a\u000aIf the acquisition of players of Gundogan's stature is no longer breaking news for a club that has come so far, Kelechi Iheanacho's breakthrough from the academy shows progress is being made in all departments.\u000a\u000aIheanacho had the Premier League's best minutes- per-goal ratio in 2015-16, scoring on average every 93.8 minutes.\u000a\u000aSmashing through a glass ceiling that traditionally has proven so troublesome for young players aiming to make it in the world's richest league, the 19-year-old scored 14 goals in just 11 starts last season -- suggesting he has the mettle to become one of the most clinical finishers in Europe.\u000a\u000aWith key striker Sergio Aguero serving a three-match ban, Iheanacho could start against United Saturday.\u000a\u000a"City were a club on the way up," Iheanacho tells CNN, reflecting on his perception of the team when he joined, shortly after winning the U17 World Cup with Nigeria.\u000a\u000a"Coming from Nigeria where I was often unable to afford to watch the Premier League, I'm very proud to be playing here. It has been a great experience coming to Manchester."\u000a\u000aCitizens beyond The Citizens\u000a\u000aHowever, in an age of growing discord between fan and player -- as both Iheanacho and Gundogan earn tens of thousands of dollars per week -- how has the club's investment in its future served the rest of Manchester?\u000a\u000aWorking at Bonnie's Cafe near the Etihad Campus, Sheila Duffy has experienced first-hand the fruits of the area's regeneration -- as well as the potential pitfalls of gentrification.\u000a\u000a"We had drugs, street crime, everything like that, and nobody cared because it was derelict," she reflects. "The swimming baths were closed down, the youth club was shut. There was nothing for the kids so they'd be hanging around on street corners."\u000a\u000aDuffy acknowledges the "Sheikh up in his helicopter" may not have directly engaged with the man on the ground and his full English breakfast, but she's the first to admit her surroundings have changed dramatically -- a reference to the five and half acres of the Etihad Campus site donated to the local community.\u000a\u000aWhere the skeletons of Manchester's industrial boom once stood, a sixth-form college, leisure center, and cutting-edge medical institute now preside.\u000a\u000a"It was a rough area of the city and now there's certainly a sense of hope ... and I'm a Manchester United supporter!"\u000a\u000aA 190m span bridge across Alan Turing way is emblematic of the connection between club and community.\u000a\u000aPep vs. Jose\u000a\u000aIf the foundations are in place, can City make good on the club's rich promise?\u000a\u000aWhile Iheanacho may be a singular talent, his presence as a youth-team graduate in the Citizens squad currently remains similarly conspicuous.\u000a\u000aPromisingly, Guardiola gave 22 young players debuts during his time at Barcelona -- many of whom, from Busquets to Thiago Alcântara, have gone on to enjoy great success.\u000a\u000aBut there is still some way to go before City emerges from United's shadow in this regard.\u000a\u000aNicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville would all go on to become United regulars having progressed from the youth team under Sir Alex Ferguson.\u000a\u000aSince 1940, almost 50% of all Manchester United players have come through the club's youth system. United has had at least one academy player in the squad in every first team game since October 1937 -- a run spanning 3,808 consecutive clashes.\u000a\u000aStriker Marcus Rashford, already an England international at the age of 18, looks the latest in a long line set to benefit from that unwavering faith this year -- even if manager Jose Mourinho's commitment to youth has been questioned, and fellow "homegrown" player Paul Pogba required a $100M education abroad.\u000a\u000aExcept the envious glances toward Old Trafford have stopped.\u000a\u000aConverging with its more illustrious counterpart on and off the pitch, City has finished above United in four of the past five seasons, and Mourinho looks like he has quite the job on his hands getting the better of his old rival Guardiola.

aVHow can you enjoy fine wine by the glass without having the rest of the bottle turn to vinegar?\u000a\u000aThat was the challenge Greg Lambrecht set out to solve when his wife gave up alcohol while pregnant.\u000a\u000aFrustrated by opening bottles of wine that would then go to waste, he invented Coravin -- a device that allows you to pour a glass without removing the cork.\u000a\u000aIt works like this: A thin, hollow needle is pushed through the cork to inject argon gas into the bottle. The gas pressure forces wine back up through the same needle and into the glass, while preventing the rest of the bottle from oxidizing. When the needle is withdrawn, the cork reseals.\u000a\u000aLambrecht's inspiration for Coravin came from medicine. After studying nuclear engineering at MIT, he went into medical engineering after working at Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).\u000a\u000aHis first start up -- Intrinsic Therapeutics -- makes technology for spine implants and cancer treatments.\u000a\u000a"I thought - in medicine we go through things all the time with needles and don't damage them," he said.\u000a\u000a"My dad is diabetic, he has an insulin bottle, he sticks his needle through, he drives in the insulin. Maybe I can go through this cork and try to suck out wine like my dad does with insulin?"\u000a\u000aCoravin is available in 50 countries for $299, or $199 depending on how slick you want your model. The argon capsules cost $11 each and need replacing after 15 glasses of wine.\u000a\u000aThat begins to add up. The cost of pouring six glasses would add more than $4 to the price of a bottle.\u000a\u000aBut the serial entrepreneur rejects suggestions that Coravin is a luxury product.\u000a\u000a"I use Coravin even on a $10 bottle of wine. It's about drinking the amount I want and having that wine in the perfect shape every time I taste it," Lambrecht said.\u000a\u000aCoravin's biggest markets are in the U.S., U.K., and France but it's hoping to grow in China and Japan as well as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.\u000a\u000aThe company hired Frédéric Lévy, former president of Nespresso North America, as CEO in 2015 to lead its expansion. One of his early deals was with Morton's The Steakhouse.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant chain was one of the first to offer premium wines by the glass using Coravin. Lambrecht says his product can save restaurateurs a whole lot of money by preventing waste.\u000a\u000aHowever, individual consumers still account for 90% of Coravin's business. Lambrecht said it allows people to taste a far broader range of wine -- and that's proving particularly appealing to younger drinkers.\u000a\u000a"I've met more Millennials who have had Txakolina wine [from the Basque County in Spain] than Cabernet," he said.

aVBrooklyn, New York (CNN) Behind Andre Rozier's bright smile is an iron will to win.\u000a\u000a"I don't like to lose," the champion boxing trainer says. "I don't like my fighters to lose."\u000a\u000aHis brusque commands to "keep moving" and "don't fold up" echo through his basement gym in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes you have to punish yourself to achieve maximum success," the New York native explains.\u000a\u000aIt is clear Rozier knows what he wants in the ring.

I'm finished."\u000a\u000aYears later, an eager young boxer pulled a reluctant Rozier back into the sport.\u000a\u000a"I met a young man in my apartment complex who kept asking me to take him to the gym," the trainer explains. "And I would say 'no, I don't have time for it.' "\u000a\u000aBut the relentless boxer continued to pester Rozier to train him.\u000a\u000a"He broke my shell," the corner man says with a laugh. "I wanted to break him."\u000a\u000aStepping back inside the ring\u000a\u000aAfter stepping inside the ring with the young boxer, Rozier says "a new fire was lit" within him.

"This time as a teacher instead of student."\u000a\u000aRozier says he has coached more than 1 million athletes in his training career. Among his top fighters is Daniel Jacobs, who won the middleweight championship title in 2013.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes you train an athlete for two days and sometimes you train an athlete and they are with you for the rest of their lives," he explains. "It's only because I love it."\u000a\u000aPhotos: In 2011, American boxer Daniel Jacobs was diagnosed with a life-threatening form of bone cancer, and was partially paralyzed.

aVThe three shows provided an appropriate backdrop to a related message: luxury, within the context of design, is being redefined. Bling is passé. High-function trumps high-price, and subtle design details are favored over ostentatious add-ons. Less is more.\u000a\u000a"Modern luxury is about real value," said Marie Kristine Schmidt, Bang & Olufsen's vice president for brand, design and marketing, during the launch of the brand's new BeoSound speaker system.\u000a\u000aA post shared by CNN Style (@cnnstyle) on Apr 5, 2017 at 12:20am PDT\u000a\u000a"Modern luxury is not about mass consumption. I think we're moving towards a time when we are saying we'd rather have less. A few good items that you are really happy about, instead of this consumerism where you buy and throw away."\u000a\u000aDesigner Yves Behar added, "Our definition of luxury has completed shifted in recent years. Whereas luxury used to be about rarity and inaccessibility, luxury is now about ease -- something is luxurious if it makes our lives simpler and easier, in other words, if it enables us to navigate the world with ease."\u000a\u000aCraft and materiality -- storytelling -- still play an important role in modern luxury. Danish design practice Studio Copenhagen alluded to thoughtful design: "Post-bling luxury is about awareness and enlightenment.

aVJane Greenway Carr is an opinion producer at CNN. She holds a PhD from NYU and was an ACLS/Mellon Public Fellow at New America. She is the co-founder of The Brooklyn Quarterly . The views expressed here are solely hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Charlottesville is where I learned what history is and isn't, and who I wanted to become. I posed for graduation and wedding photos in the shadow of the Rotunda at the University of Virginia, elated to be starting a new life pursuing further post-graduate study and building a family. It's a campus and a town that will always feel a bit like home to me.\u000a\u000aThe world saw a very different Charlottesville last weekend, a place overrun by a mob of white men screaming, "You will not replace us," and "Jews will not replace us," torches illuminating their contorted faces. A place where racist intimidation and violence -- helmeted marchers carrying shields and clubs and semiautomatic weapons, a car plowing into a crowd of counterprotesters -- jarringly upended the world's perception of a serene and sophisticated college town.\u000a\u000aThe white supremacists in Charlottesville said they wanted to "defend history" by protesting efforts to take down Confederate monuments. They say they feel threatened. They fear the removal of "white stories" from our culture.\u000a\u000aI used to teach African-American literature and cultural history. I wish I could tell them what real erasure looks like. I'd ask them to think about the memorials that never existed in public spaces in the South -- noting Richmond's past as a slave market, or the communities of free blacks who were terrorized by the installation of these Confederate monuments in the first place. To take down Charlottesville's statue of Robert E. Lee will not change the fact that all Virginia schoolchildren know his name, while the names of those who lived in the lost Charlottesville neighborhood of Vinegar Hill are forgotten.\u000a\u000aI keep returning to the question: how can people who claim to love history get the meaning of history so very, very wrong?\u000a\u000aThis isn't the first time people with hate in their hearts have marched in a place I know and love.\u000a\u000aI was born and raised in Memphis -- home to barbecue, Elvis, the blues, and the place where, on April 4, 1968, James Earl Ray took the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. On January 17, 1998 the Ku Klux Klan came to downtown Memphis to protest naming a national holiday for King. I remember the feeling of hate coming home. I was almost an adult at the time, but I wished my grandfather were still alive so I could crawl into his lap and feel all right with the world.\u000a\u000aFar fewer of us in Memphis grew up knowing the name of Ida B. Wells, who was an editor and journalist in my hometown before she became an iconic anti-lynching activist. After three of her friends were lynched in 1892 , she published an editorial in her paper (the Memphis Free Speech ) denouncing the act and urging black Memphians to leave the city. She was rewarded with death threats and a life of exile -- where she went on to become one of the country's most significant (though inadequately celebrated) figures in civil rights, social justice, feminism and journalism.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 'Central Park 5' on Charlottesville Protests Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Central Park 5' on Charlottesville Protests 08:54\u000a\u000aThe Klan marched in Memphis again in 2013 , this time to protest the city council's decision to rename parks named for Jefferson Davis , the president of the Confederacy, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and the first grand wizard of the KKK. Around the same time, a movement also began to erect a monument to Ida B. Wells in one of those parks. Wells' life was remembered locally mostly by out-of-the-way plaques, the kind you see at a glance from a car window.\u000a\u000aThe images from Memphis in 2013 stayed with me: police in riot gear and robed men holding flags emblazoned with a noxious mash-up of a swastika and the Stars and Stripes. Then as now, across the South, efforts to engage honestly with history, to restore public spaces so they are welcoming to all, were sparks for conflagrations of violence and hatred.\u000a\u000aIn New Orleans , Confederate monuments were removed this year under cover of darkness to avoid threats of violence against contractors and workers. "These statues are not just stone and metal," the mayor, Mitch Landrieu , said in an emotional speech. "These monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for."\u000a\u000aEmotions run high on this issue. Nothing in the South is simple. Very little about the Civil War is simple.\u000a\u000aElizabeth Keckley knew that first hand. A dressmaker and former slave, she is best known from her memoir "Behind the Scenes: Or, Thirty Years a Slave and Four Years in the White House" -- a postbellum slave narrative and portrait of the First Family, especially Mary Todd Lincoln . But she had also created designs for powerful Southern women, including the wives of Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis. So close was Keckley to the Davis family, that when they left to go South after secession, Varina implored Elizabeth to join them. The book contains a deeply vulnerable moment between Keckley and Jefferson Davis, a moment which humanizes a man whom many view as the figurehead of an effort to obliterate America.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Warner: Trump's behavior is not leadership Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warner: Trump's behavior is not leadership 04:57\u000a\u000aI have now taught Keckley's autobiography to students many times; I first discussed it in a seminar room just yards from where the men with torches stood on Friday night.\u000a\u000aAs I attempt to process what's happened in Charlottesville, I keep returning for solace to the conversations I had about race and history in those seminar rooms. I mourn Heather Heyer. I know it could have been one of my former teachers or classmates who still live there and who were, like Heather Heyer, on the streets to defend the tolerance, the openness of thought and mind we all learned at UVA.\u000a\u000aWhat angers me most about the white supremacists who came to Charlottesville isn't just their views or their hate. It is their apparent rejection of anything complicated; their lazy belief that history is a zero sum game with easy equivalences. They believe that if we acknowledge -- by removing or contextualizing them -- that many Confederate monuments were not attempts to record history as it happened but a direct effort to marginalize people of color to shape a whiter future, then we deny where they came from. They appear to think that if the world says Black Lives Matter, then white lives must matter less.\u000a\u000aThat just isn't how history -- or the real world, for that matter -- works. History is messy, and at its best, it is an uneasy and beautiful patchwork built from the raw places where the hegemony of the powerful and the resistance of the marginalized rub away at each other, revealing something broken but new. Those raw places are our opening to make progress; without them, we are lost.\u000a\u000aThe alt-right's approach to history, meanwhile, is the ultimate in intellectual entitlement. It embraces toxic myopia, a failure of imagination that has in other eras been a dire warning: the first step toward the worst of human evil.\u000a\u000aWhen these young white men shout, "Jews will not replace us," who is the "us?" Do they even know? I'm a white Southerner too, and I want to understand how they have come to believe that this lazy form of history is enough. If I believe Ida B. Wells is more deserving of public recognition than Nathan Bedford Forrest, does that mean I am trying to erase them? I refuse to believe the answer is yes.\u000a\u000aI don't want to erase white supremacists from public view. Beyond being a scholar and a believer in the First Amendment, I also contend that all of us need to know white supremacy exists in America in 2017 so we can do something about it.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aI can't un-see the images from Charlottesville; none of us can.

The Confederacy doesn't need preserving, and to paraphrase the artist John Sims, it doesn't need resurrecting -- it needs exorcising.\u000a\u000aLast Sunday, members of the Memphis community stood in what is now Health Sciences Park to show support for those who were injured and killed in Charlottesville.

She also said she will not benefit financially from the campaign, and any proceeds it nets short of the goal would go to Global Zero, an organization Plame has worked with that advocates for complete nuclear disarmament.\u000a\u000aPlame said Trump's behavior on Twitter made her concerned that his threats could provoke an attack from North Korea.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVOn a special edition of Amanpour, former New York governor Eliot Spitzer joined Christiane Amanpour to discuss the aftermath and the coordinated federal and state disaster response in the wake of the destructive North American "superstorm," Hurricane Sandy. Spitzer says that politicians of both parties, on state and federal levels, have not made investments in long-term improvements in critical infrastructure that are necessary, but very expensive, in order to minimize the impact of a strong storm to the low lying coastal areas of the United States. Spitzer also points out that global warming was not discussed during any of the recent presidential debates.\u000a\u000a"When you speak of things in hypotheticals, people discount the reality \u2013 after this storm, perhaps, public opinion will be galvanized...the way Katrina in New Orleans helped," Spitzer added. He included his own tenure as Governor of New York, in his criticism that politicians at all levels do not make environmental policy the priority that it should be, due to competing fiscal priorities.\u000a\u000aThe full transcript for this interview will be posted here.

aVFrom Fisher Price toys to the opening credits of "Saved by the Bell," the era's designers carved out a distinct day-glo look that is an unmistakable product of its time.\u000a\u000aBut they were all taking cues from one radical Italian designer and architect: Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aSottsass' short-lived collective, Memphis, was made up of about two dozen Italian creatives. As well as attracting the attention of high-profile collectors, including Karl Lagerfeld and David Bowie, the group's wildly stacked blocks and zig-zag patterns inspired the mainstream designers who defined the aesthetic of an optimistic age.\u000a\u000aA 'renaissance' figure\u000a\u000aBut while Sottsass is best known for his work with Memphis, he spent just six years of his seven-decade career in the collective. By the time he formed the group in 1981, the Austrian-born Italian (then aged 64) had already traveled Europe with Allen Ginsberg, photographed Picasso and Hemingway, built a postmodern New York flagship store for the fashion brand Fiorucci, and helped design some of Silicon Valley's earliest computers.\u000a\u000aHis influence touched the farthest reaches of the design world, inspiring generations of young designers from across many disciplines, according to Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of London's Serpentine Galleries, who describes Sottsass as a "renaissance figure."\u000a\u000a"He was not just an industrial designer or an architect. He worked in ceramics, paintings, jewelry and interior design, as well as photography and writing. He was also the editor and publisher of his own magazine," said Obrist, a friend of Sottsass' for more than 10 years before the designer's death in 2007.\u000a\u000a"It's common for people who make a great contribution in one field to go into different fields. But it's very rare for people to make amazing contributions to entirely different fields. He was unique."\u000a\u000aTo mark the 100th anniversary of Sottsass' birth, Le Stanze del Vetro museum in Venice exhibited more than 200 of his glass works earlier this year. A major retrospective of Sottsass' work -- from both before and after his time with Memphis -- will be on show until October at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's new design-focused sister venue, the Met Breuer\u000a\u000aHere, we hear about Sottsass' work and legacy from some of the design industry figures who knew -- and were inspired by -- the Italian designer and his collective.\u000a\u000aKarim Rashid\u000a\u000aKarim Rashid is one of the most prolific designers of his generation, responsible for well-known creations including the Bobble water bottle and the Garbo trash can.\u000a\u000aI studied with Ettore (Sottsass) for three months in 1990, and before that I was about to leave the profession. But I remember his words: "Find what you can contribute that no one else can in this world."\u000a\u000aHe did really powerful, useful design work. But you can really see his soul within it. The whole premise of Memphis was almost Ikea-like: these things would be super cheap and built out of plastic laminate. They were made to reach a lot of people.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, it was so poetic, powerful and experiential. (His work) makes us look at the physical world in a different way. It teaches us that objects around us can still function perfectly, but they can imbue and provoke such positive energy and spirit. They can also be radical, in that all of a sudden you see a very banal thing in very different way.\u000a\u000aA "Valentine Portable Typewriter" (1968) by Ettore Sottsass, owned by David Bowie.\u000a\u000aHans Ulrich Obrist\u000a\u000aKnown for publishing hours' worth of interviews with the world's leading artists, Hans Ulrich Obrist is the artistic director of London's Serpentine Galleries.\u000a\u000a(Sottsass) was 63 when he founded his architecture practice, Sottsass Associati. So, in his sixties, seventies, eighties, he developed a whole life as an architect which could be (considered) a career in itself. He designed the interiors of Milan's Malpensa Airport, private homes and the famed early Esprit stores.\u000a\u000aIf somebody had just his architecture career, that person would be a very significant architect of their generation. But he is this renaissance figure (who practiced) industrial design, ceramics, glass and interior design, but also paintings, photography and writing.\u000a\u000aIt's almost like the super string theory in science, where the world has 11 dimensions -- he brought all the disciplines and all the fields together in one person. Every generation will find a different Sottsass to revisit.\u000a\u000aJack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez\u000a\u000aA model walks the runway for the Proenza Schouler fashion show during New York Fashion Week.\u000a\u000aDesigners Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez founded New York-based womenswear and accessories brand Proenza Schouler in 2002. Their clothing has featured Memphis-inspired shapes and graphics.\u000a\u000aWe'd love to say that we first discovered the Memphis movement through the context of design history, but we, like many of our friends, really first encountered that particular aesthetic through things like "Saved by the Bell," "Pee-wee's Playhouse," and (skateboard brands) Vision and Santa Cruz. It wasn't until much later on, during our college years, that we realized that this poppy, nostalgic aesthetic that so many of us responded to was actually rooted in a serious design movement.\u000a\u000aIt kind of authenticated our moments of being seduced by things like neon colors, graphic shapes and plastics. It's a look that harks back to a simpler, more wide-eyed and carefree moment in our lives. It takes us back to a time when many of us were first discovering popular culture via things like MTV. As a result, it has a special place in our hearts.\u000a\u000a"Mizar Vase" (1982), by Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aDavid Kelley\u000a\u000aA Stanford professor and founder of global design firm IDEO, David Kelley invented the world's first computer mouse. He lives in a house designed by Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aWhen was I was living in Silicon Valley in 1974 to 1975, I was inspired by Ettore's designs on Olivetti's computers and office (products). His stuff looked quite different from everything else -- it just made me think "oh, you can think of these things differently." Sottsass only designed three houses in the United States, including the one in Woodside, California, that I live in.\u000a\u000aI put together a big book of all the things I'd wanted in the house, and what our lifestyle was like. He looked at the book for maybe 25 seconds and said: "This looks like you want a house for living in the past. Let's design you a house for living in the future." As a worldly Italian who enjoyed life, he was going to fix this nervous American's life by building him a house. I think he did build us a better life.\u000a\u000aDavid Kelley residence, designed by Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aCamille Walala\u000a\u000aWALALA x PLAY at NOW Gallery, Greenwich Peninsula\u000a\u000aCamille Walala is a London-based print, graphic and textile designer whose bright, playful installations mix Memphis influences and African design.\u000a\u000aI grew up in the 80s, and my dad was an architect. He gave me some plates with these amazing triangle designs.\u000a\u000aAt the time, I didn't really know who the Memphis movement or Ettore Sottsass were, but I loved them. We put (the plates) in boxes to keep them safe, and I completely forgot about them.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, I went to the university library and found some books about Sottsass. I was hysterical looking at them. The colors and the sense of humor in his work -- I just didn't know there was already something like Memphis in the design world. I love the architectural shape of the lamps, the toy-like hoovers and the Carlton book shelf. For London Design Festival in 2015, I made (the installation) "Walala in Da House" with Memphis patterns, plates, lamps and prints, which was a bit of an homage to them.\u000a\u000aRonan Bouroullec\u000a\u000aEttore Sottsass, Kachina 11, 2006, in the exhibition "Ettore Sottsass: The Glass," curated by Luca Massimo Barbero @ Le Stanze del Vetro, Venice through July 30. #ettoresottsass #lestanzedelvetro #veniceshows #fondazionegiorgiocini #pentagramstiftung A post shared by Artforum (@artforum) on May 14, 2017 at 6:02am PDT\u000a\u000aRonan Bouroullec is one half of French design team Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec, whose work ranges from vases to urban design\u000a\u000aSottsass invented a very specific formula which (allowed him) to play with heavy, geometric shapes. And yet, his works were always full of sensuality and vibration. He said that, for him, there is no hierarchy in objects: To design an ashtray or a house is the same problem. It is as complicated to do an ashtray. It was very interesting to learn from Sottsass that a good object is exactly like a beautiful person. It's a mix of different aspects that, in the end, chemically produce something bizarre and interesting. A good object is never a perfect answer.\u000a\u000aMisha Kahn\u000a\u000a"Carlton Room Divider" (1981), by Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aMisha Kahn is a Brooklyn-based furniture designer who said that he wanted his latest collection "to do Memphis as if it was about Memphis, Tennessee."\u000a\u000aLavumisa (2015), by Misha Kahn in collaboration with Gone Rural.\u000a\u000aI remember discovering (Sottsass') work in college and being very influenced by its spirit. I think I was more inspired by his willingness to swim upstream against conventional taste than his visual language. I love the Carlton bookshelf -- it's sort of anthropomorphic and feels like a dance party, which isn't often something you'd say about a bookshelf.\u000a\u000aThe shapes and colors of my Lavumisa chandelier were really Sottsass-inspired. (I designed it) at the height of a Memphis revival, and I felt like I wanted to introduce some natural materials to the mix to see how it felt.

aVDaniel Keating is a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and author of " Born Anxious: The Lifelong Impact of Early Life Adversity -- and How to Break the Cycle ," due to be published in April from St. Martin's Press. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) There are new clues that the high levels of stress many people endure every day are taking a deadly toll.\u000a\u000aWhite, working-class Americans are dying in middle age at a rapidly increasing pace, reversing a long-standing trend toward greater life expectancy across all races and social classes, according to a new report from economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton.\u000a\u000aMuch of this alarming trend comes from "deaths of despair," especially opioid addictions and overdoses, suicide, and alcohol-related diseases. To stem this epidemic, they argue that we need to understand the underlying reasons why this is happening. Case and Deaton make a plausible case that "slow moving and cumulative" social forces -- lack of labor market opportunities and fraying of the accustomed social fabric -- are key explanations. They reject arguments that attribute this trend to income alone or to a decline in virtue.\u000a\u000aBut an even more basic cause lies hidden at the intersection of psychology and biology -- a widespread stress epidemic that is affecting this group dramatically at the present but threatens all of us unless we soon understand the source of this trend and take steps to address it.\u000a\u000aStress-related disorders and diseases have been on the rise in the whole population for decades, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including those leading to these deaths of despair, but also to heart disease obesity , and diabetes\u000a\u000aNational surveys by the American Psychological Association that also capture how stressed, anxious and overwhelmed we feel show a similar increasing pattern. And it shows up in our bodies, even before we get sick or start down the many roads to self-harm.\u000a\u000aA recent study by the Hamilton Project looked at the "physiological stress load" in the US using biological markers tied to cardiovascular, kidney and liver function to create a stress load index. This physical stress load, a precursor to many diseases, has increased in striking fashion since the late 1970s, and it is getting worse as each new age group enters adulthood.\u000a\u000aWe should see this increase in mortality for what it is -- a leading indicator of what could be in store for many of us. What social forces are producing the broader stress epidemic, and how do they "get under the skin" to cause long-term damage? One major clue comes from a closer look at the stress load index.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED White working class says Christian values under attack Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White working class says Christian values under attack 03:42\u000a\u000aIt has increased for everyone, but with marked inequality -- it has risen more sharply for those with fewer social and economic resources but also more for the middle class compared to the well off. There is a clear line that connects increasing inequality in income and opportunities, to increases in stress and mortality that hits some groups earlier than others.\u000a\u000aA central biological pathway is from excess cortisol -- the fight-or-flight hormone -- that characterizes being over-stressed for long periods of time. This "stress dysregulation" leads to risky health decisions, like addiction or overeating, and directly to many health problems linked to excess cortisol.\u000a\u000aWhy are white, working-class Americans showing the earliest effects? Surely African-Americans and Hispanics have been experiencing inequality at equal or higher levels over these same decades. The key lies in different starting points in perceptions of control -- stress is largely a psychosocial phenomenon, though, of course, material deprivation also plays a role.\u000a\u000aMinorities have gained some ground materially, in relative terms, over recent decades, but they also did not start with an assumption of being in control in the wider society. Losing a sense of control that you believed you had, whether real or not, justified or not, creates stressful dislocations.\u000a\u000aWe have seen this pattern before. In the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the group that saw itself as having substantial control -- middle-aged Russian men in particular -- experienced a similar loss of control, economically and in terms of cultural identity as the "socialist vanguard." They also died younger, suffering dramatic increases in early mortality\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Type 2 diabetes hitting a younger generation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Type 2 diabetes hitting a younger generation 02:33\u000a\u000aIf we understand what is actually happening -- socially, psychologically and biologically -- we can see that this effect is not going to be limited to just one group in the future. My colleagues and I have reported a pattern of increasing inequality being tied to worsening population outcomes -- not for mortality, but for the health, achievement and social engagement of adolescents in rich Western countries. But what we also found was that this was not inevitable.\u000a\u000aCountries (Austria, Denmark, France, Sweden and others) that controlled income inequality and maintained investments in human development -- such as early childhood and parenting support, education, and social safety nets in health care and unemployment -- did not experience these increasing problems in adolescent and youth development.\u000a\u000aSlow-moving and cumulative social forces "get under the skin" early in life and can show up decades later in morbidity and mortality. The risk is magnified in light of very recent research showing that high levels of stress experienced by expectant mothers or by babies can make fundamental biological changes in infancy -- through what are known as epigenetic changes , which alter how genes work -- that can endure over a lifetime.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThis burden of stress dysregulation in young Americans from early life adversity amplifies the stress epidemic by making more of us vulnerable, and by increasing the total amount of ambient stress we all experience everyday in our schools, our workplaces, our social media, on our highways, in our malls -- in effect, throughout our communities.\u000a\u000aIncreasing inequality and decreasing investment in human development place all of us at risk -- a stressful recognition itself in the current political environment where there is the potential for going even further in the risky direction. Resisting these trends is essential to health, because the consequences will show up for all of us for decades to come.

Some babies are later,'" said her mom, Catherine Tagliareni.\u000a\u000aBrittany never learned to babble or crawl. At 2, she was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder.\u000a\u000a"I just expected her to do the same things as any other baby. It was just going to take her a little bit longer," her mom said.\u000a\u000aBrittany also was diagnosed with an auditory processing disorder and motor-control issues caused by apraxia and dyspraxia.\u000a\u000aShe didn't say her first word until she was 6.\u000a\u000aBut it took three more years for her parents to get a more definitive diagnosis.\u000a\u000a"It wasn't until she was 9 that we heard the word 'autism,'" her mom recalled.

And then if we can get you hitting some balls across the net then I'll put you in lessons.'"\u000a\u000aBrittany was 18 when she first picked up a racquet. With patient coaching and a lot of repetition, she started improving. Her confidence grew both on and off the court.\u000a\u000aTagliareni was inspired by her brother A.J. to play tennis.\u000a\u000a"Before tennis, she would go to a home school class one day a week, and she would not talk to anyone," her mom said. "She really didn't have a social life at all. She didn't have any friends."\u000a\u000aShe would also go into what her mom called "autistic land."\u000a\u000a"It takes so much for her to go somewhere and carry on a conversation," her mom said. "It's much easier for her to go in her room and 'talk to the air,' listen to music or go on the computer and not have to deal with any of those issues."\u000a\u000aBut tennis gave her the motivation to improve her social skills.\u000a\u000a"Girls were coming up and saying, 'I want to be like you,'" her mom said. "And then she was like, 'Wow, this is really cool.'"\u000a\u000aWhen she plays in Special Olympics competitions, she gets paired up with men because she's usually in the top division.\u000a\u000a"She loves to beat the guys," her mom said.\u000a\u000aBrittany also competes in international tournaments through Athletes Without Limits.

"Four years later, she's competing in money events here in Florida with people without any disabilities."\u000a\u000aThe sport has given her the chance to exceed expectations, her mom said.\u000a\u000a"When she was young, you always heard from professionals, 'She's not going to be able to do this.

aVErrol Louis is the host of "Inside City Hall," a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan used his televised town hall meeting Monday to gingerly walk across the tightrope congressional Republican leaders will face this fall: how to put distance between themselves and President Donald Trump without alienating the White House.\u000a\u000aThe goal of this Republican political unity, Ryan also made clear, is passage of a federal budget full of tax cuts for the wealthy and deep reductions in social service programs.\u000a\u000aRyan went out of his way to praise Trump's latest attempt to undo the damage caused by his statements suggesting "both sides" of the recent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville were at fault for the resulting violence.\u000a\u000a"I do believe that (Trump) messed up in his comments on Tuesday, when it sounded like a moral equivocation, or at the very least moral ambiguity, when we need extreme moral clarity," Ryan said of the President\u000a\u000aBut when asked if he would take steps to hold the President accountable by supporting a resolution for censure, Ryan firmly refused.\u000a\u000a"I will not support that. I think that would be -- that would be so counterproductive," he said. "If we descend this issue into some partisan hack-fest, into some bickering against each other, and demean it down to some political food fight, what good does that do to unify this country?"\u000a\u000aPressed on whether he'd go as far as his former running mate, Mitt Romney, in demanding an apology from Trump, Ryan again refused.\u000a\u000a"It is very, very important that we not make this a partisan food fight," he said. "It is very important that we unify in condemning this kind of violence, in condemning this kind of hatred. And to make this us against them, Republicans against Democrats, pro-Trump, anti-Trump, that is a big mistake for our country, and that will demean the value of this important issue."\u000a\u000aRyan's take-home message is that people can disagree with Trump's comments and actions individually, but he won't use the power of his office to voice a collective objection.\u000a\u000aThat delicate balance -- criticize the President, but only up to a point -- reflects the reality that Ryan will need White House cooperation to pass the deep, permanent tax cuts that have long been his core political objective.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED How does Ryan talk to his kids about bullying?

And we are taxing American businesses 35% to almost 45%? That is a recipe for disaster," Ryan said. "The biggest business we had in Wisconsin, publicly traded, was Johnson Controls. They are now an Irish company. Their worldwide tax rate is 12.5%... We're losing businesses left and right. And this is among the reasons why we have to have fundamental tax reform. "\u000a\u000aThose cuts come at a cost, of course. And one startling exchange illustrated how far Ryan and other conservative lawmakers intend to go to pay for the reduction in corporate taxes\u000a\u000aThe moment came when a town hall questioner -- a Dominican nun -- asked Ryan, a fellow Catholic, to square his conservative attacks on Obamacare and other government programs with church teachings about the need to help the poor. Ryan slipped into a familiar right-wing talking point, the false claim that federal efforts to help the poor simply don't work.\u000a\u000a"We're in the 32nd year of (the) War on Poverty. Trillions spent, and guess what -- our poverty rates are about the same as they were when we started this war on poverty 32 years ago. So the status quo isn't working, sister," Ryan said. "We are not solving the problem of poverty."\u000a\u000aThat's highly debatable, and mostly wrong.\u000a\u000aFor one thing, the War on Poverty, launched by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, is 52 years old, not 32. And Ryan's talking point, popular among conservatives, measures poverty only by a family's income , rather than including the value of housing subsidies, food stamps, medical assistance, the Earned Income Tax Credit and other government supports created over the last 52 years.\u000a\u000aIf you only count income, it looks like the poverty rate only dropped from 19% to 15% , which seems small but is actually a 26% drop. And if we apply a more realistic assessment that includes the cash value of those other benefits, it turns out the poverty rate has dropped an impressive 40%.\u000a\u000aBeyond the income debate, measuring the War on Poverty requires taking into account what really matters: whether people have been helped to live better lives since Johnson launched the crusade in 1964.\u000a\u000aBy counting the effect of the programs, the New York Times noted in 2014 , "Infant mortality has dropped, college completion rates have soared, millions of women have entered the work force, malnutrition has all but disappeared. After all, when Mr. Johnson announced his campaign, parts of Appalachia lacked electricity and indoor plumbing."\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aAnd harping on the overall rate of poverty ignores the fact that it isn't the same families that remain poor decade after decade. In 1967, the first wave of government antipoverty programs lifted 4% of low-income Americans out of poverty. Today, thanks to the additional programs that Ryan scorns, the comparable number is 44%\u000a\u000aRyan's remarks aren't just a political debating point. Conservatives who think government has done little to improve life for the poor are likely to try and defund key programs.\u000a\u000aThat's a battle that will be joined in earnest as Ryan tries to pass a budget later this year. Democrats will fight ferociously for the social programs they've created, and Ryan will try to reduce or gut them -- and also continue to tread carefully to avoid antagonizing the White House.\u000a\u000aIt should be quite a tightrope act.

aVPeter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists." This article has been updated with commentary on President Trump's speech on Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The seriously deteriorating situation in Afghanistan -- and what to do about it -- is a deeply personal issue for Trump's top national security advisers and generals.\u000a\u000aIn the months after the 9/11 attacks, Trump's secretary of defense, retired Marine four-star General James Mattis, led the deepest assault from a ship in Marine Corps history near the key Taliban city of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aTrump's top military adviser, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, was the commanding general in Afghanistan in 2013.\u000a\u000aAnd General John Kelly, the retired four-star Marine general who is now Trump's chief of staff, lost a son in Afghanistan, 29-year-old Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly who was killed by a landmine there in 2010.\u000a\u000aFour days after his son's death, in a speech in St. Louis, Kelly said that the United States' war against jihadist terrorists will go on for a very long time. "The American military has handed our ruthless enemy defeat after defeat, but it will go on for years, if not decades, before this curse has been eradicated," he said at the time.\u000a\u000aSo when it came to developing a new strategy for Afghanistan, the generals brought a degree of commitment to the longest war in US history that their commander in chief, at least initially, did not share.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, for example, Trump tweeted , "Let's get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA."\u000a\u000aThe generals had a different view of what was at stake.\u000a\u000aGenerals Mattis, Kelly and Dunford have fought alongside each other since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Then-Major General Mattis, then-Brigadier General Kelly and then-Colonel Dunford led the Marine force that went into Iraq in March 2003 during the initial US invasion of the country.\u000a\u000aAll of them experienced the visceral sense that US forces leaving Iraq at the end of 2011 helped pave the way for the collapse of the Iraqi army in the face of ISIS's campaign in Iraq in 2014.\u000a\u000aNone of them wanted the same scenario to play out in Afghanistan, where the Taliban is at its strongest point since 9/11 and a virulent local affiliate of ISIS has established itself.\u000a\u000aThese Marine generals also know how hard-fought were the battles in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, where 349 Marines died in a campaign that began there in 2009 and ended in 2014.\u000a\u000aNow 300 Marines are back in Helmand because the Taliban have recently regained territory the Marines had seized there several years ago. The Taliban also control or contest about a third of the Afghan population, around ten million people.\u000a\u000aMonday night President Trump delivered an unusual prime-time address from Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia about what his Afghanistan and larger South Asia strategy will be.\u000a\u000aThe well-delivered, well-written and well-argued speech largely reflected the consensus views of the generals and of the American national security apparatus.\u000a\u000aAs President Trump conceded in the speech, "My original instinct was to pull out. And historically, I like following my instincts."\u000a\u000aBut Trump acknowledged that "a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for terrorists, including ISIS and Al Qaeda, would instantly fill just as happened before Sept. 11. And as we know, in 2011, America hastily and mistakenly withdrew from Iraq. As a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorists."\u000a\u000aTrump also had stern words for Pakistan, a common theme of the American military: "Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror."\u000a\u000aTrump also made clear the American commitment to Afghanistan will be conditions based: "A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I've said it many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin or end military options."\u000a\u000aThis was an implicit criticism of the Obama administration's approach to Afghanistan. President Obama surged tens of thousands of additional US troops into Afghanistan in 2009, but he also simultaneously announced their withdrawal date. The Trump administration isn't planning to repeat what it sees as a grave mistake.\u000a\u000aBut he also said, "America will work with the Afghan government as long as we see determination and progress. However, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check. "\u000a\u000aTrump's national security advisers and generals with deep experience in Afghanistan had advised against the complete withdrawal that was Trump's first instinct and also against the notion of using contractors as substitutes for US soldiers.\u000a\u000aBoth these options were on the table as the Trump national security team discussed the options in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aThose options were being pushed, in part, by Trump's chief strategist Stephen Bannon, who was forced out of the White House on Friday.\u000a\u000aBannon didn't attend the final war cabinet meeting on Afghanistan that Trump hosted at Camp David on Friday.\u000a\u000aA decision to use American contractors in battlefield roles would face a number of legal obstacles, not least that they would be subject to Afghan laws.\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, privatizing the Afghan war and outsourcing it to contractors or withdrawing completely were really non-starters during the war cabinet's deliberations on Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThe United States' key strategic goal in Afghanistan is to prevent the country from being taken over by jihadist groups such as the Taliban, al-Qaeda and ISIS, allowing the country to be once again used as a launching pad for attacks against the United States and its allies, as it was on September 11, 2001.\u000a\u000aSo far, that goal has cost the lives of 2,403 American soldiers.\u000a\u000aTrump's top national security advisers and generals understand both the stakes and the costs of the Afghan War well, because they have been personally deeply affected by it.\u000a\u000aIn the end, Trump came around to their view.

Five such benefits may surprise you.\u000a\u000aSounder sleep\u000a\u000aThe headline of a survey by the National Sleep Foundation said it best: "Exercise is good for sleep." In the poll of 1,000 people , those who exercised the most vigorously reported the best sleep quality overall. And they were less likely than non-exercisers to say that in the past two weeks, they had experienced problems such as trouble falling asleep or waking during the night.\u000a\u000aThese findings are supported by a review of 66 studies on exercise and sleep. It concluded that regular exercise is comparable to sleep medication or behavioral therapy in improving the ability to fall asleep, as well as sleep duration and quality.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Tips for better sleep Photos: Tips for better sleep Setting an alarm might be the only thing that helps you get up in the morning, but try setting one at night to remind you when it's time to go to bed.

Hide Caption 8 of 8\u000a\u000aResearchers aren't sure why, but they suspect that physical activity may help by affecting body temperature, metabolic rate, heart rate or anxiety level, among other things.\u000a\u000aBecause exercise also revs up your body, conventional wisdom has it that exercising in the evening can interfere with sleep. But research in young adults as well as older people has failed to support this assertion.\u000a\u000aOf course, everyone is different, so it's possible that nighttime exercise may make it harder for you to sleep. But the only way to know is to try. You may be pleasantly surprised at what a little pre-bedtime sweat can do for your sleep.\u000a\u000aFewer colds\u000a\u000aYou may have heard fitness buffs claim that they never get sick. This may seem like baseless -- not to mention annoying -- boasting, but there is scientific truth to it. Numerous studies have linked regular exercise to a lower risk of colds.\u000a\u000aFor example, a study that followed 1,000 adults for three months found that those who did aerobic exercise at least five days a week were about half as likely to develop colds as those who didn't exercise . And when exercisers did catch colds, they had fewer and less severe symptoms than their couch-potato peers.\u000a\u000aThese studies, which show associations but not cause and effect, are corroborated by randomized trials on exercise and colds. In one such experiment, sedentary postmenopausal women were assigned either moderately intense exercise (such as brisk walking) five days a week or once-a-week stretching. By the final three months of the 12-month study, those doing regular exercise reported having substantially fewer colds than the stretchers\u000a\u000aPhotos: Sweat out the stress Photos: Sweat out the stress Research shows that higher-intensity exercise offers increased mood-enhancing benefits.

The goal is not to achieve a high height for low reps but to jump repeatedly for higher reps with grace and control, landing softly each time. Hide Caption 6 of 6\u000a\u000aResearch in animals and humans suggests that exercise chases away colds by boosting the immune system. At the same time, very intense activities may suppress immunity by increasing levels of the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline.\u000a\u000aThat perhaps explains why, in one study, runners who participated in a Los Angeles marathon were nearly six times more likely to get sick in the week after the race than runners who did not participate.\u000a\u000aThough this is a potential issue for elite athletes or people who do marathons or triathlons, the level of activity among most exercisers -- even if it's vigorous -- is far more likely to keep colds at bay than bring them on.\u000a\u000aHealthier eyes\u000a\u000aWhen you hear about a connection between exercise and eyesight, maybe you picture those eye exercise programs that promise to sharpen your vision. But that's not what we're talking about. Instead of moving your eyes, the idea is to move your feet.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that people who are physically active have a lower risk of cataracts. For example, a study of nearly 50,000 runners and walkers found that those who exercised most vigorously were 42% less likely to develop cataracts than those who exercised the least vigorously. Exercisers who fell in the middle in terms of intensity were also at reduced risk, though to a lesser degree.\u000a\u000aThe same researcher found a similar benefit regarding age-related macular degeneration , a leading cause of vision loss also known as AMD, in a study of nearly 42,000 runners. The more people ran, the more their risk of the condition declined. A different study, which followed roughly 4,000 people for 15 years, showed that participants who were physically active were less likely to develop AMD than those who weren't active.\u000a\u000aScientists aren't sure why exercise protects against cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. One possibility is that it reduces inflammation, which is associated with both conditions.\u000a\u000aCataracts and AMD have also been linked to risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including elevated blood sugar and triglycerides, which regular exercise can improve. Further, some research suggests that people who are overweight or obese are more prone to cataracts and AMD, so physical activity may help by preventing weight gain.\u000a\u000aEnhanced hearing\u000a\u000aYou heard it here first: Exercise may be good for your hearing. A study of more than 68,000 female nurses, who were followed for 20 years, found that walking at least two hours a week was associated with a lower risk of hearing loss . Other research has linked higher fitness levels with better hearing\u000a\u000aExercise may protect against hearing loss by improving blood flow to the cochlea, the snail-shaped structure in the inner ear that converts sound waves into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. What's more, it may prevent the loss of neurotransmitters, which carry those signals between nerve cells. Exercise may also help by reducing the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, both of which are linked to hearing loss.\u000a\u000aOf course, blasting music into your ears while you exercise could have the opposite effect and do damage to your hearing. Noise-canceling headphones are a good option because they reduce the need to turn up your music as much. But don't use them while exercising on a busy road. By being unaware of approaching traffic, you could be subjecting yourself to a risk far more serious than loud music.\u000a\u000aBetter bathroom habits\u000a\u000aThe place to start, naturally, is No. 1: Though high-impact activities such as jumping or running can cause women to leak urine, research shows that moderate exercise may decrease the risk. For example, a study of middle-aged female nurses found that those who were physically active had lower rates of urinary incontinence than women who were inactive. A study of older nurses by the same team of researchers yielded similar findings\u000a\u000aA urinary problem familiar to many middle-aged and older men is nocturia, the need to get up more than once a night to pee. Often, the cause is an enlarged prostate, a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia. Exercise can help prevent nocturia or reduce its severity.\u000a\u000aIn a large study of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, those who were physically active for an hour or more per week were l ess likely to report nocturia than those who were sedentary. Likewise, a study of sedentary older men found that after eight weeks of daily walking, they urinated less frequently during the night.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAnother common bathroom-related problem for both men and women is constipation, which exercise can help improve as well. In a study of 62,000 women, those who reported daily physical activity were nearly half as likely to experience constipation as women who exercised less than once a week. A randomized trial involving inactive middle-aged men and women with chronic constipation found that those assigned to a 12-week exercise program were able to poop more easily\u000a\u000aExercise helps by decreasing transit time. That's how long it takes food to move through the digestive tract -- not, as it sounds, the amount of time it takes to get to work. Alas, a shorter commute is one benefit that exercise may not have -- unless, of course, biking to work is faster for you than driving in heavy traffic.

aVCaracas, Venezuela (CNN) Venezuela has always been home for Carolina Wong.\u000a\u000aThis is the place where she was born, where she is surrounded by her adoring family, where she fell in love, where she became a mom.\u000a\u000aEven as the country descended into economic and political turmoil , she didn't think of leaving.\u000a\u000aBut now she's moving to an unknown land with her husband and infant daughter, packing up her entire life into a few suitcases.\u000a\u000a"I don't really mind leaving material things behind," Wong says, as she sits in a small room surrounded by piles of clothing. "What truly hurts is leaving behind our family that loves us so much."\u000a\u000aStories like hers are becoming increasingly common, with more Venezuelans looking at their heritage and seeking out a citizenship and a passport from another country. Through her Peruvian mother, Wong was able to get the necessary documents to emigrate legally with her husband Jorge Salas and their 7-month-old baby, Akira.

aVHong Kong (CNN) As Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate, lay dying in a heavily-guarded hospital last month, there was little mention of his fate in China.\u000a\u000aFor many younger Chinese, Liu is an unknown figure, the culmination of years of intense censorship of his life and works. The tiny minority who did attempt to express outrage online at Liu's treatment, or commemorate him after he succumbed to liver cancer on July 14 , saw their posts blocked and images deleted.\u000a\u000aOn Weibo, China's most popular Twitter-like platform, users were prevented from posting messages with the words "Nobel," "liver cancer," "RIP" or the candle emoji, according to researchers at Toronto's Citizen Lab and Hong Kong's Weiboscope\u000a\u000aCensorship was also widespread on messaging app WeChat, which was once less filtered than Weibo because of its more private nature. Citizen Lab found that even in one-on-one chats, mentions of Liu Xiaobo's name and photos of him were deleted when chatting with Chinese users.\u000a\u000aSina and Tencent, which own Weibo and WeChat respectively, did not respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000a"The party keeps tightening censorship to an absurd degree," said dissident artist Badiucao, who has launched a campaign to memorialize Liu worldwide.\u000a\u000aWhile Liu's case is an outlier in terms of the intense efforts to wipe out all mention of the deceased activist, it is in keeping with trends in Chinese online censorship that have been building since Xi assumed power in 2012.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED China steps up censorship on the internet Replay More Videos ...

The New York Times' Nick Kristof said in 2005 the Chinese authorities were "digging the Communist Party's grave, by giving the Chinese people broadband."\u000a\u000aBut the Chinese censors have defied their critics, building the world's most sophisticated system of internet filtering and surveillance -- the Great Firewall\u000a\u000aChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to faxed requests for comment.\u000a\u000aThis month saw new bricks added to the wall, as Beijing went after two means of bypassing its controls.\u000a\u000aUsers of encrypted messaging service WhatsApp found themselves unable to send images or videos this week , and analysts reported the app's speed was being filtered or disrupted, making it difficult to access from China.\u000a\u000aDisruption of virtual private networks (VPNs) -- which enable users to tunnel their web traffic through the Great Firewall, effectively browsing as if they're in another country -- has also been ramped up, with both Bloomberg and the Associated Press reporting that a blanket ban on VPN usage may be in the works.\u000a\u000aThat would be an extreme step, as VPNs are also used by many companies to enable secure networking and file sharing between offices.\u000a\u000aPreviously Beijing has tolerated commercial services offered to foreigners to allow them to access banned sites like Facebook and Twitter while they're in China --international hotels in major Chinese cities have also been known to offer this service.\u000a\u000aLokman Tsui, an expert on censorship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it was "possible that some of the newer developments we have seen are experimental in nature, e.g. let's try and float this to see how well it works ... and see what public reaction we get."\u000a\u000aEven if the VPN ban does not pan out, Tsui said, the direction things are going in is clear, and it's not positive.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Is China secretly censoring WeChat?

In Xi's view, sovereignty, not freedom or communication or sharing, was the most important factor in online policy.\u000a\u000a"Cyberspace is not a domain beyond the rule of law," Xi said. "Greater efforts should be made to strengthen ethical standards and promote civilized behavior."\u000a\u000aThe doctrine of internet sovereignty, which emerged in China in the early 2010s and is now driving Beijing's internet policy, seeks to establish a national, as opposed to global, internet.\u000a\u000aInstead of the world wide web as we know it, countries would each maintain their own national internet, by force if necessary, with the border controls and immigration standards they see fit.\u000a\u000aPeter Micek, general counsel for Access Now, which lobbies in favor of an open internet, said Chinese officials and technicians are increasingly working to water down protections for online freedoms at the United Nations and other bodies which oversee internet standards and governance.\u000a\u000a"More and more Chinese engineers and engineers from Chinese companies are proposing and developing and adopting standards," he added.\u000a\u000aTechnical bodies like the International Telecommunication Union, the World Wide Web Consortium and others have huge influence on how the global internet operates, but sometimes with little transparency and limited democratic input.\u000a\u000a"That's one place where quietly there is a more concerted effort (by China) to take control of what the internet actually is," Micek said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the New York Times , in late 2015 Beijing lobbied hard -- but ultimately unsuccessfully -- to remove phrases like "freedom of expression" and "democratic" from a major UN document on internet policy.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Time travel, cleavage banned from Chinese TV shows Replay More Videos ...

aVWe climbed to the top of the minaret of the mosque inside Aleppo's ancient citadel, where you get an amazing view of the entire city. To the west are the bustling neighborhoods that remained under government control during the entire battle for the city. To the east lie the ruins of the formerly rebel-held areas, still fairly empty but with some people coming back, trying to pick up the pieces.\u000a\u000aWe're in Aleppo with the permission of the Assad government, which granted the visas that allowed us to enter Syria.\u000a\u000a"We held out here for years," a Syrian soldier leading us through the citadel tells us. The ancient fortification on a high point right in the middle of Aleppo was also on the frontlines, with rebels attempting to storm it while Syrian troops remained holed up inside.\u000a\u000aThe soldier leads us past the amphitheater, the old temples and excavation sites. He says he spent three years here fighting off assaults. "They dug 10 tunnels," he says, pointing to a hole in the ground. "Some we only discovered at the last moment and then blew them up. We had little food and water. It was too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. But we held out."\u000a\u000aThe battle for Aleppo, especially in its final stages, was among the most fierce and brutal of Syria's civil war. Thousands died and hundreds of thousands more fled before the regime finally recaptured the city in December.\u000a\u000aI remember looking down from the 20th floor of a high-rise building and seeing plumes of smoke across the entire east of the city and hearing the never-ending sound of explosions. When we went close to the frontline we were met with people fleeing the ever-shrinking enclaves controlled by the rebels. All of them seemed tired, many malnourished, the children and elderly often too weak to even walk.\u000a\u000aNine months later there are remarkable changes in the city, but much of it remains in a state of utter devastation, and the massive rebuilding effort that will be needed here hasn't started. Cars now drive easily between areas in western Aleppo that are almost untouched and places in the east that are completely wrecked. The frontlines here seemed almost impossible to breach only a few months ago. Now the debris has been cleared, leaving almost no trace of the former battle positions.\u000a\u000aWe drove through some of the eastern neighborhoods that used to be strongholds of the opposition. Many remain largely deserted, but thousands of people who fled the conflict have returned and are trying to salvage their homes or move into abandoned buildings, many of which are often badly damaged. We saw a small vegetable market, the produce laying on a blanket on the sidewalk with dozens of residents gathering here.\u000a\u000a"We have most of what we need," a man named Mustafa al Bab told us. "We will rebuild and things will improve over time."\u000a\u000aMustafa al Bab says he is a supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and fled this area when the rebels took over. He praised Russia for its support of the Syrian military.\u000a\u000a"The Russians are our friends," Mustafa al Bab says "They are honest with us like we are honest with them. Bashar al-Assad and the Russians are one."\u000a\u000aMany of those returning rely on donations from aid groups to get by. We were on hand when a truck full of bread arrived, leading to a rush, with dozens of people hurrying to get in line. They have to present a ration card and then get a pack of flat bread that will last for one day.\u000a\u000a"We have to keep in mind that life basically stopped here for six years. It has only been nine months since the fighting ended. So in light of that the improvements are good," said Abdul Rahman Razouk, the head of the local NGO supplying the bread.\u000a\u000aSome progress has certainly been made. Aleppo now has electricity almost all day, versus just a few hours only a few months ago. The Syrian government is building power lines in the desert between Damascus and Aleppo to try and make the supply more reliable. More and more areas now also have running water.\u000a\u000aBut the task of rebuilding is momentous when you look over the areas that have been flattened by the years of siege and fighting, where many buildings have collapsed under the heavy shelling that engulfed the opposition-controlled areas. Some people are rebuilding their houses, but most places will require reconstruction on a grand scale.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, the entrepreneurial spirit that has always been a hallmark of Aleppo is beginning to return. We go into a damaged building to find large, computerized sewing machines buzzing inside. The shift leader says he repaired the machines shortly after the fighting ended. For now they are producing a very limited quantity of clothes, mostly T-shirts, but at least it's a start.\u000a\u000a"Everything is difficult. Electricity is a problem, water is a problem, getting the raw materials and the spare parts for the machines. And there aren't enough workers because too many people fled," says Rami Abou Souf, the shift leader in the small workshop. He also left the district when the rebels took over but has since moved back to the area, and he hopes others who fled the city -- and the country -- will do the same.\u000a\u000aWorkers at a textile factory hope that business will drive others to return to the war-ravaged city.\u000a\u000a"I think Aleppo will be back to the way it used to be: as the main business town in Syria. When the people who fled see that business is coming back, we will work together and make Aleppo as great as it used to be and even better."\u000a\u000aThat seems like a very ambitious and optimistic outlook considering the extensive damage done, the number of people who have fled or were killed and the communities that were divided by the Syrian conflict. Still, Aleppo has been bruised and battered many times in its history but has always found a way to stand up again.

aVFollowing a social media backlash over ESPN moving announcer Robert Lee off the University of Virginia's home opener football game due to "the coincidence of his name," the sports network's president explained the decision.\u000a\u000a"There was never any concern - by anyone, at any level -- that Robert Lee's name would offend anyone watching the Charlottesville game," John Skipper, ESPN's president, said in an internal memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday night. "Among our Charlotte production staff there was a question as to whether -- in these divisive times -- Robert's assignment might create a distraction, or even worse, expose him to social hectoring and trolling."\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, ESPN switched Lee to the game in which Youngstown State University will face the University of Pittsburgh. The decision came following the violence that broke out earlier this month at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, protesting plans to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\u000a\u000aThe website Outkick the Coverage broke the story using the headline, "MSESPN Pulls Asian Announcer Named Robert Lee Off UVa Game To Avoid Offending Idiots." The title "MSESPN" derides the network as the sports equivalent of the liberal talk shows on MSNBC.\u000a\u000aThe story overloaded the site's servers on Tuesday and caused backlash from many sides on social media.\u000a\u000aRelated: ESPN under fire for taking announcer Robert Lee off UVA game\u000a\u000aSkipper added in the memo that "Robert was their primary concern" and that "they consulted with him directly" on the choice.\u000a\u000a"He expressed some personal trepidation about the [Charlottesville] assignment and, when offered the chance to do the Youngstown State/Pitt game instead, opted for that game," the memo read.\u000a\u000aSkipper said that part of Lee's decision was "because he lives in Albany and would be able to get home to his family on Saturday evening."\u000a\u000aYoungstown and Pitt are set to play at Pittsburgh-based Heinz Field.\u000a\u000a"I'm disappointed that the good intentions of our Charlotte colleagues have been intentionally hijacked by someone with a personal agenda," Skipper added.\u000a\u000aRelated: ESPN apologizes for fantasy football segment compared to slave auction\u000a\u000aHe ended the memo by saying that he sincerely appreciated "Robert's personal input and professionalism throughout this episode."\u000a\u000aFox News' Tucker Carlson spoke about the controversy and read the memo on his Wednesday night broadcast.\u000a\u000a"I don't think I've read anything quite that dishonest in a long time," Carlson said. "But it reminds me of the central problem with the story, which is how mean is it to this guy, Robert Lee, in the end? They're not protecting him. They exposed him to ridicule. They made him famous in the worst way, and they prevented him from calling a game because of his name. It's cruel."\u000a\u000aOn Twitter, Jim Miller, the co-author of "Those Guys Have All The Fun: Inside The World of ESPN," tweeted "everyone is entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts."\u000a\u000a"Skipper lays down facts," he added.\u000a\u000a-- CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.

aV(CNN) There she is ... I think I see her," an anxious Anthony Wiggs told Raymond Abreu. "With the sunglasses on."\u000a\u000aRaymond was speechless. He glanced at his younger brother, then his eyes darted back to the entrance to the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport baggage claim.\u000a\u000aThe woman continued to walk slowly toward them -- then she froze.\u000a\u000a"Elsie?" Anthony called out, his voice a tone higher. "Raymond?" she asked.\u000a\u000aIt was an emotional reunion between a mother and her sons that had been 46 years in the making. "I love you," she whispered, kissing both men on the cheek again and again.\u000a\u000aAs they hugged their mother, Abreu and Wiggs were surrounded by their children and girlfriends, members of the media, airport employees and curious travelers -- each perhaps trying to understand what they had just witnessed.\u000a\u000aSeparated in Puerto Rico\u000a\u000aRaymond Abreu, left, and his brother, Anthony Wiggs, were separated from each other and their mother when they were infants in Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aMany months of late-night calls -- and a DNA test -- had led to that life-changing moment. Now 64-year-old Elsie Ramirez was finally face-to-face with her sons, Raymond, 47, and Anthony, 46. She hadn't seen them since they were infants. Before the meeting, she had been anxious. "I feel the butterflies ... and felt like a new butterfly," she said as she hugged her sons.\u000a\u000aRamirez said she left Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, in the 1970's shortly after her relationship with her husband broke down. He was in the military and stationed at Ramey Air Force Base.\u000a\u000aSoon after the couple's relationship soured, social services in Puerto Rico became involved and the brothers and their mother were split up. Raymond Abreu -- 10 months older than his brother -- moved in with his grandparents. Soon after that, his father took him to San Antonio, Texas.\u000a\u000a'I think my dad panicked'\u000a\u000aBrothers Anthony Wiggs and Raymond Abreu wait anxiously for their mother at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, baby Anthony had been adopted by the Wiggs family. Marta Wiggs and her family called the boy "Mikey," a nod to his birth name.\u000a\u000aShe fondly recalls the morning in 1971 that her late husband called and told her about a little boy who had been dropped off at the base's social services office -- and who needed a home.\u000a\u000a"I think my dad panicked," Anthony Wiggs told CNN. "He didn't know what to do with me and he took me to someone he knew, who happened to be his sergeant in his platoon, who (also worked) for social services."\u000a\u000aMarta Wiggs already had an 8-month-old boy and said that at the time she felt that she had everything she needed to raise another baby. She immediately agreed to take on the child. "A couple of hours later, we had Mikey in the house too," she remembered, chuckling. "We were overjoyed." By 1973, the adoption was official and the Wiggs family moved to California.\u000a\u000aRamirez said she looked for her boys after she moved from Puerto Rico to Massachusetts and was devastated that she couldn't find them. She said the separation caused her years of pain.\u000a\u000aDNA test leads to breakthrough\u000a\u000aElsie Ramirez meets her sons for the first time in 46 years.\u000a\u000aAnthony, meanwhile, had become curious about his family history. His adoptive mother showed him his birth certificate. He searched the white pages each day and would make a few calls to Puerto Rico, New York and Florida. Eventually he connected with Raymond's ex-wife living in Texas who put the brothers in touch. Both believed their mother was dead. Everybody they knew to ask told them so. But still they weren't convinced.\u000a\u000a"My brother found me first when I was 28 and he continued the mission to find mom," Raymond Abreu said. "He was just die hard, 'I'm going to find her.'"\u000a\u000aIn May this year they made a massive breakthrough. Anthony's girlfriend bought him a DNA test for his birthday. He was able to connect with a large database of historical records to find living relatives who shared the same DNA.\u000a\u000aThe test threw up a match for Wiggs' cousin, Elsie Ramirez' nephew, who he then tracked down. The man broke some stunning news -- Elsie was alive and living in Massachusetts. "I got on Facebook and just started typing her name," Anthony Wiggs said. "I ended up on a Facebook page with her best friend."\u000a\u000aWiggs got Elsie's cell phone number from her friend and left a voice message. His mother heard his voice on her phone just an hour later. "She was actually at the mall in the restroom," Wiggs said. "There was a lady in there next to her who heard her screaming and crying out of joy."\u000a\u000aStill in shock, Elsie explained why she was so thrilled to the stranger and then stepped outside to call her son. Anthony had Raymond join the call. Abreu said his mother told them in Spanish "I always prayed, I always tried to look for you." Then all three cried together.\u000a\u000aMaking up for lost time\u000a\u000aFour of her five Texas grandchildren were at the airport to greet Ramirez when she made her long-awaited arrival recently. They described the experience of being introduced to a new grandma as "surreal, exciting -- and nerve-racking."\u000a\u000aRaymond and Anthony also have seven other half-brothers and sisters -- Elsie's other children. "My brother was like, you know what, let's just take it one step at a time," Abreu said. "Let's get mom here to Dallas. Let's concentrate on her. And next we will concentrate on our siblings. I think we made the right choice. It was too much to handle."\u000a\u000aAfter being separated by almost 2,000 miles, they are excited about starting a relationship together, as a family. They spent their weekend hanging out at the pool, cooking, going out to dinner, and relaxing. Nobody could sleep, so they stayed up late chatting.\u000a\u000aElsie said she is eager to make up for missed moments and stay as close to her boys as possible. "It doesn't matter if we're older now, we're still her babies," Wiggs said as he smiled, receiving another kiss on the cheek from his mom.

WREG later learned the officers were on scene investigating an unrelated assault case.\u000a\u000aBut three witnesses WREG spoke to claim one officer got aggressive with Thurmond and slammed him into a police car.\u000a\u000a"They asked him what is he doing with a stick. He said, 'I'm old, I need this stick.' He showed it to them, they grabbed him, they slammed him on the car, put his arm all the way up here to the back of his back," said witness Niesha Lowe.\u000a\u000aThurmond told WREG he uses the stick to fend off dogs and never threatened the officers.\u000a\u000a"He never raised his stick up in a threatening manner. They roughed him up, they threw him on the car as if he was some young thug," said witness Carl Randolph.\u000a\u000a"They had an old man like this up against a car right over here," added Barbara Denton.\u000a\u000aNone of what witnesses are claiming appears in the citation Thurmond was issued, which a WREG crew saw officers commanding Thurmond to sign around 4 p.m.\u000a\u000a"I've never been in jail in my life.

aVThis week marked one year since Gawker shut down, a milestone that just happened to coincide with another legal threat posed to a New York media giant.\u000a\u000aWhile Gawker's fans and former staff members mourned its demise, Sarah Palin's defamation lawsuit against the New York Times continued to unfold in a Manhattan federal court.\u000a\u000aIn a brief filed on Monday, attorneys for the former vice presidential candidate argued that the Times editorial board "decided to use" the June shooting at a practice for the Congressional baseball game, which wounded Republican congressman Steve Scalise, "as a pulpit to advance their narratives on gun control and political rhetoric." A day after that filing, President Trump delivered yet another withering anti-media screed in a speech in Arizona.\u000a\u000aIt all makes for a chilly environment for those working in the news media. Between the mounting legal challenges and the relentless verbal assault from the White House, journalists may find themselves in a more precarious position than any time before.\u000a\u000a"These are threatening days for the press," said Floyd Abrams, the attorney who represented the New York Times in the landmark 1971 Pentagon Papers case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that newspapers had a right to publish information in classified documents. "Most obviously, the daily denigration of the press by President Trump takes a toll."\u000a\u000aTrump hasn't acted on his threats to change the country's libel laws. But Abrams said the president has "helped to persuade lots of people, many already persuaded, that the press is 'fake' and not to be trusted."\u000a\u000aTrump's insults have helped erode public trust, but lawsuits threaten an organization's bottom line -- an especially frightening prospect in an economy that has seen news outlets of all manner perform layoffs and cutbacks.\u000a\u000aLawyers for the New York Times have filed a motion to dismiss Palin's lawsuit, arguing that it falls well short of the standard for "actual malice" that is required in libel cases against public figures, which is defined as knowingly publishing false information or acting with a reckless disregard for the truth. Jed Rakoff, the federal judge overseeing the case, has said he will rule on the motion by the end of the month.\u000a\u000aIf the Times fails to get it tossed, it would be the latest blow in the courtroom for a news organization, dating back to Hulk Hogan's successful jury trial against Gawker last year.\u000a\u000aGawker, Hogan, Thiel -- and the year that followed\u000a\u000aIn June, ABC News' parent company Disney agreed to a record settlement of more than $177 million with Beef Products Inc., which sued the network over 2012 reports on the company's use of meat trimmings that have been referred to derisively as "pink slime."\u000a\u000aAnd Deadspin, which shared the same parent company as the now-shuttered Gawker.com, is facing a defamation lawsuit from gambling personality R.J. Bell, who is represented by Charles Harder, the attorney who helped wage Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel's legal crusade against Gawker and others.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, HBO was dealt a blow when a judge remanded a major coal company's lawsuit against the comedian John Oliver to a West Virginia court. That sets the stage for a potential jury trial on the state level -- something Gawker faced in Florida and ABC in South Dakota.\u000a\u000a"On the litigation side," Abrams said, "I can't think of a time in recent years when so many genuinely threatening, and in some cases genuinely destructive, cases have been brought."\u000a\u000aThe New York Times is fighting back hard against Palin's claims of defamation.\u000a\u000aBut unlike Gawker, ABC and Deadspin, which were steadfast in defending the coverage that prompted their lawsuits, the Times has admitted it screwed up in the June editorial .\u000a\u000aPalin vs. The New York Times\u000a\u000aThe newspaper published an editorial on the day of the shooting wrongly suggesting that Jared Lee Loughner, the man behind the 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, which killed six people and left former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords severely hurt, was incited by an advertisement released by Palin's political action committee.\u000a\u000aIn a correction issued the following day, the Times said that the "editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords."\u000a\u000aPalin is being represented by Ken Turkel and Shane Vogt, the Tampa-based attorneys who successfully tried Hulk Hogan's invasion of privacy lawsuit against Gawker last year. The Times, meanwhile, has retained Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz, the Washington, D.C. firm that represented Gawker.\u000a\u000aRelated: New York Times editor testifies in Sarah Palin lawsuit\u000a\u000aThe paper has said it intends to "defend the action vigorously," calling the error "agonizing" but expressing confidence that "the First Amendment protects publishers in these circumstances."\u000a\u000aThe piece was originally written by Times editorial board member Elizabeth Williamson before it underwent substantial revisions by Times editorial page editor James Bennet.\u000a\u000aWilliamson's original draft said that the 2011 massacre in Tucson and the June shooting at the congressional baseball practice were both "nurtured in a vile political climate." She wrote that in 2011 "it was the pro-gun right being criticized" over the advertisement from Palin's PAC, which "put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs."\u000a\u000aIn fact, the ad placed only those Democrats' districts under the cross hairs -- but Williamson's version did not include the language that forms the basis of Palin's lawsuit.\u000a\u000aThat came later in the editing process when Bennet wrote, "In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin's political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs."\u000a\u000aAt a hearing last week, Bennet testified that he "did not intend to imply a causal link" between the ad and the Tucson shooting. He said he didn't know at the time whether Loughner had ever seen the ad, and he was unaware of any reporting showing there was no link between the shooter and political incitement.\u000a\u000aBennet said he hadn't read an ABC News story that the editorial linked to or a June 14, 2017 New York Times article, both of which said explicitly that there was no connection between the ad and the Tucson shooting.\u000a\u000aWhat did Bennet know?\u000a\u000aJane Kirtley, a media law professor at the University of Minnesota, said this could put Bennet and the Times on dicey ground.\u000a\u000a"I can't say it would be definitive, but it does raise the question of whether Bennet willfully avoided looking at information that might have contradicted his thesis, and if so, if that conduct violated journalistic standards," Kirtley told CNN in an email.\u000a\u000aA crucial question, Kirtley said, is whether "Bennet had serious doubts about the truth of the allegation."\u000a\u000a"If he did, then failing to investigate would be more problematic than if he did not," she said.\u000a\u000aPalin's lawyers seem to think they have him cornered on that point. "Actual malice is reasonably inferred when a publisher turns a blind-eye to the truth because it has a pre-determined theory it wants to advance," they wrote in their filing on Monday.\u000a\u000aRelated: Could Sarah Palin beat The New York Times?\u000a\u000aAttorneys for the Times argued in their own brief this week that Palin's claim that Bennet "deliberately inserted a lie about her into the Editorial in order to profit from the use of her name and because The Times 'does not like Mrs Palin'...is flawed in both law and fact."\u000a\u000aTimes lawyers also called for dismissal on the grounds that the 2011 advertisement referenced in the editorial was "circulated by a political action committee, not Mrs. Palin herself."\u000a\u000a"As a matter of law, she has no personal cause of action," they said.

aVStory highlights Frida Ghitis: Outrage over Cecil trophy kill went viral, spawned outrage backlash from those who say moral compass is skewed\u000a\u000aWhat about human suffering in Zimbabwe, Syria, among refugees?\u000a\u000aFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for the Miami Herald and World Politics Review and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Of all the stories you heard in the news in the past few days, which one moved you the most? Which outraged you, brought you to tears, led you to action? Which did you talk about with your friends, post on Facebook, discuss on Twitter? If the answer is the killing of Cecil the lion, you are in lots of company.\u000a\u000aFrida Ghitis\u000a\u000aBy now, it seems, most people agree that the killing, apparently for fun, of the majestic lion by a Minnesota dentist visiting Zimbabwe was a perplexing act of pointless cruelty and cowardice. It spawned millions of posts on Facebook and Twitter -- a kind of outrage tsunami.\u000a\u000aCecil, who was apparently well-known and loved in the natural park where he lived in Zimbabwe, died in a most unnatural way, lured from his home and slaughtered. (The dentist, now perhaps fearing for his life, has apparently gone into hiding.)\u000a\u000aThe intensity of the backlash over the trophy killing has triggered a counter-backlash. Why, some are now asking, do people care so much about the death of a lion when so many human beings are suffering and dying? The surge of sorrow for a dead lion, they say, when compared to the relative quiet about other wrongs, reveals a moral flaw in our humanity, a defect in our moral compass.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor decades, the majestic wildlife found across Africa has been a major draw for tourists wanting to catch a glimpse of roaring lions, towering elephants and rare rhinos.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut wildlife tourism should always be a case of look, but don't touch.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor several African countries, wildlife is more than a tourism treasure. It's also a key source of revenue. A recent The brutal killing of Cecil , Zimbabwe's famous black mane lion, has caused outrage around the world, highlighting once more the persistent threats faced by endangered animals.For decades, the majestic wildlife found across Africa has been a major draw for tourists wanting to catch a glimpse of roaring lions, towering elephants and rare rhinos.But wildlife tourism should always be a case of look, but don't touch.For several African countries, wildlife is more than a tourism treasure. It's also a key source of revenue. A recent study by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNTWO) compiled figures from government and tour operators throughout the continent to assess the state of the wildlife tourism industry. It found that the industry contributes 80% of international travel sales to the continent, a large percentage of the $34.2 billion African tourism industry.

Permits to visit a gorilla family cost between $500-700, meaning the forest, home to roughly half the world's wild mountain gorillas, generates approximately $15 million annually. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours The Serengeti-Ngorongoro southern circuit, a key migration route, is another tourist hotspot. It receives 300,000 visitors a year, spending $500 million in total on trips to the 300-kilometer stretch between Arusha and Serengeti, Tanzania. Hide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours Of the countries who submitted data, 14 generated a total of approximately $142 million in entrance fees to protected parks, bolstering the coffers of various conservation initiatives. Around half of operators contribute to anti-poaching projects, and governments are taking steps to counter the elevated threat in recent years. Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours UNTWO worked out that across the continent, the average wildlife tour lasts 10 days, has six participants and costs $433 per day. It also found that France, the UK, the U.S., Germany and Portugal are the biggest long-haul markets for Africa. Hide Caption 5 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours There's more to wildlife tourism than safaris. Although 96% of operators questioned did offer them, bird watching tours, whale watching and a variety of treks also came under the UNWTO's census. One of the most popular non-safari activities in Zambia is a visit to Victoria Falls -- 30% of tourists will make the trip to the 1,708-meter wide falls, the " largest curtain of water in the world. Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours Globally there were 12 million wildlife tourism trips in 2013 (the last full year of data available), and numbers are rising 10% annually, suggesting positive signs for the industry -- should it counter the existential threats to it, such as "the dramatic increase\u000a\u000ain poaching and illicit trade of wildlife products since 2005," which "threatens to undermine conservation achievements," according to UNTWO.

aVOver the intervening 20 years, he's set records on the course and off it with his prodigious talent and immense marketability.\u000a\u000aHe might not have played competitively since August 2015 after undergoing multiple back surgeries , but the former world No.1 -- now ranked 898th -- is finally set to return this week at the Hero World Challenge, a $3.5 million invitational event hosted by his own foundation.\u000a\u000aWoods had previously planned to return to action at the October 13-16 Safeway Open, but withdrew from the PGA Tour season-opener after deciding he was "not yet ready to play."\u000a\u000aAnd, while the 14-time major winner hasn't been out of the game entirely, taking on the role of US vice-captain at Hazeltine for September's victorious Ryder Cup campaign , 17 months of injury turmoil will finally come to an end when he tees off in the Bahamas this Thursday.\u000a\u000aWoods may never reach his previous heights again; aged 40, he's cast doubt on his lifelong quest to break Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major titles.\u000a\u000aBut, given the Golden Bear won his 16th, 17th and 18th majors after his 40th birthday, a revitalized Tiger certainly has plenty to play for.\u000a\u000aAs he prepares to put troubled times behind him, CNN reporters recall the times they met one of history's most fascinating sportsmen.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1997, Atlantic City - Gary Tuchman\u000a\u000aWoods' first major triumph came at Augusta in 1997 when he became the youngest Masters champion in history and its first non-white winner.

MUST WATCH Tiger Woods speaks to CNN after 1997 Masters win 01:20\u000a\u000a"I have long been a sports fan and followed Woods' amateur career. When CNN asked me if I would like to meet Tiger and interview him, I jumped at the opportunity. I believed he would likely become the best golfer to ever play the game.\u000a\u000a"People were very excited to meet him. There was a buzz on the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey where this all took place. People knew he was a young man who was likely to make history.\u000a\u000a"Woods was polite, thoughtful, and considerate. I remember thinking to myself that I hoped he would always stay that way because I was so certain he would be immensely successful and so many people who become rich and famous don't keep the values they had when it all began.\u000a\u000a"Tiger clearly knew what he was capable of at a young age. And I also had little doubt about his capabilities. It is amazing now to look back and know that what he, I, and so many others thought would happen did indeed happen.\u000a\u000aGary Tuchman joined CNN back in 1990.\u000a\u000a"The difference of course is that he was relatively innocent and naive back then. Now, he has the physical and emotional scars that one often gets as the years go by.\u000a\u000a"With the benefit of hindsight, I would ask him if he was concerned about the pressures of being on the PGA Tour and his personal life off the tour. I would ask him if he felt he had the support to deal with all of that.\u000a\u000a"And then I wish I said to him that I hope he has a happy and healthy career. I try to be polite when I interview people and I don't think I got the chance to say that to him as he began his path to fame and fortune."\u000a\u000a2008, Dubai - Don Riddell\u000a\u000aFast forward 11 years and Woods was living up to the hype. Aged 32, he was ranked as the world's No. 1 golfer having won a further 12 majors -- including four in a row between June 2000 and April 2001. But away from the course, it had been a turbulent couple of years. His father Earl passed away in 2006, the sadness of which was somewhat offset by the birth of Woods' first daughter Sam in June 2007. Both events were discussed when Woods sat down with CNN World Sport's Don Riddell in 2008 ...\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Tiger Woods opens up on becoming a father in 2008 Replay More Videos ...

I think he was genuinely excited to be a Dad and absolutely devastated when his father passed away.\u000a\u000a"I'll always remember his reaction when I told him I had twin boys in 2006 'Twins?,' he exclaimed, 'Holy s**t!'\u000a\u000a"I guess my reaction was similar when he hit the fire hydrant in 2009 and everything fell apart; turns out I'd been getting an overly varnished account of his marital bliss.\u000a\u000a"He once told me that he didn't want to be remembered for his achievements as a golfer, more for his 'actions as a human being.'\u000a\u000a"Hopefully I'll get to see him again one day. If so, I'd ask what has been the single biggest regret of his life. Whether it's personal or professional, I think that would be very revealing."\u000a\u000a2012, China - Shane O'Donoghue\u000a\u000aBy 2012, Woods' life had unraveled in spectacular fashion. A minor car crash in November 2009 began a chain of events which led to the revealing of multiple infidelities and, ultimately, the break-up of Woods' marriage to Elin Nordegren. His golf game had suffered too. He won the U.S. Open in 2008 but a severe loss of form and fitness meant he'd failed to win a major in over three years by the time he sat down with CNN Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue in November 2012. And he wasn't alone. A new generation of golfers, who'd grown up idolizing Woods, were now overtaking their hero at the top of the game.

MUST WATCH Exclusive: Tiger and Rory's 'bromance' 09:34\u000a\u000a"It was a whirlwind trip to China for 36 hours. A long way to go, but it was an opportunity to host the first ever sit-down interview with Tiger and Rory McIlroy. Rory had yet to be announced as a Nike player, but the rumors had begun of a multimillion dollar deal. I remember noting that he wore Nike trainers to the interview.\u000a\u000a"That was revealing, but we couldn't really speak about it, as he was still under contract to his other clothing sponsors. Rory and Tiger had both decided not to compete in the WGC event later that week in Shanghai, which caused a bit of a fuss.\u000a\u000a"They were here in Zhengzhou for a big money match and we were the only television interview that they were doing, so it was a real exclusive. I'd interviewed him once in Dubai for CNN about 18 months previously.\u000a\u000a"I'd also interviewed him after various rounds at the Masters, in my previous role for the BBC.\u000a\u000aShane O'Donoghue sits down with Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy in China.\u000a\u000a"Tiger was very friendly. He arrived early for the interview and came straight over to me. We spoke about his other sporting passion, NFL.\u000a\u000a"He is a great friend of the Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, and they had been beaten a few hours before and he was still smarting at the loss, so we spoke about that and how Romo is also a good golfer.\u000a\u000a"Tiger was very relaxed and very good humored. We were off to a good start and then Rory turned up, also in good form. The two had a very natural friendship and it certainly wasn't forced. They were laughing and joking. It was clear that they were genuinely friendly.\u000a\u000aCan Tiger Woods still break Jack Nickalus's record of 18 majors? \u2014 CNN Sport (@cnnsport) July 20, 2016\u000a\u000a"It was a good atmosphere. However, it was very noticeable how Tiger changed the minute the red light went on and we began recording the interview. It wasn't bad or anything, just a very noticeable change in his demeanor as soon as we started. He doesn't really like interviews.\u000a\u000a"He was lighthearted again once we finished and wished me a safe trip home. I hope to interview Tiger many more times in the future!\u000a\u000a"I expect him to return to top class golf, and to win again. We have seen the best of him, but there are still a few more chapters left in his extraordinary story, so I hope to be in a position to bring those stories to the CNN audience."

aVCedric L. Alexander is a CNN law enforcement analyst and deputy mayor of Rochester, New York. He is a former president of The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. The views expressed are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) "The worst part is that people got hurt," a seventy-year-old man caught up in the Charlottesville clashes told the Washington Post. "The police stood by and didn't do a g------- thing." Experts as distinguished as former Philadelphia chief Charles H. Ramsey commented on that department's failure to "have overwhelming force" on hand, and others spoke of the police appearing "outnumbered, ill-prepared and inexperienced."\u000a\u000aAs a former law enforcement executive and the current deputy mayor of Rochester, New York, I am deeply anxious about the rallies extreme far-right groups are planning in cities across the country this weekend. My concern is that the police in at least some of these cities will find themselves in the same horrific predicament the Charlottesville PD faced on August 12.\u000a\u000aIn times of hazard, the police are the primary point of contact between the government and the public -- victims, prospective victims, perpetrators, and prospective perpetrators of violence alike. Quelling a riot is hard and dangerous work, but the even greater challenge is to "be the government" when everything is chaos.\u000a\u000aWhat Charlottesville needed most urgently was the full embrace of their government. The most difficult and demanding police mission is to provide that embrace, and in my estimation, the Charlottesville department fell short and must accept a share of the blame.\u000a\u000aBut not the lion's share.\u000a\u000aIn responding to each call for help, a police force brings the policies and values of both the local and national government to bear. In Charlottesville, we saw the grave danger both the police and the community face when the government's very highest authority, the President of the United States, fails to live up to the duties of his office.\u000a\u000aIn Charlottesville, I believe, this failure contributed to injury and tragic loss of life. It degraded the performance of the police force. My fear is that something similar could happen again this weekend on a larger scale.\u000a\u000aI do not mean to say that President Trump has not aired opinions -- some vague, others inflammatory, many inconsistent and self-contradictory. I do mean that he has time and again failed to articulate unambiguous policies and values. The pronouncements that routinely issue from this White House are almost always supremely incoherent.\u000a\u000aTo many, they are also evasions conveyed through figurative winks and nods. Speaking to police on Long Island on July 28, Trump encouraged a policy of brutality. "When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? ... I said, you can take the hand away, okay?" Police leaders nationwide pushed back and denounced brutality. But the presidential eye had already winked and the head already nodded.\u000a\u000aLaws cannot be enforced and communities cannot be protected this way. Mixed messages from President Trump put in jeopardy the police as well as the communities they serve. At the very least, they lead to a degree of paralysis among first responders. At the very worst, they condone unnecessary force. Either way, lives are put at risk.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has not confined mixed messages to law enforcement; his winks and nods have also been directed toward proponents of white supremacy and white nationalism. He has given us government by innuendo. Who can blame a police department for an inability to enforce innuendo?\u000a\u000aThe tragedy of Charlottesville is that, this time, the innuendo encouraged domestic terrorists. What will happen this weekend?\u000a\u000aAll police officers swear an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is too often a most difficult duty to perform, especially in situations like Charlottesville, when the First and Second Amendments come into conflict.\u000a\u000aWhile the rights guaranteed by the Constitution are absolute, putting them into practice very often cannot be. Both common sense and common morality (as well as judicial ruling) say we cannot use free speech to yell Fire! in a crowded theater that is not burning. And our right to "assemble" is governed by the adverb "peaceably." Assault with fists, pepper spray, improvised spray-can flamethrowers, baseball bats, and automobiles do not constitute free speech or assembly. We have the right to bear arms, and, in Virginia and a number of other states, the right to carry them openly. But do those marching with assault rifles (per the Second Amendment) broadcast to the police and the community an intention to assemble "peaceably" (per the First Amendment)? And should the police do nothing until, armed as they are, their true intention is revealed?\u000a\u000aPolice leaders and officers are called on to make Constitutional judgment calls all the time. Making these is far more difficult when the only messages sent from the top are winks and nods -- mostly toward the extreme right.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aWe don't know how the President feels about these upcoming rallies, but former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke has been very clear about his own feelings toward the President. "Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Anitfa."\u000a\u000aThe rest of us are still waiting for the President to deliver something more than his stunning equation of armed Nazis, white supremacists, and anti-Semites with those who stood up to oppose them in Charlottesville. Donald Trump proclaimed himself the "law and order candidate" and was duly elected. But how can you be the law and order President if you cannot tell the difference between right and wrong?

Logan somehow rolled down the window and accidentally rolled it up with an automatic button.\u000a\u000aHe was reportedly not breathing when he was found and was without a pulse for a significant amount of time as medical personnel gave him CPR.\u000a\u000aLogan was airlifted to Riley Hospital for Children and reportedly showed low levels of brain function due to the time frame doctors believed he was without a pulse.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Logan still had a low-level of brain activity, but doctors did not declare him brain dead.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday evening, Logan was prepped and entered surgery to preserve his heart valves. After doctors thought he would be able to transplant his kidneys to a victim in Texas, they were unable to use them.\u000a\u000aHis family said Logan was breathing on his own following the surgery. At 1:07 a.m. as family and friends sang worship songs in his hospital room, Logan passed away. Doctors were able to preserve his heart valves for a future donation. Lisa posted a clay imprint made from his hand and a foot.

aV(CNN) In their picturesque garden in a quintessential English village in Oxfordshire, Tom and Ellen Nabarro are making mint tea with leaves cut from a plant nearby.\u000a\u000aThey've just surfaced after a late night in London, which Ellen attended almost straight off a plane having returned from vacation. But they are fresh and conversational, with no fretting over obstacles that could be in their way that day -- or in fact, any day.\u000a\u000aIt's easy to overlook that Tom uses a wheelchair. He's paralyzed from the neck down and has been for over a decade, after a snowboarding accident severed his spine. But he lives the way he wants to.\u000a\u000a"I have a very active life," said Tom Nabarro, 32.\u000a\u000aPerhaps it's the comfort and ease with which he moves around his home, the calm and happy nature both he and his wife exude or the fact that both have professions they enjoy. Whatever the reason, the garden hosts a happily married couple with a constant flurry of friends dropping by.\u000a\u000aDisability does not get in their way.\u000a\u000aTom and Ellen Nabarro don't let obstacles get in their way.\u000a\u000a"I can work. I can travel. There's support from everyone around us," Tom said, acknowledging that his road to get to this point was far from easy. But now, they are happy. "I think we have probably a more active life than maybe we would have had before."\u000a\u000aTheir secret: a firm grasp of technology.\u000a\u000aOnline and infrared assistance\u000a\u000aTom's work as a software engineer enables him to know and understand technology that can assist him as part of his everyday.\u000a\u000aToday, he uses eye gaze technology, head pointers and voice recognition to facilitate his movements. His wheelchair also has environmental controls that use infrared to communicate with devices across his home.\u000a\u000a"I control my bed movements, so the bed sits up when I tap a certain button, and I can open the door and watch TV and change channels," he said. "There are not many things you can't do."\u000a\u000aTom inherited his home from his grandfather and it has been adapted for his needs. He moves around it with ease using a switch at the top of his chair, controlled by his head. "I still feel very human, surprisingly," he said.\u000a\u000aTom Nabarro uses a head control to move his wheelchair.\u000a\u000aHe easily gets online and uses voice recognition and dictation to instruct his devices. "I use voice recognition for everything. ... It's incredibly enabling," Tom said.\u000a\u000aThis independence, combined with assistance from two regular care workers, helps keep their marriage strong and allows Ellen to live the life she wants while caring for her husband.\u000a\u000aBut the Nabarros believe that these technologies are just the tip of the iceberg.\u000a\u000a"Full automation would be good," said Ellen, also 32, who works in theater, "meaning Tom can do more for himself and have to rely less on other people."\u000a\u000aTom has even more ambition and believes that the burgeoning field of brain-computer interface technology -- both invasive and not -- will soon become mainstream.\u000a\u000aBrain meets computer\u000a\u000a"I spend a lot of time frustrated that I have to spend three minutes maneuvering somewhere when someone can walk there in seconds," he said. Brain-computer interfaces may someday enable automated senses, he hopes, and machines could understand human cognition and intention and in turn make decisions for you. Then, you "can get on with daily life," he said.\u000a\u000aAs regular -- and somewhat blissful -- as his life may seem, there is room for improvement, Tom and Ellen agree. "I need something that is as good as a body," Tom said. "Your body is a physical extension of your brain, and if your brain is still functional, then you can pretty much still do anything."\u000a\u000aWhat he wishes for is the ability to make turns easily, to drive smoothly on uneven ground and to move close to people or turn to look at them as a situation fits. He believes wheelchairs will continue to be the way forward, rather than more ambitious technologies using exoskeletons. The Nabarros are working with scientists from Imperial College London to help make this happen.\u000a\u000aThey are working on a noninvasive brain-computer interface, without the need for implants, as they believe implants are still decades away from being a reality.\u000a\u000aTh technology they are optimistic about does not require surgery, but instead combines modalities, according to Aldo Faisal, who runs the Brain and Behavior Lab at Imperial College London.\u000a\u000aHe gives the example of picking up a glass: "We can measure eye movements that tell us you're looking at the glass. You can have a computer recognize that you're looking at a glass, and we can then form a brain command and understand the person wants to grab that glass."\u000a\u000aNext would be a robotic hand grabbing that glass and bringing it to your lips.\u000a\u000aFaisal points out that this life-changing assistance can be made possible with cameras and sensors that learn to understand what someone intends to do, and then initiating actions to make it happen.\u000a\u000aFaisal believes people's attitudes and acceptance -- and affordability -- will push this technology and determine the form it takes.\u000a\u000a"Society will drive these technologies forward," he said. "What we'll be able to see in the next five to 10 years is self-driving wheelchairs."\u000a\u000a'I want to carry on'\u000a\u000aThe experiments Nabarro has undertaken with Faisal have involved external technologies, such as skull caps embedded with electrodes that read brain signals to decipher the action someone would like to take. Both are keen on the idea, as it does not involve surgery and therefore there's no time away from work -- or life.\u000a\u000a"I'm not into being a guinea pig," Tom said. "I want to carry on living my life."\u000a\u000aBut many other research teams globally are working with chips implanted in the brain in order to help people with paralysis regain control of their limbs. Closer proximity to brain cells reduces the noise from other brain signals and allows devices to focus on a region to better tap into someone's thoughts.\u000a\u000aThis year, a man paralyzed from his shoulders down in the United States regained the use of his right hand with the aid of an experimental prosthetic that replaced lost connections between his brain and the muscles, thanks to a team at Case Western Reserve University.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, scientists at the University Medical School Utrecht enabled a woman with amyotropic lateral sclerosis to communicate by reading her thoughts, replacing her use of an eye tracker.\u000a\u000aIn an editorial published this year, Steve I. Perlmutter, an associate professor at the University of Washington, said that the research with the paralyzed man at Case Western was groundbreaking, but that this form of treatment is not nearly ready for use outside the lab.\u000a\u000a"The algorithms for this type of brain-computer interface are very important, but there are many other factors that are also critical, including the ability to measure brain signals reliably for long periods of time," he told CNN.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe significant challenges that remain, as well as the need for surgery and monitoring, are why Faisal's team is focusing its attention on less-invasive ways to tap into someone's cognition.\u000a\u000a"If we're looking at technologies where we want to make sense out of brain recordings directly, I think that's a lot further away," Faisal said, possibly 10 to 20 years out and subject to regulatory approval.\u000a\u000aHe also highlighted affordability. "If you put things into the body, it's a lot more expensive, because you need to undergo surgery. If you just pop on a pair of glasses, it's a lot cheaper."\u000a\u000aAs Nabarro and Faisal's partnership grows, they hope it will accelerate the field and bring brain-computer interface technologies to the market.\u000a\u000a"I spend a huge amount of my time trying to communicate with a computer," Tom said. "The closer I can get my brain to a computer, the more efficient I will be."

aV(CNN) In May, a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said young people were staring down a "serious public health problem." But it wasn't drugs they were worried about, or alcohol. It was bullying.\u000a\u000aResearchers have long looked for a way to prevent bullying in American schools, but the problem persists, and no one can seem to agree on a surefire way to address it.\u000a\u000aBut Finland has piloted a program that has seen widespread success in combating bullying in schools. It's been translated and licensed to countries across Europe. But some researchers say it wouldn't work in the US.\u000a\u000a"The United States is a different beast," said Dorothy Espelage, a psychology professor at the University of Florida who studies bullying and harassment.\u000a\u000aWhat it is\u000a\u000aThe program is called KiVa -- short for "kiusaamista vastaan," which means "against bullying." The Finnish government helped fund its development and it's now being used in schools throughout the country.\u000a\u000aIt was developed by educators and researchers at the University of Turku, and multiple studies show it effectively curbs bullying by focusing on classes as a whole, instead of addressing individual bullies and their victims.\u000a\u000a"The idea is that kids bully to gain status and power," said Julie Hubbard, a psychology professor at the University of Delaware who's studying KiVa's effectiveness with American students.\u000a\u000aAccording to its website, KiVa's curriculum uses lessons and computer games to change that dynamic by focusing on bystanders who witness the bullying.\u000a\u000a"If you can get the bystanders to focus on the victim and not the bully, then bullying isn't a very rewarding thing to do," Hubbard said. The hope is that this fosters a culture where bullying is socially unacceptable.\u000a\u000aHow effective is it\u000a\u000a2016 study conducted by researchers at the University of California Los Angeles surveyed more than 7,000 students between the 4th through 6th grades in nearly 80 Finnish elementary schools. About half the schools received KiVa intervention while the others didn't.\u000a\u000aResearchers found the program significantly helps victims of bullying, and data even suggested KiVa could decrease depression in the victims and raise their self-esteem.\u000a\u000aWhy it falls short for US schools\u000a\u000aSchools in the US are too diverse\u000a\u000aOne of the reasons KiVa wouldn't work is because it wasn't developed for an audience as diverse as the US public school system.\u000a\u000a"Finnish students are homogeneous economically, racially and culturally," Espelage, the University of Florida professor, said, "whereas US schools are distinctly diverse on socioeconomic status, ethnicity and religious background."\u000a\u000aAccording to Espelage, the social inequalities these students face -- whether it be race or class -- increase the risks of bullying.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Bullied teen killed herself in front of family Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bullied teen killed herself in front of family 01:37\u000a\u000aIf kids have different races and different socioeconomic backgrounds, other kids are more likely to bully them around those issues.\u000a\u000a"Kids that are in the minority of the school tend to be victims of bullying," Espelage said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the National Center of Educational Statistics , the average racial make-up of American students in 2014 was 50 percent white, 25 percent Hispanic and 16 percent African American. The remaining nine percent consisted of Asians and Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and those of mixed race.\u000a\u000aCompare that to UCLA's study of KiVa, where all but 2.1 percent of the participants were white Finnish students.\u000a\u000aSchools in the US are resource-challenged\u000a\u000aSchools in the United States also have varying levels of funding and access to resources, and the problem is even more evident in predominantly African American and Hispanic neighborhoods where students are more likely to attend poorer schools, Espelage said.\u000a\u000a"Education is local," she said. "There's not going to be one program that fits all. It's going to have to be tailored to the context."\u000a\u000aTodd Little, a psychology professor at Texas Tech University, helped conduct an early study of KiVa in Finland, back in 2011. He agreed with Espelage's assessment of the program, he told CNN. "It worked in Finland but that is specific to the Finnish culture (and perhaps similar cultures)," he said in an email.\u000a\u000aThe teachers are focused on other things\u000a\u000aHubbard, the University of Delaware professor who has completed her trial of KiVa in Delaware, said her data suggests the program can work, even across a variety of races and ethnicities. But the roadblocks to implementing a program like KiVa don't lie with the kids, she said. It's with the teachers.\u000a\u000aHer study has not been published yet, but she shared the racial breakdown of her sample. The children in her study were 49 percent European American, 20 percent Hispanic American and 18 percent African American. Seven percent were of mixed race and six percent were Asian.\u000a\u000aShe and her colleagues looked at KiVa's effectiveness across the board to see if they differed by race. "Largely," she said, "the answer was no, we really did not see differences by child or race ethnicity."\u000a\u000aShe's more concerned with the differences between Finnish teachers and American teachers.\u000a\u000a"Our data suggests that if teachers really implement KiVa it works well in the US for our children," Hubbard said. "But we had a lot more difficulty getting teachers to do it."\u000a\u000aWe don't value our teachers as much\u000a\u000aAccording to the National Institute of Justice , KiVa requires teachers to conduct 10 lessons over 20 hours -- a huge time commitment many US teachers can't justify when they are teaching to prepare their students for standardized tests.\u000a\u000aAnother big difference is the value Finnish society places on teachers, Hubbard said. The "best and brightest" become teachers, and they're placed on the same level as doctors and lawyers, she said. "They value their teachers that way and they pay their teachers that way."\u000a\u000aFinland has one of the best school systems in the world . It requires its teachers to have master degrees and the government provides free access to all levels of education so children of varying socioeconomic backgrounds get equal opportunities, according to a 2015 report by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic and Co-operation Development.\u000a\u000aFinnish students also face no national standardized tests, the OECD report said.\u000a\u000aTeachers in the United States are "bombarded" with expectations, Hubbard said. "They're supposed to do drug prevention, they're supposed to do sex education, they're supposed to do so many things, and bullying prevention is just another thing that's on the list."\u000a\u000aIn Finland, schools placed high value on bullying prevention, and spent a lot of time and energy on it, she said.\u000a\u000aWhat needs to change\u000a\u000aChange the focus of how we teach\u000a\u000aFor bullying prevention programs to work, school districts and administrators need to see that same value, and recognize it takes time and effort to work. "It's not a 30-minute assembly at the beginning of the school year and then you check that box," Hubbard said.\u000a\u000aThey also need to recognize the advantage bullying prevention programs have not just for the well-being of children, but their academics as well.\u000a\u000a"There is such a push on improving academic standards and test scores for our kids," Hubbard said. "But I think that then these initiatives that have to do with sort of social and emotional learning and developing don't get as much attention."\u000a\u000aIn order to convince school administrators to see the benefit of these programs, we need to emphasize that decreasing bullying helps academic performance and test scores, Hubbard said.\u000a\u000aMove away from zero-tolerance policies\u000a\u000aExperts have long recommended moving away from zero-tolerance policies and towards evidence-based programs like KiVa.\u000a\u000a"Remaining evidence-based is really important," Hubbard said.\u000a\u000aEspelage agreed teachers in the US simply aren't able to implement a program like KiVa, but agrees that it addresses what she's found in her research; it's important to focus on "school climate," she said, instead of individuals.\u000a\u000aShe suggests anti-bullying advocates focus on funding research that takes into account the issues of our educational system and the diversity in our schools.\u000a\u000a"We know these programs are good if kids can see themselves reflected in the program," she told CNN.\u000a\u000aBoth Espelage and Hubbard agreed the burden of solving the issue of bullying in US schools is on researchers and advocates.

aV(CNN) A night out drinking in Vietnam used to mean one thing: sipping Bia Hoi, a local draft beer with 3% alcohol content, from a tiny stool on the sidewalk.\u000a\u000aBut feather-light lagers aren't the only game in town anymore.\u000a\u000aThe country's craft beer scene is booming, having welcomed more than a dozen micro-breweries in the past two years.\u000a\u000a"The beer culture in Vietnam starts with Bia Hoi," Hao Tran, managing editor of lifestyle website Vietcetera , tells CNN. The craft beer scene that has evolved has done so from people drinking beer in the Old Quarter in Hanoi or Bui Vien Street in Saigon, he says.\u000a\u000a"But there's so much more to beer culture in Vietnam now than just that particular image."\u000a\u000aTapping new tastes\u000a\u000aPasteur Street Brewing Company draws a crowd.\u000a\u000aVietnam is one of the biggest beer consumers in Asia drinking 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.\u000a\u000aand Bia Hoi still account for the lion's share of that consumption, in Ho Chi Minh City alone artisan brewers such as Pasteur Street Brewing Co, Winking Seal, While stalwart brands such as Tiger, Saigon Beer,and Bia Hoi still account for the lion's share of that consumption, in Ho Chi Minh City alone artisan brewers such as Platinum Heart of Darkness , and Fuzzy Logic are providing a real alternative, says Tran.\u000a\u000aThe brands have, for example, introduced potent Indian pale ales (IPAs) and sour gose -- a tart and salty style of German beer -- to the market.\u000a\u000a"As Vietnam has continued to experience income growth and taste for global concepts and standards, that's where craft beer has really come in," says Tran.\u000a\u000a"The tastes and preferences of Vietnamese consumers are changing and evolving."\u000a\u000aWhat's brewing\u000a\u000aOne of Vietnam's craft pioneers, Pasteur Street Brewing Co opened its doors in 2015 and now distributes not only all over Vietnam, but also to Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong, and the United States -- with Japan and Europe to come later this year.\u000a\u000aFor the past two years, Pasteur Street has been leading the revolt against boring lagers and predictable pale ales -- an effort that was rewarded with three gold medals at the 2016 Asian Beer Medal competition.\u000a\u000aalso behind Helmed by Americans John Reid and Alex Violette -- the latter isalso behind Upslope Brewing Company , in Colorado -- the brewery imports its hops from the US and malts from Europe, but adds a local touch to every recipe.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Vietnam's new brews The usual nightlife scene in Vietnam revolves around drinking Bia Hoi -- most commonly consumed street-side on tiny plastic stools.

aV(CNN) At first, no one believed them when they said the charming, well-liked aide in the nursing home where they lived had raped them.\u000a\u000aClaims like theirs are often dismissed as drug-induced hallucinations, signs of dementia or attempts by lonely residents to get attention. And even when the cases of nursing home residents get to court, they can fall apart when victims' memories prove unreliable -- or they are no longer alive to testify.\u000a\u000aThis time was different.\u000a\u000aThe two women made their way to the courthouse in Waynesville, North Carolina, last week to testify against the man entrusted with their care.\u000a\u000aOne entered the courtroom in her wheelchair, two oxygen tanks behind her, and defiantly described the February night when 58-year-old Luis Gomez lifted up her nightgown. He had entered her room at the Brian Center, a nursing home in the center of town, when she was alone and asked if she needed to go the bathroom. She said she did, and climbed out of bed. As she entered the bathroom and faced the toilet, she heard the door close and lock. Then, she said, Gomez raped her.\u000a\u000aAt first, no one acted on her accusation, and she feared Gomez might appear in her room again at any moment. But when a nurse insisted on notifying police -- against the wishes of her boss -- the call triggered an investigation. And women just down the hall from the resident came forward, with their own allegations against Gomez.\u000a\u000aNow he has been sentenced to at least 23 years behind bars.\u000a\u000a"What this man has done for a period of almost a decade is ... prey on Alzheimer's patients because they're forgetful and they can't remember and oftentimes they die," the prosecutor told the judge during sentencing.\u000a\u000a"In 2016, Your Honor, he made the grave mistake of hurting the wrong woman. She was brave enough to tell, and she wouldn't be quiet until everybody listened. And because of her, that's the only reason that we are finally able to put him in prison."\u000a\u000aAfter a weeklong trial, Gomez was found guilty of raping both women who testified against him -- convicted on six counts that included forcible rape with a physically helpless victim. He still maintains his innocence, and is appealing the verdict.\u000a\u000aWhat should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\u000a\u000aAt his sentencing, the prosecutor said the two women who testified against him were not his only victims.\u000a\u000aSix others have accused him, she said. At three different facilities in the area. Some were in their 50s and 60s. At least one was nearly 90.\u000a\u000aNone were believed, until the woman who was raped in her nightgown came forward. Gomez's attorney told jurors they shouldn't believe her either.\u000a\u000a"He told me I'm untruthful, and I said, no I am not," the victim, now 55, said of the lawyer's questioning. "He made me feel like I was a worm crawling on the ground." CNN does not typically identify victims of sexual abuse.\u000a\u000aThe weeklong trial of Luis Gomez took place at the Haywood County Courthouse in Waynesville.\u000a\u000aGomez's attorney, Joel Schechet, told the court that his client is a "good man" who came to America after almost dying from an assault in Guatemala. "To this day, I would contend he never committed an act that was inappropriate to any of these people making these allegations," he said, adding that had the jury found him innocent,Gomez was prepared to leave the country and return home.\u000a\u000aThe Brian Center paid a six-figure fine after regulators found it had failed to protect residents from sexual abuse. A spokesperson for its parent company said it was pleased the case was over and that it had been unaware of the multiple allegations against Gomez until the police investigation began.\u000a\u000aMonths before the trial, a CNN investigation into sexual abuse at nursing homes had discovered many of these same accusations against Gomez at three different nursing facilities in Haywood County. At least some had been reported to the state.\u000a\u000aBut because investigators were unable to substantiate any of the complaints, Gomez's record remained clean and he continued work as a nursing aide.\u000a\u000aAsked whether the Gomez case would spur change, such as a way to track a pattern of unsubstantiated complaints against nursing home employees, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has said the agency is simply following federal and state laws.\u000a\u000aThey refused to comment on just how many times Gomez was investigated in the past. But in court, the prosecutor ticked off each accusation, one by one:\u000a\u000aIn 2011, years before Gomez worked at the Brian Center, a woman with severe Alzheimer's said he had touched her inappropriately while cleaning her up at another nursing home in town, prompting a law enforcement investigation. At first, she insisted it had happened. But then she said, "Well, maybe I'm confused."\u000a\u000aTwo years later, a resident at yet another nursing home screamed when she awoke to Gomez touching her. She was living in the Alzheimer's wing, even though she didn't suffer from the condition.\u000a\u000aThe following year, an Alzheimer's patient at the same facility reported that he had pressed her "down there." But she said she was "afraid" and didn't want to get him in trouble. She has since passed away.\u000a\u000aAfter that, the accusations started piling up at the Brian Center.\u000a\u000aNursing aide Luis Gomez most recently lived in this house, according to property records.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, a resident said Gomez touched her breasts and told her he wanted to marry her. Another woman, who'd suffered a stroke, told staff that Gomez molested her. She was promptly committed to the psychiatric unit of the local hospital. Within months, a different woman insisted Gomez had touched her while changing her diaper, but said that no one believed her. And yet another said she had silently endured weeks of sexual abuse that left her terrified.\u000a\u000aThe woman who said he raped her in the bathroom was his eighth accuser.\u000a\u000aBefore the judge sentenced Gomez, the victim asked to have a word with him. The sheriff wheeled her up to face him. Then she spoke.\u000a\u000a"The Lord loves you," she told her attacker. "Even though what you did is wrong, the Good Book says that I must love you, even though you did me wrong; and I do. I love you, and I pray that the others learn to forgive you and love you as I have. May you go in peace."\u000a\u000aGomez sat silently and cried, she said.\u000a\u000aShe returned to the Brian Center, where she says memories of her abuse still haunt her. The day of the verdict, she said, was the best day of her life.\u000a\u000aShe was finally believed.\u000a\u000a"It felt like a ton of bricks were off my shoulders," said the woman, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. "I wanted to scream in the courtroom, 'Yeehaw!'"\u000a\u000aNews of the verdict quickly made its way around town, reaching another woman who had accused Gomez of sexual abuse -- the stroke victim who had been sent to the psych ward.\u000a\u000aThe stroke victim sent to the psychiatric ward after accusing Gomez of molesting her says his sentence is not enough.\u000a\u000a"I was glad that people did believe it, and something was done about it," she said, speaking on the phone from the facility where she lives now, many miles from the Brian Center. But she wasn't satisfied with the outcome. "What he did was a lot worse than what he's paying for."\u000a\u000aThe nurse who supervised Gomez and defied her boss by triggering the police investigation said she, too, was also glad the victims were believed. Even if her life has been upended.\u000a\u000aShe said she suffered panic attacks for months leading up to the trial. She was fired from the Brian Center days after notifying police, and she said she plans to sue the facility to make a statement: that nurses will not be forced to act unethically.\u000a\u000a"I couldn't live with myself if I did not make the call," said 36-year-old Krista Shalda. "I could not go to bed at night if I knew I was the reason someone was getting sexually assaulted."\u000a\u000aShe doubts she will ever work in a nursing home again. Facilities are reluctant to hire a whistleblower, she said. She also knows that she wouldn't be able to stop herself from worrying about what could be happening behind closed doors.

aVGorakhpur, India (CNN) Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his Independence Day speech Tuesday with a call for the country to stand shoulder to shoulder with people of the city of Gorakhpur as they mourn the deaths of 68 children in a state-run hospital.\u000a\u000a"In the last few days, our country's innocent children died in a hospital. In these times of crisis, these times of sadness, as all 1.5 billion of our countrymen give their condolences, I am with you all," Modi said.\u000a\u000aAuthorities in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state, are investigating why dozens of children died over seven days last week in the Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College.\u000a\u000aA 900-bed government hospital, BRD serves as a primary treatment facility for 20 million people in Uttar Pradesh and surrounding areas.\u000a\u000aParents say their children were starved of oxygen when tanks ran out because the supplier's bills hadn't been paid.\u000a\u000aThe Uttar Pradesh government said a lack of oxygen wasn't to blame and has appointed a high-level committee to investigate the deaths.\u000a\u000aThe children were suffering from acute encephalitis syndrome, also known as AES, according to India's Ministry of Health. The condition is characterized by inflammation of the brain caused by a range of microbes, typically viruses. In acute cases, patients often require assistance to breathe.\u000a\u000aA scene from the ICU unit (ward 100) at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.\u000a\u000a'It wasn't working'\u000a\u000aBandana Devi believes her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter Shivani died at the hospital because of a lack of oxygen.\u000a\u000a"When she got into more critical condition, only then they put her on oxygen. I held the oxygen pipe and saw it wasn't working. I checked it with my hands, it wasn't working," she said.\u000a\u000aAccording to CNN Affiliate News18, 60 children died between August 7 and 11. Since then, 8 more have been confirmed dead, including up to four on Monday, according to Dr. Kafeel Khan, the former head of the encephalitis ward who was relieved of his role on Sunday August 13\u000a\u000aKhan had been called a hero for attempting to save lives by driving to a private nursing home in a bid to get more oxygen.\u000a\u000aNurses examining the patients at wad L of the ICU at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.\u000a\u000aHowever, on Monday, he confirmed to CNN he was no longer employed at the government medical facility, but did not disclose why.\u000a\u000aHis efforts to find extra oxygen supplies were dismissed by KK Gupta, director-general of medical education in Uttar Pradesh, who has been stationed at BRD since Sunday and is helping to lead the investigation, according to CNN Affiliate News18.\u000a\u000a"Dr. Khan has not done something great by providing three cylinders when 52 cylinders were already available ... there is nothing heroic about it," said Gupta, referencing what he claims was the hospital's existing oxygen supply.\u000a\u000aKhan himself has denied that the children died due to a lack of oxygen. Khan said most of the children's death certificates cite lung failure, cardiac arrest and multiple organ failure as the cause of death. No post-mortems have been conducted, he added.\u000a\u000aThe state government have so far not commented on the claims, stating only that the investigation is ongoing.\u000a\u000aRajiv Mishra, the head of BRD Medical College, was suspended on August 12 after the deaths became public.\u000a\u000aAt a press conference, Mishra said he had tendered his resignation before he was suspended, and said he accepted moral responsibility for the deaths as they occurred during his tenure.\u000a\u000aMohammad Zahid, who lost his five-and-a-half year old daughter Khushi, holds his daughter's photograph in Gorakhpur in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, on August 14.\u000a\u000aHundreds of deaths 'normal'\u000a\u000aUttar Pradesh Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh told reporters Friday that a large number of deaths are "very normal" in August.\u000a\u000aHe said 567 children had died at the hospital in August 2014. And as many as 668 and 587 in August 2015 and 2016.\u000a\u000aThe minister said that, as is the case with many medical colleges, many patients come to BRD Medical College after the first line of treatment fails.\u000a\u000aAn Indian woman looks after her child at the encephalitis ward on August 14.\u000a\u000aOutbreaks of AES tend to coincide with the monsoon and post-monsoon period when there's more water around for mosquitoes to breed. It causes an acute onset of fever and can cause mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, or coma.\u000a\u000aThe condition is endemic in Uttar Pradesh where it led to 3,422 deaths between 2009 and 2015\u000a\u000a'I do not want to stay at this hospital anymore'\u000a\u000aSome of the parents of children still being treated in the hospital are trying to get them discharged.\u000a\u000aJonhai Devi, 63, traveled more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the neighboring state of Bihar to bring her three-year-old grandson Prince for treatment.\u000a\u000aNow, two weeks later, she's trying to get him moved.\u000a\u000a"I think my grandson is well now and the fever will go down with time. There is a local doctor in our village who is very good in treating patients with fever. I do not want to stay at this hospital anymore," Devi said.\u000a\u000aMohammad Kaimuddin Ansari and his son.\u000a\u000aHowever, Prince's doctors say it's too risky for him to leave.\u000a\u000a"How can we discharge a patient who has not yet recovered and the condition is critical," said junior resident doctor Radhey Shyam Singh.\u000a\u000a"We cannot afford even a single death and all the doctors here are trying their best to give better treatment and special care to every child. Prince still needs to be here," he said.\u000a\u000aJonhai Devi is not the only worried relative who is trying to get a child discharged from hospital.\u000a\u000aMohammad Kaimuddin Ansari, 33, brought his son to the hospital from a city 31 miles (50 kilometers) away last Monday for the AES treatment of AES.\u000a\u000aIndian relatives of patients wait outside the encephalitis ward at the Baba Raghav Das Hospital in Gorakhpur on August 14.\u000a\u000aThey don't have much money -- he makes a living as a farmer and carpenter.\u000a\u000a"I want to take my child to some private hospital, no matter how expensive the hospital is. I cannot see my child dying," he said.\u000a\u000a"I will sell my land, my house, my motorcycle and everything but I will save my child."

aV(CNN) Favored by hardened yakuza gang members and law-abiding body art purists alike, large-scale Japanese tattoos are widely celebrated for their distinctive style, mythological motifs and vibrant coloring.\u000a\u000aBut while many of the common motifs are steeped in history and folklore, Japan's pictorial tattooing tradition is relatively new. Before the Edo period (c.1615-1868), tattoos were primarily used as crude markers of punishment for petty criminals or of fealty for lovers, or else the domain of the indigenous Ainu tribes of the northern islands.\u000a\u000aAccording to "Tattoos in Japanese Prints," a new publication from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it was only in the 19th century that they were elevated to the level of art.\u000a\u000aAuthor Sarah E. Thompson, curator of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, traces their popularity back to the publication of "One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Water Margin," a series of woodblock prints by the artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, between 1827 and 1830.\u000a\u000aHis prints, adapted from a 14th-century Chinese novel, saw bandit heroes covered with elaborate, full-body tattoos rendered in impressive detail. The common motifs -- dragons and demons, fearsome predators, koi fish and cherry blossoms -- were laden with meaning, and added another layer to the narrative.\u000a\u000a"Yan Qing, the Graceful" from "One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Water Margin" (c. 1827-3) by Utagawa Kuniyoshi\u000a\u000a"By emphasizing the tattoos sported by some of the heroes, Kuniyoshi's print designs not only exploited the allure of the exotic but also provided a titillating hint of the illicit -- especially if the suggestion that pictorial tattoos in Japan had been outlaws and spread to fashionable urbanites is correct," Thompson writes.\u000a\u000aThe impact of the "Water Margin" series and similar works from Kuniyoshi and his contemporaries was immediate and broad-reaching. Men across class lines requested tattoos of scenes from "Water Margins" -- and, in some cases, the characters' tattoos. Textile artists started incorporating tattoo-like prints into their designs; kabuki stars painted simple designs onto their skin for performances.\u000a\u000a(The tattoos did have their detractors, however. In 1872, as Japan started its push toward Westernization, tattoos were banned by the Japanese government, who considered them uncivilized and old-fashioned. This ban was lifted after the American occupation after WWII.)\u000a\u000a"It is uncertain whether Kuniyoshi was responding to a recent craze for extensive pictorial tattoos, or whether -- as suggested by oral tradition among present-day tattoo artists -- it was the prints themselves that inspired the new fashion," Thompson writes.\u000a\u000a"Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between: large tattoos were already beginning to appear, but it was Kuniyoshi who transformed a temporary fad into a lasting art form."

aV(CNN) Venezuelan security forces have used excessive force and arbitrarily detained thousands of people over months of sometimes deadly anti-regime protests, the UN's human rights office said Tuesday, citing interviews with demonstrators and witnesses.\u000a\u000a"Witness accounts suggest that security forces ... have systematically used disproportionate force to instill fear, crush dissent and to prevent demonstrators from assembling, rallying and reaching public institutions to present petitions," the UN office said.\u000a\u000aMore than 120 people have died in protest-linked incidents since spring as critics accused leftist President Nicolas Maduro of illegitimately consolidating power, including stacking the Supreme Court with loyalists and holding an election for a new legislative assembly packed virtually with only his backers.\u000a\u000a"The responsibility for the human rights violations we are recording lies at the highest levels of government," UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said.\u000a\u000aAmong the team's findings:\u000a\u000a-- Security forces allegedly are responsible at least 46 deaths. Other, pro-government armed groups are accused of being responsible for 27 deaths. The UN report said it does not have details for all the deaths.\u000a\u000a-- Some demonstrators have attacked security officers; eight officers have been killed during the demonstrations.\u000a\u000a-- Pro-government armed groups "routinely break into protests on motorcycles, wielding firearms and harassing or in some cases shooting at people."\u000a\u000a-- Security forces fired tear gas and buckshot and anti-regime demonstrators without warning. Several interviewees "said tear gas canisters were used at short range, and marbles, buckshot and nuts and bolts were used as ammunition."\u000a\u000a-- More than 5,000 people have been arbitrarily detained, and more than 1,000 reportedly still are in detention.\u000a\u000a-- In several cases, "there were credible reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by security forces of such detainees, amounting in several cases to torture" -- including electric shocks, beatings and threats of killings.\u000a\u000aVenezuela's ministry of communication didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment about the UN report. Government officials have said anti-regime protesters were responsible for criminal violence fomented by opposition leaders.\u000a\u000aThe UN office said it interviewed 135 people -- including victims, their families and witnesses -- remotely from June 6 to July 31. Venezuelan authorities did not respond to the team's request for access, the office said.\u000a\u000a"I call on all parties to work towards a solution to the rapidly worsening tensions in the country, to renounce the use of violence and to take steps towards meaningful political dialogue," Zeid said.\u000a\u000aConstituent Assembly\u000a\u000aThe UN report comes days after a controversial new legislature, the Constituent Assembly, took power.\u000a\u000aThe new assembly was created in a July 30 national vote orchestrated by Maduro and boycotted by the opposition.\u000a\u000aFilled with Maduro supporters, it is expected to eventually take the place of the opposition-led National Assembly in a move that critics fear will erode democracy, and is expected to rewrite the Constitution at Maduro's behest.\u000a\u000aConstituent Assembly leader Delcy Rodriguez said a "truth, justice and peace commission" will investigate the violence in the country in the past few months, and warned that "justice will come" to some members of the opposition.\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, the Constituent Assembly unanimously fired Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz, a Maduro critic. The Supreme Court said she would be investigated for what it called serious violations and offenses.\u000a\u000aOrtega has called the Constituent Assembly's election illegal, and said she would continue to be attorney general.\u000a\u000aBoth the Constituent Assembly and the National Assembly met Tuesday in separate chambers of the legislative palace in the capital, Caracas. That raised prospects that two camps may claim to be the country's legitimate government\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Venezuelan authorities say a manhunt is underway after an anti-government paramilitary attack at a military barracks in the northwestern city of Valencia early Sunday.\u000a\u000aTwenty people attacked the barracks; two were shot dead, one was injured and is recovering in a hospital and seven people were arrested, according to Minister of Communication Ernesto Villegas.\u000a\u000aTen others fled when the gunfight began, and are being hunted down.\u000a\u000aLatin American foreign ministers meet\u000a\u000aMost countries around the world have called the July 30 vote fraudulent and say the new assembly is a sign of a dictatorship.\u000a\u000aThe United States and other nations slapped sanctions on Maduro and other government officials after the vote.\u000a\u000aForeign ministers of 12 nations in the Americas met in Lima, Peru, on Tuesday to discuss the "critical situation in Venezuela" and to explore ways to achieve a "peaceful and negotiated" outcome. Among the countries represented were Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe ministers condemned the break of the democratic order in Venezuela and said their countries wouldn't recognize the Constituent Assembly.

aV(CNN) If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox.\u000a\u000aBut whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating.\u000a\u000aIn fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar.\u000a\u000aBut there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin.\u000a\u000a"Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old," said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of "The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great." "What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging."\u000a\u000aSugar addiction\u000a\u000aHere's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. "People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar," Alpert said. "We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Why sugar intake has increased Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why sugar intake has increased 02:52\u000a\u000aAbout 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff.\u000a\u000a"People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aHow to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three days\u000a\u000aThe good news is that even if you're not a true sugar "addict," by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance.\u000a\u000a"There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets," Lustig said.\u000a\u000aChildren can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed.\u000a\u000aBut going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.\u000a\u000a"Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clichéd and not effective," Alpert said. "It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.\u000a\u000a"What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate," she said. "They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to."\u000a\u000aSo for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. "You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats."\u000a\u000aFor example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.\u000a\u000aThough they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. "These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aConsuming artificial sweeteners causes "you not only (to) store more fat," Lustig explained, "you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage."\u000a\u000aHow to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candy\u000a\u000aOnce the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple.\u000a\u000a"By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy," Alpert said. "The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again."\u000a\u000aStarting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. "Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aYou can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too.\u000a\u000aDuring week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.\u000a\u000aFor week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.\u000a\u000a"Week three should be quite livable," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aWeek four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week.\u000a\u000a"You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier," Alpert said. "I want people living. Week four is the way to do it."\u000a\u000aWeek four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. "Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one," Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days.\u000a\u000a"The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aBenefits and cautions with slashing sugar\u000a\u000aDetoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. "We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction," Alpert said. "Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!"\u000a\u000aParticipants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Natural sweeteners Photos: Natural sweeteners Although maple syrup contains some vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the amounts in a typical serving are quite small. One tablespoon provides about 1% of your daily needs for calcium, potassium and iron. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Natural sweeteners Honey has been shown to possess small amounts of nutrients, antioxidants and antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory compounds.

Plus, it has been shown to have higher antioxidant levels than any other sweetener. Hide Caption 5 of 5\u000a\u000a"I have lost approximately 40 pounds following the sugar detox," said Diane, who preferred not to share her last name. She has been on the plan for approximately two years.\u000a\u000a"I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes."\u000a\u000aDiane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. "This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal."\u000a\u000aThere are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive.\u000a\u000a"Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue," Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided.\u000a\u000a"If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit. But if you can push through and stay well-hydrated, you can really break your cycle of sugar addiction," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIt's important to note that the plan may not be appropriate for diabetics, extreme athletes or anyone taking medication to control blood sugar. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.\u000a\u000aFinally, before starting a sugar detox, enlist the help of friends and/or family members for support. "You need people around you to help you be successful," Lustig said. "The whole family has to do it together."

aV(CNN) The Canadian pastor who released from a North Korean prison camp has recounted the privations he suffered during two and a half years of hard labor.\u000a\u000aWearing a dark suit, with his hair cropped short, Hyeon Soo Lim told his Ontario church Sunday that it was "difficult to see when and how the entire ordeal would end," according to a copy of his address obtained by CNN.\u000a\u000aLim was detained in February 2015 and "released on sick bail" last week , according to state-run news agency KCNA. Lim had been serving a life sentence of hard labor after being convicted of crimes against the state.\u000a\u000aThe 62-year-old's health had deteriorated while in North Korean custody and the pastor has experienced "dramatic" weight loss, according to family spokeswoman Lisa Pak.\u000a\u000aTwo years, seven months of solitude\u000a\u000aLim told his congregation at the Light Presbyterian Church in Missassauga, Ontario, of the overwhelming loneliness he felt during his time in North Korea detention.\u000a\u000a"From the first day of my detainment until the day I was released, I ate 2,757 meals in isolation by myself," he said. "It was difficult to see when and how the entire ordeal would end."\u000a\u000aLim said he was also forced to endure back-breaking labor, six days a week, including digging square meter holes for planting trees.\u000a\u000a"The mud was so hard that it took two days to dig one hole," he said.\u000a\u000a"It was incredibly challenging. My upper body was sweating; my fingers and toes were frostbitten."\u000a\u000aHe also said that he was forced to break up frozen coal inside a coal storage facility. The summer months were just as painful, as he was required to work outside in the scorching heat.\u000a\u000aThe extreme conditions took a severe toll on his health, and he lost almost a third of his body weight. He said he was admitted to hospital four times during his time in prison.\u000a\u000aLim veered from his prepared remarks several times while addressing the congregation, telling them that he didn't know he was going to be released until 15 minutes beforehand, and that he was certain that his Canadian citizenship played a huge role in the commutation of his initial sentence -- from death to hard labor -- and also in his release.\u000a\u000aLim is greeted by members of his congregation at the Light Korean Presbyterian Church.\u000a\u000aHard labor\u000a\u000aIn a January 2016 interview with CNN in Pyongyang , Lim said he was the sole prisoner in a labor camp. He told CNN he received regular medical care and three meals per day.\u000a\u000aLim was arrested by North Korean authorities while on a humanitarian mission in Rajin, North Korea, a family spokesperson said at the time. He was acting on behalf of the Light Korean Presbyterian Church, which he had led since 1986.\u000a\u000aAccording to his family, Lim has made more than 100 trips to North Korea since 1997, and his humanitarian efforts have included the founding by his church of a nursery, orphanage, and nursing home in the northeastern city of Rajin.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, Lim's son James received word that a plane carrying senior Canadian officials, a medical doctor, and a letter to North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un was dispatched to Pyongyang "at the last minute," Pak said.\u000a\u000aRatcheted tensions\u000a\u000aLim's release comes at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula.\u000a\u000aThe US and North Korea have been engaged in increasingly threatening rhetoric during the past week.\u000a\u000aNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has finished reviewing a plan to fire four missiles into the water off Guam , and has opted to wait to see what the "foolish Yankees" do next.\u000a\u000aThe comments, published in state media Tuesday, came hours after US Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned that if North Korea fired on US territory it would be "game on."\u000a\u000aLeft behind\u000a\u000aAt least three US citizens remain in North Korean custody.\u000a\u000aBusinessman Kim Dong-chul was detained in October 2015 and is serving a 10-year sentence for espionage.\u000a\u000aKim Sang-duk, an academic also known as Tony Kim, was detained in April and is accused of "hostile criminal acts," and researcher Kim Hak-song was detained in May and is also accused of "hostile acts."

aVLondon (CNN) One was a basketball fanatic who became an international soccer star.\u000a\u000aThe other dreamed of being a football great, and is bound for basketball's Hall of Fame.\u000a\u000aSteve Nash and Owen Hargreaves are two of Canada's greatest sporting exports who made their names on opposite sides of the Atlantic.\u000a\u000aBut through a passion for each other's sports -- along with kindred, crisscrossing pasts -- the two have formed a sporting bromance for the ages.\u000a\u000aHargreaves, the younger of the two, was a scrappy high school point guard who dreamed of playing for the Chicago Bulls, while Nash was so crafty with his feet that he was named British Columbia's most valuable high school soccer player as a lanky 16-year-old.\u000a\u000aYet it was Nash, of course, who would blossom into the NBA's two-time Most Valuable Player with the Phoenix Suns, while Hargreaves was winning bookend European titles with Bayern Munich and Manchester United.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Steve Nash: Hoops magician, footie addict Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Steve Nash: Hoops magician, footie addict 03:25\u000a\u000aTwo sides of the same coin\u000a\u000aAlthough the two met only after their careers took off, both standouts grew up in Western Canada as sports-obsessed sons of English soccer players.\u000a\u000aNash made his NBA mark in 1998, as a dynamic counterpart to Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas. It was during his six-year spell in Texas that he heard about a young Canadian soccer player who was making waves in Germany, and through a mutual family friend invited him to attend a Mavs game.\u000a\u000aHargreaves, who like Nash is a dual British-Canadian citizen, was breaking into the England squad and reciprocated with World Cup tickets.\u000a\u000a"I would have loved to have been Steve, because I would have loved to have been an NBA player," Hargreaves told CNN before this year's annual NBA game in London, where the 35-year-old soccer television analyst is a fixture.\u000a\u000a"We connected because we are basically opposites: I grew up in a football family, but wanted to be a basketball player," he explains, noting that he wore number 23 on his jersey throughout his career at Bayern in honor of his hero Michael Jordan.\u000a\u000aBorn to British parents and raised in Western Canada, Nash (L) and Hargreaves achieved greatness in two improbable sports.\u000a\u000aNash, in turn, says he found inspiration in watching soccer players excel during his 18-season Hall of Fame career, which ended last year.\u000a\u000a"I was a big fan of Owen's," the 42-year-old Nash tells CNN. "Obviously, it was phenomenal to hear of a Canadian kid who was making the ranks of Bayern Munich.\u000a\u000a"To watch him go on to Manchester United and win Champions Leagues in both countries, and to have the career that he did representing England ... It was thrilling for all of us Canadians."\u000a\u000aNash even tried to recruit Hargreaves to play for the Vancouver Whitecaps, the MLS team he partially owns, towards the end of the midfielder's career -- which was cut short by knee injuries.\u000a\u000aBut Hargreaves preferred to stay in England, launching stalled comebacks with Manchester United and Manchester City before retiring at 31.\u000a\u000a"The thing I like about Steve is he was such an amazing athlete, but he's such a great guy as well," Hargreaves reciprocates. "I like that people can be big stars and still be humble. Steve was a great example."\u000a\u000aSoccer fanaticism\u000a\u000aIt's no secret that Nash is equally as enamored with soccer as Hargreaves is with hoops.\u000a\u000aAs a fan he watches a lot more footie than he does basketball, even though he is contracted with the Golden State Warriors as a special consultant and is the general manager of Canada's men's team.\u000a\u000aA quick skim through Nash's Instagram feed confirms his soccer obsession.\u000a\u000aHe stars in a Venice Beach league which features the likes of ex-pros Alessandro Del Piero and Landon Donovan, organizes a celebrity charity game in New York going on its 10th year, trains with his beloved Tottenham Hotspur, and rubs shoulders with the likes of Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry.\u000a\u000aNash is a regular at White Hart Lane, home of Tottenham Hotspur. As a youth player, he chose to stay in Canada rather than try out for his family's beloved team.\u000a\u000aNash has also taken his role as a club owner a step further with an active investment in Spanish second division team Real Mallorca.\u000a\u000aThe resident of Manhattan Beach, California has made several trips to the Mediterranean island, known more as the birthplace of tennis ace Rafael Nadal.\u000a\u000a"We love the sport. We have fallen in love with the history of the club and the fans," Nash says on behalf of his investment group, led by Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver.\u000a\u000a"This is something that we are passionate about and want to see succeed."\u000a\u000aDespite his involvement in the club's boardroom, it's hard not to wonder whether something gnaws at Nash for diverting from the path of Hargreaves, or his own brother Martin, who made 38 appearances for the Canadian national team and captained the Whitecaps.\u000a\u000a"The competitor in me thinks that if I dedicated myself the way I did with basketball, I could have been a professional (soccer) player," he says, although he still can't quite admit that the ship has already sailed.\u000a\u000a"The dream is still alive; I'm not going to give up on it just yet," he says, perhaps reconsidering his teenage decision to spurn an offer to join Canada's national under-17 soccer team.\u000a\u000aBy his own admission, Hargreaves -- who is generously listed at 5 foot 11 inches to Nash's 6 foot 3 -- says Nash was a far better soccer prospect than he was on the hardwood.\u000a\u000aHe assesses a young Nash's chances of making it in the English Premier League as high, though "not as a two-time MVP-level player."\u000a\u000aUnlikely path in an unlikely sport\u000a\u000aAs a 12-year-old, Nash showed enough promise that his father John, a former professional in South Africa, offered to send him to live with his aunt in London to latch on to the youth club at Tottenham.\u000a\u000aBut Nash, who was also exceptional in hockey and baseball, found the prospect of moving to a strange city too daunting. Instead, he switched to a new school in Victoria and joined the other jocks playing pickup hoops.\u000a\u000a"Really, I started playing basketball for social reasons," he recalls. But Nash's hyper-competitiveness soon took over and he outgrew his surroundings.\u000a\u000aAt 16 he told his coach at Mount Douglas Secondary School that he was aiming for a scholarship to an American Division I college program, only to be informed he needed to "readjust his goals," according to the book "Steve Nash: The Making of an MVP."\u000a\u000aNash switched schools instead.\u000a\u000aAlthough league rules forced him to sit out a season, he returned as a senior and averaged a near-triple-double at St. Michaels University School. Still, the skinny Canadian kid was rejected by nearly every Division I program he approached.\u000a\u000aOnly tiny Santa Clara University offered Nash a full scholarship, and was rewarded by big-time upsets over UCLA and Arizona. Nash would lead his conference in scoring and assists, before being picked just two slots behind Kobe Bryant in the 1996 NBA Draft\u000a\u000aNash's past, he says, made all those no-look passes for easy buckets possible.\u000a\u000a"In soccer, you already have to know what you are doing before the ball comes to you, so you've calculated your options," he explains. "A lot of kids growing up playing basketball, they don't think like that. They have the ball, then they survey.\u000a\u000a"I think it gave me an advantage to have seen thousands of angles, and players moving, and reading defenses, and making decisions on the soccer field."\u000a\u000a'You did what your Dad did'\u000a\u000aHargreaves, meanwhile, credits fighting for a spot on his high school basketball team for later asserting himself in an unfamiliar sport.\u000a\u000aHis father Colin played soccer semi-professionally in Calgary, and brother Darren was set to play for English team Bolton Wanderers before tearing up his knee, leaving young Owen as the next big hope.\u000a\u000a"I played soccer because my Dad played, and you did what your Dad did," he shrugs.\u000a\u000aHargreaves cared so little for the sport, in fact, that he didn't even have a favorite team. "It wasn't on TV at the time," he recalls, "so I watched basketball."\u000a\u000aGrowing up in Alberta, where it was so cold he could only practice soccer twice a week, Hargreaves hit the indoor basketball courts for five hours a day instead.\u000a\u000aAs an undersized point guard, he struggled at first -- "I wasn't very good at it; I could barely shoot," he confesses -- but earned respectability on the court.\u000a\u000a"Because I worked so hard at getting good at basketball, when I took that competitiveness and applied it to soccer -- where I was more naturally gifted -- it actually helped me so much," he says, sounding a lot like Nash.\u000a\u000aAlthough Hargreaves became a star at Bayern Munich, he played a big part in Manchester United's 2008 Premier League and Champions League titles.\u000a\u000aGiven that Hargreaves only began playing soccer competitively at 15, it's remarkable that just one year later he landed a spot on Bayern's youth team and moved to Germany.\u000a\u000aAs a 19-year-old, he debuted as one of the first three Canadians -- all on the same day -- to ever play in the Bundesliga. He is also one of only seven English players to have played in Germany's top division.\u000a\u000a"Listen, I never expected to be a professional soccer player -- never in a million years -- because it just wasn't possible really," Hargreaves says.\u000a\u000a"And then you just go over one hurdle. And then you go over another one, and another one, and it just builds up your confidence."\u000a\u000aHargreaves' "welcome to world football" moment took place that rookie year when he stripped the ball from Real Madrid star Luis Figo, who he idolized.\u000a\u000a"I remember thinking 'It's Luis Figo, he's going to kill me,'" he says. "That gave me more confidence than anything I had ever had, because I realized he's actually just like me."\u000a\u000aIn many ways, he could say the same about Nash. Through the most improbable mirroring turns, both athletes took their dreams to the highest levels in sports which came secondary to them.\u000a\u000aThese days, Hargreaves seems content with watching his Chicago Bulls from afar as an NBA superfan, while Nash is giving soccer one more go from the owners' box.\u000a\u000aThe dream, as he says, is still very much alive.\u000a\u000aCorrects to reflect that Steve Nash is not yet in the Hall of Fame. He will be eligible for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.

He will be dearly missed by so many," Estey said in a statement to CNN.\u000a\u000aIn addition to his work on TV, many know Thomas from his annual holiday season appearance on "The Late Show with David Letterman," where he'd retell what Letterman once called "the greatest talk show story of all time."\u000a\u000aThe colorful anecdote involved Thomas giving a ride to a costumed Clayton Moore, star of TV's "The Lone Ranger," and getting involved in a minor car crash that escalated into more.\u000a\u000a"I loved Jay," Letterman told CNN in a statement. "His Lone Ranger story was the best I heard in 30 years. Plus, nobody could throw a football like Jay. Maybe Tina Fey, maybe. My heart goes out to his family."\u000a\u000aRead More

The discovery brings a measure of closure to one of most tragic maritime disasters in US naval history.\u000a\u000a"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling," Allen said.\u000a\u000aThe heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis.\u000a\u000a"As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances. While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming."\u000a\u000aThe Indianapolis sank in 12 minutes, making it impossible for it to send a distress signal or deploy life-saving equipment. Before the attack, on July 30, 1945, it had just completed a secret mission delivering components of the atomic bomb used in Hiroshima that brought an end to the war in the Pacific, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVWar & Fashion\u000a\u000aCarnage: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria. Catwalk: Armani, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWar is ugly. Fashion is beautiful. War projects the worst of humanity. Fashion displays sartorial splendor in its highest. War is fraught with danger, even for journalists and especially for photographers who must get up close to their subjects to frame an image. Fashion is far less perilous, though photographers must also get intimate with their subjects on and around the runways. There are photographers who shoot both: battlefields and runways, guns and glamour. At first, photographing war and fashion appear as incongruous acts that are difficult to reconcile.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUntil, perhaps, you take a deeper look.\u000a\u000aGaza, 2000. Gaza, 2000. Paris, 2006. Paris, 2006. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aI laid out photographer Christopher Anderson's images of war and fashion before him. He was on a lunch break from a New York Magazine cover shoot in a Manhattan studio.\u000a\u000a"Amazing," he said.\u000a\u000aHe'd never seen his own photographs juxtaposed like that. War belongs in one intellectual compartment; fashion in another. The two don't usually mix in project portfolios -- or in the mind.\u000a\u000aHe called over the magazine's photo director, Jody Quon, for a look. She, too, was astonished by the common threads.\u000a\u000aAnderson captured a Palestinian youth in Gaza during the second intifada and a Giorgio Armani show in Paris. Both images are blurred, the figures airy, almost diaphanous in the light.\u000a\u000a"It's about the optics," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 2006, Anderson shot rescuers attempting to remove bodies from the rubble of a Beirut apartment building hit by Israeli jets. "Lebanon horrified me," he said.\u000a\u000aTwo years later, he clicked his camera behind the scenes at a Proenza Schouler show in New York. The composition feels eerily similar. Both images show a cacophony of chaos.\u000a\u000aBeirut, Lebanon, 2006. Beirut, Lebanon, 2006. New York, 2008. New York, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThen there is a photograph of 3rd Infantry Division soldiers clearing a building during the battle for Baghdad after U.S. forces entered the Iraqi capital in 2003. And a shot showing models at a L'Wren Scott show in 2008. The movement in the Iraq photo mirrors that of the models in their high heels.\u000a\u000a"I see scared little girls who have come from all over the world, all dressed up to be something they're not," Anderson said. Just like the young men in the U.S. Army who got dressed up to fight, terrified, at times, of a still-invisible enemy.\u000a\u000aIraq, 2003. Iraq, 2003. New York, 2008. New York, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"People are people," Anderson said. "I see the human experience in these photos. When I'm looking to make a picture, I'm peeling back layers to get that emotional quality."\u000a\u000aAs in the photo of an Iraqi army sergeant surrendering to the Americans in Najaf.\u000a\u000a"I don't see war," Anderson said. "I see a man who is frightened."\u000a\u000aThe idea to juxtapose war and fashion evolved after CNN's Director of Photography Simon Barnett came across a war photograph that reminded him of a fashion shot he'd seen. (See Barnett's selection of images on CNN's photo blog.)\u000a\u000a"I got to thinking about a number of established combat photographers who have in recent years been turning their cameras toward fashion," Barnett said. "I wondered what we would find if we went deeper into their work."\u000a\u000aBarnett did just that; he asked Magnum Photos to send him a collection of images made by four photographers -- each of whom has won major photojournalism awards.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2005. New York, 2005. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aWhen they arrived in Atlanta, Barnett plastered the photographs all over CNN's media lab, and began moving them around.\u000a\u000a"We saw that many photos taken by the same photographer seemingly started pairing themselves together." Barnett said. "In a very immediate and simplistic way I found this stimulating to look at, but wondered whether this meant anything."\u000a\u000aHe was intrigued by the prospect of presenting the photographers with an edgy new body of work they'd created with no conscious awareness of having done so.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Jerome Sessini were both surprised at first but the more they talked about their work, the more it became apparent how the pairings made sense. Paolo Pellegrin and Alex Majoli, the two other photographers whose work is showcased here, were shooting a project in a war zone and could not be reached for comment.\u000a\u000aTo others, the idea of this odd juxtaposition seemed unfair. Disturbing, even.\u000a\u000aKabul, Afghanistan, 2004. Kabul, Afghanistan, 2004. Paris, 2008. Paris, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"Appalling," said Sonya Fry, executive director of the Overseas Press Club, which bestows the prestigious Robert Capa Gold Medal for courage and enterprise in photography.\u000a\u000aShe perceived war as serious; fashion, not.\u000a\u000aStill, she found it interesting to compare the dynamics of the photos.\u000a\u000aThat someone had put them together fascinated Anne Tucker, curator of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston: "It's kind of ballsy," she said.\u000a\u000aLook at the photographs, she said. Take away the first three things you see. Perhaps the number of people. Or gender sameness. Or chaos.\u000a\u000aThen you begin to see other realms -- of coded clothing, body posture, the relationships of people to their environment.\u000a\u000a"Its total unexpectedness is its value. It ain't ho-hum," Tucker said.\u000a\u000a"My experience is that combat photographers are some of the smartest people I have met. They're not just interested in conflict photography. They are image connoisseurs. It doesn't surprise me that one would inform the other."\u000a\u000aIraq, 2003. Iraq, 2003. Paris, 2008. Paris, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aProvocative. That's how Stefano Tonchi saw it. The mastermind behind The New York Times style magazine, T, and now the executive editor of W magazine, has worked with combat photojournalists in many fashion shoots.\u000a\u000a"Not to say that fashion is not war," he joked. "But what is compelling about the images is the technique."\u000a\u000aIn both situations, the photographers must move fast, quick to make decisions about light and composition. They are used to catching a moment, capturing something people believe in.\u000a\u000a"I think there are more believers in fashion," Tonchi observed, "than there are in human rights."\u000a\u000aAuthor and documentarian Sebastian Junger admitted he knew nothing about fashion. But when he saw the war and fashion photos, he felt that perhaps the fashion world was a bit of a battlefield.\u000a\u000a"It makes the world of fashion seem kind of brutal and filled with conflict," said Junger, whose collaboration with the late combat photographer Tim Hetherington in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley resulted in the gritty film "Restrepo."\u000a\u000aKosovo, 1999. Kosovo, 1999. Paris, 2009. Paris, 2009. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThe fashion world for Junger is all about performance. The emotions are exaggerated, even fake. The gestures, for the most part, posed.\u000a\u000a"It's funny, in my eye. They all look like they're trying very hard to stand out, striking very aggressive, confident poses.\u000a\u000aNot different, perhaps, than a rebel fighter posturing in front of a camera, trying to appear invincible.\u000a\u000aThat's evident in Sessini's portrait of a fighter in Libya along the road to Ajdabiya in 2011.\u000a\u000aWar, too, said Junger, can be about performance. Only the anguish is real.\u000a\u000aAjdabiya, Libya, 2011. Ajdabiya, Libya, 2011. Milan, Italy, 2012. Milan, Italy, 2012. Photographs by Jerome Sessini/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"It's not how a photographer looks at the world that is important. It's their intimate relationship with it." The words of French photographer Antoine d'Agata synthesize the work of Sessini.\u000a\u000a"I would say shooting is conditioned by the attitude on the ground, the emotional connection with the subject. That is, my personal relationship," Sessini said.\u000a\u000a"When this relationship is strong, my eyes and my perception take precedence over the subject, whatever it is."\u000a\u000aThe difficulty for photojournalists lies in balancing truth with emotion, information with appearance. In the 2004 Falluja offensive, Sessini photographed two Marines who were clearing houses. They are shown sitting back to back on a metal bed in a house clearly ravaged by war.\u000a\u000a"I felt their fear. Very young and very scared. They were lost in this space, wondering what they were doing there," Sessini said.\u000a\u000a"That's what I tried to transmit -- the psychology of the soldiers. Anxiety, fear. No sense of purpose."\u000a\u000aIn another photo that Sessini shot just last September at an Armani show, two models appear backstage, back to back, wearing the same dress, their uniform of sorts. As with the case of the Marines, you cannot see their faces but Sessini captured the essence of their emotions with their pose. Lost in the middle of a big show.\u000a\u000aFalluja, Iraq, 2004. Falluja, Iraq, 2004. Milan, Italy, 2012. Milan, Italy, 2012. Photographs by Jerome Sessini/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"Showing expression most of the time, it's too easy," Sessini said. "A smile -- it's the first thing that you can see. If you search more, you can find something in the body or the posture."\u000a\u000aJunger saw the same mechanics in those two photos but took away two completely different stories. The two women didn't seem connected.\u000a\u000a"In fashion, there's some kind of implicit competition of who is the prettiest. In combat, it's the exact opposite. Those guys are completely connected."\u000a\u000aIt made sense to Junger that photographers focus on the same physical statements they make about individuals in fashion as they do in war. But the human form has limited focus points, the face being the most obvious one.\u000a\u000aPellegrin used the face, gesture and posture to get across two very different situations, said Tucker of Houston's fine arts museum.\u000a\u000aThere is a man with his arms outstretched in Tahrir Square and a model with her left arm in the air at New York's Fashion Week. The two images look similar. One emits rage, the other grace.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2004. New York, 2004. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThe anger in the faces of Egyptians protesting the rule of Hosni Mubarak in Cairo's Tahrir Square is evident in Paolo Pellegrin's 2011 photo. His shot of four models at Fashion Week in New York in 2005 is composed and framed in very much the same vein. Only this time, audiences come away with a look of speculation.\u000a\u000aAnother Pellegrin photo shows a man with his face covered, running during the anti-Mubarak protests. Next to it is a Paul Smith model running through brush in a corseted skirt.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. Paris, 2010. Paris, 2010. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThere's no mistaking the circumstances in which each subject is running. The model is wearing high heels and holding up a black bag. Her jaunt lacks desperation. The man, perhaps, is running for his life.\u000a\u000aWar and fashion. Opposite worlds?\u000a\u000aYes, of course.\u000a\u000aA photographer is not likely to be injured or killed at backstage Balenciaga. But take away the danger element and to Anderson, much of it feels the same.\u000a\u000aTo get through the logistics, to be able to position yourself just right is as difficult at Armani as it is in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a"You have to anticipate where you need to be so that when things unfold you're reacting to what's in front of you," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aBoth situations are uncontrolled. If you click too late, you've missed the drama of the moment.\u000a\u000aAnderson sees the same sensibility in all his photographs. The same person behind every frame.\u000a\u000aHe no longer shoots war. At a certain point, he believes, he was playing with statistics.\u000a\u000a"From a creative standpoint, I don't know what else to say about war."\u000a\u000aBut the thing is, there is beauty in war. Powerful beauty.\u000a\u000aTo understand it, you have to first understand war's ugliness.\u000a\u000a"The volume is turned up in war," Anderson said. "If it's beautiful, it's more beautiful. The ugly is uglier."\u000a\u000aIn war, you look for beauty of the human spirit. In a single gesture. Or act.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2009. New York, 2009. Photographs by Alex Majoli/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aFor many combat photographers, fashion is the tougher subject in that it is less familiar. Pellegrin, in a 2010 interview with Reuters, said this about fashion: "It's a world I do not frequent or know well. But I did not want to dismiss it as superficial. There is a lot of talent and creativity in fashion. I came with respect and wanting to discover a world I knew not so much about."\u000a\u000aStrangely, shooting war is sometimes less complicated, from a purely artistic standpoint. There is so much that is happening in front of you, Sessini said. It's easier to tell an extraordinary tale than craft one from the ordinary.\u000a\u000a"For me, war photography is easier," he said. "The thing happens in front of you. You just have to frame and shoot. It's very easy to get a strong picture. At Fashion Week, it's much more difficult. You have to work, you have to find something different and find your own vision."\u000a\u000aShooting fashion was a challenge for Sessini. "I can feel stressed in the same way in Falluja that I feel in Milan."\u000a\u000aSessini found my questions interesting. No one had asked them before. He, too, had never studied his photos of war and fashion next to one another.\u000a\u000aWhen you have a vision of the world, it comes through in your work, he supposed. That is true whether in war or fashion.

aVAbu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) Saudi Arabia will open its land border to Hajj-bound Qatari pilgrims and pay their expenses, according to the Kingdom's state media.\u000a\u000aSaudi's King Salman also offered to dispatch private jets to transport pilgrims from Qatar to Jeddah.\u000a\u000aThe developments came more than two months into a diplomatic rift in the Gul f. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar over its alleged support of terrorism -- a charge it has denied.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia said the Hajj decrees emerged from mediation between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Thani, the brother of Qatar's former ruler, Emir Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani, who was deposed in 1972.\u000a\u000aThese are the first known negotiations between Saudi and Qatari royals since the start of the diplomatic crisis.\u000a\u000aQatar FM: Hajj decrees 'politically motivated'\u000a\u000aQatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said his country welcomed the move, though he considered it "politically motivated."\u000a\u000a"Despite the fact it's been politically motivated to ban the Qatari people haj and politically to allow them ... we welcome such a step, which is a step forward to get rid of this blockade which is imposed against my country," the minister told a news conference on a visit to Sweden, according to Reuters.\u000a\u000aQatar's National Human Rights Committee said it was "satisfied" with the move, but asked for further clarification about procedures. It is unclear whether Sheikh Abdullah's role in the mediation was sanctioned by the Qatari government.\u000a\u000aQatar's National Human Rights Committee had previously said that Saudi Arabia was restricting Qataris' access to the pilgrimage.\u000a\u000aEvery year, millions of Muslims from around the world make their way to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to mark the Hajj.\u000a\u000aThe pilgrimage -- which this year starts on August 30 -- is one of the pillars of Islam that all Muslims who are financially and physically able must perform at least once in their lifetime.\u000a\u000aOfficials from other boycotting Arab states appeared to endorse Saudi Arabia's announcement.\u000a\u000a"The facilitation of Qatari Hajj pilgrims ordered by King Salman have never been done before for any Islamic country and even under regular circumstances," Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said in a tweet Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar al-Gargash, lambasted Qatar's criticisms of Saudi Arabia's dealings with Qatari pilgrims.\u000a\u000a"Qatar's politicization of Hajj must come to an end following the initiative taken by King Salman," Gargash said. "There are matters that rise above politics."

The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day, or $22.\u000a\u000aBut there's a catch. Fathers have to share that leave with mothers.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVNot many successful businesses start with a luggage fail.\u000a\u000aBut when Jen Rubio called her friend and former colleague Steph Korey for advice on a replacement suitcase, they quickly spotted a gap in the market.\u000a\u000a"Jen had broken a suitcase and had been looking for recommendations and everyone came up empty handed," Korey said.\u000a\u000aThere appeared to be only two options: Pay for a bag that costs more than a vacation, or buy another cheap suitcase that would likely break again, she said.\u000a\u000aSo Korey and Rubio launched Away in February 2016 to provide an alternative. The founders say the luggage startup recorded sales of $12 million in its first year.\u000a\u000aThe founders put Away's early success down to its team of 41 tech-savvy millennials and their love of photo sharing app Instagram.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot of people on our team who were coming of age when Instagram came out, so we've definitely learned from them that brand discovery and shopping through Instagram is an important part of how they find things," said Korey.\u000a\u000aWhat makes the perfect suitcase?\u000a\u000aAfter spending months interviewing hundreds of travelers, Korey says the team were able to create luggage that helps take the hassle out of any journey.\u000a\u000aAway suitcases have impenetrable and "unbreakable" shells, says Korey, USB ports that can charge devices, interior compression systems that save space, and wheels designed to provide the smoothest, 360-degree roll.\u000a\u000aRelated: Airline electronics ban: What you need to know\u000a\u000aPrices start at $225 for its carry on model, which includes a battery that can charge an iPhone five times.\u000a\u000aTravelers seem to like the formula. Away sold over 50,000 suitcases in its first year of business.\u000a\u000aBut Korey and Rubio, who met when they worked for eyewear unicorn Warby Parker, have bigger ambitions.\u000a\u000a"We don't think of ourselves as a luggage company at all and we very strongly view ourselves as a travel brand. For us it's all about how can we make travel more seamless," Korey says.\u000a\u000aAccording to the founders, investors include Forerunner Ventures, the original Warby Parker backers, Andy Dunn from menswear firm Bonobos, and Brian Lee from The Honest Company.\u000a\u000aLondon, New York, Los Angeles?\u000a\u000aAway plans to expand into accessories. It also wants to start a travel website with tips and recommendations.\u000a\u000aThe company has one retail store in New York's Soho, but it has also tested pop ups in Los Angeles, London and Berlin. Encouraged by the strong start, the firm is now looking at permanent stores in Los Angeles and London.\u000a\u000aKorey says the company has grown a lot faster than they expected. But they're very careful about who they hire, despite the intense workload.\u000a\u000a"It's going to be worth it to wait for that person who is truly aligned with this vision for creativity and execution and teamwork," Korey says.\u000a\u000aCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Jay Z as a direct investor of Away.

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation .\u000a\u000a(CNN) Mounting evidence suggests that the richer and more diverse the community of microbes in your gut the lower your risk of disease. Diet is key to maintaining diversity and was strikingly demonstrated when an undergrad student went on a McDonald's diet for ten days and after just four days experienced a significant drop in the number of beneficial microbes.\u000a\u000aYour gut microbiome is a vast community of trillions of bacteria that has a major influence on your metabolism, immune system and mood. These bacteria and fungi inhabit every nook and cranny of your gastrointestinal tract, with most of this 1kg to 2kg "microbe organ" sited in your colon (the main bit of your large intestine).\u000a\u000aWe tend to see the biggest diet-related shifts in microbes in people who are unhealthy with a low-diversity unstable microbiome. What we didn't know is whether a healthy stable gut microbiome could be improved in just a few days. The chance to test this in an unusual way came when my colleague Jeff Leach invited me on a field trip to Tanzania, where he has been living and working among the Hadza, one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer groups in all of Africa.\u000a\u000aMy microbiome is pretty healthy nowadays and, among the first hundred samples we tested as part of the MapMyGut project, I had the best gut diversity -- our best overall measure of gut health, reflecting the number and richness of different species. High diversity is associated with a low risk of obesity and many diseases. The Hadza have a diversity that is one of the richest on the planet\u000a\u000aThe research plan was devised by Jeff who suggested I should have an intensive three days of eating like a hunter gatherer during my stay at his research camp. I would measure my gut microbes before heading to Tanzania, during my stay with the Hadza, and after my return to the UK. I was also not allowed to wash or use alcohol swabs and I was expected to hunt and forage with the Hadza as much as possible -- including coming in contact with the odd Hadza baby and baboon poo lying about.\u000a\u000aTo help us record the trip I was accompanied by Dan Saladino, the intrepid presenter and producer of BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme , who was preparing a Hadza microbe special.\u000a\u000aAfter a long tiring flight to Mount Kilimanjaro Airport in Tanzania, we stayed overnight in Arusha, a city in the north of the country. Before setting off the next morning, I produced my baseline poo sample.\u000a\u000aAfter an eight-hour journey in a Land Rover over bumpy tracks, we arrived. Jeff beckoned us to the top of a huge rock to witness the most amazing sunset over Lake Eyasi. Here, within a stones throw of the famous fossil site of Olduvai Gorge and with the stunning plains of the Serengeti in the distance, Jeff explained that we were never going to be closer to home as a member of the genus Homo, than where we were standing at that moment.\u000a\u000aThe million-year-old diet\u000a\u000aThe Hadza seek out the same animals and plants that humans have hunted and gathered for millions of years.

The significance of being in Hadza-land was not lost on me.\u000a\u000aUnlike the Hadza, who sleep around the fire or in grass huts, I was given a tent and told to zip it up tight as there were scorpions and snakes about. I had to be careful where I stepped if I needed a nocturnal pee.

At the center of celebrations is Gerewol, a male beauty contest and courtship ritual. Young men -- traditionally herdsmen -- wear full makeup, jewelry and their finest clothes and stand in line to await inspection by female onlookers. White teeth and white eyes are highly prized, so participants will grin broadly and pull all manner of expressions in the hope of attracting attention. It's flirtation en masse, in the hope of winning a night of passion with one of the judges.

They are one of the few tribes that continue the practice in East Africa, but archaeologists have discovered lip plates in the region stretching back 30,000 years, says anthropologist Dr Jerome Lewis of University College London. "It's a body modification that people find beautiful," he says. "It's also very striking and a distinctive way of marking your difference from other people around you."The bottom lip is pierced with a wooden peg inserted, which is replaced with larger pegs thereafter.

It's the result of otjize, a paste of butter, fat and red ocher, applied daily to their hair and skin. It was once speculated that the otjize served as a form of sun protection and to ward off insects, however the women say it's purely for aesthetic reasons -- which makes sense, given that Himba men don't take part in the practice.

Young men of the Hamar tribe, one of many in the valley, prove their manhood by jumping on prize bulls and then running across their backs -- all while naked. The purpose? It's a coming of age ceremony, and only when the participant has traversed the bull run four times will he be allowed to marry. Slip and you risk a hard fall: "Because it's a manhood initiation ritual, [failure] is likely to affect the perception of someone's manhood and that of course can have all sorts of dire consequence," adds Dr Lewis. Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Xhosa, Ulwaluko \u2013 In Eastern Cape, South Africa, young Xhosa men take part in a coming of age initiation called Ulwaluko. The youths, known as abakhwetha, are first circumcised without anesthetic, before being sent away from their village and into the bush, with minimal supplies and wrapped in a blanket. Wearing white clay on their faces, initiates will fend for themselves for up to two months, living in a structure built by the village's adult community specifically for Ulwaluko. Upon their return they are no longer referred to as "boy" and receive a new blanket. The initiation has not been without its criticisms, due to complications and malpractice surrounding the circumcision process.

Descent and succession for the Bantu-speaking tribe, spread across Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique, is matrilineal, with property and land inherited from their mothers. "Although inheritance passes down the female line, which definitely gives women more power in society, it's still male-dominated and patriarchal in the sense that men are still at the apex of power," explains Lewis. "People have an assumption that matrilineal societies are somehow favorable to women -- and they are certainly more favorable than some of the extreme patrilineal societies -- but they're not societies that give women equal power."One thing Chewa women are shut out of is the Nyau brotherhood (pictured), a secretive society who can channel spirits and performs a ritual dance called Gule Wamkulu around harvest and at weddings and funeral. Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Maasai, spitting \u2013 Spittle is an essential part of life for the Maasai of East Africa, as it acts as a blessing. "People have different views about where the power and essence of somebody resides," explains Lewis. For some, "spit represents an essence of you as a person."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTo spit is "a way of blessing people by giving something of yourself; your own power to someone else." It starts at an early age, when newborn babies are spat on to wish them a good life. "If you leave a place, elders will come and spit on your head in order to bless your departure, and that whatever you do you're safe and kept well," adds Lewis.

This means that by extension... these performances are not the original initiations but a facsimile of them." The San of South Africa, Botswana, Angola and Namibia are, according to some researchers, the world's oldest people . Their hunter-gatherer culture stretches back tens of thousands of years, and integral to it is the trance dance, also known as the healing dance. Historically an all-night affair, the practice brings the whole community together, led by healers and elders dancing around a fire, chanting and breathing deeply until they induce a trance state. It offers the chance to commune with ancestral spirits of the departed and for healers, cure sickness within other dancers.Lewis says that this tradition is under threat: "In some places in southern Africa the San now perform their traditional culture exclusively for tourists, because they've been forced out of all their territories as hunter-gatherers by conservationist organizations.

In societies that are cattle based, men tend to marry in their mid-forties, he adds, explaining that "there's always a backlog of women who are available but unable to marry" because men of a similar age have not yet raised the required bridalwealth. A feature of marital affairs for many Bantu-speaking tribes in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, lobola is practiced by, among others, Zulus (pictured). Lobola is also referred to as "bridalwealth", with the prospective groom's family negotiating with the bride's for her hand in marriage. The dowry comes in many forms, including money, but some choose cattle. There were reports in 1998 that Nelson Mandela (of Thembu lineage) paid the marital lobola of 60 cows to the family of new wife Graca Machel."It's the cause of much conflict," says Lewis, "because in order for a man to get married he must provide often quite a substantial head of cattle, and so he's in indentured labor to his father until the herd he's caring for is big enough."

The tangelmust, a wrapped headdress up to eight meters in length, is ubiquitous among the "blue men of the desert." The name does not allude to the muslin headdress, dyed with indigo, but rather because the dye gradually leeches out into the skin of the wearer. Tuaregs use the tangelmust for practical reasons: it protects from the sun and sand, but men will still wear them at night, and even during meals. Men cover their faces with the tangelmust in front of strangers and women, while women are free to show their face.

With it comes an extraordinary show of pageantry. In the months before the event men live in isolation and drink to excess a mixture of cow milk and cow blood for months in order to become vastly bloated and overweight. Each clan will then present an unmarried male to compete for the title of fattest man -- and with the glory, the greater chance of finding a wife. With stomachs swollen, balance and fatigue can be an issue, but once the event is over, contestants return to their normal size in a matter of weeks.

A perfect example of this is the Dassanech tribe, another group found in Ethiopia's Omo Valley on the border with Kenya. Rubbish of all manner, but particularly bottle tops, have begun to be recycled by Dassanech women, who weave the metal caps into vibrant jangly headdresses. Other women have adapted broken watches and trinkets for similar purposes -- and a sure fire way of getting yourself noticed. Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aThe baobab fruit is the staple of the Hadza diet, packed with vitamins, fat in the seeds, and, of course, significant amounts of fibre. We were surrounded by baobab trees stretching in the distance as far as I could see. Baobab fruit have a hard coconut-like shell that cracks easily to reveal a chalky flesh around a large, fat-rich seed. The high levels of vitamin C provided an unexpected citrus tang.\u000a\u000aThe Hadza mixed the chalky bits with water and whisked it vigorously for two to three minutes with a stick until it was a thick, milky porridge that was filtered -- somewhat -- into a mug for my breakfast. It was surprisingly pleasant and refreshing. As I wasn't sure what else I would be eating on my first day, I drank two mugs and suddenly felt very full.\u000a\u000aMy next snacks were the wild berries on many of the trees surrounding the camp -- the commonest were small Kongorobi berries. These refreshing and slightly sweet berries have 20 times the fibre and polyphenols compared with cultivated berries -- powerful fuel for my gut microbiome. I had a late lunch of a few high-fibre tubers dug up with a sharp stick by the female foragers and tossed on the fire. These were more effort to eat - like tough, earthy celery. I didn't go for seconds or feel hungry, probably because of my high-fibre breakfast. No one seemed concerned about dinner.\u000a\u000aHadza woman and child sitting at a fire, Lake Eyasi, Tanzania.\u000a\u000aA few hours later we were asked to join a hunting party to track down porcupine -- a rare delicacy. Even Jeff hadn't tasted this creature in his four years of field work.\u000a\u000aTwo 20kg nocturnal porcupines had been tracked to their tunnel system in a termite mound. After several hours of digging and tunnelling -- carefully avoiding the razor-sharp spines -- two porcupines were eventually speared and thrown to the surface. A fire was lit. The spines, skin and valuable organs were expertly dissected and the heart, lung and liver cooked and eaten straight away.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the fatty carcass was taken back to camp for communal eating. It tasted much like suckling pig. We had a similar menu the next two days, with the main dishes including hyrax -- a strange furry guinea-pig-like hoofed animal, weighing about 4kg -- a relative of the elephant, of all creatures.\u000a\u000aHarvested high from a baobab tree, our dessert was the best golden orange honey I could ever imagine -- with the bonus of honeycomb full of fat and protein from the larvae. The combination of fat and sugars made our dessert the most energy-dense food found anywhere in nature and may have competed with fire in terms of its evolutionary importance.\u000a\u000aIn Hadza-land nothing is wasted or killed unnecessarily, but they eat an amazing variety of plant and animal species (around 600, most of which are birds) compared with us in the West. My other lasting impression was how little time they spent getting food. It appeared as though it took just a few hours a day -- as simple as going round a large supermarket. Any direction you walked there was food -- above, on and below ground.\u000a\u000aMassive increase in microbiome diversity\u000a\u000aTwenty-four hours later Dan and I were back in London, him with his precious audio tapes and me with my cherished poo samples. After producing a few more, I sent them to the lab for testing.\u000a\u000aThe results showed clear differences between my starting sample and after three days of my forager diet. The good news was my gut microbal diversity increased a stunning 20%, including some totally novel African microbes, such as those of the phylum Synergistetes.

aVThere is no shortage of finance apps that purport to fast-track your money life.\u000a\u000aBut do they save you money? Are they worth the trouble?\u000a\u000aWe've waded into the fields of fintech to find three ways these programs will boost your finances.\u000a\u000a1. Discover better discounts and perks\u000a\u000aUnless you enjoy continually comparison shopping at multiple outlets for every purchase, you may as well let a bot do it. As you buy things, these apps work in the background of your purchases to ensure you don't overpay, miss out on an already earned benefit or buy something that's cheaper elsewhere.\u000a\u000aSift works with your credit card and lets you know of a benefit when you buy something. For example, your cards may offer trip cancellation protection, flight delay insurance, car rental insurance, lost luggage insurance, extended warranties, theft protection, and the ability to get some or all of your money back if you find something cheaper elsewhere. But it's a lot to track on your own.\u000a\u000aSift streamlines the process of getting reimbursed or making a claim. The founder, Abhinav Dubey, says the average user saves 5% of what they spend a year in addition to expenses they avoid. The service is currently free.\u000a\u000aSimilarly there's Earny, which scans your receipts and searches for better prices elsewhere. When there's an opportunity to get the difference back, because of store or credit card price protection policies, Earny files for it and refunds your money.\u000a\u000aEarny keeps 25% of what you get back -- which is pretty steep -- but the company is betting the likelihood of you bothering to look for the cash back opportunities on your own is pretty low. The average refund is $8 and a typical user gets $100 a year on about 13 different purchases.\u000a\u000aYou can also install Honey, a Chrome browser extension that searches for coupon codes so you get the best deal.\u000a\u000a2. Finding more money to save\u000a\u000aEveryone loves seeing their money grow, but the hard part is putting the money aside. Apps like Acorns and Digit do that for you.\u000a\u000aWith Acorns your purchases are rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference is deposited into an investment portfolio in $5 increments. The portfolios range in risk-tolerance with a mix of equity and bond exchange traded funds (ETFs). According to the company, Acorns users who use the round up feature see an average monthly account balance growth of $45 in their investments over those who are only directly investing. The fee is $1 a month on accounts under $5,000.\u000a\u000aWith Digit, the bot tracks the amounts going into and out of your checking account, saves an amount it determines you won't need, and puts it into a Digit account. The service is free for the first 100 days and costs $2.99 a month thereafter.\u000a\u000a3. Tax tallying\u000a\u000aRobots can also help with the taxable events resulting from selling investments.\u000a\u000aBetterment offers tax-loss harvesting, a process of selling a security that's taken a loss. By realizing, or "harvesting" a loss, investors can offset taxes on both gains and income.\u000a\u000aTo recreate the process yourself, an investor would need to go in and look at every share you've ever bought, including from new deposits, reinvested dividends and rebalancing, and determine if that specific share is at a loss, says Dan Egan, director of behavioral finance and investments at Betterment. You then need to consider if tax loss harvesting that share would result in a wash sale based on the purchase dates and prices of other shares.\u000a\u000a"It is an extremely onerous thing for a person, but it is perfect for an algorithm," he said.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the financial platform offers a tax impact preview, so that you can see the tax implications of any action before you make a move. After rolling it out a few years ago, Egan said, people who were shown the tax impact of a potential allocation change were 70% less likely to go through with it.\u000a\u000aBots also help the investment service M1 Finance to minimize your taxes by executing your sale of securities by prioritizing lots that don't result in any tax liability first, followed by a more favorable long-term capital gains rate and lastly a short term capital gains tax rate, which is the same rate as ordinary income.

aV(CNN) As attitudes about marijuana shift around the world, researchers are warning parents that it's risky to keep it around children, especially those who are too young to know what it is.\u000a\u000aThe number of children who were admitted to emergency rooms for unintentional marijuana intoxication increased by 133% in France over an 11-year period, according to a new study.\u000a\u000aCannabis is illegal in France, but it has the highest rate of marijuana use in Europe, said Dr. Isabelle Claudet , lead author of the study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics.\u000a\u000a"And that means we are facing an increase in emergency admissions of marijuana intoxication and an increase in severe symptoms seen in children," said Claudet, a pediatric emergency physician in Toulouse.\u000a\u000aShe and other researchers analyzed the number of French children under 6 admitted to pediatric emergency departments because of unintentional cannabis intoxication and the number of cannabis-related calls involving children to French poison control centers.\u000a\u000aFrom 2004 to 2014, 235 children were admitted to ERs with cannabis intoxication, and there was a 133% increase in the admissions rate for it. The number of calls to poison control centers related to cannabis exposure in children increased by 312% in the same period.\u000a\u000aWhat concerns Claudet the most is that the concentration of the psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, has been increasing in cannabis products in France.\u000a\u000a"THC concentration in cannabis products has increased from 9% in 2004 to 20% in 2014," she said. "I believe that's why we're facing more adverse effects in children."\u000a\u000aOver the 11-year span, the severity of symptoms in children admitted to emergency departments because of marijuana intoxication also increased.\u000a\u000aTwenty times more severe cases were reported in 2014 compared with 2004, and and four times more severe cases were reported in 2014 compared with 2013. Of the 32 children reported to have gone into comas, 53% were admitted in 2014, and there were more cannabis-related admissions than any other type of pediatric emergency room admission.\u000a\u000aThe main cannabis product circulating on the French market is hashish or cannabis resin, a solid and very concentrated form of cannabis extract, usually sold in the form of sticks or balls. Users break off pieces, roll them in tobacco papers and smoke them.\u000a\u000aClaudet believes the best way to decrease the number of pediatric marijuana intoxication cases in France is to decrease the concentration of THC in cannabis through regulation.\u000a\u000a"And we have to also warn consumers and parents that it could be very dangerous for children to eat such products," she said. "Because usually, parents think it's not very harmful because they're smoking it, and it relaxes them. But if a child ingests one stick or ball, they can become comatose."\u000a\u000aWhat about children in the US?\u000a\u000aRecreational marijuana is legal in eight US states and the District of Columbia, and medical marijuana is legal in 29 states and D.C. Cannabis product trends in the United States are quite different from those in France, though high concentration of THC is still a concern, especially in edible products.\u000a\u000a"The results of this Pediatrics study also makes sense with what we've been seeing in Colorado. With the marijuana industry increasing, there's a lot of new products, a lot of concentrated products, that people vape or ingest, like the edible products, that are high in THC," said Dr. G. Sam Wang , a pediatric toxicologist at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora.\u000a\u000a"And so we've been seeing a lot of kids who are more symptomatic and more intoxicated," said Wang, who was not involved in the French research.\u000a\u000aWang has conducted several studies of US trends in pediatric marijuana intoxication, as well as trends in Colorado\u000a\u000aHe found that in states where recreational or medical marijuana is legal, the number of pediatric marijuana intoxication cases reported to poison control centers increased by 30% each year from 2005 to 2011. Children in states where marijuana was legal had more severe symptoms and were more likely to be admitted to a critical care unit compared with those in states where marijuana was not legal.\u000a\u000aIn his Colorado study, Wang found that in the two years leading up to when recreational marijuana became legally available for purchase in 2014 and the two years after, rates of marijuana exposure cases in children increased. On average each year, there was a 34% increase in calls to poison control centers about marijuana exposures in Colorado and a 19% increase across the US. Forty-eight percent of the cases in Colorado were attributed to the ingestion of an edible marijuana product.\u000a\u000aWang said the higher number of cases in states where marijuana is legal can in part be attributed to the increased availability of marijuana products and the attractiveness of edible product labels, which often look like normal candy or cakes to a child.\u000a\u000a"Usually, kids get into things that become more available, and usually, that happens when it's a household product, like those laundry detergent pods, which were attractive," Wang said. "It's kind of the same situation with marijuana, where we think in states with legal marijuana, probably more households have it in their home, especially the food or edible marijuana products with bright labels, that makes it easier for kids to get into them."\u000a\u000aThe US National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , or NORML, says that it is concerned about the inadvertent ingestion of cannabis products by children in both the US and France but that more regulation could help provide a solution: "It is our contention that the frequency of these incidences can be mitigated by the imposition of stricter regulatory controls, such as more stringent and overt product labeling and by limiting such products to single serving sizes."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWang believes the key to ensuring the safety of children living around marijuana products is a combination of outreach and education. He tells parents to treat the marijuana like any other prescription or over-the-counter drug and keep it out of reach of children.\u000a\u000a"Parents need to understand that kids can actually get sick from this stuff," he said.\u000a\u000aSeveral states with legal recreational marijuana, including Colorado Oregon and Washington state , have also made child-resistant packaging a requirement for certain products.\u000a\u000aWang thinks this is also a step in the right direction, especially as other states or countries may be looking to legalize marijuana.\u000a\u000a"They need to think about the unintended consequences of legalization, such as marijuana intoxication in children. So whether that's education, packaging regulations, dose regulations," he said. "Colorado had some of that in the beginning of legalization, but we also made mistakes. But I'm hoping that other places can learn from those mistakes and implement programs or rules at the outset."

Blinken stressed that pressure on Iran \u201cis not going away\u201d and addressed why he thinks Israel and other nations may have a problem with the deal.\u000a\u000aBlinken said, \u201cIn terms of Israel, we understand Israel has the right to be skeptical. An Iranian bomb would present an existential threat to Israel. And we have the exactly the same goal, which is to prevent Iran from getting a bomb. There may be tactical differences in how we get there. I think Israel would\u2019ve preferred not to do this first step. If we could\u2019ve negotiated a comprehensive deal right away in a matter of days, we would\u2019ve done that. But because its complicated, because it takes time, we wanted to make sure that Iran couldn\u2019t use that time to advance its program. This stops the program in its tracks.

aVJay Inslee is the governor of Washington State. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The American dream has always been about chasing opportunity and pursuing a brighter future for ourselves and our children.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, if certain national leaders have their way and repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the American dreams of hundreds of thousands of young people will be cruelly ripped away. These are dreams that are as lofty and aspirational as the dreams of those who helped build our country more than 240 years ago.\u000a\u000aWe must ask ourselves: Are we a confident, forward-looking nation that builds monuments -- like DACA -- to hope and determination? Or are we a nation that is turned inward, lauding monuments to intolerance and division?\u000a\u000aFive years ago this month the federal government began accepting applications from undocumented immigrants under the age of 31, many of whom were brought here as small children and have known no other home than America. They came forward, passed a background check and achieved their dream of living in our country without fear and contributing as fully recognized members of our society.\u000a\u000aToday, close to 800,000 young people have been granted protection from deportation under DACA. Some 17,000 of them live in Washington State. These "Dreamers" are students, teachers, doctors, and small-business professionals who are working, studying and raising families.\u000a\u000aThey are people like Hortencia, a young woman I met at Skagit Valley College. She is working to earn a degree in business management and says she hopes to be an inspiration to her daughter and her community. These Dreamers are aspiring -- and, yes, inspiring -- young people who contribute to our country and our economy.\u000a\u000aFor years, my state of Washington tried to pass its own state Dream Act. Many Republicans weren't interested. But some thought differently after they met Dreamers and heard stories that revealed their courage, grit and determination. It is the same determination that built America and will help it continue to thrive.\u000a\u000aIt was then t hat these Republicans joined Democrats in doing the right thing. I hope that same spirit can work in Washington, D.C., like it did in our state capitol.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Immigration arrests surge under Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Immigration arrests surge under Trump 02:39\u000a\u000aThe stakes for Hortencia and other Dreamers are high. At this moment, a group of Republican attorneys general a re threatening to sue President Donald Trump if he does not repeal DACA. They would like to strip these young people of their lawful resident status and their jobs.\u000a\u000aThis would put Dreamers at immediate risk of deportation and tear thousands of families apart. It would also hurt businesses in every state and cost the US economy $460 billion over the next 10 years, according to a data analysis by the Center for American Progress . It's a senselessly cruel objective, driven by a hateful anti-immigrant agenda that is rejected by the vast majority of Americans.\u000a\u000aNow is a moment for the President to show leadership and defend the DACA program against a legal challenge. But given the President's words and actions in recent months and days, I believe it will be up to Congress to choose empathy, sensibility and smart policy over hate, division and fear-mongering.\u000a\u000aIf President Trump will not protect Dreamers, Congress must immediately pass the bipartisan DREAM Act and provide permanent protection for these young Americans.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Sessions toughens US immigration enforcement Replay More Videos ...

Unfortunately, members of the Tea Party killed the effort in Congress, Republican senators abandoned the effort, and Trump's election campaign dumbed down the GOP's immigration policy platform to three words: build a wall.\u000a\u000aNow America is facing an identity crisis, encouraged by nativist forces in our White House. In rhetoric and in deed, we are witnessing the mainstreaming of a hateful and discriminatory ideology I had hoped my children and grandchildren would never see.\u000a\u000aWhile our nation rightfully expresses outrage over the Charlottesville tragedy and its fallout, we must not lose sight of the imminent threat to this crucial program that protects young immigrants.\u000a\u000aAs governor, I stood up against the travel ban, and as governor, I will fight in every way I can to keep these Dreamers here, at home. I hope Republicans in Congress and the administration will fight for Dreamers as well. Deportation is no more a solution to our immigration challenges than the President's nativist "build a wall" plan.\u000a\u000aFederal lawmakers must act now to protect Dreamers. Staying on the sidelines is not an option. Strongly worded tweets are not enough. These are people pursuing incredible futures. Let's give them the chance they deserve.

aV(CNN) In a doctor's waiting room in South London sit three people of varying ages and ethnicities, waiting among a sea of empty green plastic chairs.\u000a\u000aIt's Tuesday afternoon in the Hetherington Group Practice, which serves more than 8,500 people from dozens of miles in every direction from its base in the bustling area of Brixton.\u000a\u000aAdorning the many notice boards on the walls are posters asking people to get flu vaccinations, to embrace more walking as part of their day to day and to speak up if they feel that they may have symptoms of bowel cancer.\u000a\u000aAnother poster informs that the Accident and Emergency room at the local hospital "won't kiss it better," appealing to people not to visit their local ER when something is not urgent.\u000a\u000aRecords from the National Health Service show that the numbers of people visiting an emergency room in England have risen from just over 4.5 million per quarter in 2004 to almost 6 million per quarter by the end of 2017 -- almost a 25% increase.\u000a\u000aThe "patient pod" at the Hetherington Group Practice allows those registered to monitor their vitals and their mood in their own time.\u000a\u000aIn the corner of the waiting room sits a "patient pod" consisting of a computer, a blood pressure machine and scale, for people to measure their vitals in their own time.\u000a\u000aThey can even monitor their mood by answering a series of questions about how they're feeling and what they're thinking. The practice has more than 230 patients registered with severe mental health problems, such as psychosis.\u000a\u000a"It's about managing demand," said Dr. Steve Mowle, one of the nine physicians at the practice and a spokesman for the Royal College of General Practitioners\u000a\u000aThis "pod" and the option of a phone consultation aren't the norm for all general practitioners' facilities but Mowle -- like any other GP in the United Kingdom -- has a budget to spend on his practice each year, based on a capitation, an amount paid from the government's budget per patient registered. He and his partners may use it how best they see fit to meet the multiple needs of their large patient base.\u000a\u000aDemand on the practice has increased significantly in recent years.\u000a\u000aUnusually, the rise is not in terms of patient numbers, which have in fact fallen, but by people living longer with greater numbers of increasingly complex conditions to manage. Each day, Mowle will have contact with 40 to 50 patients, he explained, with 60% of those in person and the rest through phone consultations.\u000a\u000a"My clinics are longer," Mowle said. A clinic represents a half-day of seeing patients and is meant to last three hours each. His clinics routinely last at least five hours.\u000a\u000aSteve Mowle works at the Hetherington Group Practice in London, contacting 50 patients, on average, each day.\u000a\u000a"Being a full-time GP is impossible," he said, adding that there is "more and more administration" on top of seeing patients.\u000a\u000aThe demographic of his patient base is as vast as the region the practice covers, ranging from the homeless, newly arrived refugees and blue-collar workers to high-earning middle-class and lawyers and bankers whose houses are worth millions. More than 140 languages are spoken locally.\u000a\u000aDespite their differences, the patients at this clinic -- and anywhere else in the UK -- have one thing in common: Not one of them will pay or receive a bill for the care they receive here.\u000a\u000aTheir health care is free and universal and has been since the formation of the country's National Health Service in 1948.\u000a\u000aThe population's health care is funded through tax and compulsory national insurance contributions deducted from income, which go toward many state benefits.\u000a\u000aBut as the demand for health care has increased across all levels of care -- primary, secondary and tertiary -- so has the strain on this once-coveted health system -- particularly on its finances.\u000a\u000aA changing climate for health care\u000a\u000aHealth care budgets in the UK have been plateauing, with only minor increases in spending, as percentages of gross domestic product spent on it have been declining.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Kings Fund, an independent health care charity, the National Health Service is halfway through its most austere decade ever. Figures from the World Bank reflect this: In 2009, the UK spent 9.8% of its GDP on health care; by 2014, it fell to 9.1%, according to the World Bank.\u000a\u000aAlong with this came more people, who are living longer and with multiple conditions like diabetes and heart disease that require treatments also rising in cost. Meanwhile, hospital bed numbers have fallen, numbers visiting emergency rooms have risen, and the demand for social care -- such as home care or equipment -- in the community has increased with limited services in place to provide it, again leaving more people with fewer hospital beds.\u000a\u000a"The current situation is unsustainable," said Dr. Ian Eardley, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK and practicing surgeon at a hospital in Leeds. "There are patients who are medically fit but can't get help in the community, or support, to leave hospital."\u000a\u000aAusterity has brought extended wait times for people seeking elective or routine treatments, such as knee or hip surgery, while emergency treatments for serious issues such as cancer or heart attacks continue to be treated promptly, as they should, according to Mowle.\u000a\u000aGuidance requires anyone in the UK with signs of cancer be seen within two weeks.\u000a\u000a"(But) you can't bring patients in for elective surgeries," said Eardley, who further stressed the complexities surrounding people living longer.\u000a\u000a"People often live longer with other medical problems being controlled and managed," he said, adding that greater expectations by patients today and the tendency to discuss cases in greater detail all add time and strain to an already overwhelmed system.\u000a\u000aAnother financial constraint is the increasing, but important, role of computing.\u000a\u000a"Most of these countries have seen a need for increased spending with changing technology," said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\u000a\u000aReal National Health Service spending in 2015-16 increased by just 1.6%, according to the Kings Fund.\u000a\u000a"The budget has been frozen for too long," McKee said.\u000a\u000aMore funding is needed, he said, to decrease the debt owed by hospitals whose budgets were not enough and to ensure a greater transition from care settings into the community.\u000a\u000aIs more spending better for health care?\u000a\u000aThe UK spring budget for 2017 announced last week pledged £2 billion ($2.5 billion) toward adult social care over the next three years to "ease pressure on the NHS."\u000a\u000a£425 million ($525 million) was also announced to be invested in the NHS in the next three years, with £100 million ($125 million) going to Accident and Emergency departments in 2017-18, to help them manage increasing demand.\u000a\u000aExperts like McKee and Eardley welcome the investment, but believe it will not be enough.\u000a\u000a"The UK is not exceptional," McKee said, adding that other countries have similar levels of health care coverage using a tax-based system, including Finland, Sweden, Portugal and Spain. "The broad model of tax-based funding is common in quite a few countries."\u000a\u000aA recent report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (PDF) highlighted that, although access to care in the UK is good, the quality of care is uneven and continues to lag behind that of many other countries.\u000a\u000aMcKee also highlighted Germany and France, which spent 11.3% and 11.5% of their GDPs on health care, respectively, in 2014 and have more beds per capita, more doctors per 1,000 people and longer life expectancies\u000a\u000aGermany and France use a social insurance model to pay for their health care: Deductions are taken from income, but unlike in the US, everyone is covered, and companies don't make a profit. Those contributing also "own" the organizations involved through boards and unions, McKee said.\u000a\u000aPeople pay a fee at the point of care, though it's just $5 to $11 in Germany and $25 in France, which is often reimbursed.\u000a\u000aThe Western country spending the most on its health care is the US, which spent 17.1% of its GDP on health care in 2014.\u000a\u000aYet a series of factors -- such as a lower life expectancy and uneven coverage -- highlight that increased expenditure alone is not always a good thing. A system to manage it best is key.\u000a\u000a"The US is an outlier internationally," McKee said. "No one would say the US (model) is good ... for the population."\u000a\u000aTreatments and new technologies for conditions such as cancer often lead from the US, but the key issues are access and the varying amounts that could be charged as a fee to provide them.\u000a\u000aMcKee added that the private insurance-based model in the US, covering only those who are insured, leads to companies in the industry working toward profit. "This leads to more division and less universal coverage," he said.\u000a\u000a"If you have lots of money, you get good care," Eardley said about US health care. "If you don't have money, you don't fit into the system," he added, calling such a system "wasteful."\u000a\u000aExperts in the UK are eager to stress the cost-efficiency of the National Health Service. According to the Royal College of General Practitioners, the UK pays the least per patient than most countries in the West.\u000a\u000aIn comparison with the US, Europe's universal coverage, with tax- and social-fund-based financing through contributions, spends less and has more care that's better, according to McKee.\u000a\u000aMany countries on the continent still have a small sector of patients using private insurance. In the UK, an estimated 11% of the population has private insurance, often through their employers. In Germany, top earners can opt out of the public system and pay privately instead, representing an estimated 10% of Germans.\u000a\u000aAt the core of the debate around health care, money alone is not the issue; it's the model of care.\u000a\u000aWhat is health care?\u000a\u000a"Health care should be free at the point of delivery," said Dr. Richard Kerr, a council member of the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK and consultant neurosurgeon at a large regional hospital in Oxford. "There is a fee structure behind it, but when a patient comes to see me ... the issue of money never comes into it."\u000a\u000aKerr believes countries worldwide can learn from those on mainland Europe, such as Germany and France, where the population receives great care, in his opinion, with good quality but pays more for it through taxes. "They are taxed higher but have much more investigative health care," Kerr said.\u000a\u000a"We should look at the different models of health care and take the good aspects of it ... without getting rid of the basics of what we've got," he added. "But what you get for your buck is more here."\u000a\u000aWith the UK being more cost-efficient, he ponders whether that is something to be proud of. "If you receive the same level of care with less money," that is indeed a point of pride. But with patient waiting times up to 20 weeks in some cases, he added, that is not the case.\u000a\u000aThe neuroscience department at his hospital in Oxford is the regional hospital, a point of tertiary care where patients requiring specialist procedures are referred from their district hospitals. It serves more than 2.8 million people across a 100-mile radius, said Kerr, with just 60 beds in his main ward and another 13 in the intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aThe building is just a decade old, light and airy in design, but as he walks through the wards, he highlights the shuffling he and his team do on a regular basis between main wards and the ICU to ensure that all patients can access a bed and undergo their procedures.\u000a\u000aStaffers borrow beds between the departments, he explains, so spare beds in the ICU will sometimes be used for his less severe cases. But he shows further frustration with the lack of social care resources for patients away from his hospital, such as the provision of home carers or equipment to keep them mobile, or changes to make their homes more accessible or to help them access day centers. These are crucial, he believes, particularly as the population continues to live longer.\u000a\u000aNeurosurgeon Richard Kerr faces the challenge of bed shortages in his hospital in Oxford most weeks.\u000a\u000aBetween 2014 to 2015, 72% of more than 1.8 million new requests for social care support requested from councils in England were clients aged 65 and over, according to NHS data\u000a\u000aIn addition to keeping beds unnecessarily occupied, resulting in a "domino effect," he explains that "if a patient has social care needs, a busy environment (like a hospital) isn't the best place for them," he said.\u000a\u000aNeurosurgical procedures vary also greatly, with some patients needing just 24 hours to recover while others have stayed as long as 100 days.\u000a\u000a"We have to cancel patients at short notice sometimes," he said, not only leaving patients untreated but leaving surgeons unable to do their jobs.\u000a\u000aDuring this visit, Kerr is smiling, as for once, he has some beds going spare on his wards. He is ready for whatever comes his way. This is not the norm, he said.\u000a\u000a"There is pressure on us now, but this is not new," he said of demands on the wards and his outpatient clinics. "My clinic overruns. It always does ... so there's frustration there."\u000a\u000aBut Kerr wants to carry these realities forward and kick-start a debate to get the UK government investing more for even greater efficiency, enabling greater capacity to deliver care.\u000a\u000a"When I'm old and crumbly, I don't want to have to wait," he said, thinking of his patients. He and others in the field want reform or restructuring to get people discussing what health care is, as its meaning has changed dramatically since the National Health Service's inception.\u000a\u000a"We need a commission," he said, stating a need to push for patients, cross-party politicians, policymakers and medical practitioners to come together to define health care.\u000a\u000aMowle agreed, adding that the separation of "health care" and "social care" is no longer acceptable and is what has led to the fragmentation of services in the UK.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We need a debate asking, what do you want out of health care?" Kerr said. "Do you want to continue treating everything? Yes, you do, but we can't do it under the current financial envelope."\u000a\u000aCurrently within the health service, certain conditions are not covered -- such as more cosmetic procedures -- leaving some patients unsatisfied.\u000a\u000aThe need to identify what people on each side of the debate believe health care to be, and which aspects they prioritize, will help manage expectations as well as resources, Kerr explains, not only in the UK, but also more globally.\u000a\u000aHe believes this will lead to a happier and more satisfied patient base, particularly among those left behind -- either waiting in the UK or uninsured in the US. But it won't be easy.\u000a\u000a"Health care is incredibly complex. ... The growing number of older people with multi-morbidities are having very very complex trajectories through the health and social care system," McKee said. "We shouldn't underestimate the challenges."

aV(CNN) China may be home to both the longest and highest bridges in the world, but neither is as pioneering as the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.\u000a\u000aBuilt during China's tumultuous Cultural Revolution, the double-decked bridge was considered groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 1968. But more importantly to some, it was also the first modern bridge to be designed and built by China without help from foreign architects.\u000a\u000aAs major repairs get underway ahead of next year's 50th anniversary, the bridge remains a source of pride in Nanjing, China's former capital. A project commissioned by railway officials hopes to secure the bridge's legacy by documenting its history, according to the initiative's head Lu Andong, a professor at Nanjing University's School of Architecture and Urban Planning.\u000a\u000a"The bridge was so important, and it's undoubtedly a symbol of the city," he said. "It is being repaired for transportation and safety purposes, but I would relish the chance to transform the bridge's tower and the affiliated park into places of memory."\u000a\u000aMade in China\u000a\u000aChina had initially hoped to build Nanjing's bridge with its communist allies, the USSR. Having already helped construct a crossing at Wuhan (about 280 miles up the river), the Soviets once again offered technical assistance. But soon after construction began in 1960, relations between the two nations soured.\u000a\u000aWang Shiqing is pictured with railway tickets featuring illustrations of the bridge, part of his vast collection.\u000a\u000aSoviet experts withdrew from the project ahead of the Sino-Soviet split -- the breakdown of relations between the world's largest communist powers from 1960. The bridge was nonetheless completed eight years later. China considered the accomplishment to be a major feat of engineering -- and a propaganda victory.\u000a\u000aAt over 5,000 feet long, the bridge carries both cars and trains. Its upper deck is a four-lane highway with sidewalks, while the railway tracks are now part of the Beijing-Shanghai train route.\u000a\u000a"Everybody loves the bridge," said Wang Shiqing, a longtime Nanjing resident who has collected over 1,000 pieces of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge memorabilia.

However, for Nanjing's residents, it is best known for transforming life in the city.\u000a\u000aBefore the bridge was built, people and goods could only cross the river by ferry. Trains passing through the city would have to be disassembled and loaded onto boats in order to continue their journey.\u000a\u000aUpon its completion, the bridge changed the lives of the city's residents."In terms of the function, it made people's lives so much easier," said Wang, who was born the same year the bridge was opened. "It reduced the river crossing time and served as the main artery for north-south transportation."\u000a\u000aPhotos: The most spectacular bridges in the world Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge (Switzerland) \u2013 Measuring 1621 feet long, the newly opened Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge is the world's longest pedestrian suspension bridge, according to Zermatt Tourism.

Critics worry the new bridge, which is not yet under construction, will destroy Pimlico Gardens, one of few public green spaces in the area. Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aThe bridge united visual expressions of technology and progress, according to Lu.\u000a\u000a"It is not just infrastructure but a piece of architecture," he said. "The bridge's form expressed speed, penetration and force-flow -- similar to what was seen in Italian futurism. The form of the bridge intends to express an inner flow of forces, as if the structure is merely a pipe of energy."\u000a\u000aBut on the ground, the spatial composition of the bridge's towers resorted to traditional architectural language: central access, a processional route and a podium.\u000a\u000a"This design became a canonical case of Chinese modern architecture and was extremely important. This formula had enduring impact."\u000a\u000aA 'pop icon of modernity'\u000a\u000aAs well as sculptures of peasants, workers and soldiers, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge also features Mao Zedong quotes and a 230-foot statue of the former leader.\u000a\u000a"The red flags and magnolia decorations are very Chinese," Wang said, referring to the three flag-shaped sculptures found at the top of the bridge's towers.\u000a\u000aThis particular design reflects the "Three Red Banners" -- a major propaganda campaign during the Cultural Revolution. The "banners" represented ideologies that called for the construction of a socialist state in China.\u000a\u000aThis poster was designed by the Nanjing Great Bridge Workers Creative Group and the Revolutionary Publishing Group of the Shanghai Publication System.\u000a\u000aThe bridge often appeared in propaganda posters, which were keen to imply that the structure represented a "great victory of Mao Zedong Thought" (the political theory known outside China as "Maoism"). One such poster featured a quote from Mao: "Chinese people have drive and strength -- we have to reach and overtake levels of advancement across the world."\u000a\u000aErected during a turbulent time in China's history, the bridge had far-reaching cultural impact, according to Lu.\u000a\u000a"This bridge is one of the most recognized achievements of the Cultural Revolution era," he said. "It is both a political monument and a symbol of technological and historical success. Its image appeared on cups, pencils, shoes, mirrors, cigarettes and bicycles nationwide -- the bridge became a pop icon of modernity."\u000a\u000aThe legacy of the bridge also lives on through the people who were named after it. According to Wang, many people in Nanjing named their firstborns Chang Jiang (Chinese for "Yangtze") and their second Da Qiao (which means "big bridge").\u000a\u000aRestoring former glories\u000a\u000aIn April 2016 the National Development and Reform Commission, China's state planning body, approved a 27-month program of repairs to the bridge. According to a government report, "safety and durability risks" were key factors in the decision.\u000a\u000aBut the structure will be getting a facelift too. A $160.7 million (RMB 1.09 billion) investment will be used to restore some of the iconic statues, including those found on nearby river banks. Sculptures on the bridge will be reinforced, with handrails and piers also undergoing renovations.\u000a\u000aWith younger generations less aware of the bridge's historical significance, Lu hopes that the renovations will restore not only the bridge, but the city's interest in it.\u000a\u000a"The older generation obviously takes more pride in the bridge," he said. "It is very important to re-access the memory of the bridge in a creative way, to allow people of all ages to experience and understand the memories of it.

aV(CNN) "Welcome to Bali! Do you have any plastic bags to declare?"\u000a\u000aIf you've traveled to the lush Indonesian island of Bali recently, you might have received this peculiar greeting at the airport.\u000a\u000aIt would have come from Melati and Isabel Wijsen who have been campaigning for four years to get plastic bags banned from their island.\u000a\u000aWhen they started out, they were just 10 and 12 years of age.\u000a\u000aAnd now, they're about to succeed.\u000a\u000aIndonesia's plastic problem\u000a\u000aIndonesia is the second largest plastic polluter in the world after China -- its plastic waste accounts for a whopping 10 per cent of marine plastic pollution.\u000a\u000aThe Indonesian government has pledged to invest $1 billion in reducing marine waste by 70 per cent by 2025, as part of the UN's Clean Seas program.\u000a\u000aThe goal is ambitious, given the dire state of some of the country's 17,000 islands, including Bali, which has a population of just over four million.\u000a\u000aDue to the massive amounts of trash in the waters, when the wet season arrives and the winds turn, beaches on Bali are hit by the annual "trash season."\u000a\u000a"Trash season" on Kuta Beach, Bali.\u000a\u000aThe local government downplays the event, on one occasion calling it a " natural phenomenon ," but at its root are poor disposal systems and a lack of education on the problem of waste.\u000a\u000aStart with the bags\u000a\u000aGrowing up on Bali, Melati and Isabel were surrounded by the negative impact of plastic.\u000a\u000a"There's no escaping it here," Melati tells CNN. "The plastic problem is so in your face, and we thought: 'Well, who's going to do something about it?'"\u000a\u000aA fateful day at school gave them the motivation they were looking for.\u000a\u000a"We had a lesson in class about positive world leaders, change makers like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Lady Diana, and I remember at the ages of 10 and 12 we went home thinking about what we could do as kids from an island.\u000a\u000aIsabel and Melati Wijsen.\u000a\u000a"We didn't want to wait until we were older to stand up for what we believe in."\u000a\u000aSo they didn't. They founded, instead, an organization called Bye Bye Plastic Bags, an NGO driven by young people determined to get the population of Bali to say no to plastic bags.\u000a\u000a100,000 signatures\u000a\u000aThat was the start of an incredible journey that has taken the sisters around the world, including to London where they delivered a TED talk and New York where they made an appearance at the United Nations.\u000a\u000aMelati and Isabel Wijsen at the United Nations in New York for World Oceans Day 2017.\u000a\u000aIn their TED talk, they sisters noted that only 5 per cent of plastic bags get recycled in Bali, but the island produces 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day -- the equivalent of a 14-story building.\u000a\u000a"Next to the many highs and successes," says Melati, "there were definitely challenges. Particularly dealing with the government and lobbying to get them to move in the right direction."\u000a\u000aIn their bid to get the local government to pay attention, they started a petition.\u000a\u000aThey obtained permission to start collecting signatures behind customs and immigrations at Bali's airport and, eventually, got over 100,000.\u000a\u000aBali's governor Mangku Pastika, however, remained unimpressed and for over a year-and-a-half failed to meet Melati and Isabel's request for a hearing.\u000a\u000aFrustrated, the sisters decided to start a hunger strike -- a decision inspired by trip to India and a visit to Mahatma Ghandi's house. Due to their young age, they performed the strike under the supervision of a dietician and only from sunrise to sunset.\u000a\u000aIt proved effective.\u000a\u000aTwenty four hours later they were escorted by the police to the governor, who signed a memorandum of understanding to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags by January 2018.\u000a\u000aA global project\u000a\u000aAs that date approaches, the girls have been promoting on Bali the use of reusable bags and highlighting shops that have stopped selling plastic bags on their social channels\u000a\u000aBye Bye Plastic Bags is now a global organization with affiliates in several countries.\u000a\u000aAlong the way, they've had other successes, such as Bali's largest ever beach cleanup, which attracted 12,000 volunteers.\u000a\u000a"It was crazy to see so many people, no matter what age, nationality or occupation coming together for the same thing," says Isabel.\u000a\u000aThey believe the voice of the youngest generations should have a larger resonance.\u000a\u000a"If we could meet with world leaders and speak to them, we would tell them to listen more to the youth, consider us as more than just inspiration. We have bright innovative ideas of how to deal with some of the greatest issues of our time," says Melati.\u000a\u000a"We are the future, but we are here now, and we're ready. We've learned kids can do things. We can make things happen."

aVConcluding a dedicated week of CNN International programming on Italian Renaissance artist, Leonardo da Vinci, a half-hour special \u2018Leonardo \u2013 The Lost Painting\u2019 charts the amazing discovery of a newly-found Da Vinci painting.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year the art world made an extremely rare discovery: a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Experts believe only 15 paintings by the artist still exist, including the iconic \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019 and \u2018The Last Supper\u2019. The newly-discovered work \u2013 known as 'Salvator Mundi ' or \u2018Saviour of the World\u2019 \u2013 depicts the head and shoulders of Christ, and though 500 years old, after cleaning and restoration, is in remarkably good condition.\u000a\u000aCNN has gained rare access to this globally-significant find, as arts expert Nick Glass travels to New York and becomes one of the first few people on earth to see the painting first-hand. Nick meets Robert Simon, an old masters dealer acting on behalf of the painting\u2019s owners and talks to Dianne Modestini, the restorer who brought the painting back to its original state.\u000a\u000aALSO IN THE PROGRAMME:\u000a\u000aNick heads toFlorenceto learn more about the life and work of this ultimate Renaissance man.

aV(CNN) When it comes to Confederate monuments and reckoning with the past, America could learn a lot from Germany, says CNN's Fareed Zakaria.\u000a\u000aZakaria's comments came a week after violence broke out in Charlottesville, Virginia, when white supremacists and neo-Nazis held a rally to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E Lee. Heather Heyer , 32, was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters gathered to oppose the rally.\u000a\u000aThe protests reignited an ongoing national debate over whether the more than 700 Confederate memorials and monuments across the country should be removed.\u000a\u000aThe United States should take inspiration from Germany, a country that has gone through the "difficult national process of reckoning with its history," Zakaria argued Sunday on his show, "GPS."\u000a\u000a"The country has gradually come to accept a sense of collective guilt. It has not been immune to push-back and backlash. There have been far-right nationalist parties -- today, there is one called the Alternative for Germany -- but by and large the country has rejected its Nazi past," he said.\u000a\u000a"Anyone who uses the swastika or performs a Hitler salute in Germany faces potential prison time, and there are strict prohibitions against hate speech. Hitler's book Mein Kampf was not published in Germany for 70 years, until the copyright expired," he added.\u000a\u000aZakaria brought up the tens of thousands of "stumbling blocks," an ongoing Holocaust memorial project in which brass plaques are placed in the ground across Germany, each bearing the name of a Nazi victim who lived at that location.\u000a\u000aHowever, Zakaria noted, these memorials had not been greeted "without controversy."\u000a\u000a"The so-called stumbling blocks have offended some people, who say the Holocaust victims are being trampled daily, and the city of Munich went so far as to ban them," he said.\u000a\u000aBut this kind of debate, he insisted, was "healthy."\u000a\u000a"Wrestling with a country's history is not easy, and should not be easy," he said.\u000a\u000aAmerica, he said, was now "wrestling as well."\u000a\u000a"The South is still littered with monuments honoring, celebrating the people whose only claim to fame was that they marched and fought in mutinous opposition to the government of the United States because they wanted to defend slavery," he said.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, the CNN host noted, "there are relatively few memorials to the millions of slaves who were violently oppressed in these same lands."\u000a\u000aThat's why it's ironic to note that America is actually one of the reasons why Germany was able to confront its past so effectively, Zakaria argued.\u000a\u000a"When it occupied Germany after World War II, the allied powers prohibited the display of 'any monument, memorial, poster, statue, edifice, street or highway name marker, emblem, tablet, or insignia which tends ... to revive militarism or to commemorate the Nazi Party,' " he said.\u000a\u000aIn doing so, Zakaria said, the United States helped Germany show "that it could bury its militarism and Nazism."\u000a\u000a"The circumstances are very different, of course, but some of the lessons from Germany might well apply in America today," he concluded.

But few can boast as many credentials in sustainability as this retreat in South America.\u000a\u000aLocated 950 meters above sea level in the Chocó-Andean forest of Ecuador -- a three-hour drive from the capital of Quito -- Mashpi Lodge is designed to blend seamlessly into one of the most biodiverse spots on the planet.\u000a\u000aAt the 3,000-acre (1,200-hectare) reserve alone guests can watch the club-winged manakin bird conduct its courtship dance, trek to 190-feet-tall waterfalls, climb an observation canopy into the treetops, or spot the Mashpi torrenteer frog species, discovered by a team of hotel scientists.\u000a\u000a"The idea is that you have a symbiosis with all that nature and you become part of the nature," Alfredo Ribadeneira, lead architect behind Mashpi Lodge, tells CNN.\u000a\u000aRooms cost around $1,200 per night, and the hotel also has restaurants, a spa and a boutique.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Rooms cost around $1,200 per night, and the hotel also has restaurants, a spa and a boutique.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge also runs a Life Center where guests can take a closer look at the abundance of local butterfly species.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Mashpi Lodge also runs a Life Center where guests can take a closer look at the abundance of local butterfly species.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge has a team of scientists who research and discover wildlife in the area, which is home to some 500 species of birds, as well as trees and frogs endemic to the region.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Mashpi Lodge has a team of scientists who research and discover wildlife in the area, which is home to some 500 species of birds, as well as trees and frogs endemic to the region.\u000a\u000aHousing 24 guest rooms, it sees more than 2,000 visitors a year, who are attracted by its unique position in the rainforest and abundance of activities designed to bring guests closer to nature.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Housing 24 guest rooms, it sees more than 2,000 visitors a year, who are attracted by its unique position in the rainforest and abundance of activities designed to bring guests closer to nature.\u000a\u000aThe lodged was designed to blend into the impressive natural landscape.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 The lodged was designed to blend into the impressive natural landscape.\u000a\u000aThe architects tried to cause minimum disruption to the local wildlife and natural environment when building the property.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 The architects tried to cause minimum disruption to the local wildlife and natural environment when building the property.\u000a\u000aThe idea was to create a retreat in the middle of the jungle, says lead architect Alfredo Ribadeneira.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 The idea was to create a retreat in the middle of the jungle, says lead architect Alfredo Ribadeneira.\u000a\u000aThe luxury eco-resort, which took two years to build, was constructed using sustainable techniques.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 The luxury eco-resort, which took two years to build, was constructed using sustainable techniques.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge is nestled in the midst of Chocó-Andean forest -- a three-hour drive from the capital of Quito.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Mashpi Lodge is nestled in the midst of Chocó-Andean forest -- a three-hour drive from the capital of Quito.\u000a\u000aAt one with nature\u000a\u000aThe man behind Mashpi Lodge is Ecuadorian entrepreneur, environmentalist, and former mayor of Quito, Roque Sevilla.\u000a\u000aThe idea was to make a bubble of comfort in the middle of the jungle. Alfredo Ribadeneira, lead architect\u000a\u000aA timber company had previously owned the site, which Sevilla purchased 11 years ago, to save the forest and its inhabitants. Two years of building work and $10 million later, the resort opened in 2012.\u000a\u000a"I think Mashpi Lodge is a very special case when it comes to the numerous eco-resorts around the world," Sevilla tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"(Protection of the area) is an ongoing effort and we're still working on purchasing more land so we can guarantee 100% protection from logging, agriculture and mining."\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge as seen from an observation tower built for guests.\u000a\u000a"The idea was to make a bubble of comfort in the middle of the jungle," explains Ribadeneira. "The real luxury is the possibility of being part of this web of life as a spectator."\u000a\u000aOn top of the network of logging roads that once covered the site the architects laid a grid of metal mesh tubes "encrusted in the land" to serve as the foundation of the property.\u000a\u000a"The time it took to make all the foundations was very long," Ribadeneira says. "In another place, you would just go and dig a hole and put down foundations -- and that's it."\u000a\u000aBut Ribadeneira and his team took great care to avoid disturbing the forest, where possible.\u000a\u000aFor example, the timber firm left behind a platform where lumber machinery had been stored. Ribadeneira decided to locate the hotel there: not only did it have expansive views, but it also didn't require trees to be cut down since the site's vegetation had already been removed.\u000a\u000a"If you walk around you're not going to see building debris," Marc Berry, the hotel's general manager, tells CNN. "We're very respectful of the forest."\u000a\u000aLost in the jungle\u000a\u000aVertical lines have been used throughout Mashpi Lodge to mirror the forest.\u000a\u000a"We tried to make all the vertical elements of the structure very slender and tall, aiming for a similar proportion to the trees nearby," Ribadeneira explains.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge's vertical structural elements are designed to evoke a feeling of being "lost" inside the jungle for its guests.\u000a\u000aAnother way of bringing the forest inside was the extensive use of glass -- there are floor-to-ceiling windows in the guest rooms, for example.\u000a\u000a"The glass reflects the jungle; the glass makes you see from the windows. This generates a magnificent relationship with the exterior," Ribadeneira adds.\u000a\u000aOne moment you are at ground level ... and the next moment you are practically inside the canopy of the jungle. Alfredo Ribadeneira\u000a\u000aFurthermore, the hotel was built across three floors to provide a layered view of the forest.\u000a\u000aThe ground level, where the entrance and communal areas are, offers views of two lateral mountain ranges.\u000a\u000aMost of the guest rooms take up the two floors above, looking out into the higher reaches of the forest.\u000a\u000a"One moment you ... are at ground level with bases of the trees very close to you -- and the next moment you are practically inside the canopy of the jungle.\u000a\u000aViews of the rainforest are visible at every turn from inside Mashpi Lodge.\u000a\u000a"The sensation that this generates is very interesting," Ribadeneira says.\u000a\u000aIn more practical sustainability terms, Mashpi Lodge has been running on hydro-electricity over the past year.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, 75% of the property operates energy efficient LED lights. The lodge sources its water from local rivers and treats it in a natural water plant on site, while used beverage crates are recycled to cover slippery paths.\u000a\u000aLocal villagers grow organic produce -- fruits and the heart of palm vegetable -- for the hotel's kitchen, reducing the property's carbon footprint.\u000a\u000aIf you build it, they will come\u000a\u000aRibadeneira admits that the building process was challenging.\u000a\u000a"Initially, when the hotel was not yet inhabited, the reflection of the jungle in the windows made the birds crash against the glass," he says.\u000a\u000aThe team leveled the windows in different angles so the birds wouldn't hit them.\u000a\u000aThe Cloud Forest surrounding Mashpi Lodge is teeming with wildlife.\u000a\u000aTransporting materials to the site and constructing the building was also difficult.\u000a\u000a"Normally, you would work with materials that are nearby. In this case, the place is so complex that it's very hard thinking about getting the materials there."\u000a\u000aI think people miss out this bit (in Ecuador) so this would be a lovely way to come and see it. Michael Bloy, Mashpi Lodge guest\u000a\u000aTo avoid disturbing the wildlife, the architects used small cars and lots of manpower, rather than trucks. Each sheet of glass was carried in. Parts of the property were built off-site and reassembled once they arrived.\u000a\u000a"You have to be very, very silent and you cannot go and have huge trucks and all those things," he explains, or else the wildlife the property wanted to showcase would have fled forever.\u000a\u000aSome parts of Mashpi Lodge were pre-assembled in Quito before taking shape on site.\u000a\u000aIndeed, an initial downturn in biodiversity proved unavoidable.\u000a\u000a"The animals went away -- but after a couple of years they were all back again," says Ribadeneira. "That was a very good thing."\u000a\u000aWith Mashpi Lodge receiving some 2,200 guests a year, it would seem that their efforts have paid off.\u000a\u000a"Ecuador has a lot to offer anyway, but this seems a little bit special in terms of how you can approach the cloud forest and how you can see a little bit more of Ecuador," guest Michael Bloy tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"People tend to think of Ecuador as the Galapagos or the rainforest. I think people miss out on here, so this would be a lovely way to come and see it."

aV(CNN) Republicans may be jubilant that revamped health care legislation finally passed the House on Thursday, but many of the professional associations that represent America's health care workers are clearly unhappy.\u000a\u000aThe groups said they were "disappointed," "deeply disappointed" and "extremely disappointed" with legislation that is "unacceptable," "shameful," "harmful and irresponsible." Their reactions immediately followed the 217-213 House vote\u000a\u000aThe American Medical Association said in a statement that although change is needed in the health care system, people with pre-existing health conditions "face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question."\u000a\u000aThe American Cancer Society expressed concerns that the bill will leave cancer patients unable to pay for plans, arguing that the bill would make pre-existing condition protections "virtually meaningless." The legislation may bring back high-risk pools, which "have not historically been an adequate safety-net," according to the statement from Chris Hansen, president of the society's Cancer Action Network.\u000a\u000aThe American College of Physicians disagreed with a provision that will allow insurers to opt out of covering essential benefits like mental health care, maternal care and cancer screening. The group also took issue with cuts and caps on federal contributions to Medicaid and an end to Medicaid expansion, which they say will leave tens of millions without coverage.\u000a\u000aIn a statement from Dr. Jack Ende, the group's president, it vowed to fight for a better change to the health care system instead of this "harmful legislation."\u000a\u000a"The American Health Care Act (AHCA) plays Robin Hood in reverse. It fails to deliver better, cheaper health care for all Americans, instead giving massive tax cuts to the rich while causing 24 million people to lose coverage," the National Education Association said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIt too expressed concerns about funding cuts to Medicaid, which covers millions of students nationwide.\u000a\u000aThe Main Street Alliance , a group that works with small businesses on health care issues, called the vote "a shameful display of partisan politics at its worst" in a statement from its national director, Amanda Ballantyne. It added that the legislation would raise costs for all families while giving tax breaks to "the very wealthy and the big insurance and drug companies."\u000a\u000a"Today, the sunny, flamboyant promises of better health care at a lower cost during a political campaign gave way to the cold, dark realities of politics in America," said Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of Mental Health America, in a statement. He called it a "tragic day for all those dealing with or caring for someone with serious mental health concerns."\u000a\u000aIn an emailed statement, Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said: "Today the U.S. House of Representatives voted on the worst women's health legislation in a generation. It makes it harder to prevent unintended pregnancy, harder to have a healthy pregnancy, and harder to raise a family."\u000a\u000aPhysicians for Reproductive Health's statement argued that the bill is a "targeted attack against reproductive health care" and that it takes away health care from millions of Americans, disproportionally affecting low-income women and women of color.\u000a\u000a"It is appalling that the House would push forward legislation that offers no significant improvements to the bill that was rejected just last month," said a statement from Dr. Diane Horvath-Cosper, the reproductive health advocacy fellow at the association. "I am terrified for my patients and for the health of this country."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThere was at least one association that was applauding the passage of the legislation in the house. #ProtestPP , which stands for Protest Planned Parenthood Coalition. The group organizes rallies around the country in support of defunding Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000a"With today's vote in the House, our leaders in Congress have taken a giant step toward keeping the promise they made to voters last year to defund Planned Parenthood. Now it's time for the Senate and President Trump to get the job done," said Eric Scheidler, one of the association's national directors.\u000a\u000aThe office of the Health and Human Services secretary also sent out a statement on the legislation.

aV(CNN) Despite a 23-year campaign urging that babies be put to bed on their backs, only 43.7% of US mothers report that they both intend to use this method and actually do so all the time, according to a new study .\u000a\u000aThe study, published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics, surveyed 3,297 mothers, of whom 77.3% reported that they usually -- but not always -- put their babies to sleep on their backs.\u000a\u000a"What was new and hadn't been explored before was this idea of what people intended to do versus what they actually do," said Dr. Eve Colson, professor of pediatrics at Yale School of Medicine and co-author of the study. "What we found was that people intended to put their baby on their back but didn't always do that."\u000a\u000aAnother finding was that those who felt the baby's sleeping position was not up to them, but rather the baby or another family member, were more than three times as likely to place the baby on its stomach.\u000a\u000aThe two main critiques of back sleep were the fear that the baby might choke and that it's less comfortable than having them sleep on their stomachs, Colson said.\u000a\u000aThese beliefs could be from lack of education, as well as cultural and familial influences, said Dr. Robin Jacobson, a pediatrician at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone Health, who was not involved in the study. Many prior generations had their babies sleep on their stomachs, she said.\u000a\u000a"Grandmothers and aunts and everybody have told (mothers), if they have babies sleep on their bellies, they're more comfortable; they're not going to choke," she said. "And because of that, a new mom who doesn't really have a lot of information is using information from everybody else in their life."\u000a\u000aA racial disparity\u000a\u000aThe new research oversampled Hispanic and African-American women in order to make adequate comparisons across racial groups, the authors said. African-American mothers were reported to be the least likely to put their babies on their backs, compared with other demographics.\u000a\u000aThere were about 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths in the US in 2015, according to the CDC . SIDS account for 1,600 of those while 1,200 are due to unknown causes and 900 were due to accidental suffocation and strangulation while in bed. The sudden unexpected infant death rate of non-Hispanic black infants was 170.2 per 100,000 live births between 2011 and 2014, more than twice that of non-Hispanic white infants (83.8 per 100,000).\u000a\u000aThe elevated rate has a lot to do with societal norms, said Dr. Rachel Moon, a pediatrician who has studied SIDS in African-American communities.\u000a\u000a"There's very much a culture of putting babies on their stomach in an African-American community," said Moon, who was not involved in the new study. "There's a lot more dependence on grandmothers and other senior family members as trusted sources, and lots of times, the information that you get from your family members is more persuasive than what you get from physicians and other sources."\u000a\u000aMoon also said that parents perceive babies to be uncomfortable if they are frequently waking or crying while on their backs, so they let the child determine the sleeping position.\u000a\u000a"I think the fact that parents don't feel like they have control is something we can talk about," she said. "It's often the child that's the queen or the king of the household. And I think parents often forget that they're the adults of the household, and they can actually make decisions if they think they're right for their children."\u000a\u000aPreventing SIDS\u000a\u000aThe latest guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics advise that parents sleep in the same room -- but not the same bed -- as infants until the child is at least 6 months old.\u000a\u000aBabies should be placed on their backs on a firm sleeping surface with a tight-fitted sheet and no pillows or blankets, to prevent suffocation and overheating. They should never be put on couches, sofas or cushioned chairs to sleep.\u000a\u000aBut what's the best way to ensure that everyone obtains access to this information?\u000a\u000aThe key is educating parents' friends and families, facilitating open conversations about infant sleep and encouraging the media and advertisers to display images of safe sleep practices, according to an editorial accompanying the new study.\u000a\u000aIt also noted that health care providers should be consistently communicating clear messages about safe sleep guidelines.\u000a\u000a"Every single health care provider needs to be saying the same thing," Moon said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe study found that those who received advice from their doctor consistent with the guidelines were less likely to place a baby on its side or stomach to sleep.\u000a\u000a"You don't really realize when you're doing this day in and day out that moms really respect you and really listen to what you're saying and even would agree with you over their own mother or somebody else in their life," Jacobson said of doctors. "So I definitely think this needs to be publicized again in the American Academy of Pediatrics and with pediatricians to really push the Safe to Sleep program."

aVBlåvand, Denmark (CNN) Bjarke Ingels certainly has a way with words when it comes to describing his design for the newly opened Tirpitz Museum.\u000a\u000a"It's almost compared to when you have a hot potato," he says. "When you make a cross and you squeeze, it opens up and reveals the softness inside. That's pretty much what's going on here, just with culture and nature."\u000a\u000aHe's alluding to the entrances to the new museum, open corridors carved into a large sand dune, which meet like a cross in an open courtyard. From there, glass windows allow visitors to peek into the vast underground galleries below.\u000a\u000aLight-hearted comparisons aside, the museum builds upon a dark historical heritage. It was constructed as an extension to the Tirpitz bunker in Blåvand, Denmark, a former World War II fortress built by the Nazis in 1944, and abandoned, unfinished, in 1945.\u000a\u000aMany crumbling bunkers still dot the coast of Denmark -- a reminder of Hitler's grand plans to build an impenetrable Atlantic Wall against his enemies, stretching from the Spanish border in France to the northern tip of Norway.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Inside Bjarke Ingels' Tirpitz Museum\u000a\u000aDanish architect Bjarke Ingels has transformed an original World War II bunker into the new Tirpitz Museum in Blåvand, Denmark.

aV(CNN) Founded as a small gathering in San Francisco in 1986, Burning Man has evolved into what it advertises as "a temporary metropolis dedicated to art and community."\u000a\u000aThese days, the annual festival attracts some 70,000 revelers who descend on the Black Rock Desert in Nevada.\u000a\u000aInitially based on the bonfire ritual of the summer solstice, Burning Man has some strict rules. Goods and services can be gifted but not sold or bartered, for example, and there are no trash cans on site. A netted fence at the perimeter of the festival keeps windswept debris from escaping into the desert beyond.\u000a\u000aBut when it comes to where to sleep, creativity is encouraged and, in recent years, the festival has garnered press for the weird and wild architecture that inhabits the desert for one week only.\u000a\u000aPhotographer Philippe Glade has been attending the festival since 1996, and has documented the most inventive structures. In his latest book, "Black Rock City, NV: The Ephemeral Architecture of Burning Man," Glade has brought together the most inspiring builds he's come across in recent years.\u000a\u000aFrom burning palaces to igloos made of bread, Glade has seen them all.\u000a\u000a2017 Burning Man takes place from Aug. 28 to Sept. 5, 2017.\u000a\u000aCNN: Why did you start taking photographs of the structures?\u000a\u000aPhilippe Glade: Having crossed the Sahara several times in 1990 and 1991, I thought I knew everything about desert living. Big mistake! In 1996, several hours after arriving at Burning Man, I realized that I was unprepared for the harshness of the desert. I was without any shade and nothing to protect me from the very aggressive alkaline dust that dries out your fingertips and feet, and gets in your lungs. I began to note down what I needed to bring the following year. I was vexed by this unexpected, miserable situation of being unprepared.\u000a\u000aThe following year, I came a bit more prepared but still came short of real comfort. So, I decided that I should do like the locals and I started casually taking pictures of the surrounding camps.\u000a\u000aAt the time I was like every other photographer: far more focused on the art installation than the structures. After some years, having shared my images with the head of the art department of Burning Man, I decided to focus on the fabric of this temporary city and document its diverse shelters, all the while still looking for something myself.\u000a\u000aBuilders can spend all year planning, tweaking and designing their abodes.\u000a\u000aCNN: What about the buildings at Burning Man amazes you?\u000a\u000aPG: The thinking behind them, the constant tweaking, the sheer effort put in by regular people and city slickers to create a unique design to make their neighborhood special -- just for one week. Much like the Rio carnival designers, camp-builders think and test parts and structures all year long because a failure could be catastrophic.\u000a\u000aCNN: Who are the people that are building these structures?\u000a\u000aPG: They come from all walks of life, ingenious city slackers, your resourceful average Joe, aerospace engineers, architecture students, designers, construction workers. The Black Rock Desert is a large canvas to challenge men and women to create fast and sustainable shelters in any shapes possible.\u000a\u000aCNN: Do you think the innovation shown by the architects at Burning Man could give us an insight into the future of architecture in some way?\u000a\u000aPG: Because of the transient nature of the festival and its remoteness, without any direct access to hardware stores, architects, designers and builders must carefully plan in advance the process of building and erecting the structures. Gear must be well-stocked with spares and all the tools necessary for the construction.\u000a\u000aSo the main goal is to have very light components that will flat-pack and can be assembled by non-specialists as fast as possible because of the harsh environment. Designers are looking to inflatable structures, aluminum nodes, domes made of one size struts, pre-cut elements to prevent on site pollution. The ultimate goal of these designers is to create shelters that could be easily implemented in disaster-stricken zones around the world for a low cost.\u000a\u000aThe Dome of Dough was made of 850 loaves of bread in 2013. The builders gifted their neighbor toast at the end of the festival.\u000a\u000aCNN: What is it like watching the buildings being dismantled after the festival?\u000a\u000aPG: It's always a feeling of sadness and loss. A new landscape can appear again, the entire neighborhood shifts. Sometimes this dismantling happens really fast all around you, which can be disorienting after you got used to it for one week and suddenly, in a matter of hours, the landscape, the cityscape is shrinking to nothing. It's disorienting and mood-altering.\u000a\u000aCNN: What is the most unusual building you have seen at Burning Man?\u000a\u000aPG: The loaf shelter made of 850 loaves of bread.

Or is that just too far afield, do you think? [JOHNSON] \u201cNo, no, I'm highly concerned about that, but not only in Europe. Look at the attack on the Metcalf power station in California. We have not solved that. That is a very disconcerting chain of events here. So, trust me, our critical infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber-attack, to potential terrorist attack. And we're not taking this threat seriously enough. It's highly concerning.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohnson on the threat of another ISIS attack in Europe: \u201cWell, we're being told there are no specific, credible threats. And I have to believe the officials. And it would make sense that there are probably more plots being hatched in Europe as we speak. Europe obviously is in greater danger. They're in closer proximity to the Middle East. We're seeing this surge of refugees. We now know that a couple of those terrorists came into Europe with that refugee flow. So what we're unraveling or what the officials in Europe are unraveling are these cells and these plots. And, unfortunately, this is exactly what Islamic terrorists are trying to sow, what you're seeing in Brussels today, the type of civil unrest. They're trying to destabilize different countries. And they're doing a pretty good job of it.\u000a\u000aJohnson on his strategy to defeat ISIS: \u201cWe need to just have a more robust effort. We need to assemble that coalition of the willing. And the reason we haven't assembled them is because we have not shown the leadership. President Obama took off the table that - the same day that he declared the goal, he basically took off the table the very ingredient that was going to be necessary. And that's American troops on the ground. Now, I don't think we have to have that many of them. We haven't heard out of this administration a real strategy for defeating ISIS. But we actually have to show the leadership, so that the coalition of the willing will actually assemble around us. And let's face it. I think Europe is probably a little bit more primed to really join that coalition. This has got to be a long-term effort. The historic blunder of President Obama was leaving Iraq. After all the sacrifice, after the stabilization of the Iraq, we bugged out. And as a result, that coalition disintegrated, and ISIS was able to rise from the ashes of what was a defeated al Qaeda in Iraq. We have to learn the lessons of histories. We have to be relentless in our pursuit of stamping out Islamic terror.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohnson on using torture as an interrogation technique: [TAPPER] \u201c\u2026Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, said this week he would have talked a lot faster with the torture. Do you agree?\u201d [JOHNSON] \u201cWhat we really need to do - and I have been down to Guantanamo Bay and I have talked to the people that do the interviews. And the way you actually gather intelligence that's effective is over a long period of time. And what this administration has done, in their quest to close down Guantanamo Bay, we stopped capturing, detaining and questioning Islamic terrorists. Now, we're doing some of that. We're starting to capture some of the Islamic terrorists, some of the ISIS operatives. Fortunately, we captured one that was a former Iraqi chemical weapons expert. And that individual apparently started to sing like a canary. So, we were able to take out some of those installations. But we need a long-term facility for long-term detention. And that's really how you gather intelligence, is capturing people, detaining them, and interviewing them over a long period of time, finding discrepancies between themselves - between their own testimony and that of their fellow operatives.\u201d\u000a\u000aFULL POST

aVNanjing, China (CNN) Outside China, architect Zhou Qi is best known for the People's Daily headquarters, a Beijing tower that went viral in 2013 when social media users drew attention to its distinctly phallic appearance.\u000a\u000aBut the building's notoriety does a disservice to its designer.\u000a\u000aNot only did the 590-foot (180-meter) skyscraper go on to win an international award (the viral photographs had been taken during construction), it also distracts from a distinguished architectural career.\u000a\u000aZhou may design the occasional high-rise, but he spends most of his time restoring treasured pre-war buildings in his home city of Nanjing.\u000a\u000aA city endures\u000a\u000aAs rampant development unfolds across urban China, the country's former capital has retained much of its old charm. Many historic buildings still stand in Nanjing amid the steel and glass.\u000a\u000aAnd over 100 of them owe their longevity to Zhou. From a disused church to a crumbling hotel, he has breathed new life into the city's buildings, fighting to preserve the past in a country where heritage is often forfeited in the name of progress.\u000a\u000aThe new headquarters of the People's Daily newspaper during construction.\u000a\u000a"This preservation work is so important," Zhou told CNN at his office in Nanjing's Southeast University, part of a magnificent Western-style campus dating back to 1902. "It means we can keep old buildings for our own use -- and for the next generation. Through them you can see that the city is alive."\u000a\u000aSite of Nanjing's former provisional government senate.\u000a\u000aThe abundance of historic buildings in Nanjing -- both Western and Chinese in style -- results from the city's unique past.\u000a\u000aMost of the finest examples date back to Nanjing's time as the country's capital, before the Communists came to power in 1949, according Charles Musgrove, author of "China's Contested Capital: Architecture, Ritual, and Response in Nanjing."\u000a\u000a"From 1927 to 1937 quite a few government buildings were constructed along the main artery of the city, Sun Yat-sen Boulevard," he said over email. "Mostly, these buildings housed key ministries, particularly those that it was believed would help the government raise revenue for investment in infrastructure."\u000a\u000aThe area is also home to banks, churches and mansions from this era. Zhou says that around 80% of the period's noteworthy architecture remains, albeit in varying states of disrepair.\u000a\u000aFit for purpose\u000a\u000aJust over a mile south of Zhou's office stands the Dahua Cinema, a 1930s structure that once housed a movie theater and concert hall. When the architect's team began renovating the building in 2008, it had been in disuse for almost 15 years.\u000a\u000aToday, the cinema has been restored to its former glory -- or something resembling it. The building's Art Deco design has been revived with a grand foyer composed of striking red columns and golden embellishments.\u000a\u000aThe Dahua Theater.\u000a\u000aBut Zhou describes restoration projects as exercises in compromise. Although he occasionally -- and painstakingly -- restores old buildings to their original form, he is normally tasked with preparing them for the 21st century.\u000a\u000aAt the Dahua Cinema, for instance, Zhou was forced to sacrifice much of the building's interior to accommodate the trappings of a modern movie theater: cafes, popcorn vendors and multiple screening rooms.\u000a\u000a"These projects have to meet the requirements of modern use," he said. "We have make sure the building has another 100 years of life.\u000a\u000a"It can be very controversial. Sometimes, if we make the interiors especially modern, people say that we shouldn't have. But while historic buildings have to be preserved, they also have to offer new functions."\u000a\u000aZhou's pragmatic approach makes restoration more appealing to city authorities and private developers alike.\u000a\u000aA modern cinema will generate more revenue than a faithfully restored monument to the past, offsetting the substantial cost of the work.\u000a\u000a"Preserving these buildings can cost three times as much as it would to just destroy them and build new ones -- it requires a lot of energy and money," Zhou said, referring to an old British-built storage facility that he is transforming into a shopping mall.\u000a\u000aOne of his most extensive projects to date, Zhou must feed steel reinforcements into the structure's dilapidated concrete frame before cosmetic work can begin.\u000a\u000aChanging attitudes to heritage\u000a\u000aIt appears that government protection, not economic forces, has kept the bulldozers at bay. In the last two decades there has been a sea change in official attitudes, according to Musgrove, who is also an associate history professor at St. Mary's College of Maryland.\u000a\u000a"When I first lived in Nanjing back in 1996 (...) a lot of old buildings were being torn down," he said. "And while the officials I talked to recognized the cultural value of the old architecture, they clearly wished they could work in one of the new 'modern' (government) buildings being built.\u000a\u000a"(Now) Nanjing city officials seem to have woken up to the fact that these buildings provide a distinctive quality to the city that can be used to add a special cultural cachet (...) and to attract tourists."\u000a\u000aAcross China, buildings with historical value are being offered national-, provincial-, city- and even district-level protection.\u000a\u000aPublished in 2010, the Nanjing government's ten-year plan for protecting the city's heritage pledges to "emphasize the revival of history and culture" while "strengthening the organic integration of various historical and cultural sites (with) modern city functions."\u000a\u000aThese protections, which now safeguard hundreds of buildings in Nanjing, forbid property owners and developers from making certain alterations and have been designed to enhance "the vitality of the old city."\u000a\u000aA former Communist Party building in Meiyuan Xincun.\u000a\u000aThis can be considered progress in a country with a reputation for demolishing the past. In Beijing, for instance, large swathes of the old city were razed as part of Mao Zedong's campaign to destroy what he called the "Four Olds" (old customs, old culture, old habits and old ideas).\u000a\u000a"During the Cultural Revolution, people tried to destroy everything -- like the Taliban," Zhou observed.\u000a\u000aAs neither a political or commercial hub, Nanjing was afforded protection of sorts. Zhou also attributes old buildings' survival to the city's slow urban development when compared to nearby Shanghai, which accommodates more than three times the population.\u000a\u000aPioneering preservation\u000a\u000aBut while old buildings remained, it was not until the late 1980s that Zhou perceived any official interest in protecting them. Despite providing little to no funding for restoration at that time, the city's government helped him survey old government buildings -- the first research of its kind in Nanjing.\u000a\u000aBy the time he returned from completing a Ph.D. in Chicago in 2003, public and private heritage projects were becoming commonplace. Now, Zhou's team at Southeast University -- which comprises architects, researchers and mature students -- typically carries out five or six restorations at any one time.\u000a\u000a"Over the last 20 years, the government has made real efforts to establish national laws, local laws and regulations so we can pursue this work," he said, of his optimism for the city's heritage preservation efforts. "It has just become common sense."

aV(CNN) The worlds of horror films, science fiction and heavy metal have always shared a set of thematic and aesthetic similarities -- blood, space, screams, monsters. Countless heavy bands from Slayer to System of a Down have been influenced by the books of William Gibson, Wes Craven, Clive Barker and Dario Argento, and schlock metal icon Rob Zombie has even directed several horror movies himself, including a remake of the classic "Halloween."\u000a\u000aFollowing in this long tradition comes an enormous display of horror and sci-fi movie posters at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, on loan from Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett.\u000a\u000aSpanning nearly 50 years, the show brings us into the personal obsession of a guitar hero and reveals some of the fears and illicit desires of the American public in the 20th century, shedding light on what scares us and why. Curator Daniel Finamore explains:\u000a\u000aCNN: How did Kirk Hammett come to own such an incredible collection?\u000a\u000aDaniel Finamore: The objects come from a wide range of sources, but nobody really collected them until fairly recent times, so there's no traditional archive of this material. They were mostly thrown away. Some of these posters are much rarer than one might expect them to be ... They were produced by the thousand, but that doesn't mean that thousands survive.\u000a\u000aThey've turned up in all sorts of places unexpectedly. In one famous example, Kirk has a three-sheet poster for "Frankenstein," produced in 1931, and it's the only surviving example. It was found in a projection booth that had been boarded up when they were remodeling the theater ... It hadn't been mounted since the '30s.\u000a\u000aKirk Hammett at the Peabody Essex Museum\u000a\u000aWho are the artists behind these posters?\u000a\u000aAmerican movie posters are almost entirely anonymous. The artists were never allowed to sign their work. Some European posters are signed because the tradition of poster art is considered more credible there. Some of the classics, which are such wonderful works with such skilled lithography ... we have no idea who made them.\u000a\u000aWhat do these posters tell us about the fears of American society?\u000a\u000aIt definitely changes over the course of time. Each era had a different source of fear. In the earlier years, it was much less based in horror from outside our known world. The stories originated with a sense of romance ... The engagement was more based in having empathy with the monster, rather than fear of it. It was more based in a terror within humanity ..."How could we treat the monster that way?"\u000a\u000aAfter WWII and the atomic bomb, aliens are suddenly invading from outer space. People were much more aware of our place in the cosmos. We also have a section on the changing role of women in these films, whether they're helpless victims in the jaws of giant spiders or wherever they're more aggressive, like in "Barbarella."\u000a\u000aThen we close the show with a section on zombies, which everyone knows are in ascendance on film and TV ... Why that is is anyone's guess.\u000a\u000a"Frankenstein" (c. 1931) by Roland Coudon for Universal Pictures\u000a\u000aAre the posters sometimes better than the actual films? Is there a sense that they were doing things that cinema couldn't at the time?\u000a\u000aFor most periods, the films and the posters match each other in terms of impact, but there is a nadir in the '50s and early '60s when there are a lot of very low budget sci-fi films that had very effective, wonderful, evocative posters. You'd see one of the posters and have to go see the film ... and invariably be disappointed.\u000a\u000aPeople who were involved in the production of those films have said things to the effect of "Getting people into the theater was the only goal." These films were made as date films and it was said that if you were still watching the film 20 minutes into your date, it was not a successful date.\u000a\u000aThis was not high art ... In fact, there was one interview with a film producer from that era who said that they used to pour all their energy into creating these posters and shop the films around using the posters as promotional material. If they had enough interest from the theaters, then they would go out and shoot the film.\u000a\u000aThe film was really an afterthought. They didn't even have a screenplay written. It was all based around the poster.

aV(CNN) At first glance a Rio de Janiero favela would seem an unlikely place to find an athlete who was one of the sporting stories of the last Olympics.\u000a\u000aJudoka Popole Misenga -- one of the stars of the refugee team at the Rio 2016 Games -- lives with his partner and children in the Bras de Pina favela in the northern part of the sprawling Brazilian city.\u000a\u000aIt's a place that, on some days, isn't safe enough for him to jog through. Its streets are frequented by drug dealers and occasional police presence.\u000a\u000aIn the first two months of 2017, at least 182 people were killed during police operations in Rio's favelas -- a 78% increase on the same period in 2016, according to official figures, reported by Amnesty International\u000a\u000aBut Misenga, who ran away from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) team camp at the 2013 World Championships in Rio, remains eternally grateful the city gave him a home, helping him compete at the Summer Games last year.\u000a\u000a"My life really changed after the Olympics," Misenga told CNN. "I have a good life now. I don't need to worry every day if I can feed my family.\u000a\u000a"I've been supported by the IOC [International Olympic Committee] and Visa since last year," he added referring to the US financial services company.\u000a\u000aPopole Misenga in the Rio favela where he now calls home.\u000a\u000aRescue\u000a\u000aJudo has given Misenga the life he has longed for since he was orphaned at the age of nine when his mother was killed.\u000a\u000a"I was separated from my family when I was nine," said the 25-year-old. "My mum got killed and I ran for days in the woods and I was rescued by UNICEF."\u000a\u000aIt was at a training camp in the DRC that Misenga was first introduced to judo, where his robust physical frame caught the eye of the coaches.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Legends of judo: Teddy Riner, the best ever?

Another Congolese competitor, Yolande Mabika, made the decision to abscond from the team before returning to fetch Misenga a few days later.\u000a\u000a"It was a very hard time," he says. "I didn't have a home, money or food. Everything was missing in my life.\u000a\u000a"I was hungry and it was a lot to suffer. So I decided to stay here, that I'm going to find a way, that someone will help me but I won't go home."\u000a\u000aThe pair walked the streets until they met another refugee from Angola who introduced them to the Bras de Pina favela, and Misenga scraped around for any work he could get.\u000a\u000aThat changed in 2015 when he was introduced to the Insituto Reacão where he was invited to train by Brazilian judoka and Olympic bronze medalist Flavio Canot.\u000a\u000aThe institute is run to help disenfranchised youth affected by poverty and crime.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Having long ago committed himself to the proposition that there is no such thing as too much press, Donald Trump may be the most photographed, filmed and quoted man of our time.\u000a\u000aAdd his own words, offered in books, speeches, Facebook posts and Tweets, and you might conclude that there's little left for this man to share.\u000a\u000aBut think again. What if all those words were intended, not to reveal, but conceal? What if Trump talks so much because he wants to control the conversation?\u000a\u000aNow that Trump is the GOP's presumptive nominee for president, he'll face more intense scrutiny about his many claims to personal success, his political beliefs, his temperament and his character. In each case, the public record is filled with incidents and examples, but a skeptic finds little clarity.\u000a\u000aThis state of affairs may suffice for anyone buying a steak or an apartment from Trump the salesman, but voters contemplating Trump the candidate for president deserve better answers to the lingering questions.\u000a\u000aHere they are:\u000a\u000aWhat is Trump's temperament?\u000a\u000aTV audiences have been treated to more than 100 episodes of Trump's reality TV shows "The Apprentice" and "Celebrity Apprentice."

More useful is the cumulative Trump record, which includes as many negatives as positives.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aTo Trump's credit, he has shown himself to be resilient, coming back from failures that would have sent less confident men and women into business exile. Most notable, of course, is the crisis he experienced in the early 1990s when he was unable to pay personal and corporate debts in the neighborhood of $3.4 billion\u000a\u000aTrump is also a nimble entrepreneur, who looks for opportunities and seizes them decisively. Witness his ability to deal in real estate, entertainment and retail merchandising, all at the same time.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the ledger, open questions remain about his consistent record of cruelty and excess when dealing with critics and competitors. Trump's code begins with the belief that he's justified in "hitting back ten times harder" whenever he's offended. If our presidents believed in this approach, America would have engaged in shooting wars with untold numbers of countries that have, in recent decades, committed transgressions against the United States.\u000a\u000aWould Trump have hit back 10 times harder when North Korea detained the spy ship Pueblo? What about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over the territory of our ally Ukraine. U.S. intelligence indicates a Russia missile likely was responsible. Would Trump have responded by downing 10 Aeroflot planes?\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Keeping Them Honest: Trump on Afghanistan & gun control Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Keeping Them Honest: Trump on Afghanistan & gun control 03:48\u000a\u000aWe can ask additional questions about Trump's penchant for bullying. In some cases this trait has shown itself in mere words, as he has attempted to humiliate, disparage and marginalize others. In other instances he has sought to force innocent landowners off their properties to make way for his developments. This willingness to use any means necessary to get what he wants raises serious concern about Trump's ability to manage America's affairs in a complex world.\u000a\u000aWhat does Trump believe?\u000a\u000aMore than any political figure in modern times, Trump represents an ideological puzzle. Although he now claims the conservative Republican mantle, he has often associated himself with liberal and Democratic Party ideas. In 1999 he told CNN, "I've actually been an activist Democrat and Republican."\u000a\u000aIn the past, Trump said he is "totally pro-choice." Now he is against abortion rights, recently musing about punishing women who might violate a ban on the procedure.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary 02:02\u000a\u000aIn the past, Trump was in favor of levying a big tax on the rich , himself included, to pay down the federal deficit. Like banks, rich people have the money, and Trump reasoned that they could afford to help the country out. Today, Trump is in favor of big tax cuts for the wealthy.\u000a\u000aIn 2000 Trump proposed banning private ownership of assault weapons and increasing the waiting period for the purchase of guns. In the current campaign he has declared himself to be an ardent defender of gun rights, and he has even proposed eliminating gun-free zones near schools.\u000a\u000aThe list of Trump flip-flops is long and includes his positions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his regard for Hillary Clinton's performance as secretary of state. Voters, especially those conservatives who want a clear sense of what their standard-bearer will do as president, deserve explanations for these shifts.\u000a\u000aHow rich is he?\u000a\u000aThroughout his life Trump has cited his wealth as evidence of his excellence but without offering verifiable proof of his claims. In the 1970s he cruised Manhattan in a chauffeured limousine and gave others the impression that he was in control of the $200 million fortune amassed by his father.\u000a\u000aIn the 1980s, when he first made it onto the Forbes magazine list of America's wealthiest men and women, Trump complained often and loudly about how his holdings were underestimated. More recently he said he is worth some $10 billion.\u000a\u000aThe record produced by those who have looked closely at Trump's finances raises many questions. Writer Wayne Barrett reported in the 1980s that Trump's income as of 1978 was less than $100,000. In the 1993 biography of Trump called "Lost Tycoon," Harry Hurt III noted that during his divorce from his first wife, Ivana, her attorneys found that Trump had never been worth the billions of dollars he claimed. Hurt also reported that in March 1992, Trump's own lawyers said he could not afford to pay Ivana even half of the $20 million he had offered as a settlement.\u000a\u000aMore recently doubts about his wealth arose in 2005 when journalist Tim O'Brien wrote that Trump was probably worth between $150 million and $250 million. For a man who reveled in his image as a billionaire, O'Brien's estimate was too much to bear. Trump sued. The case was dismissed by the trial judge. Trump appealed. He lost\u000a\u000aWere Trump a more circumspect and well-mannered man, who never bragged about how rich he is, his wealth would be less of an issue. However Trump has made his fortune such an important part of his identity that voters deserve to know the truth. Many of the facts are contained in Trump's personal income tax filings, and it is now a campaign tradition for candidates to make these documents public. Clinton has made public all of her returns going back to 2000.\u000a\u000aSo far, Trump has refused to release his returns because, he says, he is undergoing an audit on returns filed in the last few years. Nothing in the law, or in federal regulations, would prohibit him from making the documents public now, but if he is uncomfortable with releasing those forms, he could simply match Clinton for those years that are settled.\u000a\u000aSuch a release would reassure the public that Trump is who he says he is -- a really rich man -- and allow a glimpse into other matters, including his charitable giving. It is a matter of conservative orthodoxy that the rich should be spared excessive taxation so they can support society freely with their philanthropy.\u000a\u000aIs he a man of character?\u000a\u000aPersonality, which can be seen in a smile, heard in a glib remark or felt when viewing a performance, is not the most important measure of a man or woman. Many people with winning personalities are, in fact, hucksters, con men, manipulators and deceivers. In fact, the false signals flashed by well-practiced performers, including politicians, compel us to look for the signs of the character beneath the personality.\u000a\u000aExperts in assessing character generally look for some traits such as autonomy and life purpose that Trump clearly possesses in abundance. But there are other areas of character , including positive relations with others, ethical behavior, empathy, honesty and humility where Trump would not achieve a very high score.\u000a\u000aIn his long and very public life, Trump has often shown he is willing to do things others consider wrong in order to get what he wants. This includes using a false identity to make claims about his success, carrying out a bitter divorce dispute in the tabloid press, criticizing the appearance of others and refusing to take the high road when offered the chance.\u000a\u000aThe most troubling aspect of Trump's character can be seen in his devotion to the so-called birther campaign that sought to delegitimize President Barack Obama. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, birthers led by Trump insisted that some mystery surrounded Obama's status as a citizen born in the United States.\u000a\u000aLong after documents were produced to settle this falsely posed question, Trump continued to raise doubts and thus signal his allegiance to those who considered the President to be an unworthy "other." The racism latent in the birther movement was documented in a study by University of Delaware psychologist Eric Heyman, but the link to prejudice was always plain to see. Rather than stand against birtherism, Trump built a following by exploiting it.\u000a\u000aIn fact, one can find precedent for Trump's birtherism in his previous provocative statements about racially sensitive subjects. Other evidence of his character can be found in his selective use of facts, his tendency to inflame conflict rather than cool it and his devotion to self-promotion.\u000a\u000aIn the past Trump's character has been well-suited to his pursuit of success as he defines it. But as revealed thus far, it would disqualify him when it comes to the presidency. We can only hope Trump has something better to show and will do it when placed under the pressure of the coming campaign.

aVIn 1964 Edward Mukuka Nkoloso, high school teacher and self-appointed director of Zambia's national space program, had the bold ambition of beating the USA and the Soviet Union in the space race, and landing a Zambian on the Moon.\u000a\u000aUsing unconventional techniques, such as spinning students around a tree in an oil drum, Nkoloso trained 12 astronauts. He was unsuccessful, but in 2014 there was a film released inspired by his efforts.\u000a\u000aFortunately Africa's space programs now look much more promising. In fact, in the last decade the continent has entered a space race.\u000a\u000aNigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Egypt and Algeria have taken a renewed interests in their existing programs, with Ghana and Kenya joining the club, launching their own space projects in the last few years.\u000a\u000aTwo big players\u000a\u000aWhile no African country is within realistic reach of moon travel yet, Nigeria and South Africa have by far the most advanced space programs on the continent.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa is set to host the world's biggest radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).\u000a\u000aIf successful, they claim the telescope will enable astronomers to look much deeper into space -- at the sensitivity of many times current telescopes. The first phase will cost approximately $790 million.\u000a\u000aAn artist's impression of South Africa's SKA telescope\u000a\u000a"What drove this project was a need for the next generation radio telescope with a preference for the southern hemisphere as then you can view the centre of our galaxy," says Carla Sharpe, Business Manager at SKA.\u000a\u000a"When you're studying space with an optical telescope you're only observing the visible light, whereas a radio telescope can observe the electromagnetic spectrum over a number of frequencies," she adds.\u000a\u000aHowever, Sharpe disagrees that there is an African space race per se. Instead, African countries see space programs as an important part of economic development.\u000a\u000a"In general African countries accept that developing technology drives growth and that space is a great area for technology development. It's accepted as a new market we can still get into," Sharpe continues.\u000a\u000aAlthough space programs in Africa are frequently criticized for being a waste of money, particularly with the presence of more immediate concerns.\u000a\u000aSharpe responds: "Space science and technology is not just rockets. It's everything from data analytics, data storage and transport and more. There are so many areas of development within the arena which are classed as space science."\u000a\u000aSpace exploration\u000a\u000aSouth Africa has set its sights on space observation, but what about space travel?\u000a\u000aIn that field, Nigeria is leading the charge.

aV(CNN) Millions of Americans are uncertain about their future as a new health care bill heads to the Senate.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would shake things up. It could open the door for insurers to charge sick people and pregnant women much higher premiums.\u000a\u000aUnder Obamacare, all insurers are required to charge everyone the same premium, despite their medical history. This new version of the bill would weaken protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\u000a\u000aWhat is a pre-existing condition?\u000a\u000aIt's a "health problem you had before the date that new health coverage starts," the US Department of Health and Human Services says.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 52 million of adults under 65 years have pre-existing health issues, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found.\u000a\u000aBut the term itself is vague and every insurance company has their own lists of "declinable" or "uninsurable" conditions.\u000a\u000aSome companies even considered domestic violence and rape a pre-existing condition before the Obamacare era.\u000a\u000aDo I have a pre-existing condition?\u000a\u000aMaybe.

Three of the largest insurers in the US -- United Healthcare, Cigna and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield -- considered a person generally "uninsurable" and could decline coverage without reviewing any medical records if an applicant had a certain health issue.

aV(CNN) Yum, who's hungry for a slice of cake loaded with bacteria? A chip dipped in both salsa and bacteria? Mmm, what about a piece of toast that just fell on the bacteria-covered floor?\u000a\u000aGetting some bacteria with your food is the risk you take if you eat birthday cake after the candles have been blown out, dip a chip in salsa after someone else double-dips or eat toast that has fallen on the floor -- yes, even just for five seconds.\u000a\u000aEvery year, Dawson and a group of his undergraduate and graduate students come up with a research project related to our food habits and then quantify how dirty it actually is. He and another colleague are also working on a book about his fascinating food findings.\u000a\u000aHow many of these are you guilty of?\u000a\u000aThe double-dip\u000a\u000aAt one point in an iconic "Seinfeld" episode , George Costanza takes a bite of a chip filled with dip. When he goes for more dip with the same chip, he is quickly confronted about "double-dipping."\u000a\u000a"That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip!" another character says.\u000a\u000aThose who oppose double-dipping say it spreads germs from your mouth into shared food. After watching a rerun of that episode, Dawson was inspired to test the theory . He and his team put chips in three types of dip with different pH levels and consistencies: salsa, chocolate syrup and queso.\u000a\u000aNo mouth bacteria were found in the dips when chips were dipped only once. But when double-dipping occurred, there were much higher bacterial populations in the dip. And the type mattered: Salsa that had been double-dipped had five times more bacteria than the chocolate and cheese.\u000a\u000aDawson attributed this to some basic food science principles.\u000a\u000a"Common sense tells you that if you bite it and dip it in the salsa and more of it falls back into the bowl and doesn't stick to the chip, then there's going to be more bacteria going back in the bowl with it," he said.\u000a\u000aThick chocolate syrup and cheese dip are more likely to stay on a chip, resulting in less bacterial transfer.\u000a\u000aFive seconds on the floor\u000a\u000aUrban legend says that if you pick up dropped food from the floor within five seconds, it's safe to eat, because it is not enough time for contamination to take place.\u000a\u000aDawson and his students set out to understand the truth behind this food trope.\u000a\u000aThey spread salmonella bacteria on tile, carpet and wood. After five minutes, they put down bologna or bread and left it there for five, 30 or 60 seconds. They did the same thing after bacteria had been on the surface for two, four, eight and 24 hours.\u000a\u000a"There was enough bacterial transfer in five seconds that from a practical standpoint, it's not a really good idea to eat food from the floor," Dawson said.\u000a\u000aHe said he doesn't think it's time on the floor that matters so much, but rather the type and amount of bacteria.\u000a\u000a"Really, it depends on what's been on the surface. The odds are, there's probably nothing there. But there's always the chance something could be," he said.\u000a\u000aDonald Schaffner , a food microbiologist at Rutgers University, conducted the only other peer-reviewed five-second rule study . His findings, published last year, confirmed Dawson's and showed that longer contact times with a contaminated floor resulted in the transfer of more bacteria.\u000a\u000a"In one sense, the five-second rule is not true, because there was no safe amount of time (for food to be on the floor), but on the other hand, time really did seem to make a difference, especially with certain foods," he said.\u000a\u000aSchaffner found that the type of food, as well as the surface on which the food fell, also influenced the amount of bacteria transferred. Wet foods were more likely to pick up bacteria, and surfaces such as carpets were less likely to transfer bacteria. He said these factors are important to consider when weighing whether to apply the five-second rule.\u000a\u000a"If it's my floor in my house and I know how clean my house is and it's a relatively dry piece of food like a piece of cereal, yeah, I'll eat that up off the floor," Schaffner said.\u000a\u000a"But if it's a big sloppy wet piece of watermelon that drops in my kitchen, where I walk and my dogs walk, no, I'm definitely not going to eat that, because I know the risk is much higher."\u000a\u000aThe worst party favor: germs\u000a\u000aBlowing out candles on a birthday cake is a tradition that some scholars say dates to ancient Greece. But because your mouth contains bacteria that can spread through blowing, the practice is pretty dirty.\u000a\u000aDawson discovered that when candles are blown out on a cake, there was 1400% -- or 15 times -- more bacteria on the frosting than on frosting with candles that were not blown out.\u000a\u000aTo simulate a birthday party and activate the salivary glands, Dawson's research team first ate some pizza. But instead of a cake, they spread frosting on foil and placed it on top of a Styrofoam disc, along with 17 candles. After all the candles were blown out, the number and type of bacteria in the frosting were measured.\u000a\u000a"The amount of bacteria varies a lot from person to person based on how sloppy someone is when blowing their candles out, but it does occur," Dawson said. "I don't know the chance of this occurring, but in fact if someone is sick, carrying a disease, and blows on the birthday cake, there is going to be bacterial transfer."\u000a\u000aBeware the beer pong ball\u000a\u000aIt's a simple concept practiced by college students across the country: Throw a pingpong ball across a table and hope it lands inside a plastic cup filled with beer on the other side. If the ball goes in, the other person has to drink the whole beer.\u000a\u000aExcept a pingpong ball may be covered in more bacteria than you might expect. The ball could have been bounced on the table, fallen on the floor, been in someone's hands or landed in a cup of beer -- surfaces that all contain bacteria.\u000a\u000aFor this experiment , Dawson sent his students to collect pingpong balls from indoor and outdoor tailgates during a football game at Clemson.\u000a\u000aThe highest levels of bacteria were found on balls from outdoor beer pong games. They also discovered that nearly all of the bacteria on the pingpong balls transferred directly into the beer.\u000a\u000aMind the popcorn hands\u000a\u000aSharing a bowl of popcorn at movies, sporting events, fairs and concerts is common practice. And it seems to carry only a very low risk of bacterial transmission.\u000a\u000aDawson and his team spread a noninfectious E. coli strain on people's hands and then measured how much was transferred to the popcorn they picked up and the kernels left in the bowl. Though they observed that bacteria transferred to both the popcorn in the hand and the popcorn in the bowl, the rate of transfer was only 0.2% and 0.0009%, respectively.\u000a\u000aOf 136 tests, 24 resulted in no bacterial transfer to the popcorn at all.\u000a\u000aNot-so-refreshing drink\u000a\u000aYou might want to think again after telling a waiter that you would like a lemon in your ice water. In restaurants, lemons are often left in open containers at room temperature, where anyone can access them, and are sometimes refrigerated overnight and used the next day to reduce waste. Food workers also may not always have clean hands when handling lemons. And depending on where ice is stored and how it's picked up, it can contain bacteria, too.\u000a\u000aDawson and his researchers set out to test the rate of bacterial transfer to both lemons and ice by inoculating their hands or ice scoops with E. coli and then handling the two items. One hundred percent of the bacteria were transferred to wet lemons, but only 30% was transferred to dry lemons.\u000a\u000aFor ice, an average of 19% of the bacteria on hands were transferred, while an average of 66% of bacteria on the ice scoop were transferred.\u000a\u000aThey also found that lemons contaminated with E. coli and left at room temperature for 24 hours had an increased bacterial population. Inoculated lemons refrigerated for 24 hours had less E. coli the next day than those left at room temperature overnight. But the bacteria in refrigerated lemons were still able to survive.\u000a\u000aChecking out the menu\u000a\u000aAs soon as you sit down at a restaurant, the waiter hands over a menu. You flip through all the pages and check out the back to make sure you don't miss anything delicious. But those restaurant menus are often not washed and can be another culprit in the spread of bacteria.\u000a\u000aAfter collecting random samples of local restaurant menus and testing them for bacteria, Dawson and his team discovered that for the most part, there were low numbers of bacteria living on them. At busier restaurant times, higher numbers of bacteria were on menus than in less busy periods.\u000a\u000aWhen the researchers contaminated the menus with E. coli, 11% of the bacteria were transferred to people's hands. Low amounts of the bacteria were also able to survive on the menus over a period of one or two days.\u000a\u000aBut is eating bacteria actually that bad?\u000a\u000aDawson's studies illustrate that there is a risk of bacterial transfer from many everyday food habits.\u000a\u000aBut besides feeling grossed out, should we be worried?\u000a\u000aAs Dawson and Schaffner pointed out in their five-second rule studies, risk is often dependent on the type of bacteria. And that mostly depends on where the bacteria came from.\u000a\u000aJohn Molinari , a spokesman for the American Dental Association and an oral infection control expert, said that for some of these scenarios, such as double-dipping or blowing out candles on a birthday cake, it depends on the health of the people you're sharing with.\u000a\u000a"When someone is sick, they don't have normal oral flora in the mouth. If they have a strep throat, that's a type of bacteria that can cause an infection in people if it spreads," Molinari said. "For the most part, everyone just has common nonpathogenic bacteria in their mouths. But when a person gets sick, that dynamic changes."\u000a\u000aRandy Worobo , a food microbiologist at Cornell University, agreed.\u000a\u000a"I would say that a good rule is, if a person is sick, they really shouldn't be sharing food or preparing food to share with other people," he said. "You don't want to end up like Typhoid Mary."\u000a\u000aMary Mallon, who became known as Typhoid Mary , worked as cook in the early 1900s and spread typhoid to many people who ate her food despite never developing symptoms herself.\u000a\u000aWorobo added that in situations involving bacteria on the floor, like the five-second rule and beer pong, most bacteria are probably normal organisms found in soil.\u000a\u000a"But if it's in the kitchen and you've dropped meat or poultry or meat juice has dripped and not been cleaned properly, that has the potential for campylobacter and salmonella to be present on the floor," he said. "So safety really depends on what has been on the floor prior."\u000a\u000aSchaffner applauds Dawson's efforts to teach undergraduate and graduate students how to conduct research. But he thinks these studies may need more outside replication and statistical analysis to confirm the results. He also says the overall risk of contracting a disease through any of these situations is low.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Relatively speaking, these are going to be rare events. We obviously don't see a lot of disease outbreaks from this," Schaffner said. "But people do need to aware of the problem and evaluate their level of risk based on the situation."\u000a\u000aAnd that's the message Dawson intends to convey: not that people should be afraid to eat but that they should be knowledgeable about the right ways to do it.\u000a\u000a"These studies are not really big food safety issues, but they're interesting and fun. I hope they do make people aware of good hygiene," he said. "But, I don't want anyone to be a germophobe about it."

aVSee Momo run.\u000a\u000aSee Momo run faster, farther and with far more vigor, energy and youthfulness, his owners say, now that he's taking a drug meant for humans with cancer.\u000a\u000a"It's been remarkable," Paola Anderson said as she watched Momo, her 13-year-old white Pomsky, run around the backyard, keeping up with dogs a third his age.\u000a\u000aThe drug is called rapamycin. After nearly a decade of research showing that it makes mice live up to 60% longer, scientists are trying it out as an anti-aging drug in dogs and humans.\u000a\u000aRapamycin was discovered nearly 50 years ago in soil collected from Easter Island in the South Pacific and studied in a Canadian lab, and it's the most promising drug to fight aging that Arlan Richardson has ever seen.\u000a\u000aA professor at the Reynolds Oklahoma Center on Aging, Richardson has been doing this kind of research for 40 years.\u000a\u000a"It's the best bet we have," he said.\u000a\u000aNow, scientists are moving forward and testing the drug in dogs.\u000a\u000aResearchers at the University of Washington's Dog Aging Project gave rapamycin to 16 dogs and imaged their hearts.\u000a\u000a"It started to function better. It started to look like a more youthful heart," said Matt Kaeberlein, co-director of the Dog Aging Project, who has presented this research at conferences but hasn't yet published it.\u000a\u000aThose dogs took rapamycin for only 10 weeks. Here's what happened to Momo and his "brother," Sherman, who took it for much longer.\u000a\u000aSherman the Pomeranian\u000a\u000aSherman and Momo's story\u000a\u000aFor many years, Momo and Sherman were regular visitors to the Laguna Pet Spa in Laguna Hills, California, getting baths and haircuts.\u000a\u000aThen, on Christmas Eve 2010, their owner dropped them off and never came back.\u000a\u000aAnderson, who runs the spa, said she called the owner, but her phone had been disconnected.\u000a\u000aAnderson was horrified but not shocked. This was during Southern California's housing loan crisis, and this owner wasn't the first to abandon a dog to her care.\u000a\u000aBut this was more than a foreclosure. Sherman was sick, very sick.\u000a\u000aOn Christmas Day, the tiny 8-year-old Pomeranian was vomiting and howling in pain. Anderson rushed him to the emergency room. It was an attack of acute pancreatitis.\u000a\u000aAnderson nursed him back to health and became, in her words, "mom" to Sherman and Momo.\u000a\u000aThe dogs had another mom, too: Anderson's partner, Sarah Godfrey, who was then living in Northern California but moved a few years later to Laguna Hills to live with Anderson and "the boys."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Can dogs smell cancer? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Can dogs smell cancer? 02:21\u000a\u000aAll was well until one day in May 2015, when Sherman fell over. He'd had a stroke.\u000a\u000a"They gave him two weeks to live, unless he had surgery," Anderson remembers. Even with an operation, he had only a 20% chance of surviving.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Godfrey were wary of surgery for a fragile dog who was already 13 years old; that's equivalent to 68 years old for a human being, according to the American Kennel Club\u000a\u000aOver the years, the couple had sought help from an herbalist for people problems, and now they desperately turned to him for help with their pooch problem. The herbalist did some research and came up with a possible treatment: rapamycin.\u000a\u000aExcited but also skeptical, Anderson and Godfrey went online and ran across Kaeberlein and the Aging Dog Project, which was recruiting canine subjects for the rapamycin research.\u000a\u000aThey begged Kaeberlein to enroll Sherman, but the answer was no. Dogs had to be healthy and over 40 pounds. Sherman was neither.\u000a\u000aThe couple calculated their next step.\u000a\u000a"We knew we could go to Mexico and get rapamycin or order it online, but we wanted to be guided by a veterinarian, by a professional," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aThat proved to tougher than they thought.\u000a\u000aFive vets refused to prescribe the drug. Finally, a sixth vet agreed to prescribe rapamycin, but only after consulting with Kaeberlein to determine the best dose for Sherman.\u000a\u000aBy this point, a month after his stroke, Sherman was so weak, he had to be fed by hand and carried everywhere.\u000a\u000aBut rapamycin changed all that, Anderson and Godfrey said.\u000a\u000a"The third day after taking rapamycin, he could eat on his own. By the seventh day, he was walking on his own," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aSixteen months later, the dog who had been given two months to live is still alive, and while clearly old, he's still active and able to run around the yard.\u000a\u000aThat got the moms thinking about Momo. He wasn't sick like Sherman, but at 13, he was getting old and achy and losing stamina. The couple decided to try rapamycin on him, too.\u000a\u000a"Why not have your dog live longer if you can?" Godfrey said.\u000a\u000aShe said that within days of taking the drug, Momo was able to run for hours, whereas before, just a 30-minute walk would tire him out. On a hot summer day when CNN visited, he was able to keep up with Anderson's parents' dogs, who are 4 and 5 years old.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Godfrey couldn't be happier.\u000a\u000a"We call Sherman and Momo our rapamycin babies," Godfrey said.\u000a\u000aArlan Richardson with his Tibetan terrier, MoMo.\u000a\u000aBut there's a catch\u000a\u000aTake a look at the labels for Rapamune , made by Pfizer, and Afinitor (PDF), made by Novartis, two drugs that are essentially the same as rapamycin and are used to treat cancer patients and organ transplant recipients. The list of things that can go wrong is long and horrifying: cancer, diabetes, infections and more.\u000a\u000a"You have to be concerned about these side effects," Kaeberlein said. But that hasn't stopped him from doing research on the drug.\u000a\u000aFirst, Kaeberlein thinks the side effects seen in cancer patients and transplant recipients might not be because of rapamycin per se but because those patients were very sick to begin with, because they were taking a whole host of other drugs as well, or both.\u000a\u000aSecondly, he uses a much lower dose of the drug on his healthy dogs compared with the dose used on sick people.\u000a\u000aRichardson, the aging expert at the University of Oklahoma, agrees with Kaeberlein. He's so convinced that he gave a low dose of rapamycin to his own dog, coincidentally named MoMo.\u000a\u000aMoMo had a heart problem, and Richardson said it stabilized after he started taking rapamycin. He said the Tibetan terrier looks and acts younger than his 14 years, which would be around 80 or 90 in human years.\u000a\u000aPlus, he said, there have been no side effects.\u000a\u000a"We've been doing blood chemistries on her the whole time, and there's nothing bad," Richardson said.\u000a\u000aThe researcher was quick to note that one dog's experience did not constitute proven scientific data -- but he added that he's given rapamycin to tiny monkeys called marmosets and hasn't see any negative side effects for them, either.\u000a\u000aBut what about humans?\u000a\u000aRapamycin has had very limited testing in healthy humans. Novartis gave rapamycin to 218 elderly volunteers , and it enhanced their response to the flu vaccine by 20%.\u000a\u000aThe results "raise the possibility that (rapamycin) may have beneficial effects" on the decline in immune function that occurs naturally as we get older, the study authors wrote.\u000a\u000aThey reported that the side effects of rapamycin were "relatively well-tolerated." Severe side effects, they wrote, occurred at a "similar" rate as those experienced by the patients in the study who took a placebo, or a sugar pill.\u000a\u000aOf the 53 patients on the lowest dose of rapamycin, 22 suffered some side effect, most commonly mouth sores.\u000a\u000aDr. Monica Mita, who's done her own research with drugs like rapamycin, said she thinks the side effects can be managed.\u000a\u000a"It's really a matter of using the right dose and keeping an eye on the patients," said Mita, co-director of experimental therapeutics at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.\u000a\u000aThe future of rapamycin\u000a\u000aKaeberlein, the professor of pathology at the University of Washington, is nervous about this article.\u000a\u000aHe wants readers to know that Momo and Sherman's story is a tale of two dogs -- that's it -- and not scientific evidence in any way, shape or form, especially considering the placebo effect, meaning Momo and Sherman's owners might subconsciously be seeing what they want to see because they believe so much in rapamycin and fought so hard for it.\u000a\u000aHe doesn't want Momo and Sherman's seeming success to "encourage dog owners to go off to their veterinarians and demand rapamycin."\u000a\u000aAnd Kaeberlein, who's also president of the American Aging Association, is nervous for another reason, too.\u000a\u000aHe dislikes the term "anti-aging," as it conjures up images of snake oil salesmen peddling the fountain of youth.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aInstead, he prefers to think in terms of treatments that will delay the onset of diseases of aging, such as dementia or heart disease. In mice, rapamycin has been shown to slow these two types of declines, as well as several others.\u000a\u000aOver the next year, Kaeberlein will be studying rapamycin in a much larger group of dogs: about 150, compared with the 16 he studied earlier.\u000a\u000aHe said other groups are looking at doing more aging studies in rapamycin in humans, too.\u000a\u000aIt's been a long journey for the compound discovered more than half a century ago in the dirt of a South Pacific island.

aVStory highlights Gene Seymour: Jerry Lewis was an imperfect, yet captivating comedian who lived longer than his fiercest critics\u000a\u000aPoking around the legacy he leaves behind should keep us busy for another 91 years, give or take, writes Seymour\u000a\u000aGene Seymour is a film critic who has written about music, movies and culture for The New York Times, Newsday, Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Everything, it seemed, was a joke when it came to Jerry Lewis. Even his reputation -- whether as a comedian, actor, entertainer, moviemaker or philanthropist -- was a setup for somebody somewhere to float balloons or pierce them, the louder the "pop," the better.\u000a\u000aAnd, as was the case with many of Lewis' over-the-top displays of brash, noisy, run-amok slapstick as a performer, the jokes at his own expense threatened to overstay their welcome. The insurgent "sick" comedian Lenny Bruce characteristically took a cheeky, sideways shot at Lewis' efforts to combat muscular dystrophy, but that's because he was Lenny Bruce. Other, lesser lights injected waves of wisecracks about Lewis' veneration by French film critics into the comic biosphere, and how long before those jibes stop being original or funny?

MUST WATCH Jillette: Jerry Lewis was the king of comedy 01:13\u000a\u000aHere's what's really funny: Lewis, who died Sunday at 91, outlasted most, if not all the jokes at his expense to the point that, perhaps, there are now those who wonder whether the French were onto something after all. Martin Scorsese, who directed Lewis as an arrogant talk show host in the 1982 cult classic, "The King of Comedy," certainly thought so, believing Lewis to be both a pioneer and perfectionist among comedy film directors.\u000a\u000aWe may still be some time away from wider appreciation of Lewis' movies, though his passing may help set off more earnest reappraisals. But the absence of Lewis as a living presence may take more getting used to than most of us realize, especially those who aren't old enough to fully appreciate the prominence of Jerry Lewis in American pop culture beginning more than 70 years ago.\u000a\u000aIt was in 1946 that Lewis, a high-school dropout from Newark, New Jersey, teamed up with an Italian-American crooner from Steubenville, Ohio, named Dean Martin to form a nightclub act that transformed them by radio, movies and the fledgling mass medium of television into high-magnitude stars.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) When Kate Townsend took her kids for their back-to-school health checkups last month, she got a surprise.\u000a\u000aThe Western Springs, Illinois, mother of three wanted to make sure their vaccinations were up-to-date. The pediatrician did talk about shots, but also mentioned her daughter's body mass index.\u000a\u000a"She said to my daughter, 'you are in this percentile, which is in total normal range,' but she made it sound like one more number, and that is too big," Townsend said.\u000a\u000aThe family was surprised. The girl is an active volleyball player, Townsend said, who grew 2½ inches this year. "My daughter's in great shape. And she was sensitive about this news. I tried to reassure her 'that is just a number' and to move on."\u000a\u000aTownsend was right, many experts say, because a growing body of research shows that body mass index, or BMI, may not be the best measure for a growing girl -- or for adults.\u000a\u000aAn increasing number of scientists are calling BS on BMI.\u000a\u000aA tool with a different purpose\u000a\u000aBMI is an easy and straightforward tool used to screen for obesity and to gauge whether you should worry about your weight. Divide your weight (in pounds) by your height (in inches) squared, and multiply that number by 703. If the resulting number is 30 or higher, by American standards, you are considered obese. You're overweight if your BMI is between 25 and 29.9. If you're under 18.5, you are underweight. The "normal" range is 18.5 to 24.9.\u000a\u000aBMI was invented in the 1800s for use in population studies. In 1972 , a key study that tested for the best formula to measure body fat percentage in more than 7,400 people found that the BMI formula best measured body-fat percentage as compared to merely calculating weight and height. It was this study that gave BMI its official name -- and its what popularized its use in research. But that study also warned against using BMI to calculate an individual's levels of fat.\u000a\u000a"BMI really was a measurement created for epidemiology to give data that was relative and could be used in research," said Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez , an obesity expert at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Up until the 1980s, he said, doctors and scientists had been using a variety of measures to track whether a person had gained so much weight that it could hurt their health. The variety in measurement made it hard to chart trends. And as doctors were noticing that people were getting bigger, they wanted to understand how big a problem it was.\u000a\u000aA handful of national and international government agencies then started to recommend that doctors use BMI, as it would be a uniform standard and was seen as more accurate than the insurance company height/weight charts the doctors had been using.\u000a\u000aIn 1985, the US National Institutes of Health recommended BMI to measure obesity. In 1997, the World Health Organization jumped on the bandwagon. The US Preventive Services Task Force, which sets guidelines for American medical professionals, still includes it as a measure in its recommendations.\u000a\u000aIt's not only doctors who use it. As the childhood obesity epidemic grew , more than a dozen states started to require schools to chart students' BMIs, with some even recording the measurement on report cards . Life insurance companies may also ask for it to determine whether you should get a policy or are too big a risk.\u000a\u000aYet while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls BMI "a reasonable indicator of body fat," the agency does not recommend that doctors -- or anyone else, for that matter -- use it as a diagnostic tool.\u000a\u000a"Over time, BMI has gained a clinical use, but that was not the original intention behind its creation," Mayo Clinic's Lopez-Jimenez said. "That's because it does have real limitations."\u000a\u000aWhy do they use it?\u000a\u000aBMI is a free and easy way to get a gauge on obesity for research, but as doctors started using it for individuals, they noticed that it doesn't tell the whole story.\u000a\u000a"Some people who are labeled overweight by BMI have a broader frame or more muscle," said Courtney Peterson , an assistant professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Department of Nutrition Sciences.\u000a\u000aPeterson said that the most exact ways to measure obesity can be expensive, so BMI became the "next best thing we use" for adults. But, it's important to think of it as only one of several screening tools that "helps show at a quick glance that this person's health may be hurt by their weight, so it is an important thing to measure." More measurements would be needed to tell the whole story, Peterson noted.\u000a\u000aThat's because BMI doesn't distinguish between fat and muscle, which could be a real problem for someone who is athletic. The average football player, for instance, has a BMI of 31.35 , considered obese by these standards. Yet many of these world-class athletes are solid muscle, and the average player probably does not have a level of fat that will threaten their health.\u000a\u000aa study in the journal BMI can also underestimate the threat for people who are "skinny fat," as some doctors call those who tend to be fit, but have big bellies. Studies show that this belly fat can be more dangerous for health than any other kind, anda study in the journal Frontiers in Public Health found that using BMI as the lone measure missed 50% of cases of people who had what was determined to be dangerous fat that could hurt their health.\u000a\u000aPaul Laursen, co-author of that study, prefers the term "overfat" to "overweight," because it really is the fat, rather than the weight , that hurts your health, he said.\u000a\u000a"We shouldn't be as much worried about weight," said Laursen, an adjunct professor and performance physiologist at the Sports Performance Research Institute in New Zealand. For example, you could have gone on a fad diet and lost three pounds, but that doesn't necessarily make you healthier. Those three pounds could merely have been water weight.\u000a\u000a"What we should really be worried about is the fat part and where your fat is concentrated," Laursen said. BMI misses that level of detail.\u000a\u000aGrowing children can also be shortchanged. Peterson's latest study found that BMI was off 19% of the time in children. The BMI measurements used for children are weighted for age, but when boys go through puberty, they add muscle at a rapid rate; girls add fat. BMI tends to miss these nuances.\u000a\u000aBMI can also miss subtle racial differences. Peterson explains that African-Americans tend to have more muscle than fat, compared with Caucasians. Doctors in some countries have had to adjust their BMI ratios because studies have shown that Asians are at a greater risk for heart disease at much lower BMI than non-Asians.\u000a\u000aWhat should doctors use?\u000a\u000aOne of the most exact ways to measure obesity is an X-ray, which can distinguish between fat and other innards. But that is expensive, and regular radiation exposure is not advised, so hospitals and doctors are trying a variety of methods and tools.\u000a\u000aSome hospitals use a highly accurate machine for a bioelectrical impedance analysis , which runs an electric current through body tissue to determine fat composition. The Mayo Clinic's Lopez-Jimenez uses a Bod Pod, which takes measurements based on body volume. He recommends against the scales or handheld devices available on the consumer market, as they are not precise.\u000a\u000aWhere kids are concerned, if you can't get a bioelectrical impedance analysis, Peterson suggests a measurement called TMI , or tri-ponderal body mass index. The calculation is weight divided by height cubed. Her study showed that this was a much better measure of obesity for kids between 8 and 17, particularly boys. TMI misclassified obesity only 8% of the time (versus more than 19% with BMI).\u000a\u000aFor adults, Laursen suggests getting out a tape measure. Measure your circumference at your belly button. If your waist circumference is half your height or less, you are at a healthy fat level, if you are over that number, your fat could put you at risk for ill health.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIf you want something even simpler, look at your hip to waist ratio . It's something even a doctor could eyeball quickly.

aV(CNN) Redemption was sweet and emphatic as Emirates Team New Zealand trounced holder Oracle Team USA to regain the America's Cup on Bermuda's Great Sound.\u000a\u000aThe Kiwis took a 6-1 lead into Monday's fifth day of racing in the 2017 event and landed the sucker punch with a win in race nine to clinch the oldest trophy in sport for the first time since the successful defence of 2000.\u000a\u000aFour years ago and poised on match point at 8-1, the Kiwis' seemingly impregnable lead shrank day by day until the Larry Ellison-bankrolled Americans completed one of sport's greatest comebacks\u000a\u000aThis time, a revamped New Zealand outfit -- with wholesale changes to personnel and a radical design program -- was too strong for Oracle and its pugnacious Australian skipper Jimmy Spithill, who had been eying a "three-peat" in sailing's most prestigious competition after wins in 2010 and 2013.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Emirates Team New Zealand, helmed by Peter Burling, celebrate after winning the America's Cup Match in Hamilton, Bermuda.

Hide Caption 5 of 5\u000a\u000a"We're just on top of the world," New Zealand's Peter Burling, at 26 the youngest helmsman to lift the America's Cup, told BT Sport just moments after the triumph had been secured.\u000a\u000a"It's going to be a good night."\u000a\u000aIn the fallout from San Francisco, the New Zealanders parted company with long-time skipper Dean Barker, who joined Softbank Team Japan, and brought in up-and-coming helmsman Burling, who won Olympic 49er gold in Rio in 2016.\u000a\u000aAustralian Glenn Ashby, one of the world's best multihull sailors, was elevated to skipper and a whole raft of athletic young sailors brought in.\u000a\u000aAfter the events of four years ago, it was a moment to savor for Ashby.\u000a\u000a"It's been an amazing journey for us as a team," he said. "We've been able to pull off the almost unimaginable."\u000a\u000a"It was absolutely brutal for the team," added Ashby, referencing the collapse of 2013. "It was a hard pill to swallow. It is a great redemption, just a relief to right the wrongs of the last campaign."\u000a\u000aPeter Burling celebrates becoming the youngest helmsman to win the America's Cup.\u000a\u000aFor Spithill, it was the end of his bid for a third successive Cup win.\u000a\u000a"We're disappointed, but first of all full credit to Team New Zealand," said the 37-year-old Spithill.\u000a\u000a"They fully deserve it."\u000a\u000a"You've really got to give credit to them, what an incredible job they've done," he added. "Unfortunately they were the quickest boat today."\u000a\u000aBehind the scenes, and with a budget a fraction of Oracle's approximate $100 million, the Kiwis were working on a revolutionary design, replacing the traditional arm-powered grinders with cycling pedestals to generate more power to fuel the hydraulic systems on the new generation of foiling catamarans.\u000a\u000aAlongside that they developed highly efficient systems for marshaling the power to control the wingsail and daggerboards, designed a formidable package of foils and rudders to suit the conditions, and brought in Olympic cycling bronze medalist Simon van Velthooven to lead the "cyclor" training program.\u000a\u000aThe Kiwis were last to arrive in Bermuda, but they quickly dominated the challenger series, beating Swedish syndicate Artemis in the final to earn the right to face the Americans again in the America's Cup proper.\u000a\u000aAs well as the agonizing defeat in San Francisco in 2013 Team New Zealand had lost to Alinghi in 2007 and suffered a 5-0 whitewash at the hands of the Swiss team in 2003.\u000a\u000aThe racing took place on the waters of Bermuda's Great Sound.\u000a\u000aAs winner, Emirates Team New Zealand has earned the right to take the competition back home and will decide the format and timing of the next event.\u000a\u000aIn the build-up to the 35th America's Cup cycle, the other five teams signed up to a framework agreement guaranteeing a blueprint for the future, but the New Zealanders, under chief executive Grant Dalton, refused to comply.\u000a\u000aWhether the event will even continue in high-tech foiling catamarans is yet to be seen.\u000a\u000aThe America's Cup is back in Kiwi hands.

aV(CNN) As Hurricane Harvey batters Texas , people in New Orleans are bracing for 10 inches of rain or more starting Sunday and continuing into early next week.\u000a\u000aThe daunting forecast comes just weeks after strong storms overwhelmed the city's unique drainage system , leading to flooding at a couple of hundred properties and exposing critical deficiencies among 100 large pumps that drain many neighborhoods.\u000a\u000aDays later, a key turbine that helps generate an uncommon frequency of electricity needed to run the city's oldest, most powerful pumps caught fire, leaving just one of five power turbines in working order\u000a\u000aMayor Mitch Landrieu detailed the progress of the repairs Friday afternoon, saying he believes the drainage system could handle the predicted 5 to 10 inches of rain -- but he urged caution.\u000a\u000a"While it is a fact the drainage capacity has improved since August 5, we remain in a state of diminished draining capacity," he said. "However, (if) this weather system strengthens and produces as much rainfall as the National Weather Service predicts, we could see some localized flooding, even if our drainage system was at full capacity."\u000a\u000aAdditionally, 24 high-water vehicles and 39 boats are strategically staged throughout the city, Landrieu said. Barricades have been placed in flood-prone areas to keep drivers from venturing into high waters, and free sandbags were available at fire stations throughout the city.\u000a\u000aNew Orleans remains under a state of emergency , which Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared in response to the flooding and the turbine failure in early August.\u000a\u000a14 pumps still offline\u000a\u000aBecause of New Orleans' unusual topography -- with many areas below sea level and protected by levees -- pumps in every neighborhood must suck rainwater through storm drains and canals and push it into a nearby lake or other water bodies. In most other cities, gravity does that work.\u000a\u000aPumps that drain rainwater from New Orleans' streets are not the same pumps that the US Army Corps of Engineers built after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as part of a $14 billion effort to fortify the city against tropical events . City-owned equipment did not figure into the deadly flooding during Katrina, which owed to the failure of federal levees, though some city pumps and other machinery were damaged in that flood.\u000a\u000aSome city-owned equipment has been repaired or upgraded since Katrina -- sometimes at federal expense -- but local investment hasn't kept pace with the system's needs.\u000a\u000aOf the 120 drainage pumps, 106 were in service, Landrieu said Friday.\u000a\u000aSeven of those pumps were relatively small and located in newer sections of the city where flooding weeks ago was not a problem, according to the most recent records posted online Friday night by the city-owned Sewerage & Water Board . Another five were among the system's 20 so-called "constant duty" pumps, which are also small and work to clear the streets of runoff from lawn watering and other daily water usage.\u000a\u000aThe two major pumps that remained out of service were located at an enormous pump station in the city's Lakeview neighborhood. Without those pumps, the capacity of that station, which serves a heavily populated swath along the city's western edge and a large section of neighboring Jefferson Parish, remained reduced by about a quarter.\u000a\u000aWhile the city's drainage system remains impaired, Landrieu has noted that even at its maximum design capacity, the pumps only can drain 1 inch of water in the first hour of a storm and a half-inch each subsequent hour. That means a deluge would predictably cause temporary localized flooding, an outcome most residents expect.\u000a\u000aHeavy hitters take the reins\u000a\u000aMuch of the drainage capacity in the oldest part of New Orleans relies on power generated by the city. Some other pumps in that area -- and nearly all pumps elsewhere in the city -- run on power supplied by the local commercial provider, Entergy. But because overhead power lines tend to topple in high winds, city-generated and backup power sources are key to keeping drainage pumps running.\u000a\u000aThe New Orleans Sewerage & Water Board generates an unusual frequency of electricity needed to run the oldest and most powerful drainage pumps at a facility near the Mississippi River.\u000a\u000aThe city has cleaned 900 street-level catch basins , Landrieu said, since the flooding on August 5. Residents complained that debris clogging the drains exacerbated flooding. The city is now poised to fast-track routine maintenance of its 68,000 catch basins\u000a\u000aAnd the mayor has installed a team of heavy hitters -- including Paul Rainwater, who led the Louisiana Recovery Authority after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 -- to manage the city's drainage infrastructure on an emergency basis.

aVCh-ch-ch-ch-changes are sweeping through China's beloved pastime of karaoke.\u000a\u000aTraditionally, karaoke in China involves getting a group of friends together, booking a room at a karaoke bar and singing into the night.\u000a\u000aBut a bunch of companies are now enabling people to use their smartphones to unlock their inner divas anytime and anywhere.\u000a\u000aRelated: How a Chinese social media app made it big in the U.S.\u000a\u000aTiny, self-service karaoke booths from a company called M-Bar started popping up all over Beijing earlier this year.\u000a\u000aPeople can scan in using WeChat, China's most popular messaging app, and rock the mic for 15 minutes or an hour -- all in the privacy of a roughly 20-square-foot cubicle.\u000a\u000a"It's so convenient," said Ye Guancheng, 28, who was trying the karaoke booth out with his girlfriend. "You don't need to have an appointment like you do with traditional karaoke rooms."\u000a\u000aThe booths are also plugged into social media. Users can get recordings of their karaoke sessions sent to them via WeChat, where they can post their best hits -- kind of like an audio selfie.\u000a\u000aOther companies are also tapping into the desire for more personalized karaoke experiences.\u000a\u000aOne startup, Smule, connects users and karaoke enthusiasts with celebrities, letting them record duets with pop stars like Shawn Mendez or Charlie Puth on its Sing! Karaoke app. Famous artists upload audio to the platform for fans to sing along with.\u000a\u000aSmule is based in San Francisco, but most of its 52 million monthly active users are in Southeast Asia. Now, it's targeting China, securing $54 million in funding from investors including Chinese tech giant Tencent (TCEHY) last month. It will face stiff competition from other local karaoke apps with built-in social media platforms like ChangBa, and Tencent's own Quanmin.\u000a\u000aHow good is this?! Double tap if you like! \U0001f60d #smule #instasmule A post shared by Smule (@smule) on Apr 18, 2017 at 10:00am PDT\u000a\u000aThe proliferation of such apps has helped fuel the Tosing craze, which is yet another way to karaoke on the go.\u000a\u000aTosing is a portable contraption that is half microphone, half speaker. It connects to smartphones and other devices through Bluetooth. From there, users can open a karaoke app and sing to their heart's content.\u000a\u000aThe company sold about 3 million mics last year, mostly in mainland China and Hong Kong. The latest versions of the karaoke-to-go machine cost about $100, but are often sold for much less.\u000a\u000aRelated: 'Carpool Karaoke' fans kept waiting for Apple series\u000a\u000a"Singing used to be something people would do at a certain place, during a certain time," Tosing inventor You Guangguo said. "People are used to singing only on stage, or at a karaoke lounge or family gathering."\u000a\u000aYou invented the Tosing mic in part because he said he's a bad singer and often embarrassed to perform in front of others.\u000a\u000aWith Tosing, "you can sing on the streets, you can sing in bed, you can sing in a public space ... whether it's by yourself or with friends," he said.\u000a\u000a-- Yuli Yang and Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.

aVAugust 16 marks the 40th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death. Presley was one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century, and is frequently referred to as "The King of Rock 'n' Roll."\u000a\u000a(CNN) Big hair, leather jackets and a touch of danger -- these were photographer Denny Renshaw's first impressions of Japan's "Roller-Zoku" gangs.\u000a\u000aInspired by the likes of Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley, Roller-Zoku is a fashion tribe that gained traction in the 1980s when a rock 'n' roll and rockabilly revival swept Japan. The groups are still active today, with regular gatherings and musical performances taking place all over Tokyo.\u000a\u000aFor Renshaw, creating a photo series about the Roller-Zoku gangs has been an evolutionary process. He began collecting images of them in 2013, but he said his first two trips to Japan resulted in an "incomplete" set of photographs.\u000a\u000aIn the hope of completing the series, Renshaw returned to Japan again this year. CNN spoke to him about the unique fashion and subculture of the Roller-Zoku.\u000a\u000aCNN: What does the name Roller-Zoku mean?\u000a\u000aDenny Renshaw: Zoku means "family," though it also roughly translates to "tribe." You'll often hear them call each other "rollers."\u000a\u000aThe tribe gets together once a week -- often on Sundays, like many of Japan's fashion tribes -- and its members (gravitate) around the things they are interested in. I've been to big meetings with 30-plus people, and others with about ten.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did you first come across the Roller-Zoku gangs?\u000a\u000aDR: I was in Tokyo on vacation in 2009, and as we walked around the park, we stumbled upon these incredibly-dressed rockers. They immediately grabbed my attention.\u000a\u000aCNN: What was it about them that caught your eye?\u000a\u000aDR: Their look is so striking -- the big hair and their clothes. They have a swagger about them, and an attitude and style seemed just a touch dangerous.\u000a\u000aI'm originally from Jackson, Tennessee, where rockabilly music is originally from and not far from Memphis. Memphis, of course, is the home of Elvis Presley and SUN recording studios.\u000a\u000aWhen I first saw the Roller-Zoku I was immediately reminded of that influence.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did your first portraits of the Roller-Zoku come about?\u000a\u000aDR: At first, I couldn't find them. Whoever I had spoke to sent me in the wrong direction. I eventually went into a rockabilly record shop and made friends with the owner, who was quite helpful and willing to draw me a map. But he told me that photographing the gang would likely be "impossible."\u000a\u000aHe was partially right. At first the rollers didn't want anything to do with it. I went through a long process of rejection. Even as I began to make friends, I was told that permits and locations would be an issue.\u000a\u000aEventually I managed to shoot a few photographs with some of the connections I had made. But there were just six subjects, which wasn't enough to make a full series. I left with a mini-series that was promising but far from complete.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did you build the collection from there?\u000a\u000aDR: Two years later, I flew back to Japan purely for the sake of completing this series. It was on this trip that I got particularly lucky.\u000a\u000aOne night I was at Shibuya Crossing -- one of the most populated intersections in the world -- and I spotted these rockers getting out of a taxi with a guitar. I stopped one of them and asked where they were playing.\u000a\u000aIt happened to be the birthday party for Pitpi, one of the original vocalists of The Cools -- a 70s Japanese band that was very important to the rock 'n' roll revival in Japan -- and they asked me to join, so I did.\u000a\u000aWhen I looked around, I realized the people I had traveled around the world to photograph were here in front of me. I approached some of the attendees to see if they'd let me take their photographs, but initially there was a lot of polite resistance.\u000a\u000aBut then I asked Pitpi (whose birthday they were celebrating) if I could photograph him. Because he said yes, the audience members in the bar also started saying yes.\u000a\u000aThis was a crucial moment in growing the photo series.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did your approach differ on your most recent visit to Japan?\u000a\u000aDR: This time I focused on building the relationships that I'd forged in 2013. This trip was more organized, and I used my connections. On the trip before, I was basically hanging by a thread.\u000a\u000aCNN: What is it about the Roller-Zoku that makes them so unique?\u000a\u000aDR: When rockabilly and rock 'n' roll music were first introduced to Japan, they were marketed as just one idea. In Japan, the two genres are often simply referred to as "rock 'n' roll," which is something particularly unique.\u000a\u000aAnother -- and perhaps more obvious -- answer is the large and extravagant hairdos. They are called pompadours in the West, but in Japan the hairstyle is called a regent.\u000a\u000aSome members shave in a receding hairline to achieve a more authentic hairdo. They can spend hours on their hair. The guy with the biggest hair that I've seen is part of a gang called Black Shadow -- one of the original Roller Zoku gangs -- and he apparently spends one and a half to two hours a day on it, but says at times he has spent as much as four to five hours.

aV(CNN) Peyton West's parents would never have thought that his first day of school this year was going to be his last.\u000a\u000aThe 13-year-old had survived a heart transplant in March and spent the past five months living a full and fun life, said his father, Corey West. He developed a passion for food, especially Mexican. Soccer became his favorite sport, and he would watch FC Cincinnati professional games with his dad. It wasn't a coincidence that it had been his heart donor, Derek's, favorite sport, too.\u000a\u000a"Peyton thought, 'hey, if Derek loved soccer, then I love soccer,' " West said.\u000a\u000aPeyton woke up on Thursday excited for his first day of eighth grade in Goshen, Ohio. He was being goofy, West said, and the family took a photo of him smiling on their front porch. But 15 minutes later, when older brother Ethan dropped him off at school, everything changed.\u000a\u000aHe told Ethan he didn't feel well and then collapsed, West said. Ethan carried him to the school nurse's office. An ambulance rushed the boy to the hospital before his mother, Melissa, joined them.\u000a\u000aThe medics told Melissa West that they were quick to leave because Peyton's heart had stopped and it was a sight that no mother should see, West said.\u000a\u000aDoctors tried for 2½ hours to revive him, but Peyton died at the hospital.\u000a\u000aHalf of a heart\u000a\u000aPeyton was born November 6, 2003, with hypoplastic left heart syndrome\u000a\u000a"Basically, you're born missing the left side of the heart," said Dr. Emile Bacha, chief officer of cardiac surgery at Columbia University Medical Center. "Instead of having two ventricles, you only have one ventricle."\u000a\u000aVentricles are the two chambers in the heart that pump blood throughout the body. The condition requires three open-heart surgeries to allow the right ventricle to function on its own normally, Bacha said.\u000a\u000aPeyton had his third surgery at age 5, West said, and nearly died. He sustained brain damage and had to relearn how to walk and talk. But over the next few years, he kept up his spirits.\u000a\u000a"He was so positive and so happy, and even when he was sick, someone would walk in, and he'd just smile. He'd just light up a room with his smile," West said.\u000a\u000aPeyton's story made the news in 2013 when he decided to go on the field and score his first 65-yard touchdown for his football team. Since he couldn't fully participate in sports, he helped coach the basketball team at school and lived vicariously through his brothers' football experiences, West said.\u000a\u000aIn January, the doctors told Peyton's parents that his heart was failing and that he was "teetering on the edge," West said. He needed a heart transplant. On March 9, a heart became available, and Peyton went in for transplant surgery at Cincinnati Children's Hospital that afternoon.\u000a\u000aOver the next few months, he began to feel better, according to West.\u000a\u000aWhat went wrong?\u000a\u000aPeyton's family and doctors are still unsure what went wrong with his heart last week.\u000a\u000aThe Cincinnati Children's Hospital Heart Failure and Transplant Program, where Peyton was treated during his transplant and final moments, said it could not comment on the case.\u000a\u000aBacha said that the course of Peyton's death was unusual for someone in his situation and that there would typically be a much longer period of not feeling well, allowing more time for medical intervention.\u000a\u000a"The rapidity of his demise is surprising, really surprising," said Bacha, who had not treated Peyton or seen his medical records.\u000a\u000aIt could be that his body was rejecting the new organ, which manifested in an abnormal heart rhythm. Or any number of other things may have occurred, he said, like a strange infection.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAn autopsy was performed Friday, and the results, which Peyton's parents hope will shed some light on the case, are pending.\u000a\u000aThe Wests agreed to donate his body parts in hopes of saving someone else's life.\u000a\u000a"When they asked the question, 'Do you want him to donate?' I looked at the doctor, and part of me just for a brief second wanted to say no, because the boy had been through four ... surgeries, so many struggles," his father said. "But obviously, it didn't take another half-second to say 'absolutely,' because organ donation is what saved Peyton's life and was able to give him the five months of full, fun life."\u000a\u000aVisitation for Peyton is Tuesday at Goshen High School. His funeral service is scheduled for Wednesday at Eastside Christian Church in Milford, Ohio.\u000a\u000aThe family of Derek Cisneros, Peyton's heart donor, will also be in attendance, West said. They love Peyton and call him their son, and Peyton loved them, too.\u000a\u000a"He always said, 'I wish I could have met Derek,' and you know, now he's in heaven playing soccer and football with Derek," West said.

aV(CNN) Last year, Kraig Moss sold the equipment for his construction business in upstate New York and stopped making mortgage payments so he could follow Donald Trump on the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aThe amateur country crooner sang pro-Trump ditties while strumming a guitar emblazoned with Trump campaign stickers, earning him the moniker "Trump Troubadour."\u000a\u000aBut now, Moss refuses to play the guitar with the Trump decorations. He's soured on the President because of the newly proposed Republican health care bill.\u000a\u000aThat legislation, which the president supports, could result in dramatic cuts in addiction treatment services.\u000a\u000aThree years ago, Moss found his son, Rob, dead in his bed from a heroin overdose. He was 24.\u000a\u000a"The bill is an absolute betrayal of what Trump represented on the campaign trail," he said. "I feel betrayed."\u000a\u000aMoss feels it personally.\u000a\u000aLast year, at a campaign rally in Iowa, Trump reached out and spoke directly to Moss about Rob's death.\u000a\u000a"In all fairness to your son, it's a tough thing. Some very, very strong people have not been able to get off (heroin)," Trump called out to Moss in the crowd. "The biggest thing we can do in honor of your son ... we have to be able to stop it."\u000a\u000aWhen Moss became emotional, Trump comforted him.\u000a\u000a"I know what you went through. And he's a great father. I can see it. And your son is proud of you. Your son is proud of you," Trump said. "I'll bet he was a great boy."\u000a\u000aKraig Moss, a supporter of Donald Trump during the campaign, sings a song outside a truck with a Trump painting last year in Iowa. Now, he regrets doing so.\u000a\u000aSeveral times on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to increase services for people facing addiction.\u000a\u000a"We will help all of those people so seriously addicted. We'll get them assistance," he told the crowd at a campaign event in New Hampshire in October.\u000a\u000aMoss trusted Trump.\u000a\u000a"I truly believe from the heart that (Trump) is going to do everything he can. He's going to create treatment centers for the kids," he said last year.\u000a\u000aBut last week, Moss read about the proposed American Health Care Act. The Republican bill would end the Obamacare requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program -- which include Moss' home state of New York.\u000a\u000a"This bill would devastate efforts to address the opioid crisis," said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, director of the Bloomberg American Health Initiative at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "There's no question this legislation in the House of Representatives would cost American lives."\u000a\u000a, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was asked about the bill's provisions for opioid treatment. At a CNN town hall event last weekHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was asked about the bill's provisions for opioid treatment.\u000a\u000aHe responded that state governors had "wonderful ideas about how to address it" but that they felt "hamstrung by the federal government."\u000a\u000a"There are wonderful ways if we keep the focus on the patient -- not the government, but on the patient," he said.\u000a\u000aMoss looks back on his days on the campaign trail, on how he sold his trucks to finance the trip, how he sang his heart out and went from restaurant to restaurant to hand out "Donald Trump for President" CDs.\u000a\u000aKraig Moss, once dubbed "Trump Troubadour," now feels betrayed by the candidate over the proposed health care bill.\u000a\u000a"I did a lot to promote his candidacy," he said. "Now, I wish I had never sold my equipment."\u000a\u000aBut he doesn't like to think about regrets. He's looking to the future.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, more than 300 people showed up in 6-degree weather for a fundraiser Moss organized in his son's memory.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHe raised $3,000 for a local drug treatment center, but he said the greatest gift of the evening was that people who'd lost loved ones to drug addiction came together and comforted one another.\u000a\u000a"We all felt less alone," he said.

aV(CNN) George "Mik" Todd's job in Afghanistan was to stay alive and keep his Marines alive.\u000a\u000a"It was a kinetic and violent deployment. The conditions were pretty austere," Todd said. "My roommate was killed on the first day. ... It shook us pretty bad."\u000a\u000aHe got his second nickname, "Doc," serving as a Navy corpsman, essentially a combat medic, for the 2nd Battalion 8th Marines in Helmand province in 2009.\u000a\u000a"Over there, we were just worried about water, survival, ammunition, food and God," Todd said.\u000a\u000aHis job was to assist with trauma and injuries on the battlefield. In the end, it was Todd who needed help.\u000a\u000aHe contracted bilateral atypical pneumonia, which is pneumonia in both lungs. He said he knew he was in trouble when he was wrapping up a blast site.\u000a\u000a"They had to drag me the last 1,500 to 2,000 yards. I was falling in and out of consciousness. I got back to base, and they ran my rectal temp. It was 105.7," he recalled. "I had black spots all over my body. I lost a considerable amount of weight."\u000a\u000aDespite all this, he got back on his feet and started working again.\u000a\u000a"I was there for another week, and then one of the battalion surgeons came up to me and said, 'Doc, we've got to get you out of here.' "\u000a\u000aTodd was ultimately sent to a hospital in Germany.\u000a\u000a"I could feel (the pneumonia) shutting my respiratory system down," he said. "I was really close to dying."\u000a\u000aLife after war\u000a\u000aAfter he recovered and moved to Atlanta, Todd had a hard time adjusting to civilian life.\u000a\u000a"I tell my friends all the time, I'd rather got shot because that's more heroic," he said. "It's like now there's an asterisk on my deployment. It took me a long time to stand up from that."\u000a\u000aTodd struggled with depression and anxiety and turned to alcohol to deal with the pain.\u000a\u000a"I haven't been formally diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder," he said. "There's a strong possibility that I have some level of it."\u000a\u000aEventually, Todd received help from two doctors in Atlanta. Then he went back to school to study economics and public policy at Georgia State University.\u000a\u000a"I thought school was a really important part of my transition. I started building a career in wealth management."\u000a\u000aBut after a client died, Todd had a change of heart.\u000a\u000a"I went to Philadelphia for the funeral, and then we've buried so many friends to whether it be suicide, substance abuse, addiction," he said. "I really just had enough."\u000a\u000aMaking music to help others\u000a\u000aTodd grew up freestyling and rapping in Memphis, Tennessee, and music was a big part of his life until he joined the Navy.\u000a\u000a"It was just time for me to be who I am," he said. "And live the life that I was called to live."\u000a\u000aWith savings from his job in wealth management and help from his wife, Todd quit his job to focus on his true passion: music.\u000a\u000aTodd wants his hip-hop album to help other veterans with PTSD.\u000a\u000aNow he hopes to use his voice to help veterans heal. He wrote and performed the album "Combat Medicine" under the name Doc Todd.\u000a\u000a"I was in combat medicine as my profession. The album itself is intended to be medicine for people who have served in combat," he said. "It's about the transition and dealing with war ... and standing up and trying to get back on your feet again."\u000a\u000aThe song "Not Alone" is aimed at veteran suicide.\u000a\u000a"You don't have to isolate yourself. No matter what your story is or what you went through on deployment, there's somebody out there who has a similar story," he said. "We're letting people know that there's people on the other side of this fight and that you can make it through."\u000a\u000aAnother song on the album "Never Get 'Em Back" deals with survivor's guilt. The first verse is about Todd's roommate who was killed in action in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a"It's something that a lot of military personnel deal with," he said. "One of the things I want to tell them is, there's nothing you can do that's ever going to bring that person back. And it's not your fault."\u000a\u000aTodd is also writing a memoir called "Combat Medicine" that he hopes will be released around Veterans Day.\u000a\u000a"My job is still to save military lives. It's just the platform is different."

aV(CNN) Hurricane Harvey made landfall Friday night between Port Aransas and Port O'Connor, Texas, as a Category 4 storm with winds of 130 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.\u000a\u000aHarvey is the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Charley in 2004.\u000a\u000aThe storm is poundng the Texas coast and its millions of residents with hurricane-force winds knocking down trees, power poles and signs, and with torrential rain deluging streets.\u000a\u000aIn its 11 p.m. ET update, the National Hurricane Center said the center of the storm had passed over San Jose Island, bringing with it a dangerous and powerful eye wall.\u000a\u000aThe hurricane center warns that some areas will see as much as 13 feet of storm surge and large, destructive waves.\u000a\u000aAnd there's the rain that the slow-moving storm is expected to produce. Because it is expected to come to a near halt inland, Harvey could drop as much as 40 inches of rain in some places, and up to 30 inches in others, by Wednesday.\u000a\u000a#Harvey made landfall at 10 PM CDT as a category 4 hurricane near Rockport, Texas, with max winds of 130 mph and min pressure of 938 mb. pic.twitter.com/98y5wpKmBw \u2014 NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) August 26, 2017\u000a\u000aThe combination of wind and water could leave wide swaths of South Texas "uninhabitable for weeks or months," the National Weather Service in Houston said.\u000a\u000aSuch daunting language hasn't been seen by CNN's experts since Hurricane Katrina , which left more than 1,800 people dead in 2005.\u000a\u000aThe threat has prompted officials in at least one town to ask residents who stay behind to write their Social Security numbers on one of their arms in case.

aVJudy Burton said was feeling some pains on a recent Saturday night.\u000a\u000aSo the Liberty Township, Ohio woman rushed to the emergency room at the new Bethesda Butler Hospital just outside Hamilton.\u000a\u000a"I signed in at the receptionist's desk, and she put a little hospital band on my wrist, and told me to go to the waiting room," Burton said.\u000a\u000aForty-five minutes and a few magazines later, she said her pain subsided.\u000a\u000a"And I said 'I'm not going to sit here,' because I had no idea how much longer I would have to wait to see a nurse," she said.\u000a\u000aSo she went home.\u000a\u000aQuick visit, huge bill\u000a\u000aBut a couple of weeks later she was hit by a different kind of pain. This was in the form of a hospital bill for $1,059.\u000a\u000a"For sitting in their chair in the waiting room, and I never saw anybody," Burton said.\u000a\u000aAt first, she didn't think much of it, figuring it was just a simple clerical error. She suspected Bethesda billed her for a full emergency room visit, not realizing she had left.\u000a\u000aBut when she called, Burton said the hospital would not drop the charges. She said they would only offer a payment plan.\u000a\u000a"She told me 'we can give you financial assistance.' And I said 'I'm not paying it. I never saw a nurse or a doctor, no vitals were taken. I just sat in your chair,'" Burton said.\u000a\u000aThen she said it got even worse.\u000a\u000a"The woman said you will be turned over to collections," Burton said. "And I thought 'oh my gosh!'"\u000a\u000aER billing surprises common\u000a\u000aPat Palmer, a nationally known patient advocate with Billadvocates.com, said emergency room surprises are common everywhere.\u000a\u000a"We are paying extreme costs that are not necessary," she said.\u000a\u000aPalmer said she commonly sees itemized bills for things ranging from $11 tissues to $50 latex gloves, which can send a simple visit for a stomach ache soaring well into the hundreds of dollars. From the moment you check in, and they put a wrist band on you, costs can start accruing.\u000a\u000aPalmer said if you feel you were overcharged during an ER visit:\u000a\u000aAsk for a fully itemized bill, not just a summary, which is what hospitals typically send you.\u000a\u000aTell the hospital you are disputing the bill.\u000a\u000aTell them not to send you to collections until the dispute is resolved.\u000a\u000aWrite a detailed list of the errors, with copies both to the hospital's customer service department as well as their billing department.\u000a\u000aSending two letters of complaint is vitally important if the hospital uses a third party biller.\u000a\u000aSome good news\u000a\u000aAfter WCPO contacted TriHealth, which runs Bethesda Butler Hospital, spokesman Joe Kelly said Burton's situation was all a big error.\u000a\u000aIt turns out, she should not have been billed $1,000 to sit in the waiting room, Kelly said.\u000a\u000a"We inadvertently did not remove her visit from our tracking system when she left, and a bill was processed when it should not have been," he said. "We have taken steps to ensure this situation does not happen again." (Please see below for his complete statement).\u000a\u000aTriHealth removed the entire charge, he said. Burton said the hospital also sent her flowers to apologize.\u000a\u000aLesson learned\u000a\u000aThere's a lesson here for everyone who ever gets a hospital or doctor bill that looks wrong. Don't simply pay it, and assume you'll mention it to the office staff next time you visit.\u000a\u000aDemand they itemize the charges, let them know you are disputing it and then carefully detail the mistakes in writing. That way, you don't waste your money.\u000a\u000a_______________________\u000a\u000aFull statement from TriHealth "The patient registered for medical care at a TriHealth facility but ultimately chose not to receive care. We inadvertently did not remove her visit from our tracking system when she left and a bill was processed when it should not have been. We have taken steps to ensure this situation does not happen again. When we learned of the error, we immediately reached out to the patient by phone and certified mail to extend a formal apology. We also removed the charge from her account and cancelled the claim with her insurance company. In addition, we conducted a review to determine how the mistake was made so that it would not happen again. We value all of our customers and strive to provide the highest quality, most accurate billing service possible. We apologize for our mistake. We encourage every patient and customer who has any questions regarding billing to call our customer service number immediately so we can resolve the issue as quickly as possible."

aV(CNN) Can the sight of a greenish-brown color really be enough to deter smokers from reaching for their next pack of cigarettes?\u000a\u000aLawmakers in the UK hope the "world's ugliest color" will be helpful in lowering smoking rates in their country. In May, previously passed legislation will go into effect requiring all packs of cigarettes to be standardized. Tobaccos products will be stripped of brightly colored branding and replaced with a sludge-like color.\u000a\u000aBut does the stripped-down, "ugly" packaging really reduce smoking?\u000a\u000aResearchers from the UK and Canada summarized several studies that look at the impact of tobacco packaging on consumer attitudes and behavior. Their findings were published today in a Cochrane Review\u000a\u000aJamie Hartmann-Boyce of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, co-author of the review, noted that "the evidence we have so far suggests that standardized packaging may reduce smoking prevalence and increase quit attempts."\u000a\u000aThe UK law, passed last year, is similar to a cigarette standardization plan Australia enacted in 2012, which also features graphic health warnings and standardized fonts.\u000a\u000aThe muddy color -- Pantone 448C -- was chosen after marketing research company GfK Bluemoon was commissioned to develop ideas for unappealing cigarette packing. The agency asked Australian smokers about colors they found unappealing and overwhelming. Pantone 448 C was later named "the world's ugliest color."\u000a\u000aRespondents reportedly associated the color with the words "dirty," "tar" and "death."\u000a\u000aI used to feature so much in all your 70s couches, curtains and wallpapers. What did I do to deserve this? \u2014 Pantone 448 C (@Pantone448C) August 17, 2012\u000a\u000aDeterring bathroom breaks\u000a\u000aCigarette and tobacco packaging is not the first time the murky shade has been used in an attempt to turn people away from certain behaviors. According to Angela Wright, a color consultant and author of "The Beginner's Guide to Colour Psychology," the technique has been around for decades.\u000a\u000aShe cites American color consultant Faber Birren, who in the 1960s devised a way to stop department store employees from taking lengthy bathroom breaks.\u000a\u000a"The company asked him, 'Can you improve the working area so they don't have to leave all the time and use the restrooms?' " Wright said.\u000a\u000a"Birren actually took a different view and painted the restrooms in a color similar to Pantone 448C. And nobody wanted to spend time in the restrooms after that."\u000a\u000aThis is just one of the many examples that the "world's ugliest color" has been used to minimize appeal to control human behavior.\u000a\u000aIs Pantone 448C really that bad?\u000a\u000aWhat makes Pantone 448C so off-putting? Wright said she believes it's the association with human waste.\u000a\u000a"It makes perfect sense that smoking packets would use a vile green that looks like bodily fluids and makes people feel slightly nauseated," she said.\u000a\u000aBut not everyone agrees.\u000a\u000aFrance will also introduce plain cigarette packaging.\u000a\u000a"I actually quite like the color," said psychologist Dr. Carolyn Mair of the London College of Fashion, UAL. "It's an earthy, muted, rich color, very much of nature. But then I also don't smoke."\u000a\u000aColor in advertising\u000a\u000aThe use of color can play a key role in brand perception among the public.\u000a\u000a"Blue is often used in services such as banking and law because of its association with loyalty, honesty and reliability," Mair said. Red meanwhile "raises the pulse rate ... and communicates strength and high energy," Wright said.\u000a\u000aColor associations Red: Strength, energy, passion Blue: Focus, loyalty, calmness Yellow: Ego, optimism, openness Green: Balance, youth, eco-friendly Purple: Luxury, femininity, glamour Sources: Angela Wright, Carolyn Mair\u000a\u000a"Football teams who have red uniforms are giving themselves more physical energy but also communicating to the opposite team that they are powerful and strong."\u000a\u000aAnd purple has connotations with luxury, Mair said.\u000a\u000a"Think of Cadbury chocolate (which has a purple logo). At least when it started out, it had the association with a glamorous, smooth, feminine brand," she added.\u000a\u000aColor combinations can also have powerful connotations.\u000a\u000aIn the UK, the Esso petrol logo features red, white and blue -- much like many national flags, including those of the United States, Great Britain and France.\u000a\u000a"So this combination can result in an instinctive loyalty," Wright said.\u000a\u000aThe eye of the beholder\u000a\u000aThat said, perception also plays a huge role -- as seen in Wright's and Mair's different responses to Pantone 448C.\u000a\u000a"Red could be seen as aggressive and demanding -- or as exhilarating and exciting," Wright said. "Similarly, blue could be perceived as calming and well-thought-through -- or excessively bureaucratic and emotionless."\u000a\u000aWright sees the overwhelming color of our times as a bleak gray.\u000a\u000a"Gray is the color of austerity," Wright said. "And we're going to keep wearing gray until we feel better financially."\u000a\u000aThat is, unless you feel compelled to lighten things with a splash of Pantone 448C.

aVCaracas, Venezuela (CNN) Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly held its first session Saturday and issued its first order of business: the immediate removal of Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz.\u000a\u000aIn a unanimous vote, the newly-elected legislative body fired Ortega. In addition to barring her from ever seeking public office again in Venezuela, lawmakers prohibited her from leaving the country and froze her assets.\u000a\u000aIn a live broadcast on state TV, the assembly's president said Ortega would be removed and legal action would be brought against her. The news was met with applause by the more than 500 members of the legislative body, known as the Constituents.\u000a\u000aIt came after Ortega said she would open an investigation into fraud allegations surrounding last Sunday's election, which led to the creation of the controversial new legislative body.\u000a\u000aThe National Constituent Assembly is expected eventually to take the place of the opposition-led National Assembly in a move that critics fear will erode democracy.\u000a\u000aThe new assembly, which has wide-ranging powers and is expected to rewrite the Venezuelan Constitution at the behest of leftist President Nicolas Maduro, had its first session televised live on state television.\u000a\u000aJust before Ortega was fired, government troops prevented her and some of her subordinates from entering her Caracas office building.\u000a\u000aAn image distributed by Ortega's press office shows troops outside her office in the capital, Caracas.\u000a\u000aMore than three dozen troops stood outside the building Saturday, pictures released by her press office show.\u000a\u000a"This is a dictatorship -- the abuse that is being experienced in Venezuela, the repression," Ortega told reporters there.\u000a\u000aThe firing defied the regional Organization of American States, whose human rights commission Saturday warned the Venezuelan government to guarantee Ortega's safety and allow her to continue as attorney general.\u000a\u000aIt cited what it said were comments by "high-ranking officials" indicating Ortega may face prosecution by Maduro's regime.\u000a\u000aWith the ouster, Ortega has lost immunity from prosecution that Venezuelan government officials enjoy. Venezuela's Supreme Court issued a statement that she will be investigated over what it called serious violations and offenses as attorney general.\u000a\u000aThe new attorney general's office\u000a\u000aThe assembly proposed a "restructuring" of the attorney general's office and nominated Tarek William Saab , a Maduro ally and former ombudsman, to be the interim attorney general.\u000a\u000aHe was sworn in late Saturday afternoon to a rousing applause from the Constituent Assembly.\u000a\u000aDuring his swearing-in speech, Saab blamed the inaction of the attorney general's office for the wave of violence that has gripped the country.\u000a\u000a"The attorney general's office allowed for there to be an approximate number of 100 victims for the lack of justice, for not acting early on, for allowing violent groups to gain unworthy control of territories that need to be liberated for the peace of all citizens."\u000a\u000aThe US Treasury Department issued sanctions in July against Saab and 12 other Maduro loyalists.\u000a\u000a"As President Trump has made clear, the United States will not ignore the Maduro regime's ongoing efforts to undermine democracy, freedom, and the rule of law," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the time.\u000a\u000a"As our sanctions demonstrate, the United States is standing by the Venezuelan people in their quest to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy. Anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly should know that their role in undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela could expose them to potential US sanctions."\u000a\u000aSaab has also been openly criticized by many people around the country, including his son Yibram, who condemned the deaths of young protesters on a YouTube video that went viral.\u000a\u000aOrtega had been a target in recent months\u000a\u000aOnce a staunch supporter of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's leftist movement, Ortega recently became a critic of the government under Maduro, Chavez's handpicked successor.\u000a\u000aIn recent months she has spoken out against the Venezuelan national guard and the Maduro government over human rights abuses committed against protesters. She has also opposed the National Constituent Assembly.\u000a\u000aFor months, Ortega has denounced the Venezuelan National Guard and the National Police for using excessive force against protesters. She has been at odds with the government, accusing high-ranking current and former members of the country's law enforcement branches of committing human rights abuses.\u000a\u000aOrtega had also recently accused Maduro's government of committing "state terrorism" by stripping citizens of their right to protest, trying them in military courts and carrying out raids without consulting courts.\u000a\u000a"We continue to witness the rupture of the constitutional order. The constitution keeps on being violated, and the government institutions are being dismantled," she said in June.\u000a\u000aHours after being fired, Ortega issued a statement saying that the work by the Constituent Assembly is a coup on the constitution, and she vowed to not surrender to the government.\u000a\u000a"I will continue to fight for all Venezuelans, for their liberties and their rights, until my last breath and in whatever position I might be in."\u000a\u000aMonths of strife\u000a\u000aVenezuela has struggled with a collapsing economy for many years. Maduro's opponents attempted to hold a referendum vote to remove him from office after they won a National Assembly majority in 2015, but the Supreme Court, stacked with government supporters, blocked all attempts to remove him.\u000a\u000aMaduro has also delayed local and state elections.\u000a\u000aThe National Constituent Assembly's election follows months of sometimes deadly anti-regime protests and an economic crisis that led many to leave Venezuela in search of easier access to food and medicine. This latest wave of unrest started after the Supreme Court of Venezuela attempted to dissolve the opposition-led National Assembly.\u000a\u000aFor his part, Maduro has said the election of this constituent body was needed to help establish order and peace in the country.\u000a\u000aHis opponents, meanwhile, say the new assembly could erase the last traces of democracy in the South American country. Opposition leaders say it was a last-ditch effort by Maduro to get rid of the opposition and the checks and balances between the branches of government.\u000a\u000aThe opposition-led National Assembly has indicated it will continue meeting -- raising prospects that two camps may claim to be the country's legitimate government\u000a\u000aInternational reaction\u000a\u000aSaturday, South America's trade bloc, Mercosur, decided to suspend Venezuela indefinitely from the group until there was a "re-establishment of democratic order." The Organization of American States applauded that decision.\u000a\u000aMercosur's decision is mostly symbolic and will not impact trade or the free movement of Venezuelans among Mercosur countries.\u000a\u000aBrazil's state-run news agency quoted Brazilian Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes Ferreira as saying that the Mercosur decision is of a "serious political nature," but that they took into consideration "the concern of not creating greater problems for the Venezuelan people. Venezuelans who want to come to Brazil will be welcomed."Both Maduro and Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza rejected the decision by the block.\u000a\u000aUS State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this week that the United States won't recognize the National Constituent Assembly because "the process was rigged from the start" and "the election lacked credible international observation."\u000a\u000aAssembly's next steps\u000a\u000aSaturday's session was a busy one for the newly established body. Not only did members restructure the attorney general's office, but they also unanimously approved extending to two years the time the assembly will stay in power. Currently, the constitution allows for only six months.\u000a\u000aAssembly leader Delcy Rodriguez, a former Venezuelan foreign minister, warned Friday that "justice will come" to some members of the opposition. Saturday, she announced that the Constitutional Assembly would create a "truth, justice and peace commission" to investigate the violence in the country in the past few months.\u000a\u000aMinutes after announcing the commission, Rodriguez also attacked Ortega, saying she had used her office to destabilize the country.\u000a\u000a"She opened the door for foreign interference in Venezuela. She also opened the door for the fascist right to act with impunity, assassinating and bringing violence to our youth."\u000a\u000aRodriguez plans to lead the truth, justice and peace commission in its first meeting Sunday.\u000a\u000aThen, on Tuesday, the full assembly is expected to convene for its second meeting.

aVHackers can unlock a high-tech Tesla car door by using the same run-of-the-mill techniques they use to crack open computers.\u000a\u000aThat's according to security researcher Nitesh Dhanjani, who spoke about his findings at a recent hacker conference in Singapore. All it takes is cracking a six-character password, considered low-hanging fruit in the cyber security world.\u000a\u000aAnd if it can happen to a Tesla (TSLA), other cars may also be susceptible. After all, many modern cars made by others like Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) can also be controlled via computer and mobile phone apps and come equipped with wireless connections that tap into Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell phone networks.\u000a\u000a"We now have ways of accessing our cars we never did before, and consumers aren't quite aware of that. Hackers will try to take advantage of that lack of awareness," said Erik Cabetas, managing partner at the consulting firm Include Security.\u000a\u000aDhanjani said today's cars should be held to a higher security standard than the average laptop. Not only are they more expensive, but losing control of a car can put lives in danger.\u000a\u000a"We can't attempt to secure our vehicles the way we have attempted to secure our workstations at home," Dhanjani, who advises companies on computer security, said in a blog post. "The implications to physical security and privacy in this context have raised stakes to the next level."\u000a\u000aRelated story: Tesla and Audi to become AT&T cars\u000a\u000aDhanjani was especially worried about Teslas.\u000a\u000aTesla owners must create a password-protected online account, which lets them use a smartphone app to access car locks, locate a car, and also see how much its batteries are charged. A single password gives complete access to an account, which is a problem, according to Dhanjani.\u000a\u000aHe also found that Tesla's website didn't lock users out even if someone typed several incorrect passwords. That opens up the site to what's known as "brute-force attacks," where a computer tries thousands of passwords per second until it breaks in. On Monday afternoon, Tesla updated its requirements, locking out users after five incorrect attempts, Dhanjani said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aDhanjani learned about this firsthand when he bought his own Tesla Model S P85+ three weeks ago. He noticed the single password requirements, and decided to test the system by submitting a wrong password 150 times straight. It never locked him out, nor did it ask for the jumbled letters that keeps automated hacker attacks at bay.\u000a\u000aRelated story: Tesla reaches deal to keep selling in New York\u000a\u000aDespite the findings, Dhanjani said he isn't uneasy about his own car and can't wait to get back from vacation to drive the Model S parked at home in Bellevue, Wa.\u000a\u000aHowever, he's concerned about the security of a Tesla, especially if it were to be the security standard for electric cars.\u000a\u000a"The time is right now for Tesla to fix this," Dhanjani said. "As other car manufacturers draw inspiration from Tesla's design and architecture, there will be more people to compromise and launch attacks against."

aV(CNN) Few athletes break world records. Fewer manage to do it twice -- on the same day.\u000a\u000aBut Adam Peaty is no normal athlete.\u000a\u000aAged just 22, the British swimmer picked up two gold medals in the 50 and 100m breaststroke events at the recent World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, and a silver in the 4x100m freestyle relay.\u000a\u000aIt was his 50m performances that really caught the eye, as Peaty broke his own world record first in the semifinals, and then again in the final, becoming the first man ever to go sub 26 seconds in the process.\u000a\u000a"It's unreal," Peaty, who also won gold in the 100m breaststroke at last year's Olympics, told CNN World Sport.\u000a\u000a"I got there in the morning and was quite tired from the 100m. I just dived in and when I touched the other side, I was like 'Oh my God, I've just gone under 26 seconds. I've just smashed my world record from two years ago.'\u000a\u000a"I was just so tired from semifinal, but I got this urge from what I wanted and just took myself back to what I wanted from the sport and thought: 'I've come this far, why not push on again?'"\u000a\u000aAnd push on he did.\u000a\u000aDespite narrowly missing out on a world record in the 100m, Peaty's dominance of the event is such that he has now recorded each of the 10 fastest-ever times over the distance.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The best of Budapest The Swimming World Aquatics Championships got underway on July 14 in Budapest.

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Published 18th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Every day, Emirates' airline catering facility prepares 180,000 meals to service its more than 400 daily flights around the globe. The Emirates facility is one of the world's biggest airline food factories, but there are similar operations across the world.\u000a\u000aThe scale of inflight catering is astonishing -- as is its waste problem.\u000a\u000aHalf-eaten meals, tossed beers, empty plastic water bottles, napkins, discarded packaging -- look around a cabin at the end of any flight and you can get a sense of the waste on a small scale.\u000a\u000aAnd the big picture? According to the International Air Transport Association, airlines produced 5.2 million tons of waste last year, and will produce over 10 million tons annually by 2030.\u000a\u000aWhile the statistic includes a host of disposable products -- from wine bottles to plastic toothbrushes -- a large chunk is directly related to food service. From harnessing behavioral data and using cups that can be composted to donating nonperishable food items and on-board recycling, here's what airlines are doing to divert cabin waste from landfills.\u000a\u000aWhat's the problem?\u000a\u000aThe problem is compounded by various factors: the sheer scale of the catering process, international health regulations, varying governmental waste policies and space constraints on board.\u000a\u000aAirlines must plan for food safety, hygiene, freshness and weight -- hence the vast amounts of plastic in every plane cabin.\u000a\u000a"Dining in the sky is quite different [than] popping down to your local café," Mark Ross-Smith, a big data specialist, airline consultant, and founder of Travel Data Daily, tells CNN Travel. "Individual wrapping is required to keep food fresh, hygienic and free from contamination. Anyone who has eaten a bread roll on a plane that has been out of wrapping for more than a few minutes can attest to how dry air affects food quality!"\u000a\u000aThere's also a concern about customer satisfaction, which leads airlines to stock more food than required on board flights.\u000a\u000a"Our fear of not serving all passengers results in an increased load, which increases waste," says Peter Lawrance, head chef of Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). "Airlines are often doing a best guess of how much passengers will buy or consume."\u000a\u000aA finely tuned computer system which can customize catering to changing needs is not yet standard, he adds. "This type of system often needs to be created from scratch."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 11 INSIDE THE FOOD FACTORY: The Emirates Flight Catering facility in Dubai is one of the world's largest airline food facilities, preparing up to 180,000 meals every day.\u000a\u000aDigesting data\u000a\u000aFlexible catering might not be commonplace now, but Ross-Smith says it's one way airlines could curb waste.\u000a\u000a"You can pretty much predict anything with data science -- from how much a hotel guest would be willing to pay for a suite upgrade and how you spend airline miles. The passenger experience will continue to be the focal point but on a deeper, more granular level. This is the type of stuff airlines can win awards for."\u000a\u000aHow does it work? By tracking passengers' online data -- from location to income, spending habits and consumption -- airlines can predict passenger behavior.\u000a\u000a"Businesses using data [that consumers have] published online is as common as having a cup of tea," explains Ross-Smith. "Companies use tools to [scrape data] and turn behavior into actionable insights. Once companies turn data into insights, they own that data. It's no longer yours."\u000a\u000aBut airlines don't necessarily need to trawl the Internet to learn what type of tea you like to drink. Ross-Smith says data can also be applied to behavioral patterns in flight. By tracking consumption over time, airlines could predict which meal type you're most likely to order on-board -- and adjust stock lists accordingly.\u000a\u000a"Based on history of sales and other flight information on specific routes, we are implementing our own developed tool to increase diverse loading instructions to match and predict the passenger needs on every specific route," says Lawrance.\u000a\u000aPay as you go\u000a\u000aAnother solution is the pay-as-you-go approach, where travelers order meals before a flight.\u000a\u000aThis is already the status quo for most low-cost carriers (LCCs) around the world, from HK Express in Hong Kong to Norwegian Air Shuttle. By providing this system -- where passengers buy meals using an app or website -- airlines can simultaneously meet demand and minimize waste.\u000a\u000a"One might argue that LCCs are more waste-efficient because they don't give free things to every passenger, so people only buy what they consume," says Ross-Smith.\u000a\u000a"Pre-ordering of meals also has obvious catering advantages. It lowers costs and weight on board, which translates to lower fuel burn."\u000a\u000aThis approach is becoming more widely embraced by full-service international airlines as well, with the likes of SAS, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Qantas creating online and mobile booking portals.\u000a\u000a"We are focusing more and more on pre-order food," says Lawrance. "We have made it easier to online pre-order your gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian or non-pork meals. This reduces waste and, in the end, cost. Ultimately we believe this will increase passenger satisfaction by offering the products our customer wants at the right time or flight."\u000a\u000aQantas is one of several airlines to introduce online and mobile booking portals.\u000a\u000aThat's a wrap\u000a\u000aReliance on plastic and paper also contribute to the issue, but some airlines are experimenting with recycling solutions and packaging alternatives to minimize waste.\u000a\u000aIn its 2016 Sustainability Report, SAS outlined a few ongoing initiatives: locally sourced food, with a "nose-to-tail" approach to limit waste; access to recycling on board; lightweight reusable plates and silverware; and recyclable or combustible disposable packaging.\u000a\u000aLikewise, Qantas has begun to use recycled materials for its packaging as well as plastic-free headsets. The airline has also partnered with OzHarvest -- a food rescue organization that collects 87 tons of food every week across Australia -- to donate unused perishables to those in need. With these changes, Qantas estimates that it will divert 350 tons of waste from landfills annually.\u000a\u000aEmirates has also introduced new measures to combat waste, including recycling facilities on board, for easy sorting of glass, plastic, aluminum, and paper products. In addition, the Dubai-based airline has also introduced eco-friendly blankets, made from recycled plastic bottles. The airline expects this amenity to rescue more than 12,000 tons of bottles from landfills by 2019.\u000a\u000aZero cabin waste?\u000a\u000aBut perhaps the broadest initiative is the European Union's "Life + Zero Cabin Waste" plan, which aims for 80% reduction in aircraft waste arriving at Madrid's Barajas airport by 2020.\u000a\u000aAn airline participant, Spain-based Iberia has introduced reusable utensils -- and soon, recycling bins attached to service trolleys -- so that in-flight waste can be easily sorted.\u000a\u000aBack on solid ground, the program has analyzed types of waste arriving at the airport, and redesigned existing waste management treatment procedures to be more effective.

We're considered the big brother of monument preservation," said Dennert.\u000a\u000aIt's the perfect occasion to sign up and enjoy expert-led, English-speaking architecture tours of Willemstad's charming colonial neighborhoods. Year-round, Dushi Walks Curaçao offers walking tours of Otrobanda and Scharloo.\u000a\u000a2. Visit the oldest synagogue in the Americas\u000a\u000aTowering over a bistro-lined street, the Mikvé Israel-Emanuel Synagogue -- part of the UNESCO designation -- is the oldest continually running synagogue in the Americas, in use since 1732.\u000a\u000aNearly 300 years old, the pastel yellow building is impressive for its neoclassical design but also for having a distinctive sand floor. This feature is in part a reminder of the congregants' ancestors who were secret Jews living in Spain and Portugal during the Inquisition. They were forced to muffle the sounds of their worship, before eventually fleeing to Amsterdam and other countries, and later settling on Curaçao.\u000a\u000aToday, the Snoa -- short for esnoga, or synagogue in ancient Portuguese -- serves 145 families who keep this heritage going. Entrance includes a visit to the adjacent two-story Jewish Cultural Historical Museum housing artifacts, photographs and stories of Curaçao's Jewish community.\u000a\u000a3. Go to wild, natural landscapes\u000a\u000aThe undeveloped, rugged northeast is where Curaçao really breathes, with two adjacent protected parks.\u000a\u000aChristoffel National Park offers multiple trails designed for hiking or for exploration from the comforts of a vehicle. Sunrise safaris allow hikers to skip the heat while spotting the island's flora and fauna -- including the endangered white-tailed deer and the native barn owl.\u000a\u000aThe intrepid tackle the island's highest peak early in the day -- Mount Christoffel towers over Curaçao at 1,239 feet.\u000a\u000aNext door, Shete Boka National Park stretches 10 kilometers along the island's rockiest coastline, and its deserted beaches are a major turtle-nesting site.\u000a\u000aMarked trails along craggy limestone bluffs lead to viewing platforms directly above a series of seven inlets where the sea blasts furiously against the rocks. Boka Pistol is the most impressive inlet of all, with waves shooting up to 40 feet high.\u000a\u000a4. Taste a rich and flavorful cuisine\u000a\u000aLike much of the Caribbean, Curaçao's diverse cuisine reflects its history and heritage, from Creole to Dutch and Indonesian.\u000a\u000aThe official dish is keshi yena -- cheese stuffed with a spiced meat (often chicken), olives, capers, picked onions and prunes, all baked to perfection. A delicious version is on the menu at Gouverneur de Rouville , set in a second-story colonial building in Otrobanda, with panoramic views of Willemstad's waterfront.\u000a\u000aA popular beverage to beat the heat and wash it all down is awa di lamunchi, a freshly squeezed and sweetened lime juice.\u000a\u000a5. Eat from a food truck\u000a\u000aCuraçaoans are big on their truki pan -- which translates literally, in the local Papiamentu language, as "bread truck."\u000a\u000aThe most popular food trucks come out in the Caracasbaai area near Willemstad after 9 p.m., pimped out with flashing disco lights and blaring music, while dishing out perfectly seasoned, grilled meats -- from ribs to stuffed sandwiches. Night owls flock to them between or after party hops.\u000a\u000aElite Grill Food is a favorite for its steak, while BBQ Express is legendary for its ribs.\u000a\u000aFruit smoothie and dessert trucks aren't any less ubiquitous, open during daytime hours -- Dushi Wafels in Willemstad's Punda neighborhood serves traditional Dutch treats like oliebollen and stroopwafel, and batidos vans serve refreshing fresh fruit milkshakes.\u000a\u000a6. See African artifacts at the Kurá Hulanda Museum\u000a\u000aThe Kurá Hulanda Museum boasts the most comprehensive collection of African artifacts in the Caribbean.\u000a\u000aIt's also home to a detailed display of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, explaining Curaçao's role as a prime location where Dutch entrepreneurs sold and shipped enslaved Africans to other parts of the Caribbean and to the United States.\u000a\u000aIn the Middle Passage building, museum guide Yflen Florentina shares hair-raising tales about the methods of capture and punishment alongside branding tools, cages and iron collars. Steep wooden stairs lead to a dimly lit basement built in the exact measurements and shape of a ship hull, outfitted with shackles, for a troubling glimpse of the conditions in which enslaved Africans were transported.\u000a\u000a7. Swim along Westpunt's enchanting coastline\u000a\u000aA favorite weekend escape of locals, the island's west point is a standout, brimming with beaches lining the crystal-clear Caribbean Sea.\u000a\u000aAn hour-and-a-half drive from Willemstad, a winding coastal road lined with giant cacti leads toward a seascape of bluffs towering over fine, white sand stretches. Spending days snorkeling and diving right off the cliffs or the beach is an easy task. Corals and tropical fish are abundant, while visibility is almost always perfect.\u000a\u000aWhile many beaches have small entrance fees, Playa Kenepa, the prettiest by far, is a public stretch where coolers are welcome. And snack vendors are lined up at the entrance -- a perfect excuse to sample the local pastechi, a crunchy pastry stuffed with seasoned meats.\u000a\u000a8. Attend Thursday Punda Vibes\u000a\u000aOnce a week, Willemstad comes alive with Thursday Punda Vibes. From 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., the city's most visited colonial district by day turns into one big outdoor cultural festival and night market.\u000a\u000aTraditional folkloric dancers show off the Curaçaoan waltz on Punda's main plaza at Gomezplein, outdoor stalls sell handmade crafts and jewelry and various local artists perform live around Punda's main streets -- from a marching band to Latin and jazz groups.\u000a\u000aRestaurants and bars join in with Punda Vibes food and happy hour specials, and the electric evening ends with fireworks over St. Anna Bay.\u000a\u000a9. Watch cliff jumpers -- or jump yourself\u000a\u000aJumping off the 40-foot clifftop at Playa Forti is a Curaçao bucket list item, and not just for tourists.\u000a\u000aFacing an expansive blue sea in Westpunt a few miles north of Playa Kenepa, this bluff boasts one of the most beautiful coastline views on the island and attracts crowds of locals and visitors who brave the leap on the weekends.\u000a\u000aThe acrophobic can head over to Blue View restaurant, perched on a bluff opposite this cliff, for a Blue Curaçao cocktail and a free show from a safe distance.\u000a\u000a10. Check out some street art\u000a\u000aColorful life-size murals around Willemstad's colonial districts are turning the city into an outdoor gallery. Some decorate the most heavily foot-trafficked plazas in Punda, while others require off-the-beaten track exploration in Otrobanda's alleys.\u000a\u000aThis growing street art movement is also helping revive Willemstad's most neglected areas. Thanks to Street Art Skalo -- a project launched in September 2016 by a dynamic trio of entrepreneurs -- works of art from renowned Curaçaoan and international artists now grace the walls of Scharloo along the entrance to the district, down Bitterstraat and in Parque Leyba.\u000a\u000aA colorful mural covers a building in the Scharloo neighborhood of Willemstad.\u000a\u000aNew businesses have moved into the area as a result, turning Scharloo into Willemstad's next creative hub.\u000a\u000a"We have permission from Monumentenzorg to do 40 more walls and spaces," says Nicole van Beusekom, part-founder of Street Art Skalo, which reveived a prestigious Business Innovation Creativity (BIC) Award in June 2017 from the EU's Overseas Countries & Territories (OCTA) Innovation Program for Sustainable Islands' Growth.\u000a\u000a11. Buy Curaçaoan arts and crafts\u000a\u000aFinding authentic arts and crafts is an easy task in Willemstad, despite the city's role as a cruise ship port. On the Windstraat alley, Serena's Art Factory stocks hand-painted Chichi dolls -- a folkloric representation of an older sister or wise friend -- with each piece made by a local women's group. Group and individual workshops are also offered to make your own.\u000a\u000aAround the corner, SilvanyRoss' new cooperative is filled with a curated, 100% handmade-in-Curaçao collection of arts and crafts, from paintings to purses and carved household items.\u000a\u000a12. Visit on offshore island with blue lizards\u000a\u000aAs if the mainland wasn't already full of incredible beaches, off the southeastern coastline is another escape: Klein Curaçao or "Little Curaçao."\u000a\u000aAn hour-and-a-half, bumpy boat ride across the sea, the small coral island has no full-time inhabitants save for aquamarine whiptail lizards and hermit crabs that crawl and feed in the shade.\u000a\u000aTwo miles of perfectly white sand seem to melt into iridescent waters teeming with tropical fish.\u000a\u000aOn land, those able to pull themselves from the sand and sea can hike to an abandoned 19th-century lighthouse on the southern end, where a couple of wrecked ships also rest along the shore.\u000a\u000a13. Knock back some green rum\u000a\u000aTucked along the Bredeenstraat, Otrobanda's lively shopping street, Netto Bar has been making, bottling and serving shots of rom berde (green rum) since 1954.\u000a\u000aOne of the island's oldest watering holes, doors open daily at 8 a.m., and the cozy Willemstad bar fills up with locals and tourists into the afternoon. Celebrities and Dutch royals have been spotted here, and their photos are plastered on the walls.\u000a\u000aShots of Netto's green rum -- a part sweet, part bitter concoction reminiscent of a cold remedy -- are a popular pick, but green rum house cocktails are also available.

aVDonald Trump fashions himself as a CEO president. But he's feuding with one of America's most famous, most respected and wealthiest business leaders -- Amazon's Jeff Bezos -- mainly because the company is so successful.\u000a\u000aIn his latest attack on Amazon, Trump said on Twitter early Wednesday that Amazon "is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost."\u000a\u000aWhile it is true that Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has wreaked havoc on the traditional retail industry. Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and JCPenney (JCP) are among the many big department stores that recently reported lousy results.\u000a\u000aTrump's tweet about Amazon came several hours before he disbanded two advisory groups that included the CEOs of many big U.S. companies -- a decision that followed Corporate America's criticism of Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aBezos was not a member of either of those councils, which had a particular focus on how to create more jobs for American workers. But Amazon is thriving. And hiring.\u000a\u000aAccording to the most recent data on retail sales from the U.S. Census Bureau, sales at "nonstore retailers" -- a category that includes Amazon and other e-commerce sites -- surged 11.5% last month from a year ago.\u000a\u000aThe president is also correct to note that the changing landscape of retail is hurting some American workers.\u000a\u000aAccording to the most recent figures on layoffs from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retailers have announced nearly 64,000 job cuts through July -- up 46.7% from a year ago.\u000a\u000aBut Trump is going overboard by saying that the country is suffering because of Amazon's dominance. Layoffs are just one part of the story. Many other retailers are doing extremely well -- and they are hiring.\u000a\u000aOverall retail sales were up a healthy 4.3% from July 2016. Consumers are still shopping until they drop -- and not just at Amazon.\u000a\u000aFor one, the rise of Amazon has appeared to reinvigorate Walmart (WMT), the nation's biggest private employer. The company has more than 1.5 million workers in the United States and 2.3 million around the world.\u000a\u000aAmazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2017\u000a\u000aWalmart has made a bigger push into online retail in recent years through acquisitions, and it's been rewarded by Wall Street.\u000a\u000aAnd Target, which has struggled lately, might finally be showing signs of a turnaround, too. It reported surprisingly strong results Wednesday morning, led in large part by digital sales growth.\u000a\u000aWhat's more, Amazon is a big job creator. The company employed 382,400 people worldwide as of the end of July, up from 268,900 a year ago. That's a 42% increase. And its workforce will grow more when it completes the acquisition of Whole Foods (WFM).\u000a\u000aAmazon was not immediately available for comment about how many jobs it has added in the United States in the past year.\u000a\u000aRelated: Amazon takes on the corner store\u000a\u000aThe president's comment about Amazon hurting taxpaying retailers seemed to be yet another suggestion that Amazon does not pay taxes -- an assertion he has made, incorrectly, for more than a year.\u000a\u000aAmazon paid $879 million in income taxes in the 12 months that ended in June, according to its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that filing, Amazon also indicated that it expected its future taxes to increase.\u000a\u000aBezos was one of several tech CEOs to meet with Trump at the White House in June to talk about jobs and other big issues important to the industry.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Trump pursues the feud with Bezos. He tweeted in December 2015 that Amazon was a "no profit" company that would "crumple like a paper bag" if it had to pay fair taxes.\u000a\u000aThis also is not true. Amazon does pay taxes, and it posted a profit (not a loss) of nearly $2 billion for the 12 months ending in June.\u000a\u000aTrump added that he thought Bezos was using his ownership of The Washington Post as a "big tax shelter" for Amazon. That, too, is wrong. Bezos owns the paper as a personal investment. It's not an Amazon subsidiary.\u000a\u000aBezos, who is currently worth about $84 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg, responded by jokingly offering to send Trump into orbit on a rocket owned by his space exploration company, Blue Origin.

aVPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Five years ago and 154 million miles away, NASA's Curiosity Mars rover successfully landed on the planet. Take a look back at what the rover has been up to these past five years, including this selfie it took on January 19, 2016. Hide Caption 1 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The bright blue speck in the middle of this image is NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. The image was taken from another NASA spacecraft, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is in orbit above the planet, on June 6, 2017. Hide Caption 2 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity has temperature and humidity sensors mounted on its mast. Calculations in 2015 based on Curiosity's measurements indicate that Mars could be dotted with tiny puddles of salty water at night. Hide Caption 3 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The Mars rover Curiosity does a test drill on a rock dubbed "Bonanza King" to determine whether it would be a good place to dig deeper and take a sample. But after the rock shifted, the test was stopped. Hide Caption 4 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Wheel tracks from Curiosity are seen on the sandy floor of a lowland area dubbed "Hidden Valley" in this image. Hide Caption 5 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover recently encountered this iron meteorite, which NASA named "Lebanon." This find is similar in shape and luster to iron meteorites found on Mars by the previous generation of rovers. A portion of the rock was outlined by NASA scientists. Hide Caption 6 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity took this nighttime photo of a hole it drilled May 5 to collect soil samples. NASA said this image combines eight exposures taken after dark on May 13. Hide Caption 7 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity This view of the twilight sky and Martian horizon, taken by Curiosity, includes Earth as the brightest point of light in the night sky. Earth is a little left of center in the image, and our moon is just below Earth. A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright "evening stars." Hide Caption 8 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The lower slopes of "Mount Sharp" are visible at the top of this image, taken on July 9, 2013. The turret of tools at the end of the rover's arm, including the rock-sampling drill in the lower left corner, can also be seen. Hide Caption 9 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The rock on the left, called "Wopmay," was discovered by the rover Opportunity, which arrived in 2004 on a different part of Mars. Iron-bearing sulfates indicate that this rock was once in acidic waters. On the right are rocks from "Yellowknife Bay," where rover Curiosity was situated. These rocks are suggestive of water with a neutral pH, which is hospitable to life formation. Hide Caption 10 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity shows the first sample of powdered rock extracted by the rover's drill.

Hide Caption 17 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The robotic arm on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity delivered a sample of Martian soil to the rover's observation tray for the first time on October 16, 2012. Hide Caption 18 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity This image shows what the rover team has determined to be a piece of debris from the spacecraft, possibly shed during the landing. Hide Caption 19 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover's scoop contains larger soil particles that were too big to filter through a sample-processing sieve. After a full-scoop sample had been vibrated over the sieve, this portion was returned to the scoop for inspection by the rover's mast camera. Hide Caption 20 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity cut a wheel scuff mark into a wind-formed ripple at the "Rocknest" site on October 3, 2012. This gave researchers a better opportunity to examine the particle-size distribution of the material forming the ripple. Hide Caption 21 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here. The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team. The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water. The grains are too large to have been moved by wind. Hide Caption 22 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity completed its longest drive to date on September 26, 2012. The rover moved about 160 feet east toward the area known as "Glenelg." As of that day the rover had moved about a quarter-mile from its landing site.

aVJessica DuLong is a journalist, historian, and author of Dust to Deliverance: Untold Stories from the Maritime Evacuation on September 11 , as well as chief engineer of retired 1931 New York City fireboat John J. Harvey . The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Christopher Nolan's $150 million film "Dunkirk" may be the first that many Americans have heard about "Operation Dynamo," the beachfront rescue in 1940 of 338,000 Allied troops trapped between Hitler's army and the sea. But what most people probably don't realize is that a larger and faster maritime evacuation actually took place here in the States less than 16 years ago.\u000a\u000aThree quarters of a century later, Dunkirk is getting its due. What continues to go largely unrecognized, however, is the spontaneous boatlift that came to the rescue when terrorists struck the US on September 11, 2001. As I reported in my book, crews aboard ferries, fishing boats, and tour boats joined mariners of all kinds to launch an unplanned maritime evacuation in New York Harbor that delivered nearly 500,000 stranded civilians off Manhattan Island in less than nine hours.\u000a\u000a"I just turned my boat around," said New York Waterway ferry captain Rick Thornton, recalling the seconds after a fireball exploded from the side of the South Tower. Instead of making his scheduled run, he steered the ferry south. "I didn't call anybody on the radio, I didn't check in with anyone on board to say, 'I'm going offline.' ... My pure instinct was just to head downtown."\u000a\u000aBefore that morning, no federal, state, or city agency had foreseen the need to evacuate Lower Manhattan, so no plan existed for doing so. At 8:46 a.m., when thick gray smoke started rolling through the airplane-shaped hole in the North Tower, an estimated 16,400 to 18,800 civilians were present in the World Trade Center complex, with many more in the surrounding homes and businesses.\u000a\u000aImmediate action after the first plane hit\u000a\u000aLower Manhattan's daytime population totaled in the hundreds of thousands that morning. Transportation shutdowns began within one minute after the first plane hit, restricting people's ability to freely navigate around and out of a suddenly changed city.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED MOVIE PASS: "DUNKIRK" Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH MOVIE PASS: "DUNKIRK" 01:54\u000a\u000aAs the scope and scale of the calamity unfolding at the World Trade Center escalated, city and state police collaborated with municipal agencies to put Manhattan on lockdown, halting buses, subways, and commuter rails, as well as closing roadways, bridges, and tunnels to prevent further attack. But sealing off the city also prevented people from leaving. All the while, conditions grew worse.\u000a\u000aFrom aboard a Coast Guard search and rescue boat, Boatswain's Mate 3rd Class Carlos Perez saw through binoculars the "horrific silhouette images" of people jumping to escape the unendurable situation inside the towers. "The worst feeling as a first-responder in any capacity," explained Perez, "is being on a scene of distress and not being able to do anything about it." This sentiment, shared by countless mariners as they began mustering on Manhattan's shores, was the driving force that propelled so many into action. And then the first tower fell.\u000a\u000aAt 9:58 a.m., a plume of gray-black smoke mushroomed up as the South Tower crumbled down. The wave of dust blanketed the surrounding neighborhoods. People caught in the mass struggled to draw breath. In an instant, the scale of the disaster had magnified.\u000a\u000aScrambling to get out of the city by boat\u000a\u000aLike the soldiers on the sands of Dunkirk, civilians in Lower Manhattan ran until they ran out of land. Meanwhile mariners raced to meet them all along the shoreline. They nosed their boats in to the sea wall and pulled into every available slip to rescue the hordes of fraught, powder-plastered people. "Gray ghosts." That's what they looked like to NYPD police boat pilot Tony Sirvent.\u000a\u000a"We had like Noah's Ark," recalled Sirvent's crewmate, NYPD Officer Tyrone Powell. "We had everybody on that boat. We had animals. We had babies without parents. Everybody was covered in soot."\u000a\u000aDesperate to get off the island, people stacked 10 or more deep against the railings along the water's edge. Stranded civilians caught in an act of war scrambled to climb, jump, or crawl across ladders to board any available vessel.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 9/11 firefighter received key to NYC (2016) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 9/11 firefighter received key to NYC (2016) 01:09\u000a\u000aSome even plunged into the water, unprepared for the perilous harbor currents that swiftly pulled them out toward the sea. An untold number of water rescues were performed that morning by mariners who put to good use their monthly "man overboard" drills.\u000a\u000aWhat had begun as a sort of expanded ferry service had transformed into a full-blown rescue. By nightfall, approximately 150 different vessels, crewed by an estimated 800-plus mariners had executed a successful boatlift, with surprisingly few incidents or serious injuries. Yet, even as we approach the 16th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, this homegrown Dunkirk still remains far less reported than its 77-year-old counterpart.\u000a\u000aDunkirk mission and 9/11 rescue\u000a\u000aThe circumstances of these two large-scale evacuations were, of course, quite different. While Britain's mariners had to cross 39 nautical miles of English Channel to reach the north coast of France, New York harbor vessels didn't have nearly as far to go. They converged from points across the port and came in from Long Island to offer their assistance. The majority of boats simply crossed the mile of Hudson River back and forth to New Jersey, dropping off passengers at ferry terminals in Weehawken, triage centers in Jersey City, and slips in parks, marinas, and yacht basins, as well as makeshift docking points all along the New Jersey waterfront.\u000a\u000aThe scope of the Dunkirk evacuation was quite different.\u000a\u000aIn May of 1940, two weeks after Germany invaded Belgium, France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in World War II, Allied forces had retreated to the beachhead in the French coastal city. Evacuation by water offered the only hope of survival, but was hindered not only by German airstrikes targeting British naval vessels but also a lack of smaller boats that could board passengers in the shallow waters just off the beach. Across the English Channel, military leadership organized a massive boatlift, calling for vessels of all sorts to participate in the evacuation.\u000a\u000aAnd over the course of nine days, between May 26 and June 4 , more than 800 fishing smacks, and other boats set out to bring the troops home, some with civilian sailors at the helm but most manned by Navy personnel or delivered under tow. These "little ships of England" played a significant role in what was then the largest maritime evacuation in history.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 9/11 memorial and museum Photos: 9/11 memorial and museum 9/11 memorial and museum \u2013 Artifacts from ground zero get a preview at the National September 11 Memorial Museum in New York.

In 1940, the rescue fleet was assembled and deployed using a battery of telephones to call boat owners and prospective volunteers. In 2001, on the other hand, the boatlift began completely spontaneously as crews saw the unfolding disaster and navigated toward it, hours before the Coast Guard issued a call for "all available boats" to join the evacuation. Mariners applied not only their equipment, but also their training, rooted in the longstanding and deeply engrained tradition of aiding those in peril.\u000a\u000aUnlike the mariners at Dunkirk, whose ranks included some unarmed volunteer sailors, those delivering people from Manhattan weren't subjected to enemy fire. But they did have to fear the prospect of more attacks as rumors about bombings and unaccounted-for planes continued to fly. When helmsmen and women set their course toward Lower Manhattan, they could not be certain what second- and third-wave assaults might soon follow. As it turned out, the most menacing hazard was actually the dust, which not only created whiteout conditions that left captains navigating by radar alone, but also began a years-long process of illness that would, for some mariners, contribute to an early death.\u000a\u000a"We were covered in dust," said then-New York Waterway Port Captain Michael McPhillips. "The radar couldn't see through the dust. ... We were pulling into the dock blind."\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aIt's impossible to know exactly how many of the mariners who participated in the evacuation wound up suffering from illnesses related to their service. At least 120 ferry captains, deckhands, and mates are registered with the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP), with 53% of those suffering from at least one illness or condition that doctors and researchers believe to be related to World Trade Center exposures. McPhillips is among them. Forced to retire from maritime work, McPhillips now works for the FealGood Foundation, an organization that provides medical and financial assistance to ailing first responders. He counts three ferry captains from his former company that he says have died from September 11-related health issues. At this time the WTCHP does not keep a tally of such deaths, and so the total number remains unknown.\u000a\u000aWhat we do know is that maritime workers of all stripes set out, heading straight toward Ground Zero. Instead of fleeing, or remaining in locations safely removed from the chaos unfolding across the harbor, they recognized the fact that they had the wherewithal to help, so they helped.\u000a\u000aThe story of the September 11th boatlift highlights the reflexive human compulsion to aid others that arose in the aftermath of the deadliest terrorist attacks on US soil. That day, a series of lifesaving, selfless acts performed by everyday people transformed New York into a place of hope and wonder. Today these acts, offering up a striking example of community, compassion, and comity, remind us of the resourcefulness and resounding human goodness that inevitably rise up in the face of darkness and calamity.

aVFilms documenting Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House yield insights into 40th presidency\u000a\u000aAs a new television-savvy president wields his unique brand of politics from the White House on the world stage, a CNN Film exploring an earlier president\u2019s novel approach to communications comes to CNN from filmmakers Pacho Velez and Sierra Pettengill. The Reagan Show is an all-archival film, comprised largely of footage filmed by the U.S. Naval Photographic unit and called \u201cWHTV.\u201d This material documented Reagan\u2019s eight years in the White House and was preserved by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. While previous administrations made WHTV, the Reagan White House far exceeded its predecessors in the volume of filmed self-documentation that it produced. Archival news footage from the era augments this fly-on-the-wall perspective on the dramatic history and pageantry of the Reagan years.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show also represents a new milestone for CNN Films, which celebrates its fifth anniversary this fall. Velez and Pettengill are alumni of the inaugural filmmakers\u2019 retreat created by a partnership with Tribeca Film Institute, Camden International Film Festival, and CNN Films in 2015. Each June, the annual workshop is hosted by Points North Institute in Camden and Rockport, Maine, and provides master classes, mentorship, and guidance to emerging documentary filmmakers. This film is the first co-production to be acquired for broadcast by CNN Films from alumni of the workshop, fulfilling a goal of CNN Films to contribute to the industry through nurturing documentary filmmaking and filmmakers.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show, will premiere on CNN/U.S. in back-to-back broadcasts on Monday, Sept. 4 at 8:00pm and 9:30pm, with limited commercial interruption. The film will encore Saturday, Sept. 9 from 10:00pm to 11:30pm and Sunday, Sept. 10 from 2:30am to 4:00am on CNN/U.S., again with limited commercial interruption. The Reagan Show will also screen for the public at New York\u2019s Museum of the Moving Image on Wednesday, Aug. 30 at 7:00pm, followed by a discussion with the co-directors, moderated by CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter. All times Eastern.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe went through nearly 1,000 hours of footage, and think that this all-archival approach allows for an exciting insight into the tools of performance that Reagan employed,\u201d Velez and Pettengill said about The Reagan Show.\u000a\u000aThrough the juxtaposition of network news coverage and WHTV footage, the viewer often gains a behind-the-scenes view of many of the events profiled in the film: the president at inauguration, pardoning turkeys in the Rose Garden, and negotiating arms reductions with Mikhail Gorbachev. Often, this technique reveals how the event was conceived by Reagan and his White House planners, as well as how the public would eventually see the event later through the network news.\u000a\u000a\u201cSubstantively and stylistically, Ronald Reagan was perhaps the most skilled communicator-in-chief of our modern era. Pacho and Sierra have made an impressive and extensively-researched film that demonstrates how essential media communication skills are to a president\u2019s success and legacy\u201d said Amy Entelis, executive vice president for talent and content development for CNN Worldwide.\u000a\u000aThe filmmakers ultimately focus on the geopolitical rivalry between America and the Soviet Union, the most fraught and consequential diplomatic relationship of the Reagan era. The film shows how, as the former film and television star began his second term as president, Reagan was challenged on the world stage by the relatively youthful new Soviet leader. Gorbachev, shrewdly determined to wield power through leveraging his own charisma and media savvy to modernize the image of his nation, rarely missed an opportunity to play any diplomatic advantage to global news cameras.\u000a\u000aMany of the pivotal inflection points in the critical INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) Treaty deliberations between these two men were made for television, and conducted before an expectant international press corps. The film shows how, alongside the technical negotiations, Reagan\u2019s years of actor-training helped him gain advantage symbolically, which had realpolitik consequences that seem to continue to have lasting influence for the U.S.-Russia relationship.\u000a\u000aReflecting on Reagan\u2019s time in office, journalist Peter Jennings remarks in a contemporaneous news report included in the film: \u201cNo presidency before this one was so often judged as if it were a performing art. I shudder when it\u2019s suggested that politicians who come after him are going to have to succeed first on television.\u201d With political irony and insight, the \u2018media archaeology\u2019 of The Reagan Show reveals how the communicator-in-chief effectively used his skills to his advantage for official diplomacy, as well as to establish his legacy in the role of a lifetime, the presidency.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the telecasts, The Reagan Show will also stream live for subscribers via CNNgo on Sept. 4 (at www.CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV, and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android. The film will be available the day after the premiere (Monday, Sept. 5) on demand via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms, and CNN mobile apps.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show is a CNN Films co-production in association with Impact Partners and Artemis Rising Foundation, and presented for U.S. broadcast exclusively by CNN Films. The film is executive produced by Dan Cogan, Amy Entelis, Houston King, and Regina Scully. The film is edited and written by Francisco Bello and written by Josh Alexander; Daniel Garber and David Barker also edited the film. Laura Karpman is the film\u2019s music composer.

aV(CNN) Energy bars are a convenient source of nutrition and come in a wide variety of flavors to satisfy different palates. They are often fortified with vitamins and minerals, which can help fill nutritional gaps.\u000a\u000aBut, like many foods in a specific category, not all energy bars are created equal. Those that are low in saturated fat and sugars, with a decent amount of protein and fiber, can provide a nutritious, satisfying pick-me-up. Others can closely mimic a candy bar. For example, some bars covered in chocolate contain as much saturated fat as a Snickers bar; others contain almost as much sugar.\u000a\u000aGranola bars are a convenient source of nutrition, but can vary significantly in terms of nutrition.\u000a\u000aEnergy bars containing mostly fruit and nuts can serve as satisfying snacks. But if you're looking for a meal replacement, aim for a bar with a higher amount of protein: about 10 to 20 grams. Athletes can also benefit from choosing a bar with more protein and carbohydrates, as their needs are higher.\u000a\u000aYou can afford more calories if bars are consumed in place of meals and not as snacks. But if a bar is intended only to tide you over until dinner, limit it to 150 to 200 calories.\u000a\u000aIn general, try to aim for bars with less than 3 grams of saturated fat and at least 4 grams of fiber. Palm kernel oil in yogurt and chocolate coatings will boost saturated fat. Also watch out for bars with ingredients such as brown rice syrup or cane invert syrup listed first, as they are generally higher in sugars than others and are better suited for athletes, not weight watchers.\u000a\u000aNote that some bars contain sugar alcohols such as maltitol or erythritol, to lower the sugar content. Because they are not fully absorbed, sugar alcohols provide fewer calories than sugar -- but they can also cause some gastrointestinal distress.\u000a\u000aOne last point: Don't be fooled by the word "energy." In the nutrition world, energy is synonymous with "calories," and all food gives you energy because it provides calories. There's nothing magical about energy bars in and of themselves, and they won't give a boost in strength or focus unless you've been skipping meals and snacks.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, energy bars shouldn't take the place of whole foods, especially fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts, which provide a package of beneficial nutrients that are important not only for energy but for overall health.\u000a\u000aSo stock up on a stash of healthful energy bars to keep in your bag or at your desk and enjoy them on days that don't allow for a break to sit and eat. Just don't make them the main staple of your diet.\u000a\u000aSeven energy bars that meet the above recommendations:\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

aV(CNN) Energy drinks are a $2.8 billion-a-year business in the United States alone, built on the promise of helping you push past that "2:30 feeling."\u000a\u000aWhile somepeople are early birds and others are night owls, one thing many people have in common is a feeling of sluggishness in the afternoon. This is in large part due to your circadian rhythm , a roughly 24-hour "master clock" that regulates hormones in your brain -- including, most prominently, the ones that make you feel tired or awake.\u000a\u000aBut you don't just experience a physical lack of energy. Your brain's reward processing system also takes a hit, according to a study published this week in The Journal of Neuroscience by researchers at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology\u000a\u000aIn the simplest terms, this system is responsible for helping you weigh potential risks vs. rewards, and arrive at a decision as far as what -- or what not -- to do.\u000a\u000aJamie Byrne, the study's lead author, says conventional wisdom has been that reward response is driven by "reward-related factors," such as the relative appeal of a reward ($10 vs. $100, for example) and "internal factors," such as whether you are an optimistic or pessimistic person.\u000a\u000a"This study is testing a third component that may be relevant to this relationship: time of day," said Byrne, a Ph.D. candidate in clinical psychology at Swinburne. "Our best bet is that the brain is 'expecting' rewards at some times of day more than others, because it is adaptively primed by the circadian system."\u000a\u000aExpected vs. unexpected rewards\u000a\u000aByrne and her colleagues recruited 16 healthy young men who worked normal daytime hours and hadn't done any recent long-haul travel, which could have resulted in jet lag. The men were asked to perform a gambling exercise while inside an MRI scanner , so blood flow in their brains could be monitored in real time.\u000a\u000aThe researchers said existing literature has found that an area of the brain known as the left putamen is a "core component of reward-related function in humans," and so they structured their study to observe subjects' activation in that area at three times of day: 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Of these, the lowest levels observed were at 2 p.m.\u000a\u000aTo put it simply: Rewards we receive in the morning or evening seem to come as more of a surprise than rewards we get in the afternoon. That surprise factor causes certain parts of the brain to light up more. This is a consequence of what is often referred to as our "primitive brain," from when our ancestors were hunter-gatherers. If they were going to venture out in search of food, for example, they would have done so during daylight hours; doing so at night would have presented an unnecessarily elevated risk.\u000a\u000a"The human reward system is primed to be more active during daytime hours when reward potential is high and risk relatively low, and less active overnight when this balance is reversed," the researchers wrote, citing " Mood and Temperament ," a 2000 book by University of Notre Dame psychology professor David Watson\u000a\u000a"Outside of 'time of day' variables, multiple lines of evidence suggest that neural activation is higher in rewards regions in response to unexpected rewards, compared to expected rewards," Byrne said. "A good analogy for this is your response to a surprise birthday party in comparison to a planned birthday dinner. Both are rewarding events; however, when the rewards are unexpected, your brain has to work harder to understand what is happening."\u000a\u000aImplications for daily life\u000a\u000aPrior research has demonstrated that it might be harder for you to think clearly, exercise good judgment and avoid making mistakes in the afternoon. This study is provides more evidence that it's not only what you do that matters, but when you do it.\u000a\u000aScience has shown there are many ways to optimize daily life activities around your circadian rhythm.\u000a\u000aPsychologist Eric Barker says you should always organize your to-do list from worst to best , knocking out the things you don't want to first, since "your self-control is at its peak first thing in the morning." Save the mindless tasks for the afternoon, he says.\u000a\u000a"Some fitness gurus recommend working out first thing in the morning, because that's when you're least likely to have scheduling conflicts and therefore more likely to exercise regularly," says Robert J. Davis, author of " Fitter Faster ." But you actually perform best at exercise later in the day , he says.\u000a\u000aEven weight loss can be tied to when, not just what, you eat . "Skipping meals or eating too few calories earlier in the day appears to stack the odds against us," says nutritionist Lisa Drayer , a CNN contributor. "More and more research points to the fact that when you front-load your calories instead, you have a much better chance of shedding pounds."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aInvestigating how to better treat diseases affected by the body's internal clock -- such as depression, substance abuse and sleep disorders -- is something Byrne would like to study next.\u000a\u000a"A range of evidence suggests that circadian rhythms are less robust in people vulnerable to depression and bipolar disorders, and we have shown that depression is indeed associated with a blunted circadian reward rhythm," she said.\u000a\u000aByrne thinks patients could benefit from a more precise focus on when they receive their treatment, maximizing rewarding experiences in the middle of the day and minimizing them at night.

aVTom Barrack, executive chairman and founder of Colony Northstar, an international investment firm, was the chairman of the presidential Inaugural Committee. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) As a very young man barely rounding the corner on 30, I had the opportunity to witness and view the Reagan revolution by serving as an enthusiastic and blindly optimistic apprentice in his administration. Now at the opposite bookend of my life, I have the challenge and honor of providing tiny bits of advice and counsel to my friend, the President of the United States, Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aLike President Reagan before him, President Trump is beginning a White House journey with a rocky and tumultuous introduction in the midst of great division, discontent and confusion among a very diverse and conflicted American and foreign constituency. I cannot help but reflect on the parallels of these two administrations as a compass for clarity and direction.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump is not only changing the tapestry of policy but is maneuvering the manner in which it is woven and the threads of its composition. His campaign was unconventional and disruptive, and he is now tackling Washington in an unconventional and disruptive way. It was Reagan who famously responded to a question from a Washington veteran on doing things unconventionally, "Well, isn't that why we are here?"\u000a\u000aThe arrival of President Trump is causing many legacy institutions to feel challenged as they scramble with the change that he is stewarding. The inertia and momentum of the government does not naturally lend itself to new methods of communication, thinking and negotiation.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the stable, recurring patterns of the Washington bureaucracy are designed to be immune from a consistent changing of the deck chairs, and become agitated by the need to acclimate to new circumstances. President Trump is facing the same opposition that President Reagan did almost four decades ago from the fixtures of the Washington and the global geopolitical scene. The bureaucracy is not the enemy but an essential ingredient to our success.\u000a\u000aWithout an unwavering entrenched establishment providing bureaucratic stability, our democratic system would cease to function in the ever-changing winds of temporal political shifts. An entrenched establishment is a safeguard, not a terminal illness. However, the bureaucracy must be amended, adopted, nourished, realigned, incentivized and held accountable. If not, the machinery itself, not the people who run it, become corroded and corrupt. Without constant supervision and monitoring, the bureaucracy will both grow in size and diminish in efficacy.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED On GPS: Can Trump meet his 4% growth goal? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH On GPS: Can Trump meet his 4% growth goal? 01:15\u000a\u000aThe President's policies were clear and distinct in his campaign and continue to be his priorities into his second month of governing: tax policy, job growth, immigration reform, a reworked health care system, a renewed national security alignment, a strengthened military and a re-engineered trade practice and policy. If the President is able to take advantage of an aligned Congress and executive branch to enact even half of these policies within the first year of administration, he will accomplish more than any other president in history.\u000a\u000aThe difficulty and challenge is the implementation of the President's policies into action by the agencies that are built to preserve the status quo and prevent abrupt movement. Aligning the leadership and bureaucracy of the Cabinet agencies with the policy initiatives of the President is a managerial nightmare.\u000a\u000aThe agencies are manned by political Schedule C appointees (individuals who report to presidential appointees), and an army of civil servants working hand in hand. Either group operating in isolation without the other is ineffective and somewhat dangerous. A little more than 30 days since the inauguration, the administration still has 2,000 vacancies, many of which require Senate confirmation, a process which is antagonistically slow and politically charged. These appointees are the nano-engines that will realign the bureaucracy to appropriately adapt to the President's and Congress's direction and practices. Without them, it will be status quo, "for better or worse."\u000a\u000aThe press is not the enemy, the intelligence community is the not the enemy, and even leaks in the new world of instantaneous information and social media are not the enemy. The enemies are time and confused expectations.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump still has to fill nearly 2,000 vacancies Replay More Videos ...

Leaks to the press, death by bureaucratic sabotage and rogue cables from within the State Department are nothing new under the sun; in fact, they are celebrated traditions and were even more demonstrable during the era of the Reagan administration.\u000a\u000aAmerica is a vast tapestry of millions of threads, a multitude of colors and a diverse and distinguished array of fabric. What is truly important to the mastery of the artistry is a process that melds all these diverse elements into an understandable and lucid portrait.\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan is not remembered for the initial confusions as he first began to set the pace. In fact, the first year of the contrarian Reagan revolution was anything but seamless. Reagan is remembered for his effective policies -- tax reform, deregulation, reinvigorating our military, bringing down the Berlin Wall -- accomplishments which were not achieved in his first year and in fact, were the result of a lengthy processes requiring significant time in the saddle, and incredible perseverance in the face of opposition.\u000a\u000aThe bottom line is the debate, the dialogue, the concern, the bickering, the parrying and thrusting all contribute to the process of American democracy. The institutional press is doing its job in bringing to light all sides of the Rubik's cube.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED On GPS: Trump vs. DC's career professionals Replay More Videos ...

The art of journalism is now about adding perspective and point of view to widely available facts that were once scarce and only disseminated to mainstream media.

President Trump is a great man, and the most effective action we can take as Americans is to give him a chance.\u000a\u000aWith our help, he will find the same trajectory as that of President Reagan, and the nation and the world will soon look through his abrupt, blunt and esoteric style to find bold substance, compassion, implementation of his policies, global respect and admiration, and a rebalancing of the attributes that truly make America great.

And the American's latest win at Super Bowl LI, in Texas, this February, landed him his fourth Super Bowl Most Valuable Player title, surpassing the record of his own childhood hero, Joe Montana.\u000a\u000aAt 40 years old -- an age when other athletes are retired or considering it -- Brady is playing at his best. And he's married to one of the world's most successful supermodels, Brazil's Gisele Bündchen.\u000a\u000aCNN's Talk Asia sat down with the American football legend in Shanghai, during his first trip to China.\u000a\u000aHi Tom. You are defying your age. What's the secret?\u000a\u000aIt's really a lifestyle, it's not one thing you can point to. It's not like: 'Wow, if you just eat this way, that will happen.' It's every decision I make ... is centered around how I can be the best possible player I can be. And I really enjoy it ... It requires a little bit of discipline but once you make those disciplined choices, they just become part of your life.\u000a\u000aBrady celebrates the New England Patriots' win against the Atlanta Falcons at Super Bowl LI in February 2017.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, your wife told CBS that you've suffered concussions. Why is so difficult for NFL players to discuss violence in the game?\u000a\u000aI don't think it's difficult to discuss. I just don't think it's anyone's business as to what's going on with my ankle, or my knees, or my arm, or my head. Those things are personal ... Yes, I do play a contact sport, but I also feel like I take more preventative measures than probably anybody in the world. So I really don't have concerns.\u000a\u000aI think I've got a great approach to how to take care of my body, it's worked very well ... (I'm) going into my 18th professional season, so you know, it's really not going to change. I've actually gotten better at my physical preparation and every year I feel better on the field.\u000a\u000aThe "Deflategate scandal" -- when your team was accused of deliberately under-inflating balls -- earned you a four-game suspension. How did you come back on top?\u000a\u000aWell, I think when you've done it for 17 years ... I've had a lot of experiences and I know what's important and I know what's not important and tend to use a very positive outlook in order to shape my own emotions and feelings. I use a lot of things for motivation.\u000a\u000aSo you know, to continue to play takes a lot of internal motivation at my age. It's not a lot of external things that motivate me ...

Why football?\u000a\u000aWell, ironically baseball was a lot of strain on my body. I liked to be a catcher, I was in the middle of all the action but I was in a crouching stance all day and my knees would get really sore, and my elbow would get sore from throwing. When I started to play football, I didn't have to do all those things. So, you know, it was really the pain that I felt from playing high school baseball that was one of the reasons why I fell in love with football.\u000a\u000aBrady throws out the first pitch in a baseball game between the Boston Red Sox and the Pittsburgh Pirates in April 2017.\u000a\u000aIn 2000, when you were drafted to the NFL in the sixth round, no one picked you to be a star, right?\u000a\u000aThat was a great opportunity in my life ... When you are picked late, not a lot of people expect too much from you. So I was able to, in my first year, work under the radar.\u000a\u000aI worked really hard when I didn't have to play and be in front of people ... a lot of young players have that criticism that they face at a young age and, you know, it is hard to overcome.\u000a\u000aThe player passes to teammate Heath Evans for a touchdown while playing the Miami Dolphins in October 2006.\u000a\u000aI didn't have that, I was able to build and grow and learn and watch. By the time I got my opportunity, I felt like I was in a really good mental place, I had improved physically and maybe caught up a little more.\u000a\u000aThe New England Patriots is a polarizing team. Why is that?\u000a\u000aIn the NFL, there's really no national team. In basketball, at some point, all those guys play on the same national Olympic team. When you see international soccer players, you know, they have their club teams but then they play for their own country, too.\u000a\u000aBrady leads his team in 2004, while playing the Baltimore Ravens.\u000a\u000aI wish I had a chance to represent our entire country playing against another country but because you don't in your own country, you have factions that break off.

The plumes of smoke rising into the night sky are illuminated by something once uncommon here -- the blinking red neon of a sign bearing the restaurant\u2019s name in Chinese.\u000a\u000aGulab Khan Shinwari, the owner, stands at its entrance welcoming a steady stream of Chinese customers. \u201cMy restaurant is called Khyber Shinwari but everyone here calls it the CPEC Hotel, since so many Chinese customers have started arriving since the deal was announced.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, popularly known by its acronym of CPEC, has become a buzzword for longed-for economic prosperity in Pakistan. An integral part of China\u2019s One Belt, One Road initiative, the corridor is a combination of projects ranging from road networks, a fiber optic cable project, railway lines, a deep-sea port, coal mines and solar farms that Pakistan views as a huge opportunity to develop its economy.\u000a\u000aMeet the Pakistani kids learning Chinese.\u000a\u000aFollowing the ancient Silk Road that stretches from the Himalayas in Pakistan\u2019s northern border with China all the way down to the Arabian Sea, the corridor was announced with much fanfare in 2015 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad and announced a $46 billion investment plan, roughly 20% of Pakistan\u2019s economic output.\u000a\u000aWith the implementation of these projects and their promised riches, Pakistan has seen the influx of a large expat community, roughly 20,000, according to Mustafa Hyder, chief executive of the Pakistan-China Institute.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a community whose influence is slowly trickling into Pakistan\u2019s daily life.\u000a\u000aIn April, a commercial released by Shan Foods, a Pakistani company that sells spice mixes, showed Pakistani and Chinese neighbors bonding over a shared love for biryani, a popular rice and meat dish. The ad immediately went viral, with more than 59,000 shares on Facebook in the first week of its release.\u000a\u000aThe sleeping dragon has finally awoken\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the ad might not have initially been made with CPEC in mind, there\u2019s no doubt the foreigners Pakistanis interact with most on a daily basis are Chinese. \u201cThey\u2019re our best neighbor,\u201d says Humayun Farooq, marketing general manager for Shan Foods.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this ad has given CPEC a human face then I am glad for that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAcross town, Pakistanis discreetly sip cheap Chinese beer and wolf down dumplings made by Amber Shen, from China\u2019s Anhui province. Shen and other Chinese expats do their shopping from a handful of Chinese grocery stores that have sprung up in Islamabad. Popular American treats, like Chips Ahoy and Skittles, with Chinese packaging and even cans of stewed pork, a meat banned in Pakistan, are all available.\u000a\u000aLast year, a bilingual newspaper called Huashang Weekly launched with a staff of both Chinese and Pakistani journalists. It publishes and distributes 30,000 copies each week to Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi.\u000a\u000aPakistan movie theaters are showing \u201cChalay Thay Saath,\u201d which is about a Chinese man finding his roots in Pakistan.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot of curiosity amongst private Chinese investors about the potential in Pakistani markets, there's just the language barrier that I wanted to erase through Huashang Weekly so these investors can have an understanding of what's happening in Pakistan. These are very interesting times," says Derrick Wang, the paper's publisher who came to Pakistan five years ago.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile in cinemas, one of the latest movies \u201cChalay Thay Saath\u201d (Together We Went), stars a Chinese-Canadian lead actor and is about a Chinese man finding his roots in Pakistan.\u000a\u000aIn Islamabad, a city that has never really had a Chinatown, these developments are unusual. But China\u2019s embrace of Pakistan has risks attached. Analysts say Pakistan will owe China $90 billion if all the planned projects go ahead.

aVJust before the Senate convenes at 11am ET today to work on a plan to avoid the fiscal cliff, Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) tells Starting Point that he believes that a bipartisan agreement on revenue has been reached, but it\u2019s now a question of whether the money will go to more spending or deficit reduction.\u000a\u000aSen. Isakson says, \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not sure we have the inside information, but I do believe the revenue issue is no longer a question. The question is making sure any new revenues go to debt spending reduction and deficit relief rather than new spending. It's deficits that got us into this problem. It's only reducing deficits that get us out of this problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen CNN\u2019s Ali Velshi asks him to clarify if a revenue deal has been accepted, Sen. Isakson responds, \u201cNo, that's not my best information, but it's my best belief that they've reached an agreement on revenues. What that level is, I don't know, but the question now is where those revenues go. If they go to new spending, we're going to have a problem making a deal because spending has been our problem.

aV"I was only 36 years old, and I was single," she said. "I just couldn't process anything he was saying."\u000a\u000aShe worked full-time as a special-education teacher in New Jersey, but her most important job was raising her 8-year-old son, Michael.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin dreaded the thought of telling people she had cancer.\u000a\u000a"I remember I was laying on my stomach saying to myself, 'You're never going to have to tell anyone, because you're going to die tonight,' " she said of the night she got the news.\u000a\u000aFor someone who was always in control of her life, the diagnosis felt like a fatal blow for McLaughlin. She went through the motions of treatment and had a lumpectomy in her left breast, followed by radiation.\u000a\u000a"I hated radiation. It felt like I was in a 'Star Wars' movie. You're in this machine, and then there's a sound that makes you think you're going to be disintegrated," McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000aBattling cancer, striving for normalcy\u000a\u000aTo most people, McLaughlin's life appeared normal. She continued working full-time and caring for Michael, who was in third grade, as if nothing had changed. The principal at her school set up a room with a cot so she could take naps during her off periods. She did it out of necessity but also because she didn't want Michael to be affected by her diagnosis.\u000a\u000a"He didn't understand that I could die," she said. "That never entered his mind, because I didn't look like I was sick; I didn't act like I was sick; I didn't sit around and cry. I kept doing the things that I was always doing."\u000a\u000aAfter a few months, McLaughlin was cancer-free. She returned to her normal routine, replacing weekly chemo and radiation treatments with a mammogram every six months.\u000a\u000aBut on the same date in April three years later, McLaughlin's doctors found cancer cells in her left breast again. A mastectomy was her only option this time. She had immediate breast reconstruction and repeated the rigorous treatment schedule.\u000a\u000aAgain, she shielded Michael from as much as possible. He was in sixth grade, seemingly unaware; school-wide prayer calls were the extent of his exposure. "He'd come home from school and say, 'Oh, Mommy! Sister Laura got on the PA system today and had the whole school say a prayer for you!' " McLaughlin recalled.\u000a\u000aUnlike with her first diagnosis, McLaughlin knew what to expect. The countless biopsies that followed were the greatest challenge. Her doctors were extra cautious, taking tissue samples at the first sign of a lump or mass in her remaining right breast.\u000a\u000a"I told my doctor, 'My breast looks like a scenic railroad! Every which way, scars, scars, scars.' And he said to me, 'You can have 10 benign biopsies, but the 11th could be the cancer that kills you.' "\u000a\u000aAnother diagnosis\u000a\u000aSeven years later, McLaughlin felt a lump in her right breast. The mammogram didn't reveal any inconsistencies. Her new doctor suggested that she wait a couple of months, but she insisted on getting a biopsy.\u000a\u000aShe remembered lying on the operating table as her doctor read the results. "Usually, I'd be told it looks clean. This time, I saw his face, and he didn't tell me anything. I knew at that moment I had cancer again."\u000a\u000aIt was her third diagnosis in a 10-year period.\u000a\u000aMichael was a senior in high school, old enough to understand her condition for the first time. "I was honest with him about having cancer, but I'd never say 'I'm going to die.' I'd just say 'I saved my life,' " McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000aMichael struggled with fear about his mother's condition but was eager to help. He drove her to the hospital for her second mastectomy and breast reconstruction. Leaving little time to sulk, McLaughlin went back to work immediately and enrolled in graduate school to earn her master's in education.\u000a\u000aCancer-free once again, McLaughlin's life stabilized. Neither her body nor her behavior evidenced the decade-long struggle she endured. She loved her reconstructed breasts and felt in control again. Throughout all of her diagnoses, "I never cried. I never got emotional about it," she said.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin's moment of weakness came years later.\u000a\u000aQuesting for confidence\u000a\u000aEight years after her last treatment, an unexpected staph infection forced doctors to remove her implants. "That's when I cried," she said. "They were so beautiful and life-like that I couldn't believe it was happening to me." Doctors removed the infected skin, expanded the remaining flesh on her chest, and inserted smaller implants.\u000a\u000aBut after six weeks, she was rushed to emergency surgery for a second staph infection and lost the option of reconstruction entirely. Flattened, misshapen lumps of fatty tissue and scars from 28 surgeries were all that remained.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin struggled with her appearance after losing her breasts. She removed all the full-length mirrors from her home, preferring not to see herself in them, and pined over the lumps on her chest when she caught glimpses of her torso in the bathroom. "Every time I looked in the mirror, you think I'd be mad about the scars; I'd say, 'Oh God, I hate that fat.' I hate it, you know, and I was obsessed with it."\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin didn't find solace until years later when Michael, then in his 30s, gave her a tablet computer. With his help, McLaughlin opened a Twitter account. She became fast Twitter friends with Friday Jones , a celebrity tattoo artist and cast member on Oxygen's "Tattoos After Dark."\u000a\u000aThrough Jones, McLaughlin discovered a community of breast cancer survivors and mastectomy tattoo enthusiasts. Jones introduced McLaughlin to P.ink Day, a nationwide event in which volunteers connect breast cancer survivors with experienced artists, providing complimentary tattoos to cover their scars during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\u000a\u000aP.ink Day founder Noel Franus said "most breast cancer survivors are told they have two options after a mastectomy: reconstruction or no reconstruction. We believe they deserve a third option that most aren't familiar with: tattoos."\u000a\u000aP.ink Day, now in its fifth year, has provided tattoos for more than 175 survivors in 25 cities. When a last-minute slot opened up at P.ink Day in New York, Jones recommended McLaughlin. "She tweeted me and said, 'This one's for you, Bern,' " McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000a'Life still goes on'\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin's first tattoo was a breeze. Having lost almost all feeling in her chest due to nerve damage from radiation, she never felt the needle puncture her skin. Wispy black vines and flowers reminiscent of lace spread from her left shoulder down to the center of her chest.\u000a\u000a"I became so obsessed with that tattoo, I forgot I had the lumps." One year later, she was ready for another tattoo to cover her right side. This time, her son would join her.\u000a\u000aShe continued the vine across her chest, embellishing it with yellow roses, symbolic of life and rebirth to show that, "even in the coldest winters where everything is dead, out of the worst possible things that can happen to you, there's still life. Life still goes on."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aMichael got a matching yellow rose on his forearm. "This tattoo will always remind me of not just her, not just this day, but of everything she's done for me," he said, recalling the years his mother silently endured breast cancer in order to preserve his childhood.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin doesn't miss her breasts anymore. "People could look at (my chest) and say it's really ugly, and I looked at it that way too, until I got the tattoos."\u000a\u000aShe will celebrate 17 years cancer-free in April but still considers herself a patient. Three hard-fought battles taught her to never get too comfortable.\u000a\u000aTo women fighting similar battles, McLaughlin shares this life lesson: "You live with cancer, but you don't let cancer ruin your life."

aV(CNN) They became known as "the real 'Fault in Our Stars' couple" and soon became nearly as famous as the couple in the novel and movie.\u000a\u000aKatie Donovan and Dalton Prager -- like Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters, the teenagers in the 2014 film -- fell in love even though they knew the other could die at any time.\u000a\u000aThe real-life couple also shared a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Adding to their drama was the fact that Katie's doctors had directed her not to meet up with Dalton, because he had a highly contagious infection, and if she caught it, her life could be drastically shortened.\u000a\u000aShe defied her doctors and went on a date with Dalton, and two years later, they married when they were both 20.\u000a\u000aKatie did catch Dalton's infection. She died September 22. Dalton died on September 17.\u000a\u000aTheir love story captivated readers.\u000a\u000aBut their story was more than just a touching and tragic tale that went viral on the Internet. Katie and Dalton's story teaches us lessons about love and medicine.\u000a\u000aYou get to make a choice that might hasten your death\u000a\u000aFor the most part, online bystanders were supportive of Katie and Dalton, wishing them well and praying for them after they died. But there were also haters, because of Katie's choice to meet up with Dalton even though he had that infection.\u000a\u000aThe average life expectancy for a cystic fibrosis patient who reaches adulthood is 37, according to the National Library of Medicine . Katie died at 26.\u000a\u000a"There's bullies behind names on the Internet that are like, 'You're so stupid,' " she said.\u000a\u000aLess than a week before she died, Katie sat down for an interview with CNN at her home in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, and said she never regretted meeting up with Dalton.\u000a\u000a"I'd rather have five years of being in love and just really completely happy than 20 years of not having anybody and just having nothing," she said.\u000a\u000aDr. Chris Feudtner, an ethicist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the haters are wrong, and Katie had the right to make a decision that would probably shorten her life.\u000a\u000a"We honor people's ability to make decisions for themselves," he said.\u000a\u000aHe mentioned that his elderly mother, for example, wants to stay alone in her home instead of moving into assisted living, even though living at home increases the chances she could fall and no one would be immediately available to help her. He said his family is still working it out, but his mother might get her wish.\u000a\u000a"We let people make decisions about how they want to live even in the face of pretty substantial risk," he said.\u000a\u000aMedicaid sometimes fails the very sick\u000a\u000aCNN first brought Katie and Dalton's story to light in April 2015 because she was having trouble getting a lung transplant.\u000a\u000aDoctors in her home state of Kentucky were reluctant to give her the transplant. They wanted her to go to a larger program at the University of Pittsburgh that had more experience performing transplants for people with infections.\u000a\u000aKentucky Medicaid had refused to pay for her to have a lung transplant in another state. It agreed after CNN published its story.\u000a\u000aDr. Pam Shaw, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Kansas Medical Center, said Medicaid, which operates independently in each state, often won't pay for care in another state, even when it's clear the patient would be much better off.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, this is quite common," said Shaw, a member of the board of the directors of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\u000a\u000a"Our hospital is 1,000 feet from the Missouri state line, and we won't accept Missouri Medicaid, even though for some medical problems, we have the best services for children," she said. "It just breaks my heart to tell a family 'I can't take care of you because you live in Missouri.' "\u000a\u000aShaw suggested that the government change Medicaid so it's more like Medicare, the insurance program for the elderly that's run by the federal government, not state governments.\u000a\u000a"I know that's pie in the sky, but it would be a lot better for patients, their families and the physicians who care for them," she said.\u000a\u000aIt's a real phenomenon: Spouses often die close together\u000a\u000aKatie and Dalton died just five days apart, and several studies show this isn't unusual. Researchers call it "the widowhood effect."\u000a\u000aStudies have found that an elderly person's chance of dying increases by as much as 90% in the three months after his or her spouse dies, according to a 2008 study by researchers at Harvard and the University of Wisconsin.\u000a\u000aThe physiological reason for this -- what actually is happening inside someone's body -- is pretty much a mystery.\u000a\u000aBroken heart syndrome ," technically called stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is one explanation. It's the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones that can be caused by the loss of a loved one, a divorce, a betrayal or any similar traumatic event.\u000a\u000aBut not all spouses die of this particular problem. The 2008 study found that after losing a spouse, people die within just a few months of all sorts of diseases, including diabetes, infections and cancer.\u000a\u000aPart of it might be practical, said Dr. Eric DeJonge, director of Total Elder Care at Medstar Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Georgetown University Hospital.\u000a\u000a"Elderly couples often become 'co-dependent' on each other for cognitive or physical daily functions," he wrote in an email. "When that support gets knocked out, it can destabilize the survivor."\u000a\u000aDr. Christine Todd, an assistant professor of internal medicine and chairwoman of the department of medical humanities at Southern Illinois University, said she thinks it also has to do with the effect that emotions have on the immune system, especially on someone who's already in fragile health.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Grief plus depression has a very dynamic effect," she said. "Stress hormones and depression affect all your organs; it's enough to shut things down."\u000a\u000aThe tragic end of the Pragers' love story touched millions around the world.\u000a\u000aDalton was doing relatively well after his transplant in November 2014. But just as Katie's health was declining this fall, he caught pneumonia.\u000a\u000aStill, his family hoped he'd beat the infection and get out of the hospital in time to visit Katie at home before she died.\u000a\u000aFamily members never expected he would die before her, and when he did, Katie was "devasted," said her mother, Debra Donovan.\u000a\u000a"She's just in shock," Donovan said the day Dalton died. "And she hasn't felt well today."

aV(CNN) A 24-year-old woman is alleging she had a sexual relationship with singer R. Kelly when she was a teen.\u000a\u000aJerhonda Johnson Pace told Buzzfeed she was 15 and a fan when she met the singer in 2008 outside the Chicago courtroom where he was on trial for child pornography charges.\u000a\u000aNow a married mother of three, Pace alleges that she began a sexual relationship with Kelly after he was acquitted of those charges. She was 16 at the time, younger than the 17-year-old age of consent in Illinois.\u000a\u000aCNN has attempted to reach Pace for additional comment.\u000a\u000aPace told the publication that despite having signed a nondisclosure agreement for which she received payment from Kelly, she said she felt compelled to come forward after a recent Buzzfeed report that included new allegations that Kelly is controlling a group of women (none of whom are minors) in what some of their parents describe as an abusive "cult."\u000a\u000a"If I can speak out and I can help them get out of that situation, that's what I will do," Pace said. "I didn't have anybody to speak up on my behalf when I was going through what I was going through with him."\u000a\u000aKelly has denied any wrong doing and has not been charged with any crimes connected with the allegations.\u000a\u000aIn a statement to CNN on Tuesday, Kelly's publicist, Trevian Kutti denied Pace's allegations.\u000a\u000a"The allegations against Mr. Kelly are false, and are being made by individuals known to be dishonest. It is clear these continuing stories are the result of the effort of those with personal agendas who are working in concert to interfere with and damage his career," the statement read. "Mr. Kelly again denies any and all wrong doing and is taking appropriate legal action to protect himself from ongoing defamation."\u000a\u000aKelly has been embroiled in controversy since an explosive Buzzfeed article last month claimed the singer is holding a group of adult women against their will as part of what some of their parents say is a "cult."\u000a\u000aA group of people cited in the original article have claimed that their daughters are a part of an entourage of at least six women attached to Kelly. Their ages given in the article were 31, 26, 25, 21, 19 and 18.\u000a\u000aThe only woman from the group to go public so far was the then-21-year-old Joycelyn Savage, who denies she is being held against her will.\u000a\u000a"It just came to a point where it definitely has got out of hand, so, you know, I just want everybody to know -- my parents and everybody in the world -- that I'm totally fine," she said in a video released by TMZ. "I'm happy where I'm at and everything is OK with me."\u000a\u000aHer parents, Atlanta, Georgia residents Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage, have been outspoken in their belief that their daughter is being pressured to say she is fine.\u000a\u000aIn a statement provided to CNN Tuesday by his attorney, Timothy Savage reasserted that his daughter "dropped out of college and disappeared," that he and his wife "have not seen or had a conversation with our daughter since December of 2016," and that she didn't attend her grandfather's funeral.\u000a\u000aHe responded to Kelly's suggestion he has a "personal agenda."\u000a\u000a"We do have a personal agenda and that is to see our daughter again," the elder Savage said in his statement. "Mr. Kelly has a concert in Atlanta on August 25th. If Mr. Kelly has any shred of human decency, then he will allow our family to see Joycelyn this weekend without any interference."\u000a\u000aThe couple added they are prepared to pursue legal action to ensure their daughter is safe.\u000a\u000aKelly has a long history of accusations of impropriety with young women.\u000a\u000aThe singer was 27 years old in 1994 when he reportedly married his 15-year-old protegee, singer Aaliyah.\u000a\u000aThe marriage was annulled after Aaliyah's family became aware of it, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.\u000a\u000aTwo years later, Tiffany Hawkins filed suit against him, as well as his record, publishing and management companies, claiming personal injuries and emotional damage arising from what she alleged was a sexual relationship she had with Kelly, which she said began when she was 15 and ended when she was 18.\u000a\u000aThat case was settled out of court -- as was a suit brought in 2001 by former Epic Records intern Tracy Sampson, who claimed she began a sexual relationship with the singer when she was 17.\u000a\u000aKelly was not charged criminally in either case.\u000a\u000aIn 2002, Kelly was charged with 21 counts of child pornography related to his allegedly videotaping himself having sex with an unidentified underage girl. The case went to trial in 2008, by which point he was facing only 14 counts. He was acquitted on all charges.

aVJohn McTernan is head of political practice at PSB, a strategic research consultancy. He was a speechwriter to ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair and was communications director to former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The White House is one of the most instantly recognizable buildings in the world -- a global symbol of American values and democracy. It is also a historic building, in need of constant repair and maintenance to ensure it remains safe and sound. It is now into its third century of life.\u000a\u000aImagine if it were announced that an unavoidable part of the essential repair programs was that it would have to be painted gray for the next four years. The outcry would be deafening. Tourists would be shocked, Americans aghast.\u000a\u000aBut that -- in effect -- is what is happening in London's most famous landmark: Big Ben. Repairs to the Westminster's Clock Tower -- formally the Elizabeth Tower since Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee -- have led to the bell being silenced for four years.\u000a\u000aThe "bongs" that are famous throughout the world are too much of a danger to the hearing of the builders working on the tower's restoration.\u000a\u000aMany people in Britain are sincerely upset. Some of the responses to the final bongs have been faintly farcical -- such as the members of Parliament who wanted to stand with heads bowed , as if in prayer.\u000a\u000aOther reactions, such as the claim that "even the Luftwaffe" never silenced Big Ben, reveal a backward-looking Britain, never happier than when recalling past victories, rather than forging a new future.\u000a\u000aYet the truth is something is happening that deeply touches the soul of the nation.\u000a\u000aIt is not just the passionate traditionalists and Brexiteers, overjoyed at the prospect of "taking back control" of the country from the European Union, who find the prospect of a "bong-less" Westminster disconcerting. This is one of the most iconic images in the world -- the establishing shot for so many films and TV shows set in the UK. Big Ben, for so many, is London.\u000a\u000aUndoubtedly for some, this emotional reaction is tied up in deeper-held fears about Britain losing its voice and place in the world -- which is part of the threat that comes from Brexit.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Queen Elizabeth speaks to Parliament Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Queen Elizabeth speaks to Parliament 00:10\u000a\u000aThe once fractious EU now speaks with one voice to argue the interests of the 27 remaining members and against the interests of Britain. The reality of losing a place at the top table is being made manifest.\u000a\u000aThere is also a nagging sense of disbelief. Four years? Why so long? The Victorians could build a road tunnel under the Thames in that length of time. The lurking fear is that Britain is not just losing its voice, it's in danger of losing its energy, its ability to build and make things.\u000a\u000aEmotional responses by the general public -- the riffraff -- are often snobbishly and disdainfully dismissed by those who find them distasteful. Twenty years ago that was how they responded when the UK visibly and openly mourned the death of Princess Diana . That was no spasm; it was the beginning of a greater emotional literacy -- and a kinder country.\u000a\u000aThe heartfelt feelings of ordinary people about Big Ben should equally not be disdained. It is a rough world out there, and whatever your views on Brexit, there is no doubt that leaving the EU will be turbulent.\u000a\u000aIt may feel silly for swashbuckling Brexiteers to demand that Big Ben should bong Britain out of the EU on the day of Brexit , but the loss of a known, reliable -- even trusted -- part of the British landscape is unsettling for most. Even more so because it is so emblematic.\u000a\u000aNo doubt the late, great Roland Barthes, the French literary theorist whose essay on the Eiffel Tower is one of the masterpieces of structuralism, would have told us that paradoxically an absence is also a presence -- and done so in witty, elegant prose.\u000a\u000aBut the British are pragmatists, not theoreticians. Silence is silence -- though it may speak volumes, it is only about fear and loss.

aVIt's an idea that intrigues German-born photographer Corinna Kern , who moved into a squatted commercial building for several months in order to document the uncommon lifestyle unfolding behind its walls.\u000a\u000aShe first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who don't own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master's degree.\u000a\u000aThe notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled "A Place Called Home," in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place.\u000a\u000aHaving moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that's both transient and close-knit.\u000a\u000aThrough the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.\u000a\u000a"As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe," she said. "The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project."\u000a\u000aAll the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.\u000a\u000aI came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe. Corinna Kern\u000a\u000aWith housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.\u000a\u000a"What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living," she writes in the text accompanying her images.\u000a\u000a"The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt."\u000a\u000aThe squatters' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aThe Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says.\u000a\u000aBut since it's now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London's disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term.\u000a\u000aWhen squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern's photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric.\u000a\u000aOther images show "The Castle," a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked.\u000a\u000aAnother of Kern's photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood.\u000a\u000aFor her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. "The use of natural light adds to a candid feel," she said, adding to the authenticity of the images.\u000a\u000a"I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home."\u000a\u000aFar from encountering resistance as she ventured into people's intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.\u000a\u000a"My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me," she said.\u000a\u000a"The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs."\u000a\u000aDespite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first.\u000a\u000aFrom her images and her words, it's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience.\u000a\u000a"You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views," she writes. "You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them. You may have to move 10 times a year, but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life, turning it into anything but ordinary."

At the lake, it was lazy summer days. Daily swims, Grandma Mann watching over me. Weekends, Grandpa Mann took me to get rainbow ice cream cones. Mondays, sometimes we went back to town with Grandpa Mann, but always the week the circus came to town.\u000a\u000aThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey announcement of its final performance this May has brought back memories of those circus visits \u2014 mixed nicely with joy and wonder \u2014 wrapped in nostalgia for the form of entertainment that brought pleasure to millions for more than 200 years.\u000a\u000aPresident George Washington was one of the first .

And in another ring clowns would be putting out a fire in the small house they circled.\u000a\u000aA band played much of the time, so there was a decided ooom-pah-pah quality as the trapeze artists performed high above, punctuated by ooooohs and aaaaaahs and OH! when one flew through the air -- always safely caught -- to a synchronized sigh of relief from the audience.\u000a\u000aI wasn't the only one who loved the circus.\u000a\u000aIn 1942, when World War II brought restrictions on rail travel to facilitate the shipment of war materials and movement of troop trains, the circus was considered such a national pastime and morale booster that President Franklin D. Roosevelt granted a special dispensation for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey train.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aAfter the war the circus came, 1946 as I recall, to perform at the Chicago Stadium. I was a reporter for the Chicago Daily News then and I was given tickets, so I took a friend. I still liked the tigers and the prancing horses with their riders. The trapeze acts however were higher up now. Their swings hung from the steel rafters, and\u2014especially, when they worked without a net -- it seemed too dangerous for me to enjoy. So much so, I never went again.\u000a\u000aStill, I have the memories of the cotton candy and peanut-filled afternoons with Grandma Mann\u000a\u000aAnother time, another era gone.\u000a\u000aAnd when the Ringling Bros. circus goes dark after the 7 p.m. performance in the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Long Island May 21, there'll be only memories for everyone.

Jones is co-author of "Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete." She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia's 900AM-WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In the testosterone-laced world of sports, sometimes your name means everything. Think not? I've seen men beaten by mobs just for having the gall to scream out "let's go Cowboys" at an Eagles game. Think of all the racial epithets we've heard, of how one football player, Colin Kaepernick, silently taking a knee during the national anthem in personal protest of injustice in America has divided the nation.\u000a\u000aWe want to pretend that sports are a safe sanctuary from the world's ugly problems, but that has always been a farce. Truth is, not even the glorious game of football can keep America's toxic culture of bigotry, hate and violence at bay. It's just too heavy a burden.\u000a\u000aSo imagine if you're scheduled to be the announcer for ESPN's livestream of the University of Virginia's season-opener football game against William and Mary in a few weeks and your name is Robert Lee. But you have watched , along with the world, as thousands of torch-wielding, white supremacists screaming hate-filled chants marched around the UVA campus and rallied all their hate at the foot of a statue bearing your name: Robert Lee. A monument the city had voted to remove under state objections. Well, it's not unreasonable, even though you are Asian-American, that you \u2014 and your employer \u2014 may have some concerns.\u000a\u000a"This wasn't about offending anyone. It was about the reasonable possibility that because of his name he would be subjected to memes and jokes and who knows what else. Think about it. Robert Lee comes to town to do a game in Charlottesville," ESPN said in a statement that was tweeted late Tuesday night. "No politically correct efforts. No race issues. Just trying to be supportive of a young guy who felt it best to avoid the potential zoo." It was a mutual decision, the network says, to switch Lee to the Youngstown State versus Pittsburgh game that same day.\u000a\u000aNope, not unreasonable at all. Not in today's America. Not when we just witnessed heavily armed, swastika-wearing protesters who believe in white supremacy clashing in the streets with counterprotesters, who believed just as passionately that all people are created equal. Not when one woman is dead and dozens more injured because they had the audacity to stand up to the failed notion of white supremacy. Not when a statue, or a team name, or a presidential tweet can incite racial tensions and violence.\u000a\u000aNo matter that Robert Lee is Asian-American and his name has nothing to do with the Confederacy or slavery. It seems unreasonable, ignorant and downright ridiculous to associate his name in any way with the Confederate general. Still, nothing we've witnessed in Charlottesville, or since, has been reasonable or intelligent.\u000a\u000aNothing we've seen in Charlottesville or other cities and towns where these types of protests and counterprotests have sprung up could be called reasonable. It's disgusting. Killing one another, fighting, chanting Nazi slogans and counterslogans. Still, it continues. We continue.\u000a\u000aAs racial tensions over police brutality, immigration and other issues have flared over the past several years in our nation, these statues have become lightning rods \u2014 symbolizing oppression, hate and the whitewashing of history for many of us, myself included. Others insist these monuments, of which there are dozens across the nation, are a symbol of Southern pride, an important part of American history.\u000a\u000aRight. If that were the case, wouldn't we also have numerous statues of Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey or Harriet Tubman and countless others who fought for freedom and equality standing proudly outside government buildings, dotting college campuses? Just getting a national monument to Martin Luther King Jr. took decades\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aLong before the Charlottesville riots, municipalities had begun to remove these Confederate monuments on public property, citing safety issues. And those efforts have increased since Charlottesville. From Baltimore to Brooklyn to Texas , these statues are toppling amid protest.\u000a\u000aWhile this national conversation continues, ESPN decided to avoid evoking the chaos during a live broadcast. Robert Lee decided he just wanted to do his job, which is to broadcast a livestream of a college football game. As one ESPN executive told me Wednesday:\u000a\u000a"Let's not go to the zoo if we don't have to go to the zoo."\u000a\u000aGood call. Life is crazy enough already.

aVDavid A. Love writes for thegrio.com , a website dedicated to covering news in the African-American community. He is a writer and commentator based in Philadelphia. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The protest movement Colin Kaepernick started is rightfully growing and having a much needed impact on the conversation of racial inequality in America.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, seemingly motivated by the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia, a dozen players from the Cleveland Browns kneeled during the national anthem before their game against the New York Giants, the largest NFL protest since Kaepernick first took a stand by taking a knee in August 2016.\u000a\u000aAmong those participating were Isaiah Crowell, Duke Johnson, Jabrill Peppers, Christian Kirksey, Seth DeValve, Jamie Collins, Kenny Britt, Ricardo Louis and Jamar Taylor. DeValve is the first white player to kneel after Michael Bennett of the Seattle Seahawks called on white players to join the protests and bolster the effectiveness of the movement.\u000a\u000aLast week, Justin Britt of the Seahawks, Derek Carr of the Raiders and Chris Long of the Eagles responded by holding onto black teammates during the singing of the anthem.\u000a\u000aStill, there is every indication that the NFL is blackballing Kaepernick for conspicuously expressing his political views. The decision of more NFL players to take a knee is also a way to stand up for their former colleague.\u000a\u000aAre professional athletes like gladiators whose role is to entertain the crowd, run and throw the ball, and be seen but not heard? Last season, Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, took a stand against police abuse and racial violence when he took a knee and sat down during the singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," a song that, in part, celebrates the murder of runaway slaves who fought with the British in 1812, according to writer and academic Jason Johnson.\u000a\u000aKaepernick's resounding, yet silent, on-the-field protests drew support from many and outrage from others, bringing into focus important yet long-neglected issues of racial justice.\u000a\u000aAthletes should be allowed to speak their mind, as social protest; wanting to make America a better place is a most noble form of patriotism. Instead, the NFL seems to be penalizing Kaepernick for his pro-Black Lives Matter stance.\u000a\u000aThis recalls other condemnations of athlete-activists. Let us not forget Muhammad Ali , who refused to serve in the Vietnam War and lost his boxing license and title, or Olympic medalists John Carlos, Peter Norman and Tommie Smith, who were vilified and ostracized for the iconic "Black Power" salute at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.\u000a\u000a"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick told NFL Media . "To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."\u000a\u000aIndeed, it is bigger than football. And for a league that is made up of 70% black men , it's ironic that the NFL expects police brutality against African-Americans not to incite feelings of outrage and the spirit of protest among its players.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Benjamin Watson talks Colin Kaepernick and racism Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Benjamin Watson talks Colin Kaepernick and racism 01:28\u000a\u000aFortunately, in light of his continued free-agent status, Kaepernick has received support, not only from other NFL players, but from celebrities and military veterans . A Change.org petition threatens an NFL boycott if a team doesn't sign him for the coming season.\u000a\u000aAnd on Saturday morning a surprising show of support came from retired and current New York Police Department officers during a rally in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Filmmaker Spike Lee lent his support for a planned rally Wednesday for the football star at NFL headquarters in New York.\u000a\u000aThough Kaepernick is receiving much needed and deserved support, it's hard to ignore the blatant hypocrisy from conservatives when deciding who has the right to speak out against what they perceive as injustice in America.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump has had far harsher words for Kaepernick and Black Lives Matter than for Unite the Right -- the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that resulted in one woman's death.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED NFLer: I'll protest anthem until we're equal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NFLer: I'll protest anthem until we're equal 01:52\u000a\u000aTrump even took credit for NFL teams refusing to sign Kaepernick. "Your San Francisco quarterback, I'm sure nobody ever heard of him," Trump said at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky. "... There was an article today, it's reported, that NFL owners don't want to pick him up because they don't want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump. Can you believe that?"\u000a\u000a"I think it's personally not a good thing," Trump told a Seattle radio station last year about Kaepernick's protest. "I think it's a terrible thing. And, you know, maybe he should find a new country that works better for him. Let him try. It won't happen." Trump also said he believes Black Lives Matter has instigated the killings of police officers, calling the movement a "threat" and accusing the group of "essentially calling death to the police."\u000a\u000aIn the memo, Damore asserted that women have "higher levels of anxiety" and "neuroticism." He decried Google's "culture of shaming and misrepresentation," and as prescriptions suggested the company "reconsider making unconscious bias training mandatory," "stop alienating conservatives," "de-moralize diversity," "de-emphasize empathy" and "be open about the science of human nature."\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aApparently, the extreme right canonizes tech bros such as Damore for perpetuating sexist stereotypes and celebrating a culture in which white men rule. Yet those people demonize, even criminalize, Kaepernick for silently protesting institutional racism, the abuses of law enforcement and the criminal justice system, and for seeking a world free from police and vigilante violence against black bodies. Apparently, for some, the right to free speech applies to some people and not others.\u000a\u000aFor his political protests on the field, Colin Kaepernick has faced accusations he is un-American. Yet freedom of expression is quintessentially American, and fighting to make one's country match its rhetoric with its actions is an ultimate form of patriotism.

aVWhile home prices in other parts of the country are still 20% below their housing boom peak, demand for large, luxury apartments has helped home prices in Manhattan almost fully recover from the housing bust.\u000a\u000aDuring the first quarter, the median sales price for a condo or co-op in Manhattan rose 18.5% year-over-year to $972,000, according to Douglas Elliman.\u000a\u000aThat's more than four times the median U.S. home price of $205,000. Yet, in most parts of the country $972,000 will typically buy you a sprawling three or four-bedroom with a backyard and a garage. Buyers in Manhattan, however, are willing to shell out that amount for one bedrooms with less than 1,000 square feet of living space.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, prices are expected to continue to climb. Manhattan's home sales are still below the $1.025 million peak set in the second quarter of 2008, said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who calculates the market data for Elliman. But he believes, "we'll probably get there in the second quarter of 2014."\u000a\u000aRelated: Hong Kong buyers send London real estate soaring\u000a\u000aElliman, along with brokers Halstead Property and Corcoran Group, have all reported that sales volume in Manhattan was up 25% or more in the first quarter. And inventory still remains very tight, with homes often being snapped up in bidding wars.\u000a\u000aMiller said 38% of all sales were either at or above asking price and that has caused a big spike in prices.\u000a\u000aAll three brokers reported that they saw high demand in luxury and high-end sales.\u000a\u000aWith little new residential construction happening, there's not enough homes available to handle all of this buyer demand. Only 367 newly built apartments were sold during the quarter. Many were in ultra-luxury buildings catering to an international clientele of Chinese industrialists, Russian oil billionaires and other foreign tycoons.\u000a\u000aAlso boosting prices: Families seeking large apartments of three bedrooms or more, said Diane Ramirez, the CEO of Halstead.\u000a\u000a"Manhattan was often for a segment of your life before you started a family or after you downsized in retirement," she said. "No longer. Now, it's where you want to raise your kids."\u000a\u000aCorcoran reported that 31% of new development closings during the first quarter were for units that had three bedrooms or more.\u000a\u000aRelated: Million dollar housing markets\u000a\u000aManhattan's housing shortage has sent many home seekers further afield to the outer boroughs, New Jersey and Long Island.\u000a\u000aBrooklyn is starting to become even hotter than Manhattan. Brooklyn's Kings County is the fastest growing county in the state, with the median price of homes rising 11.2% to $570,110 in the fourth quarter, according to Douglas Elliman, the last data available.

aVOn this day 10 years ago, lines of Apple faithful formed outside of the company's stores across the U.S.\u000a\u000aSome had staked out their spots days before. They brought folding chairs, umbrellas, sleeping bags and, in San Francisco, one mattress. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) handed out bottles of water. People offered to sell their spots in line for hundreds of dollars.\u000a\u000aA few people were doing it for publicity, but many just wanted to be among the first to own the expensive new smartphone Apple had announced six months earlier.\u000a\u000aIt was the kind of dramatic frenzy any tech company would have killed for, and that Apple specializes in manufacturing. Luckily, its product would live up to the hype, selling more than a billion devices over a decade and changing technology forever.\u000a\u000aRelated: Inside Apple: How the iPhone almost never happened\u000a\u000a"I think that everybody was very, very relieved that when the iPhone ultimately launched at the end of June in 2007, that it actually worked," said tech journalist Fred Vogelstein, who wrote a book on the smartphone race between Apple and Google (GOOGL, Tech30).\u000a\u000aSince that day, Apple has grown the iPhone into its most popular and reliable product. It sold more than 50 million iPhones in the first three months of 2017 alone, bringing in $33.2 billion.\u000a\u000aLooking back at the first iPhone, its limitations seem quaint: It was expensive, starting at $499 for 4GB of memory; it only worked on AT&T's EDGE network; and there was no App Store to speak of.\u000a\u000aNow the company releases a new version of the device every year, sprinkling on new features like water resistance or a fingerprint sensor to entice people to upgrade. All of the specs have been radically improved over the years, from the chip to the camera resolution. And the original size looks quaint 10 years later -- Apple now sells versions that are nearly two times as big.\u000a\u000aThe iPhone's success has had a halo effect on other products and industries. Apple went on to make the iPad, a tablet version of the iPhone. It added an App Store to iOS in 2008. Developers have built careers and billion dollar companies on iPhone apps. Apple says developers around the world have earned more than $16 billion.\u000a\u000aThere's even a movie based on characters that were made famous in iPhone games (that flopped, but still).\u000a\u000a"It is truly remarkable that in the 10 year span of the iPhone being on the market, it has disrupted the telecom industry, the music industry, the television industry, the video industry, the computer industry, the communications industry -- and that's just a start," said analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies.\u000a\u000aNot all the disruption has been in Apple's favor. Released a year and a half after the iPhone, Google's Android mobile operating system has been the biggest competitor to Apple's iOS. Android phones accounted for 84% of the market in the first quarter of this year, according to Gartner.\u000a\u000aRelated: How Android beat the iPhone to world domination\u000a\u000aDespite the competition, people still look to Apple for the next big thing. And after 10 years, it's become restless.\u000a\u000aApple's strength lies in its ability to take existing features and refine, repackage and market them as if they are brand new, according to Tuong Nguyen, an analyst at Gartner. He said the next industries it could push forward are augmented reality and voice interfaces, places where other companies are already doing more work.\u000a\u000aFor now, Apple is focusing on a special version of the iPhone that's expected to come out this fall. It could have conductive charging and an edge-to-edge display. (CEO Tim Cook has blamed slumping iPhone sales on excitement for the new device.)\u000a\u000aWhatever its features when it's unveiled in September, whether mind-blowing or disappointing, people will still line up outside of Apple stores, excited to be the first to touch the latest creation.

A man in a car ran down my cousin, Heather Heyer, because she decided to join her fellow Charlottesville residents against the neo-Nazis and white supremacists on their streets.\u000a\u000aMy family -- we are not the kind of family that is targeted by hate crimes. We come from a white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant background with Appalachian heritage. We have never had to be afraid that someone would target us or lynch us because of the color of our skin.\u000a\u000aWe never had to worry someone wouldn't hire us because of the way we look. We never have to worry that our children might become victims of someone else's prejudice. We've never been told we can't live in a certain neighborhood or attend a certain school because of the color of our skin. Until last week, we had no idea what it feels like to lose someone to hate.\u000a\u000aAfter the news of Heather's death, I attended a Charlottesville solidarity vigil in my hometown. I sat anonymously in the middle of the crowd, silent tears streaming down my face, as speaker after speaker took the stage. People held up pictures of Heather and signs called her a hero. But the moment that will forever be burnt in my memory was when a speaker asked the uncomfortable question. While she hailed Heather's courage, she asked something to this effect: "Why does a white woman have to get killed for you all to become outraged?" All I could think was, "Heather is sitting in heaven right now, shaking her head in agreement."\u000a\u000aWhy have we been turning our heads the other way?\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Although the details are scarce, President Donald Trump's proposed budget, "America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again" (PDF) , paints a dramatic picture for the American science and medical communities that is facing huge potential budget cuts.\u000a\u000aIf it's been a while since you've had a civics class, the Constitution states that it's Congress that gets to decide how to spend the government's money and how to tax its citizens, so this proposal is not the final word on what goes and what stays. But a President essentially starts the conversation, and for many scientists, it's not a happy topic.\u000a\u000aThe National Institutes of Health budget would be cut by $5.8 billion, meaning it would lose about 20%. The Environmental Protection Agency would face $2.6 billion in cuts, that's 31% of the agency's budget. The Department of Energy would lose $900 million, or about 20% of its budget. Health and Human Services would see a $15.1 billion or 18% budget cut; as part of that, it shifts costs to industry from the Food and Drug Administration budget. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would face an 18% budget cut.\u000a\u000aIt's unclear what would happen to the National Science Foundation . That agency gives out more than $7 billion annually in research grants, accounting for about 20% of federal support to academic institutions for basic research, but didn't get a mention in the budget.\u000a\u000aNASA would see a smaller cut by comparison -- a 0.8% decrease from the 2017 budget -- but its Earth Sciences projects would lose about $200 million, and its Office of Education would be dropped.\u000a\u000aThe budget also would eliminate entire programs, such as $403 million in health professionals and nursing training programs. It would kill the Global Climate Change Initiative (PDF) and eliminate payments to the United Nations' efforts to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aIt also would eliminate the fund that is helping clean up Chesapeake Bay . That program was the largest restoration effort for a body of water in American history and is only halfway through.\u000a\u000aThe budget suggests that states should shoulder those costs.\u000a\u000aThe proposal doesn't give a specific funding figure for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it says it would reform the CDC to give states more control over public health by creating a $500 million block grant that would "increase state flexibility and focus on the leading public health challenges to each state." Experts say that could suggest that states would get the funding, as opposed to the federal agency.\u000a\u000aTrump's budget proposal spells out a plan to create a Federal Emergency Response Fund for a rapid response to public health threats like Zika. There's a $20 million increase for the mitigation of lead-based paint in low-income homes, although the budget eliminates the LIHEAP program , which provides heating and cooling assistance to homes in those same communities.\u000a\u000aThe proposal includes $500 million to expand opioid abuse prevention and treatment efforts, $900 million for the Department of the Interior's US Geological Survey to "focus investments in essential science programs" and a billion for water management efforts. There's a $4.4 billion request for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a 6% increase from its current funding. There's also a mention of an investment in "mental health activities" but no specifics.\u000a\u000aThe budget would include some money for international health efforts with a promise to support Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , which works to increase access all over the world. There's also funding for the fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS.\u000a\u000aCongress can accept or reject Trump's budget, and lawmakers have the ability to pick and choose what they like from it.\u000a\u000aAs far as budgets go, Trump's has been compared to President Ronald Reagan's in its conservatism, but Reagan's had a little more "carrot with its stick; this is all stick," budget expert David Wessel said.\u000a\u000aAnd this proposal is a little unusual.\u000a\u000a"It's an interesting first chapter, but I'm disappointed we don't have the rest of it," said Wessel , who is a senior fellow of economic studies with the independent Brookings Institution. The document doesn't come with the usual pages and pages of tables that Congress will use in its conversation on enacting the budget; that part is only 62 pages (PDF). Without detail on taxes and other plans, it's hard to know how the proposed budget would work. "This is more like a bumper sticker than a budget."\u000a\u000aWessel believes the proposal will have a hard time getting through Congress as it stands now because it cuts programs many constituents depend on and programs Congress has increased, like its effort to increase the National Institutes of Health budget last year.\u000a\u000aScience and medical professionals watching the Trump budget process closely had predicted that it could be a tough pill to swallow, but they said they didn't know it would be this hard.\u000a\u000a"I read it a few times again this morning and had to take a few pauses -- to bang my head on the table," said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy with the Union of Concerned Scientists.\u000a\u000a"As scientists, we make decisions based on evidence. What this budget does is ignore evidence and undermine our very ability to collect it across the board," he said.\u000a\u000aRosenberg disagrees with shifting the responsibility to do scientific research. States don't have the capacity, he said, and industry doesn't have the interest or financial incentive to do basic and even some of the applied research the government does. He thinks the proposed budget could hurt the government's mission as an international leader in science.\u000a\u000a"You are telling young, really talented scientists, scientists we need, that you shouldn't go into government, and you are signaling to the senior scientists who have the good experience and knowledge, we need to leave," Rosenberg said. "It sends a really chilling signal across the federal government, and while the public doesn't see a lot of what people in government do, they are doing public service that helps them and has a real impact on their lives."\u000a\u000aSeveral scientific and medical associations also criticized the budget. The American Chemical Society wrote that it "finds these potential cuts extremely concerning because robust, sustained and predictable investments in non-defense research have proven to be critical to the nation's innovation infrastructure, job creation and economic growth."\u000a\u000aThe Alliance for a Stronger FDA appreciated that the proposal "recognizes that FDA's process for reviewing medical products needs resources at least as great as the current level of funding." However, it suggested that the funding mechanism of cutting more than a third of the agency's appropriation and offsetting it with medical product industry user fees "is neither wise nor realistic."\u000a\u000aThe American Medical Association "has grave concerns with proposed deep cuts to the NIH and their impact on patient health. Patients across the country who benefit from NIH research and advancements can attest to its value," said Dr. Andrew W. Gurman, president of the association, in a statement. "NIH conducts vital research into cancer, chronic diseases, and other illnesses, all of which are major drivers of health care costs."\u000a\u000a"The proposed reduction in NIH funding of $5.8 billion would represent a significant setback for millions of American cancer patients, survivors and their families. It would also dramatically constrain the prospect for breakthrough American medical innovation -- an essential American economic driver," said a statement from Chris Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network. "We are at the cusp of tremendous breakthroughs in cancer research, making it exactly the wrong moment to turn back the clock on progress against a disease that continues to kill more than 1,650 people a day in this country."\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, this budget proposal fails to make those investments (in biomedical and health services research) and would make America less great by undermining our commitment to science, medical and health services research, medical education, and research on climate change," a statement from the American College of Physicians said.\u000a\u000aAmerica's Essential Hospitals, one of the professional associations that represents health systems and hospitals, was also critical. "The cumulative effect of this budget and the (GOP health care bill) could be to undermine the ability of essential hospitals to meet their commitment to patients and communities and weaken efforts to respond to existing and emerging threats to the public health," the statement said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aSome federal agencies sent out releases expressing support of the plan. "HHS is dedicated to fulfilling our department's mission to improve the health and well-being of the American people," a statement from Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price said. "This budget supports that mission and will help ensure we are delivering critical services to our fellow citizens in the most efficient and effective manner possible."\u000a\u000aNext, House and Senate committees will hold hearings on the budget proposal.

aVStory highlights RaVal Davis: "Insecure" and "Girls Trip" call out institutional barriers that women face\u000a\u000aBoth films are evening out the playing field by putting more naked men on our screens, writes Davis\u000a\u000aRaVal Davis is an entertainment writer, actress, and advocate for body positivity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) With nearly all-black, female-led casts, both HBO's "Insecure" and feature film "Girls Trip" are clearly breaking all types of color and gender barriers. But it's what's happening behind the scenes that is changing the game on a more interesting frontier. Female writers like "Insecure's" Issa Rae and Erica Rivinoja and Tracy Oliver of "Girls Trip," are leveling the playing field when it comes to male and female nudity, by putting more naked men on our screens. It's just what Hollywood needs.\u000a\u000aFor far too long, naked women have become such a staple in TV and film that it's hard to notice, much less quantify, the inequality unfolding right before our eyes. But a recent study from Mount Saint Mary's University did just that and found that actresses are almost three times as likely as their male counterparts to be required to strip to their unmentionables.\u000a\u000aRaVal Davis\u000a\u000aUndoubtedly, female nudity has become an accomplice to get viewers through bad plotlines and awkward acting. And sometimes it's just the cherry atop the box office sundae. But why is female nudity so much more ubiquitous than male nudity? And what does this say about the role of women in the world?\u000a\u000aAccording to a 2005 University of Pennsylvania study , 57% of US teenagers, ages 14 to 16, identified television, film and other media as the primary source of information about sex and gender. In a post-#ImWithHer era, are we really still OK with such widespread and normalized objectification of the female body?\u000a\u000aBut it's not only an issue for the viewer. It's an even larger issue for the actress being asked to display her body. As a new actress trying my best to break into episodic television, I have to admit I cringe every time I read those typical female character breakdowns. You know the ones: The waitress in the club who has no more than five lines but happens to have sex with the main male character. She's totally inconsequential to the plot but helps move the episode along somehow. And, of course, NUDITY REQUIRED or MUST BE OK WITH NUDITY is bolded at the bottom of the script. It's degrading but seemingly sometimes a necessary evil for actresses to make their way above the five-line mark.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Dutch designer Joris Laarman has built his career through emerging technologies like 3D printing and robotics.\u000a\u000aBut as a student 15 years ago, he didn't even own a computer.\u000a\u000a"After my graduation I got a computer, which changed everything," he said in a phone interview. "My generation was the first to know what it was like before computers, but who also grew up with them."\u000a\u000aNow the 37-year-old can't work without one. From open source furniture designs to a 3D-printed footbridge made from stainless steel, Laarman's work lies at the intersection of design and technology.\u000a\u000aHis company, Joris Laarman Lab , pushes at the experimental edges of an industry that has digitalized rapidly since he graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 2003.\u000a\u000a"We're trying to figure out what the design of the future will be -- what it could look like," he said.\u000a\u000aDigital toolbox\u000a\u000aOne of Laarman's best-known designs is the Bone Chair, which was created through algorithms that mimic bone growth. Using a large volume of computer-generated calculations, Laarman's program systematically adjusted and strengthened the chair's design.\u000a\u000a"Birds' bones have super-optimal construction -- they constantly adapt themselves by taking away material where it's not needed and adding material where it is, without losing strength," he explained.\u000a\u000aUsing a large volume of computer-generated calculations, Laarman's program systematically adjusted and strengthened the chair's design.\u000a\u000a"To me, an algorithm is just a new high-tech version of a saw or a pair of scissors -- it's just a tool. The designs that we make are never finished objects, they're more like programs that we can tweak into new forms and adapt themselves accordingly."\u000a\u000aTechnology is not only changing designers' methods, but also the type of products they can create. More than a simple efficiency measure, Laarman says that digitalization makes entirely new concepts possible.\u000a\u000a"(The shape of the Bone Chair) could never have been invented without the algorithm. You'd need really heavy calculations for such an evolutionary process.\u000a\u000a"If you were to do this manually, without a computer, you'd have to break the legs of the chair thousands of times to make it stronger and to know where to add or take away material."\u000a\u000aDesign to download\u000a\u000aThe Bone Chair is set to go on display at the New York's Cooper Hewitt, The Smithsonian Design Museum , alongside other highlights from Laarman's career, including a set of tables made from reprogrammable molecular building blocks called voxels.\u000a\u000aThe exhibition, titled " Joris Laarman Lab: Design in the Digital Age ," encourages visitors to interact with technologies that may soon become commonplace, said the show's curator Andrea Lipps.\u000a\u000aEach of the 12 chairs in the Maker series is digitally fabricated and assembled from small printed parts, like a 3D puzzle.\u000a\u000a"(Experimental) designers often end up creating things that are so completely foreign that they become almost indigestible," she said. "What's interesting about Joris' work is that there's a familiarity to it that makes it feel less threatening. These designers are the early adopters -- they're taking our hand and leading us into the future."\u000a\u000aWhile Lipps wants the exhibition to be an "interactive, participatory experience," visitors won't get a chance to sit on any of Laarman's chairs. They will, however, be able to download some of the design blueprints.\u000a\u000a"You can download one (of the chairs) for free and make it yourself -- or have it produced by your neighbor if they have a 3D printer," Laarman said. "There are now platforms that show where the 3D printers in your neighborhood are."\u000a\u000aThe 'next industrial revolution'\u000a\u000aThis tools used by Laarman are just some of the digital methods transforming the design industry. Robotics, 3D printing and virtual reality are all changing the way products are made -- from super-strong digitally fabricated materials to cars designed in thin air using VR goggles.\u000a\u000aAccording to research by the consulting firm McKinsey, the cost of 3D printing fell 60 percent between 1990 and 2014, while the price of industrial robots fell by 5 percent every year between 2000 and 2012.\u000a\u000aThis series of tables was made from reprogrammable building blocks called voxels. It was built using industrial robots.\u000a\u000aThis move from industrial to digital production represents a fundamental shift in the economy of design, said Laarman, comparing the transition to the industrial revolution.\u000a\u000a"Modernists in the early 20th century were developing new form languages for the dawn of a new industrial period. It was very much dependent on standardization and geometric shapes.\u000a\u000a"Right now, you can see digital fabrication is taking off and this leads to a completely new type of form language. It's still very early, but everybody sees the potential. Digital design, biotechnology, AI and robotics are going to completely change everything in the world, at every level of society. It's very important to start working on it."\u000a\u000a"Joris Laarman Lab: Design in the Digital Age" will be exhibited at Cooper Hewitt, The Smithsonian Design Museum from 27 September 2017 to 14 January 2018

aVToday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, spoke to CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger in an exclusive interview about the events shaping current domestic and global politics including the Israeli election, the Iran nuclear talks, the terror threats throughout the Middle East, and the nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General.\u000a\u000aTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\u000a\u000aMcCain on President Obama\u2019s reaction to the Israeli election: \u201cthere was a free and fair democratic election, the only nation in the region that will have such a thing. The president should get over it. Get over your temper tantrum, Mr. President. It's time that we work together with our Israeli friends and try to stem this tide of ISIS and Iranian movement throughout the region, which is threatening the very fabric of the region. The least of your problems is what Bibi Netanyahu said during an election campaign. If every politician were held to everything they say in a political campaign, obviously, that would be a topic of long discussion. But the point is, is the J.V., as the president described them, is just moving over into Yemen. We see this horrible situation in Libya. We see ISIS everywhere in the world. We see the Iranians now backing the Shia militias in Tikrit, where they're going to - where they're going to massacre a number of Sunnis. And it is - the guy in charge is a guy named Suleimani, who - who imported - excuse me - I will catch up here - Suleimani moved thousands of copper-tipped IEDs into Iraq and killed hundreds of American soldiers and Marines. And the president of the United States is praising the mullahs and their behavior in the region.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain on President Obama\u2019s message to the Iranian people: \u201cI wish he had spoken to the people of Iran in 2009, when they rose up against a corrupt election and he refused to speak out on their behalf while they were chanting \u2018Obama, Obama, are you with us or are you with them?\u2019 Again, does anyone - does he believe that anyone in Iran is able to speak up? Are they able to speak up for anything that the mullahs disagree with? They're either jailed or killed. Again, this is a view, a world view the president has which is totally divorced from reality.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain on Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination and the issue of race: \u201cMy response is that you can't erase history. These same Democrats led by Senator Durbin filibustered Janice Rogers Brown, the first African-American to the seat on that court - on that court. They filibustered Miguel Estrada. This has nothing to do with race. It has everything to do with trying to get legislation through which would prevent - or help prevent this horrible issue of sexual trafficking that is going on. And also I will add to that, I will not vote for her because she has said she would uphold the president's unconstitutional executive orders concerning immigration.\u201d\u000a\u000aTRANSCRIPT FULL POST

aVBija Knowles, CNN \u2022 Updated 17th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Water, fire and ice have combined to make some of the most spectacular scenery in the world -- from giant crystal caves to mud volcanoes and rock formations that look like works of art.\u000a\u000aIf your office and daily commute aren't a fitting reminder of the extraordinary natural diversity of planet earth, get some inspiration from these incredible scenes.\u000a\u000a1. Pulpit Rock, Preikestolen, Norway\u000a\u000aIf there are any preachers here, they'll be telling you to get back.\u000a\u000aWith a 604-meter drop from a flat plateau down to Lysefjord with no safety railings, this is not a place for vertigo sufferers.\u000a\u000aKeep well back from the edge and you can still enjoy the fantastic scenery over Kjerag peak, which itself drops 984 meters.\u000a\u000aPreikestolen is south of Jorpeland. From the designated car park it's a 90-minute hike to the viewpoint.\u000a\u000a2. Gran Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia\u000a\u000aThe Gran Salar de Uyuni in southern Bolivia takes in more than 10 square kilometers of salt. It feels more like a desert than a lake.\u000a\u000aThe flat, white landscape causes optical illusions and reflects colors. There's even a hotel made almost entirely of salt and an island where giant cacti grow in the middle of the salt lake.\u000a\u000aGran Salar de Uyuni is 533 kilometers south of La Paz and 200 kilometers southwest of Potosi.\u000a\u000a3. Ngorogoro Crater, Tanzania\u000a\u000aMore than enough room to swing a very big cat.\u000a\u000aThe Ngorogoro Crater is Africa's Eden. Created when a huge volcano exploded 2-3 million years ago, the 300 square kilometer caldera now offers the best chances of seeing Africa's wild animals.\u000a\u000aLions, rhino, leopards, elephant and buffalo are the "big five" present among around 25,000 animals, and nearly every species present in East Africa, which call the area home.\u000a\u000aBesides that, the crater itself offers dramatic vistas, especially at sunrise.\u000a\u000aFrom Kilimanjaro International Airport you can fly or drive the 55 kilometers to Arusha, from where you can organize tours and accommodation inside and outside the crater.\u000a\u000a4. Paria Canyon, Arizona, United States\u000a\u000aNot all great waves can be surfed.\u000a\u000aThe Paria River in northern Arizona carved its own smaller version of the Grand Canyon. Some of the rock formations, including The Wave, are just as spectacular.\u000a\u000aVisitors need a permit from the Bureau of Land Management -- the permit for an overnight trek comes with a "human waste bag," so if you want to visit this natural wonder, you'll have to prepare to pack your waste.\u000a\u000aThe Paria Contact Station is 69 kilometers east of Kanab. You can hire a guide through the Bureau of Land Management\u000a\u000a5. Volcanic eruptions at Stromboli, Italy\u000a\u000aA fireworks show millions of years in the making.\u000a\u000aPart of the Aeolian Islands off the coast of Sicily, Stromboli is a small volcanic island with several hundred brave inhabitants.\u000a\u000aUnlike most volcanoes, Stromboli's is constantly spewing lava fountains, gas and ash. Fascinating for volcanologists, but also great for day-trippers who fancy seeing live lava action.\u000a\u000aFor natural fireworks, take a boat trip around the island at night.\u000a\u000aArrange boat tours from harbors on the north coast of Sicily (Messina, Cefalu, Palermo).\u000a\u000a6. Mud volcanoes of Gobustan, Azerbaijan\u000a\u000aOne of the few places you can bathe in a volcanic eruption.\u000a\u000aMud lovers trek to Gobustan's strangely Martian landscape, 65 kilometers south of Azerbaijan's capital Baku, where thick gray mud regularly spews from small volcanoes.\u000a\u000aThe mud is thought to have medicinal qualities, so don't be surprised if you see people stripping down and lathering themselves in the goo. Look out for the area's Roman inscriptions and the petroglyphic rock art.\u000a\u000aAbout 70 kilometers west of Baku.\u000a\u000a7. Jeita Grotto, Nahr al-Kalb Valley, Lebanon\u000a\u000aEighteen kilometers northeast of Beirut, Jeita Grotto is comprised of underground limestone caves were inhabited in prehistoric times and continue to attract human visitors with their vivid colors and stalactite formations. The biggest stalactite in the world is here.\u000a\u000aThe caves consist of a network of chambers -- with an upper and a lower gallery -- stretching out for nine kilometers and accessible by an underground river.\u000a\u000aThe nearest town is Juniyah, just a few kilometers away. Cave tours last two hours.\u000a\u000a8. Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail, Wales\u000a\u000aYou can almost hear the male choirs in the distance.\u000a\u000aThis path twists 300 kilometers from St. Dogmaels to Amroth in southwest Wales.\u000a\u000aIt's often wet and windy, but if you strike lucky on a sunny day this is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Scented gorse and crimson heather brighten the way.\u000a\u000aLook for seals in the waters below.\u000a\u000aPaths are signposted -- join the path on the coast between St. Dogmaels and Amroth. Details on guided walks and activities can be found on the National Trails website -- including self-guided walks with baggage transfer.\u000a\u000a9. Pangong Tso Lake, India-China\u000a\u000aBeautiful to look at. But swimming here is only for masochists.\u000a\u000aThis saltwater lake deep in the Himalayas at an altitude of 4,350 meters lies astride a disputed border area between India and China-governed Tibet.\u000a\u000aDon't let that put you off -- the rarefied air make the colors and clarity of the lake intense.\u000a\u000aPangong Tso is reached by a mountain road from the Indian town of Leh, but you'll need to get a permit via a registered tour guide.\u000a\u000aGet to Leh by road from Jammu, or by plane from Delhi. At Leh arrange a permit and travel by road 4-5 hours to the lake. Permits and tour guides can be arranged through reputable travel agents such as Kuoni\u000a\u000a10. Geirangerfjord and Naeroyfjord, Norway\u000a\u000aNot a Norwegian motor car.\u000a\u000aIf you only have time to visit two fjords in your lifetime, make it the Geirangerfjord and Naeroyfjord in southwest Norway.\u000a\u000aThese are among the world's longest and deepest fjords, with high vertical cliffs, deep waters and giddy waterfalls. Both are on the UNESCO World Heritage list\u000a\u000aTrips can be arranged from Bergen and Alesund.\u000a\u000a11. South Kaibab Trail, Grand Canyon, Arizona, United States\u000a\u000a"Ooh Ah Point" awaits the adventurous.\u000a\u000aMost visitors view the canyon from South Rim viewing stations. Considering that it has taken the Colorado River the past 17 million years to carve this wonder out of rock, it seems only fair to take a closer look.\u000a\u000aBuilt by the National Park Service in 1924, the South Kaibab Trail takes you to the wonderfully named "Ooh Ah Point" and, for the adventurous, further into the canyon's depths. Plan carefully, heat stroke is no fun.\u000a\u000aIn the northwest corner of Arizona, visitors usually head to South Rim Village (120 kilometers northwest of Flagstaff on route 180) or the North Rim Village. Free shuttle buses service the South Rim in summer months. Ranger-led day hikes and walks take place throughout the year.\u000a\u000a12. Mount Roraima, Guyana/Brazil/Venezuela\u000a\u000a1. Climb. 2. Catch breath. 3. Stand in awe.\u000a\u000aSouth America's answer to Uluru, this impressive sandstone plateau is surrounded on all sides by 400-meter cliffs, creating an isolated and unique ecosystem.\u000a\u000aIf you want to follow in David Attenborough's footsteps (he's filmed several times here), organize a trek from the Venezuelan side.\u000a\u000aHiking up Mount Roraima is best done from Venezuela. The Paratepui Route is the easiest for non-technical climbers and trips can be arranged from San Francisco de Yurani.\u000a\u000a13. Verdon Gorge, Provence, France\u000a\u000aUp a creek without a paddle? Not so bad.\u000a\u000aThe gorgeous turquoise waters of the Verdon River flow through one of Europe's most beautiful gorges for 25 kilometers.\u000a\u000aSwim in the translucent waters of Lac de St. Croix and stare in awe at the 700-meter walls of the Verdon Gorge. If you've got a head for heights, it's a popular destination for rock-climbing.\u000a\u000aThe Verdon Gorge is on the border of the departements of Var and the Alpes de Hautes Provence.\u000a\u000a14. Jiuzhaigou National Park, Sichuan Province, China\u000a\u000aAll the colors of nature in one park.\u000a\u000aThe three valleys that form this biosphere reserve contain a network of connected lakes, waterfalls and rivers -- the most spectacular of which are the Pearl Waterfalls.\u000a\u000aSpot the ancient tree trunks under the clear waters of Five Flower Lake. Wooden paths and shuttle buses help visitors get around.\u000a\u000aIn the north of Sichuan, the nearest town to Jiuzhaigou National Park is Songpan.\u000a\u000a15. Lake Nakuru, Kenya\u000a\u000aAnd you thought your city was crowded.\u000a\u000aA streak of blue (and pink) in Kenya's Great Rift Valley, Lake Nakuru is home to thousands of pink flamingoes that flock here to feed on the lake's algae.\u000a\u000aA UNESCO Heritage Site, Lake Nakuru National Park is also home to hippos, white and black rhino, giraffe and buffalo.\u000a\u000aTake a matatu 156 kilometers northwest of Nairobi, or a plane to the Naishi airstrip.\u000a\u000a16. Uluru/Ayers Rock, Australia\u000a\u000aBetter from afar.\u000a\u000aAustralia's favorite giant sandstone mass is 350 meters high and more than nine kilometers in circumference.\u000a\u000aIt's a sacred and spiritual site for its custodians, the aboriginal Anangu, so climbing the rock is considered disrespectful to them. It can also be dangerous.\u000a\u000aUluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is about 440 kilometers southwest of Alice Springs. Flights are available from most major cities to Ayers Rock airport.\u000a\u000a17. Siwa Oasis, Egypt\u000a\u000aYes, you can swim in the Sahara.\u000a\u000aThis isolated oasis has natural springs and fertile land, providing access to spectacular stretches of Sahara desert. It's a great spot for star gazing from your tent in the sand, but bring your bathing suit for a dip in its hot and cold natural pools.\u000a\u000aA 10-hour drive west of Cairo. Public buses take much longer. Desert safaris can be arranged in Siwa\u000a\u000a18. Seljalandsfoss Waterfall, Iceland\u000a\u000aA waterfall you can stand beneath without getting wet.\u000a\u000aWaterfall connoisseurs agree it's not size that counts. The biggest and the highest may be impressive, but when it comes to cascading water, Iceland's Seljalandsfoss has style.\u000a\u000aThe sight of the Seljalandsa River dropping 62 meters down the sheer cliff face has made it a must-see Iceland attraction. There's a path that goes behind the cascade, so bring your waterproof camera.\u000a\u000aOn Road 1, it's 125 kilometers southeast of Reykjavik.\u000a\u000a19. Perito Moreno Glacier, Patagonia, Argentina\u000a\u000aWe got ice, who brought the drinks?\u000a\u000aThis 30-kilometer glacier in Patagonia's Los Glaciares National Park (not to be confused with the Perito Moreno National Park) grows and contracts, often forming a natural ice dam on the "elbow" of Lago Argentino.\u000a\u000aThe force of the trapped water causes a spectacular rupture every four to five years. Even when the ice isn't exploding, the sight of the glacier's blue peaks is a lifetime attraction.\u000a\u000aFly from Buenos Aires to El Calafate in Patagonia. The alternative is a very long bus journey.\u000a\u000a20. Moraine Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada\u000a\u000aHow many natural features can you fit into one picture?\u000a\u000aDeep in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Moraine Lake -- together with its sister Lake Louise -- is one of the most photographed landscapes in Banff National Park.\u000a\u000aIt's known as the jewel of the Rockies for its deep crystalline waters that mirror pine forests, soaring mountains and endless sky.\u000a\u000aDrive or take a direct bus 128 kilometers west from Calgary to Banff.\u000a\u000a21. Cascate del Mulino, Saturnia, Tuscany, Italy\u000a\u000aSteaming hot spring water comes out of the ground at 37.5 C and cascades over a series of small waterfalls into dozens of pools on consecutive levels.\u000a\u000aNiagara Falls it ain't, but the cascading thermal springs at Saturnia are a lot of fun. Soak in the natural sulfurous mineral water and just maybe cure ailments from rheumatism to muscle ache.\u000a\u000aAbout 10 kilometers north of the small Tuscan town of Manciano, northeast of Orbetello.\u000a\u000a22. William Bay, Western Australia\u000a\u000aYes, these rocks do look a little like elephants. But only a little.\u000a\u000aA five-hour drive south of Perth, William Bay in Denmark, Western Australia, has turquoise waters that lap around white sands and the Elephant Rocks, which shelter an area of rock pools and granite terraces called Green's Pool.\u000a\u000aThe calm waters are perfect for snorkeling, while the more adventurous have the Great Southern Ocean on the other side.\u000a\u000aFifteen kilometers west of the town of Denmark.\u000a\u000a23.

Wadden Sea, Germany and the Netherlands\u000a\u000aNot much to look at, but still spectacular.\u000a\u000aUNESCO describes the Wadden Sea as "the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world." In other words, it's a surreal hinterland along the coast of Germany and the Netherlands that combines wide-open stretches of sand and shallow seas.\u000a\u000aIt's also home to migratory birds. Go there and you'll feel a million miles from anywhere else on earth and about as small as one of the clams at your feet.\u000a\u000aThis 600-kilometer stretch of coast lies between the towns of Den Helder in the Netherlands and Niebull in Germany.\u000a\u000a30. Puerto Princesa Subterranean River, Palawan, Philippines\u000a\u000aAfter trains and caves, here's another way to get underground.\u000a\u000aNominated as one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River runs for 8.2 kilometers underground and boasts limestone karst formations, stalactites and stalagmites.\u000a\u000aYou can cruise down the river in a canoe.

Check safety notices first.\u000a\u000aVisit the falls from Livingstone in Zambia.\u000a\u000a33. Finistere, France\u000a\u000aOne of Pointe du Raz's rare calm moods.\u000a\u000aThe remote headland in Brittany really does feel like the end of the world (its name is derived from the Latin finis terrae).\u000a\u000aIn front lies the Atlantic Ocean, while along the coast natural rocky harbors and inlets create a rugged landscape.\u000a\u000aTourists flock to Pointe du Raz, which points like a craggy finger at a lighthouse in often choppy waters, but on sunny days the abers are peaceful and protected from the elements.\u000a\u000aAccessible from Brest, Brittany.\u000a\u000a34. Fernando De Noronha, Brazil\u000a\u000aJoin turtles, dolphins and sharks for a look.\u000a\u000aFernando De Noronha is an archipelago of 21 tropical islands, 350 kilometers from mainland Brazil, is famed for its idyllic sandy beaches, marine life and hiking trails.\u000a\u000aIt's now a marine national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site, where hawksbill turtles, dolphins, sharks and endangered species are protected.\u000a\u000aThe island life wasn't always a paradise.

Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia\u000a\u000aSwimming with the fishes, in a good way.\u000a\u000aMade up of nearly 3,000 individual reefs, the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland extends for 2,600 kilometers and is the world's largest structure made of living organisms. It's even visible from space.\u000a\u000aA favorite on UNESCO's World Heritage list, this delicate ecosystem is home to porpoises, green sea turtles, whales and dugongs. But the reef is threatened by climate change and coral bleaching that occurs when water temperatures rise.\u000a\u000aBase your visit from any of the towns on the east coast of Queensland between Gladstone and Thursday Island. Choose a tour operator approved by the Marine Park authority.\u000a\u000a36.

The Gombasek cave is probably the more photographed, with its impressive rock formations giving it the feel of a fairy tale city.\u000a\u000aDrive 240 kilometers northeast of Budapest to the Aggteleki National Park.\u000a\u000a37. Mount Bromo, Indonesia\u000a\u000aWatch out for pickpockets and live-chicken throwers.\u000a\u000aThis smoking crater inside the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park sits in a sea of sand.\u000a\u000aIt's actually a small active volcano inside the much larger caldera of an ancient extinct volcano.\u000a\u000aWhile the volcano is still active and has recently been closed off to the public, it's still a point of pilgrimage for Javanese Hindus, who congregate every year in the Kasada festival, during which live chickens are thrown into the crater.\u000a\u000aTravel to Mount Bromo by train or bus from Surubaya, or hire a car and do the two-three hour drive.\u000a\u000a38. Freycinet National Park, Tasmania, Australia\u000a\u000aWorst thing about Wineglass Bay -- the water sports that make you feel lazy.\u000a\u000aFreycinet's white sand beach at Wineglass Bay, pink granite rock formations and Hazards peaks are among Tasmania's most stunning coastal scenery.

The waterfalls are accessible from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.\u000a\u000aA walk through the national park will take you not only to the Devil's Throat and close to the curtain of water, it will also give you a chance to spot coral trees, butterflies, toucans and hummingbirds.\u000a\u000aBuses travel from most cities in the region to Puerto Iguazu, or you can fly to Iguazu International Airport.\u000a\u000a40. Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve, Madagascar\u000a\u000aNot easy to navigate, but worth it.\u000a\u000aSpiky limestone rock formations and mangrove forests are part of the tropical and otherworldly landscape of the Tsingy de Bemaraha nature reserve on the western side of Madagascar.\u000a\u000aThe reserve is home to chameleons, lemurs and endangered birds.\u000a\u000aAlso part of the landscape is the Manambolo River, which runs red with eroded sediment from the highlands of Madagascar.\u000a\u000aThe reserve is 400 kilometers west of Antananarivo.\u000a\u000a41. Cueva de los Cristales/Cave of Crystals, Mexico\u000a\u000aIn 2000, a group of miners tunneling in the Naica mine, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, found an underground cavern containing giant selenite crystals -- some as long as 11 meters.\u000a\u000aThe size and beauty of these gypsum crystals brought the Cave of Crystals instant fame.\u000a\u000aBut the future of the cave is uncertain. While access is currently possible for short periods, the cave may be closed and flooded in the future to stop the crystals from disintegrating.\u000a\u000aThe Naica mine is 135 kilometers southeast of the city of Chihuahua.\u000a\u000a42. The Bay of Fundy, Canada\u000a\u000aClimbs and falls more than the NYSE.\u000a\u000aOne of four places on earth with extreme tidal highs and lows, the Bay of Fundy sees a vertical rise in sea level of as much as 17 meters twice a day.\u000a\u000aMore than 100 billion tons of seawater rush in and out of the bay daily, sculpting unique basalt shapes out of the rocks along the coast.\u000a\u000aTravel between the bay's islands and coastal towns is possible by small car ferry.\u000a\u000a43. Halong Bay, Vietnam\u000a\u000aTurning every visitor into a photographer.\u000a\u000aThousands of small islands and standing stacks, or karsts, overgrown with green shrubbery, protrude from Halong Bay , a peaceful bay.\u000a\u000aThe popular way to explore is in a traditional Chinese trading ship -- the brown-paneled sails of the junks have become as much a part of the landscape as the towering rocks.\u000a\u000aMost visitors to Halong Bay come via Hanoi -- 170 kilometers away, or five to six hours on a public bus. Private cars can be hired. Even rented helicopters make the journey.\u000a\u000a44. Punkaharju Esker Nature Reserve, Finland\u000a\u000aThis seven-kilometer esker, or sand ridge, was formed during the Ice Age and has been an important trade route in eastern Finland for millennia.\u000a\u000aCalm lakes lie on either side and tall pines provide shade for moss, toadstools and blueberries -- easy to see how fairy tales are born. You expect a frog with a crown to hop off the nearest giant mushroom, or a mystical hand to reach out of the lake.\u000a\u000aTake a train from Helsinki to Punkaharju or drive the 350 kilometers northeast of Helsinki.\u000a\u000a45. Frozen Sea in Lulea, Sweden\u000a\u000aThis isn't the only place in the world where the sea freezes over, but the town's location -- jutting out into the sea -- makes the frozen water a welcome extension of the town's streets in the depths of winter.\u000a\u000aFrom December to February, locals skate, snow-trek and sled across the bay, while some roads -- across the sea -- are passable only in winter.\u000a\u000aSigns advise you to remove your seatbelt for a quicker exit should your car come across thin ice.\u000a\u000aThere are several daily flights to Lulea from Stockholm, which is easier than driving the 900 kilometers.\u000a\u000a46. Trango Towers, Pakistan\u000a\u000aWhen you leave a deposit for a chopper rescue you know it's serious climbing.\u000a\u000aSome of the highest cliffs in the world are in northeastern Pakistan in the Karakoram mountain range.\u000a\u000aTrango Tower, for instance, rises a kilometer above the other granite spires in its ridge and has an elevation of more than 6,200 meters above sea level. It's a sight that's just too tempting for intrepid climbers and base-jumpers.\u000a\u000aTake a local bus or taxi from Islamabad to Skardu.\u000a\u000a47. Fox Glacier, South Island, New Zealand\u000a\u000aA beautiful scene, but don't get too close.\u000a\u000aAlong with the 12-kilometer Franz Josef Glacier (a short distance up the coast), the 13-kilometer Fox Glacier on New Zealand's South Island is one of the most easily accessible ice masses in the world.\u000a\u000aFox Glacier reaches almost to the coast, just 250 meters above sea level. Large chucks of ice breaking off the face make it dangerous to get too close.\u000a\u000aFox Glacier is in Westland National Park, 200 kilometers west of Christchurch. Get information on guided tours here\u000a\u000a48. The Shilin Stone Forest, China\u000a\u000aThe historic Stone Forest.\u000a\u000aSpread over 350 square kilometers in Yunnan province, these stone needles look like an ancient petrified forest -- the rock formations stand tall and emerge vertically from the ground.\u000a\u000aThe karst rocks are more than 270 million years old. Local legend says the forest was created when a young woman was forbidden to marry her love -- she rebelled by turning herself into stone.\u000a\u000aShilin Stone Forest can be reached by road 96 kilometers southeast of Kunming in Yunnan province.\u000a\u000a49. Na Pali Coast, Kauai, Hawaii, United States\u000a\u000aThe best of a spectacular bunch.\u000a\u000aWhether sandy beaches, giant waves or volcanic craters, Hawaii has plenty of breathtaking landscapes. But the drama and scale of the Na Pali coast of Kauai, along the 17-kilometer Kalalau trail, may top them all.\u000a\u000aThe lush green mountains ripple with scree slopes and ridges for more than 1,300 meters before dipping into the Pacific.\u000a\u000aAccessible only by 17-kilometer hike from Ke`e Beach to Kalalau Valley, or by boat.\u000a\u000a50. Lake Baikal, Russia\u000a\u000aA lake so big it has its own monster.\u000a\u000aLake Baikal in southern Siberia is not only the deepest and oldest lake in the world (more than 1,600 meters deep and more than 25 million years old), it holds almost 20 percent of the world's freshwater supply.\u000a\u000aThe UNESCO World Heritage Site is a unique ecosystem that supports more than 2,600 species of plant and animals. There have even been reports of a "Baikal Monster," likely to be a giant sturgeon.\u000a\u000aThe nearest city is Irkutsk, about 120 kilometers north of the Mongolian border.

aV(CNN) Tropical Storm Franklin is strengthening over the Caribbean Sea, menacing Mexico with storm warnings and a hurricane watch issued for the Yucatan peninsula.\u000a\u000aThe government of Mexico has issued a hurricane watch for part of the eastern peninsula from Chetumal to Punta Allen.\u000a\u000aThe National Hurricane Center said Franklin lay about 265 miles (425 km) east of Belize City at 5 a.m ET Monday and was expected to pass well north of Honduras to bring storm conditions to the peninsula by the afternoon.\u000a\u000a"Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast until the center reaches the eastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula, and Franklin could be near hurricane strength by the time landfall occurs this evening. Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center," the center's advisory said.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Caught between an ascendent China and an increasingly unreliable United States, Singapore's diplomatic future is at the heart of a debate on who really calls the shots in Asia.\u000a\u000aThe Lion City has historically had strong relations with both countries, an ally in Asia for Washington during the Cold War and one of China's first partners in their efforts to modernize their economy.\u000a\u000aOver the years Singapore has been very good at picking "the middle path" between the two superpowers, analysts tell CNN, balancing their positive relationships with both America and China.\u000a\u000aBut as new US President Donald Trump's attention drifts and Chinese leader Xi Jinping grows more powerful, Singapore finds itself in a tenuous position.\u000a\u000a"If anyone can do this balancing act, Singapore can," Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College London, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"If Singapore can't, no one can."\u000a\u000aThe mouse who roared\u000a\u000aJust seven years ago it seemed like Singapore's path was stable and secure.\u000a\u000a"We are in Asia; Asia is booming," Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an interview in 2010.\u000a\u000a"China is a big story and a major trading partner for us, but China is not the whole story ... America plays a role in Asia which China cannot replace, and nobody can replace."\u000a\u000aSingapore, which marks its National Day August 9, is politically and geographically unique.\u000a\u000aThe South East Asian nation, which is home to a majority ethnic Chinese population, is the only country in the world to have both English and Mandarin among its official languages.\u000a\u000aWith a population of five million, the Lion City is also a international financial hub and a fiercely free market.\u000a\u000aAs its neighbors have succumbed to successive waves of political and financial turmoil, Singapore has remained prosperous and stable.\u000a\u000a"It's a bridge between the West and the East," Wang Yiwei, professor at the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China said.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, hundreds of billions of dollars in exports and imports poured through Singapore's teeming waterways, consistently the second busiest container port in the world after Shanghai.\u000a\u000aPolitically, Singapore regularly punches above its weight. The city state was a founding member of ASEAN, the powerful grouping of south-east Asian nations including Indonesia and the Philippines, and since 2010 has often been invited to participate in G20 events\u000a\u000aCNN contacted Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan for this story but he didn't respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aPowerful friends\u000a\u000aThe country's power doesn't just come from its wealth but also from the powerful friendships it has made with the world's two largest superpowers.\u000a\u000aSingapore has close historic and military ties to the United States, forged during the Cold War when former leader Lee Kuan Yew took a firm stand against communism in South East Asia.\u000a\u000a"When the United States was fighting the Vietnam war, Singapore offered a place for US troops to come for their vacation, sometimes dock their ships and refuel their aircraft," Chong Ja Ian, associate professor at National University of Singapore's Department of Political Science, said.\u000a\u000aUS President Donald Trump and Singapore Prime Minister Lee meet at the G20 Summit in Germany, July 8.\u000a\u000aDespite Lee's firm stance against communism, Singapore was also quick to embrace China once it began to open up economically in the 1980s under then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\u000a\u000a"Singapore seized the opportunity for working with the Chinese ... in terms of friendship it blossomed very quickly, not just because of of the economic opportunities but linguistic similarities that made it a bit easier for them to enter the Chinese market earlier," Chong said.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, China's Xi demonstrated how highly Singapore sat in Beijing's estimation when he held a landmark meeting with then President of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou in the city.\u000a\u000aThe tactic paid off: China and the United States are today two of Singapore's largest trading partners, according to UN numbers.\u000a\u000aA full quarter of Singapore's exports, about $60 billion, are destined for China and Hong Kong while $30 billion of its imports flood in from the United States.\u000a\u000a"It's very natural ... Singapore is a very important international trade and finance center not only in China but also for other countries (in the region)," he said.\u000a\u000aBut in the past year, amid the rise of both Trump and an assertive Beijing, Singapore's position has become less simple.\u000a\u000aChinese President Xi Jinping (right) shakes hands with prime minster Lee during the G20 at Hangzhou in 2016.\u000a\u000a"China sees Singapore as being too close to America and there's a sense in which that's correct," said Michael Barr, associate professor of International Relations at Adelaide's Flinders University and author of "The Ruling Elite of Singapore."\u000a\u000aBarr said Singapore is uncomfortable with the unpredictability of President Trump, whose country the Lion State still relies heavily on for their ongoing security.\u000a\u000a"This is their dilemma. There is not a lot they can do about pulling back from America ... (but) they know full well that in the long term they have to orient towards China," he said.\u000a\u000a'Cranky bear in a small cave'\u000a\u000aAs with so much political wrangling in South East Asia, Singapore's problems began with the South China Sea.\u000a\u000aRelations between Singapore and China certainly haven't always been smooth. At an ASEAN meeting in Vietnam in 2010, incensed by discussions over the South China Sea, then-China foreign minister Yang Jiechi issued a warning to the Singaporean minister in attendance.\u000a\u000a"China is a big country and other countries are small countries, and that's just a fact," he said to the crowded room.\u000a\u000aSix years later, Singapore urged China to abide by a UN arbitration on the South China Sea, which was originally filed by the Philippines despite huge protests from Beijing.\u000a\u000aChina immediately plunged relations with Singapore into a deep chill.\u000a\u000aIn November 2016, nine of Singapore's armored troop carriers were impounded for two months in Hong Kong on their way back from Taiwan. It was widely seen as a slap on the wrist by Chinese authorities.\u000a\u000aBut the freeze showed China is fully willing to exercise its ever-growing regional and international power against countries who go against its interests.\u000a\u000a"China has reached the stage ... where they feel that they can dictate to smaller powers the relationship they will have with China, and if they wish to exercise levels of independence then China will decide how far they can go," Barr said.\u000a\u000a"It will be more and more like living with a cranky bear in a small cave."\u000a\u000aThe age of Trump\u000a\u000aIn the past, Singapore's strong security alliance with the United States helped temper concerns regarding China.\u000a\u000aBut that's no longer the case. "No one (in Asia) really knows what's happening in Washington," explained Brown.\u000a\u000a"Singapore are very aware they can't make any assumptions now, their assumption for the past 50 years is that keep close to the Americans no matter what. But now the big boys are acting in a very unpredictable way."\u000a\u000aThe new US president hasn't visited the Lion State but his Secretary of Defense James Mattis swung by in June for the annual Shangri-La Dialogue Asian Security Summit.\u000a\u000a"Once we've exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing. We will still be there," he said, pledging to stand by Washington's allies in Asia.\u000a\u000aBut experts have questioned whether the Obama Administration's highly publicized pivot to Asia would survive under President Trump.\u000a\u000aThere may also be stark policy disagreements between the two countries, on a topic they were previously in lockstep.\u000a\u000aSingapore is one of the world's staunchest defenders of the free trade, because without it the tiny city-state would not be able to exist.\u000a\u000a"Trump on his own has the capacity to take away any good and sensible reason for Singapore and most of Asia to maintain relations with the US," Barr said.\u000a\u000a"If he seriously goes down the path of closing down free trade, putting up obstacles, being an unreliable ally ... I can see not just Singapore but the whole of South East Asia lining up with China."\u000a\u000a'Singapore is not unique'\u000a\u000aSingapore is not alone in considering what Asia's future will look like with a dominant China and an inward-looking United States.\u000a\u000a"Philippines, Malaysia, all across the region there's been a real push (by Beijing)," Brown said. "Singapore is not unique, it's just because Singapore's been so adept at balancing (both sides)."\u000a\u000aOne of the first signs of a closer relationship between Singapore and Beijing would be any changes to their military exercises with Taiwan, a sensitive topic between the two countries, as China views it as a breakaway province.\u000a\u000aSingapore's famous Merlion (C) in front of the city's skyline in February, 2015.\u000a\u000a"I think there is an awareness that at the end of the day the relationship with China is so much more important than anything else, in terms of economics, so they might think of this as something of a tradeoff," Brown said.\u000a\u000aBut already Singapore's rhetoric has begun to change. In his Singapore National Day speech in 2016, Prime Minister Lee's language had come a long way from his 2010 interview, where he said China could never replace the US.\u000a\u000a"We are friends with both America and with China ... Both believe the Pacific is vast enough to accommodate both powers and President Xi said recently that America and China should "cultivate common circles of friends," he told his countrymen.\u000a\u000a"That is precisely what Singapore's trying to do."

aVStory highlights Sen. John McCain cast the deciding vote against his party's Obamacare repeal plan\u000a\u000aSen. Mazie Hirono emotionally addressed the Senate regarding health care Thursday night\u000a\u000aWashington (CNN) Sen. John McCain was the focus of much media attention this week when he dramatically returned to Washington following recent brain surgery and cast the decisive vote scuttling GOP efforts to pass a health care plan early Friday morning.\u000a\u000aBut he wasn't the only senator battling late-stage cancer whose vote effectively saved Obamacare. On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, also voted against the "skinny repeal" bill.\u000a\u000aHirono announced she was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer in May. Her doctor noticed an abnormality on an X-ray and discovered that it was kidney cancer, which had already spread to her seventh rib. She had a kidney removed days after the diagnosis and later underwent surgery to remove a lesion on her rib in late June.\u000a\u000aAddressing the Senate late Thursday night, Hirono spoke out against the GOP's health care plan, emotionally discussing her upbringing in rural Japan, where she lost a 2-year-old sister to pneumonia and worried about her mother getting sick without access to medical care. She then talked about her own health.\u000a\u000a"When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer," Hirono said, "I heard from so many of my colleagues, including so many of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, who wrote me such wonderful notes."

aV(CNN) Threats, bribes and stuffed ballot boxes may sound like a political drama, but these are all real issues that Africans face during national elections, a public opinion study has revealed.\u000a\u000aThe results, published by pan-African research institute Afrobarometer paint a dire picture of trust in the democratic process on the continent, where less than half (44%) of people across the 36 countries surveyed say they trust their national electoral commission only somewhat or a lot.\u000a\u000aPeople in countries with upcoming elections, or who have had elections recently, expressed some of the lowest levels of trust, says lead author Peter Penar, a researcher and lecturer in political science at Michigan State University.\u000a\u000a'Alarming numbers'\u000a\u000aTake Gabon for example, which has seen post election protests and unrest this month after opposition leader Jean Ping lost by less than 6,000 votes.\u000a\u000aThere, 51% have no trust at all in their election commission, and a mere 25% say they trust them a lot or somewhat.\u000a\u000a"Those are all very alarming numbers and, it shows an extreme lack of confidence," Penar says.\u000a\u000aThe survey was based on face-to-face interviews with between 1,200 and 2,400 people in each of the 36 countries.\u000a\u000aWhile individuals' responses are not published, the researchers have identified a number of key factors contributing to the lack of trust.\u000a\u000aA checkered history\u000a\u000aA history of vote manipulation entrenched in people's memories, lack of transparency of election monitoring bodies and corruption all influence people's trust in the system and many are afraid when casting their vote, the researchers found.\u000a\u000aBut what worries people the most is the counting of votes, Penar says, with 38% of Africans believing votes are only sometimes, or even never counted.\u000a\u000aVote counts can be tampered with in many ways, according to Penar.\u000a\u000a"[This happens] at the polling stations. Stuffing ballots, double voting, multiple voting."\u000a\u000aMethods for swaying voters may also include threats, actual violence and bribery.\u000a\u000aHow much for your vote?\u000a\u000aBribery is commonplace in some countries, the study showed.\u000a\u000aThe practice is illegal, and so rather than asking people whether they have accepted bribes, researchers posed the more indirect question of how often people in the country face bribery around election time.\u000a\u000aOn average, 43% of Africans said people are often or always bribed, with nearly 70% saying voters were bribed at least sometimes.\u000a\u000aSome countries returned startlingly high numbers. In Mali, 78% of people said voters were often or always bribed, and in Senegal the figure was 68%.\u000a\u000aThe bribes may range from giving a little money at the polling stations to being offered seeds or medicines during campaigns, Penar says.\u000a\u000aThreats of violence at the polls\u000a\u000aVoter intimidation is also key, the researchers found, with 44% of those surveyed saying they are sometimes, often or always threatened with violence when voting.\u000a\u000a"That's incredibly high," says Penar.\u000a\u000a"This makes people afraid of going to the polls and expressing an autonomous and personal choice of who they want to win."\u000a\u000aSurprising findings\u000a\u000aAmong the most surprising findings, according to Penar, was the lack of trust in Ghana, which goes to the polls in December this year.\u000a\u000a"We think of Ghana as a country that's really improved in terms of electoral competition and having alternation of power."\u000a\u000aStill, 37% of Ghanaians say they don't trust the national electoral commission at all.\u000a\u000aThe picture looks different across the Atlantic. A 2016 Pew study showed that 78% of US citizens are confident, or very confident, that their vote will be counted fairly in the upcoming election.\u000a\u000aIn Africa, the Afrobarometer study showed that an average 54% across the 36 countries believe that, votes are often or always counted fairly in their country.\u000a\u000aCan digital save the day?\u000a\u000aNew digital tools such as using fingerprints and digital imaging to identify voters is changing the way elections are run in Africa, which may improve the process in the future.\u000a\u000aSouth African voters having their ID checked digitally at a polling station\u000a\u000aIn Namibia, a new system appears to have boosted voters' trust, Penar says.\u000a\u000a"Namibia has invested in an electronic voting system. Interestingly one of the best countries in terms of trust in their election commission is Namibia, at 74%."\u000a\u000aBut while new digital tools can make it harder to tamper with votes, they can also create problems as they require electricity and technical know-how at the polling stations, something not to be taken for granted in rural areas, Penar adds.\u000a\u000aAnd while election processes could be improved by storing and counting votes digitally, issues with corruption may remain.\u000a\u000a"The servers on which the results data is stored may be owned by a friend of the president or a relative of an election commission. That happens."

aVPiotr M.A. Cywi\u0144ski is Director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Memorial, President of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Barely seven decades ago, smoke billowed from the chimneys of the Auschwitz-Birkenau crematoria. They smoked incessantly because the German Nazis wanted to completely exterminate European Jews.\u000a\u000aThe Holocaust -- the Shoah -- did not come out of nowhere.\u000a\u000aThe Auschwitz concentration camp was established before the extermination camp came into being. Prior to that, Polish territories were occupied and incorporated into the Third Reich. Some time earlier still, the Second World War broke out across Europe . Before the war, Jews were deprived of fundamental rights and civil liberties in Germany. And before that, Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist German Workers' Party -- the Nazis -- won in democratic, free elections.\u000a\u000aWe have seen similar kinds of hatred pop up in numerous guises throughout history -- before and after the Holocaust. The model, however, is always more or less the same.\u000a\u000aFirst, social frustration provides fertile ground to demagogy and populism. Then, the absence of an early response blurs the boundary of acceptable public discourse and the hate speech intensifies -- followed by acts of hate. The imagined enemy -- the scapegoat -- is then dehumanized. Finally, it turns out to be too late. The machine of institutionalized hatred does away with any form of social control.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Huang Xuejing broke away from the kingdom he once called home six years ago. At just 130 centimeters -- a little over 4 feet -- Huang's height permitted him entry into the kingdom in 2009.\u000a\u000aHis physical growth was limited when he injured his spine in a fall at age 8. Having been warned that surgery to restart his growth could lead to paralysis, his family chose to not take the risk.\u000a\u000aAfter studying graphic design at a school for the disabled in China, Huang found his talents to be of use in the Kingdom of the Little People, a small theme park where about 100 people of short stature, including some with dwarfism, live and perform dances and songs for tourists each day.\u000a\u000aThe maximum height for workers there is 130 centimeters, meaning Huang just made the cut. He soon found himself working behind the scenes as a manager.\u000a\u000aBut life wasn't quite what he had been promised.\u000a\u000aExploring the kingdom\u000a\u000aAn hour's drive east of the city of Kunming in southwest China, the park has been branded a disgrace by some overseas, stoking debate about the treatment of people with disabilities in China.\u000a\u000aThe US-based dwarfism support group Little People of America highlight that opinions vary about whether dwarfism/short stature is actually a disability and believe the kingdom was comparable to a zoo.\u000a\u000aThe kingdom is billed as a tourist attraction, by its owner, real estate mogul Chen Mingjing. Now, seven years after opening its doors, the kingdom remains open, but few tourists seem to be buying into the fairy tale. Just 15 customers, mainly families with young children, could be counted on one recent day, most of them Chinese.\u000a\u000aAfter paying the 100 yuan ($15) entry fee, customers sit in front of the main stage to watch the morning performances. On this day, 30 performers in pink and red coats dance while a "king" character, complete with a cloak and crown, swans around regally. Shortly afterward, an all-female dance team performed a Bollywood-style routine.\u000a\u000aThe tone is cute and quirky, with a karaoke feel to the songs sung between dance routines. Another regular performance involves male dancers dressed in female ballerina outfits and pirouetting to "Swan Lake" music.\u000a\u000aIt's like any other show performed in jest, but with a much shorter cast.\u000a\u000aLife in -- and out of -- the kingdom\u000a\u000aHuang joined the work force in the theme park after having been enticed by its owner, Chen, who was impressed by Huang's abilities and sold him his dream for the kingdom, Huang said.\u000a\u000a"He was very keen and sincere," Huang said in his small but impeccably tidy studio apartment in central Kunming. "He explained that he wanted to make the kingdom the biggest in the world."\u000a\u000aHuang Xuejing, in the red jacket, used to work in the kingdom as a manager but left six years ago to work as a freelance performer in Kunming.\u000a\u000aChen explained to Huang that managing a team of people with height impediments would be best by someone who understands their perspective.\u000a\u000a"That was why he wanted me," said Huang, who in turn felt that a job helping people like himself might be more meaningful.h\u000a\u000aThe kingdom provides accommodation for staffers, who live in a cluster of dormitory blocks a short walk from the performance area. Many workers move there straight after leaving school, as managers regularly advertise jobs in schools for disabled people in Kunming and find them as students, like Huang.\u000a\u000aThe workers sleep on bunk beds in shared rooms cluttered with clothes, stuffed animals and phone chargers. A strong constitution is required to visit the separate toilet building, and the roof of one of the blocks serves as a dining area where the staffers prepare and eat communal meals. It's rustic but liveable.f\u000a\u000aBut after 3½ years, Huang chose to set out and work as a freelance performer in Kunming. He wanted to earn more and found life in the kingdom too isolated, despite regular travel to Kunming, his hometown.\u000a\u000a"I prefer more lively places; it was too far traveling between the kingdom and city," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang said he largely enjoyed the experience, despite initially being concerned that the shows his colleagues performed were demeaning. "Gradually, I began to feel that it's not a bad thing for (short people) to have a place to work, a career to look forward to and an environment to stay together."\u000a\u000aHe felt comfortable knowing that everyone else was the same. "They were all together; they didn't have pressure (of interacting in mainstream society)," he said.\u000a\u000aBut he wanted more.\u000a\u000aThese days, "I host, sing rock music in bars and attend launch ceremonies and weddings," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang earns 5,000 to 20,000 yuan ($740 to $3,000) a month. He didn't want to reveal how much he earned inside the kingdom but said his current salary was "a lot more."\u000a\u000aEarning a (good) living\u000a\u000a"People like us have to save for the future," said Yang Qianjun, a former colleague of Huang's at the Kingdom of the Little People who also ventured out in search of more lucrative employment.\u000a\u000aYang, 30, is 125 centimeters (about 4 feet) tall and worked in the kingdom as a performer until he left four years ago.\u000a\u000aHe says he was initially paid 800 yuan ($120) a month at the kingdom, later rising to 1,200 yuan ($180) with deductions for food. "It wasn't enough," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen asked whether the wages and location made the kingdom hard to leave, Yang was quick to reply: "Yes. Indeed." He then explained that most of his colleagues still inside were struggling. "Money would be spent the day it was given to us, on daily essentials. We couldn't save anything."\u000a\u000aYang Qianjun used to work as a performer in the kingdom but left to become a restaurant host in the city of Kunming.\u000a\u000aCharismatic and talkative, Yang now works as a host in Kunming at a Cultural Revolution-themed eatery plastered with Mao Zedong imagery and staffed by waiters in soldier uniforms.\u000a\u000aHe earns about 3,000 yuan ($440) a month and says he rarely is discriminated against for his height -- something he had feared while in the safety net of the park. "People around here are really nice," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang also said he seldom faces discrimination in public life, and on the rare occasions he does, he simply brushes it off. "Sometimes people watch me, but never adults, only kids," he said, adding that the attention never gets more serious than children whispering about him.\u000a\u000aHiding away in the kingdom\u000a\u000aBut in China, especially in rural areas, attitudes about disabled people bringing "shame" to families can often persist.\u000a\u000aSome workers still living and performing in the kingdom said they'd had more negative experiences in public.\u000a\u000a"In the outside world, people look at me differently, like I'm some kind of monster," said singer Li Jia, who has worked in the park for six years and has no plans to leave.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes, when I walked alone on streets, it made me uncomfortable and embarrassed when people stare at me," he said while refueling with a bowl of noodles before his next performance.\u000a\u000aNeither he nor his colleagues was eager to discuss in detail the discrimination they had been subject to, but they revealed glimpses.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I got pointed and laughed at by kids. I didn't like it," said Lin Zheng Xio, 24, another performer who specializes in singing. He says the struggle for people considered disabled, such as himself, to get work is all too real.\u000a\u000aLi Juan, a dancer who is also 24, added, "People would say, 'Why are you so short?' and would call me dwarf."\u000a\u000aLi Jia explained that he saw the kingdom as a safe haven. "I chose to come here because everyone here is the same. I feel like it's a big family," he said. He believes there is a future for him in the park.\u000a\u000a"Some people find love here and get married. We have two married couples, each with two children, plus four or five couples. I met my girlfriend here," he said.\u000a\u000aIn 2006, the China Disabled Persons' Federation estimated the number of people with disabilities in the country to be 83 million, a number including anyone who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and who has lost -- wholly or in part -- the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal, according to the International Labor Organization.\u000a\u000aAn opportunity for some?\u000a\u000aChinese legislation requires that all public and private employers reserve at least 1.5% of their job opportunities for people with disabilities. However, according to Cindy Zhang, an employment lawyer with Shanghai's Conshine Law Firm, companies often choose to pay fines for not hitting the target instead.\u000a\u000aIt is often difficult to get cases regarding disability discrimination in the workplace to court, she said, and even if cases are successful, compensation payouts are low. Zhang said many lawyers in China advise against pursuing them at all.\u000a\u000a"A lot of factories don't want us because we're not able to finish assignments that 'normal' people can finish," Li Jia said, adding that the park is a draw for those without many qualifications.

"Working there was fine."\u000a\u000aThough content with her current life in the kingdom, Li Juan hopes to one day emulate Huang and leave, as she dreams of working in a shadow puppet theater.

aVTwo-hour special premieres Sunday, August 27 at 9pm ET/PT on CNN and CNN International\u000a\u000aLove, loss, fairytale and tragedy. Princess Diana lived a life in the public eye, with every move photographed and scrutinized. But two decades after the tragic car crash that took her life, there are still compelling questions about how she lived and how she died.\u000a\u000aCNN explores the majesty, misery and mystery of Diana\u2019s life and shocking death in a new two-hour special, Diana: Chasing a Fairytale. Reported by CNN's award-winning senior international correspondent Clarissa Ward, Diana: Chasing a Fairytale will air Sunday, August 27 at 9pm ET/PT on CNN and CNN International, and Thursday, August 31 at 9pm ET on HLN.\u000a\u000aFrom London to the French Riviera and Paris to the U.S., Ward explores little known moments on Diana\u2019s lonely journey to the palace and reveals intimate details about the last days of the life of a woman whose vibrant legacy lives on.\u000a\u000aDiana: Chasing a Fairytale features revealing interviews with many of Diana\u2019s closest friends and people around her that fateful night in Paris \u2013 some who have never spoken before \u2013 including Xavier Gourmelon, fireman and first responder to Diana\u2019s car crash; Sir Scott Baker, coroner who led the British inquest into Diana and Dodi Al Fayed\u2019s deaths; Patrick Jephson, Diana\u2019s former personal secretary; Dr. James Colthurst, childhood friend of Diana\u2019s; Paul Burrell, Diana\u2019s former butler and close confidant; Roberto Devorik, fashion designer and close friend of Diana\u2019s; Pierre Suu, photographer who was outside the Ritz hotel and took some of the last pictures of Diana and Dodi before they died; Ken Wharfe, Diana\u2019s longtime bodyguard; Lord John Stevens, former Metropolitan Police Commissioner who led Scotland Yard\u2019s three-year investigation into how Diana and Dodi died; and many more.\u000a\u000aTwenty years on from her death, what more do we know about the crash that also killed her companion, Dodi Al Fayed, and Henri Paul, acting head of security at the Ritz who was driving when the car crashed? Investigations in both France and Britain concluded it was an accident caused by high speeds and an intoxicated driver, yet conspiracy theories continued to surface for years.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe truth is that the Paris paparazzi didn\u2019t kill Diana. Incompetent travel arrangements killed Diana. And the paparazzi only became an actual nuisance or a threat to Diana after she had chosen to get rid of her bodyguards,\u201d said Jephson. \u201cIf Charles Spencer or anybody else wanted to see the cause of Diana\u2019s unhappiness or ultimately the circumstances in which she died, they should look at the royal organization which had taken responsibility for her at a very, very young age.\u201d\u000a\u000aDiana: Chasing a Fairytale will replay on CNN International on Thursday, August 31 at 8am and 2pm ET, and on both CNN and CNN International on Friday, September 1 at 9pm ET.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the TV airings, Diana: Chasing a Fairytale will also stream live for subscribers on Sunday, August 27 via CNNgo (at CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android.

aV(CNN) Horse racing and K-pop might not be traditional bedfellows but, then again, you don't often see an equine theme park in the center of a racecourse.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea is doing things differently and, one hundred years on from its first authorized thoroughbred race, the nation hopes to become a major player in the sport.\u000a\u000aA two-way process of "internationalization" is underway, with leading foreign jockeys and trainers employed domestically and Korean runners beginning to attend major race meetings overseas.\u000a\u000aWhat started with small, unstandardized pony races has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.\u000a\u000aThe grand plan\u000a\u000a"Right now thoroughbred racing is very popular," says Yang Tae Park, executive director of the Korea Racing Authority\u000a\u000a"If our process of internationalization succeeds, we can change the perception of horse racing from not just a means of gambling, but a sport."\u000a\u000aWith a new quarantine protocol, the Korea Racing Authority (KRA) plans to stage some of the biggest events on the horse racing calendar within five years.\u000a\u000aA long-term plan has been put in place to ensure the incremental development of both the Korea Cup and Korea Sprint, from International Grade Three races to Grade One.\u000a\u000aThe Korea Sprint and Cup are currently worth KRW 1 billion ($890k) and KRW 0.7 billion ($623K) respectively.\u000a\u000aBy April 2022, to mark the centenary of South Korean thoroughbred racing, their value is set to increase threefold to KRW 3 billion ($2.7m) and KRW 2 billion ($1.8m).\u000a\u000a'Well ahead of football'\u000a\u000aAs a former insurance worker who fell in love with Korean horse racing, started a website , became a race caller, and eventually a member of the Korea Racing Authority, Englishman Alastair Middleton brings a unique perspective.\u000a\u000a"In terms of attendance, horse racing is right up there with baseball and well ahead of the domestic football league," he says.\u000a\u000a"Internationalization is so important but also so challenging, because it is really difficult to measure progress or success.\u000a\u000a"It's more qualitative than quantitative but in the time I've been following Korean racing, I've seen significant development and yes, I would say the foreign influence has played a major part."\u000a\u000a'The world's top horses'\u000a\u000aThe KRA visited the United States for the Pan America Racing Conference this May.\u000a\u000aNo US-trained horse has ever raced in South Korea, but officials are confident such a breakthrough is imminent \u2014 approaching several trainers with a view to entering September's Korean Cup.\u000a\u000a"We are inviting high-quality horses from overseas so Korean-bred horses can compete with foreign horses," says Tae Park, contending the move will raise standards.\u000a\u000aThe infrastructure and interest are certainly there.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's three main venues \u2014 situated in the Seoul suburb of Gwacheon, Busan and Jeju \u2014 have seen total annual attendances exceed 15 million in recent years.\u000a\u000aTwo decades on from hosting equestrian events at the 1988 Olympics, LetsRun Park Seoul features towering grandstands, called Happy Ville and Lucky Ville, capable of accommodating 77,000 people.\u000a\u000aAccording to Tae Park, the domestic industry already boasts an annual turnover 6.4 billion dollars \u2014 the seventh largest in the world -- and it's only going to get bigger.\u000a\u000a"Right now, the racing surface is sand and that is off-putting to many of the world's top horses," says Middleton. "However, a turf track will soon be installed at Seoul Racecourse."\u000a\u000aA two-way process\u000a\u000aBut the KRA's plans aren't limited to luring the world's best racehorses to East Asia.\u000a\u000aReaping the rewards of internationalization, Korean-bred horses are increasingly racing in foreign lands and proving they can cut it at a high level.\u000a\u000aFive South Korean runners competed in this year's Dubai World Cup Carnival, three are set to line up at Singapore's Kranji Racecourse in July and two to three more are scheduled to run in Japan's Interaction Cup.\u000a\u000aThis year saw the first major international win by a horse born and trained in South Korea, as Main Stay romped to victory in January's Dubai World Cup Carnival 1200m dirt handicap.\u000a\u000aThe four-year-old bay gelding, trained by YK Kim, beat far more established competitors to earn the winning connections over $100,000.\u000a\u000a"Main Stay winning in Dubai gave us confidence to develop the racing quality," says Tae Park.\u000a\u000a"Main Stay made horse racing more attractive in Korea. Many media outlets carried news of his victory."\u000a\u000aTriple Nine, another South Korean runner, was second behind Hunting Ground in the 2000-meter handicap earlier in the night.\u000a\u000aThis, Tae Park contends, is just a sign of things to come.\u000a\u000aBy the year 2019, the KRA claims it will send its horses to all-weather track races in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aBy 2022, Tae Park foresees Korean runners competing in the best EU turf races and best dirt track races in the States.\u000a\u000aMiddleton admits Korea is starting from "a long way behind the leading countries" but says significant progress is already being made and compares the influence of international runners to that of stars in baseball and football.\u000a\u000a"Korean sports fans love seeing the likes of [LA Dodgers pitcher] Ryu Hyun-jin and [Tottenham Hotspur footballer] Son Heung-min performing well in overseas leagues," says Middleton. "Hopefully they will start to follow Korean horses too."\u000a\u000aWhinny World\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, the KRA is striving to reach new demographics in South Korea.\u000a\u000aIf race days have traditionally enticed an older, male audience -- with many regarding the sport as a medium for betting -- the KRA is "endeavoring to attract young people and ladies."\u000a\u000aTo that end, a horse theme park, situated in the center of the Seoul Racecourse, opened its doors in September 2016 -- playing host to a number of K-pop acts, including girl group I.O.I.\u000a\u000aThe attraction, named Whinny World, claims to offer guests an "interactive and inspirational experience," educating young families about Korea's horse racing tradition.\u000a\u000aWith pony riding, racing simulation machines and ice rinks in winter, there's hope it can persuade people who wouldn't ordinarily consider visiting the racecourse to attend.\u000a\u000a"Right now horse racing has a bad perception among some Korean people," says Tae park. "We are trying to change that perception."\u000a\u000aLetsRun Park Seoul's Whinny World: where you can meet different breeds of ponies!! \U0001f434\U0001f984 Cuteness overload\u2763 pic.twitter.com/2B1ATioEDu \u2014 JO Kim (@krbc_jo) September 29, 2016\u000a\u000aWhile the horses run, the young families are turning out in force.\u000a\u000aDon't bet against seeing a South Korean horse on a racetrack near you soon.

aVStory highlights Orlando mass killing fits grim pattern of homegrown terrorism, writes Peter Bergen\u000a\u000aSince 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes\u000a\u000aPeter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book "United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists."\u000a\u000a(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.\u000a\u000aBecause 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.\u000a\u000aBut Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aIn fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.\u000a\u000aIn other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVStory highlights Lev Golinkin: Ivanka Trumps' two tweets about the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville were like saying nothing at all\u000a\u000aAmong other things, Jared Kushner's family history of Holocaust survival should have prompted a stronger reaction, Golinkin writes\u000a\u000aLev Golinkin came to the US as a child refugee from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov (now called Kharkiv) in 1990. He is the author of the memoir "A Backpack, a Bear, and Eight Crates of Vodka." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I first heard the silence late Tuesday night, while pecking at my phone, waiting for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump to denounce President Donald Trump's latest comments on neo-Nazis after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the death and mayhem that resulted.\u000a\u000aAfter the President tried to compare neo-Nazis to what he described as the "alt-left," saying "I think there is blame on both sides," there was still no outcry from Jared or Ivanka.\u000a\u000aSlowly, as the hours ticked away, the silence descended.\u000a\u000aLev Golinkin\u000a\u000aMany think of silence as the absence of noise, but that's only one type of silence. There is a different, darker variety, one Jews and African-Americans have gotten to know well over the centuries. This silence doesn't suppress sound -- it amplifies it. It is the boom of the MS St. Louis departing for Nazi-threatened Europe after being denied entry by port after port. It's the whisk-whisk of Southern belles fanning themselves at the slave auction. It's the presence of apathy amid injustice and horror.\u000a\u000aI'd heard this kind of silence, long ago. I heard it in the Soviet Union, in the footfalls of teachers and classmates calmly walking around me and the other Jew in my class as we received our daily beatings. I'd heard it in the Doppler effect of cars passing my family and other refugees when we were hitchhiking along frigid Austrian roads.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVCNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour interviews Cardinal Timothy Dolan at North American College of Cardinals in Rome, on the last day for Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Dolan talks about the time he spent with Pope Benedict XVI and how he may vote during the conclave as a \u201crookie.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a particularly radiant and personal way, the pope is supposed to remind us of Jesus,\u201d Cardinal Dolan said. \u201cWe call him the vicar of Christ. So when we see him, we\u2019re immediately elevated to the things beyond, the eternal truth and to the man who described himself as the truth \u2013 Jesus Christ\u2026. That\u2019s sort of thewhat you might call the supernatural characteristics that you look for. St. Thomas says grace builds on nature. What are the natural characteristics that we\u2019re looking for? Well, you need a good pastor, somebody\u2019s who\u2019s good with people like Jesus was. You need somebody who is thoroughly versed in the tradition and the profound theology of our Catholic wisdom. Number three, you need somebody savvy about the church universal, who kind of is aware and conscious of the diverse needs of the Catholic family. Number four you need somebody who can get by in at least English and Italian and preferably some other languages, too.\u201d He adds that he\u2019s looking for someone with governing capacity.

aVCopenhagen is a bustling city full of ambitious professionals and young families. Yet working long hours here is frowned upon.\u000a\u000aJust 2% of employees in Copenhagen work 40 hours a week or more, according to an OECD report, freeing them up to spend time with family, join organized sports, volunteer or participate in other community programs.\u000a\u000aThe cost to participate in those programs, which range from laughter yoga in the park to basket weaving? Free. This helps encourage residents to get involved.\u000a\u000aTheir ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down, it gives them a happiness boost. Studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed. That\u2019s one reason Denmark takes the top spot as the happiest nation in the annual World Happiness Report commissioned by the United Nations.\u000a\u000aOther things play into Copenhagen's relaxed atmosphere. Residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries. There are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city.\u000a\u000aMen cycle to work in their slim-fit suits, and women don\u2019t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels. The city has 249 miles of bike paths, which makes biking an easy and safe option. And people use them: Nearly half of commuters in Copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day.\u000a\u000aThough parks and bike paths are plentiful, the government is upping its efforts. By 2015, all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than 15 minutes, according to a new official municipal policy. Many of the new parks created will be \u201cpocket parks,\u201d or small green spaces for city residents. The hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for Denmark: Ninety-six percent of residents in Copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need.\u000a\u000aThis supportive society is just another reason Copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest (and happiest) cities.

aVStory highlights Tom Udall: In many schools, school officials are allowed to shame students whose parents haven't paid their lunch bill\u000a\u000aThe Anti-Lunch Shaming Act, which was introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives earlier this year, would put an end to the practice, he writes\u000a\u000aTom Udall is the senior US senator from New Mexico.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It's a practice so cruel, you probably never imagined it would happen. Yet in nearly half of all US school districts, school officials are allowed to punish students -- even withhold lunch -- because a parent or guardian has fallen behind on paying their child's school meal bill. The practice, known as "lunch shaming," publicly singles out these kids by forcing them to wear wristbands, assigning them chores, and even making a display of taking away a meal from them after it has been served.\u000a\u000aAs kids across the country head back to school this month, we should ensure they are focused on the new friends, classes, and challenges that come with a new school year -- but one of those challenges should not be dealing with humiliation at lunchtime. And that's why I'm taking steps to stop lunch shaming across the country.\u000a\u000aTom Udall\u000a\u000aInstead of serving a practical purpose, lunch shaming is detrimental to students' wellbeing; it singles out students whose parents are unable to pay, stigmatizing the most vulnerable kids. Extra school chores take students away from schoolwork and classmates. And, worst of all, the practice can stand in the way of a child's only healthy meal of the day.\u000a\u000aWe can't expect our kids to succeed in the classroom under those circumstances -- not when they're hungry and face public embarrassment at the hands of school officials.\u000a\u000aI am proud that my home state of New Mexico became the first in the country to outlaw this practice. New Mexico's Hunger-Free Students' Bill of Rights was drafted by a bipartisan coalition of state lawmakers and champions for our kids, including one state senator who was a victim of lunch shaming himself; while growing up in foster care, he often was forced to work for his school meal.\u000a\u000aRead More

I mean, that's been proven that you can't change the world in a day. But we - we cannot be intimidated. We cannot be pushed aside. We cannot be told that this fight has been fought before, and that we're just one more grieving family trying to do something. I - I\u2019ve looked in the camera on other interviews and I\u2019ve said, if you were a parent, if you're a mother, if you have children, can you look your child in the eye and say, we are willing to allow you to be collateral damage in order to keep what some people perceive as their constitutional rights? If we as a society are willing to accept that, what kind of society are we?\u201d\u000a\u000aAndy Parker: "Alison would be really mad at me if I didn't take this on, and I promise you - and I\u2019ve said this time and again - these people are messing with the wrong family. We are going to effect a change, and it's going to happen. And we need people like Senator Murphy and Governor McAuliffe who are courageous enough to stand with us. And we will effect a change."\u000a\u000aBarbara Parker on those that say "If Sandy Hook couldn't deliver a change, nothing will\u201d: "You think that how could that many children be killed and nothing happen, for it to be ignored? But what we have to do, there are people out there whose minds we will never change. They are the people that are unimportant in this fight.

I\u2019m not sure arming is the right answer here mainly because of we\u2019re just not exactly sure who the bad guys are, who the good guys are right now in Syria. So you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re giving weapons to.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe continues, \u201cWell, you know, a big part of it is, [Syria is] Russia's last toehold in the Middle East and I think there is attachment to the notion that\u2026 [Assad\u2019s] going to win and they're going to have the toehold in the Middle East through Syria. We need to change that dynamic. I think we need to convince our Russians this is not in their best interests, that some of this slaughtering of women and children is going to get on them as well, and that's just not the place they want to be in the world. And they need, again a little public pressure, a little bilateral effort from the United States and others, other European allies, I think can turn Russia on what's happening. I don't think they want to be on the wrong side of a slaughter in a town like Houla. We need to put the question to them, where do you want to be when this is over? We'd like you to be with the rest of the world. They also have huge weapon sales going into Syria, another big problem we have to deal with.\u201d\u000a\u000aStarting Point with Soledad O\u2019Brien airs weekday mornings from 7-9am ET on CNN.

aVThe CNN Freedom Project wants to amplify the voices of the victims of modern-day slavery, highlight success stories and help unravel the tangle of criminal enterprises trading in human life.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When Kieu was 12, her mother asked her to take a job. But not just any job. Kieu was first examined by a doctor, who issued her a "certificate of virginity." She was then delivered to a hotel, where a man raped her for two days.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the Freedom Project went to Cambodia with Oscar-winning actress and UNODC Goodwill Ambassador against Human Trafficking, Mira Sorvino . The result was "Every Day in Cambodia: A CNN Freedom Project Documentary," which looked at child sex trafficking in the country.\u000a\u000aIn Svay Pak, a notorious child sex trafficking hub in Phnom Penh, Sorvino met Kieu, who was then around 14 years old. She had been rescued from sex trafficking by Agape International Missions (AIM), a non-profit for trafficked and at risk children and teenagers.\u000a\u000aKieu told of how she had been sold aged 12 by her mother to a Khmer man of "maybe more than 50" who had three children of his own, Sorvino explained in her Cambodia journal : "The price set in advance for her virginity: $1,500, though she was ultimately only given $1,000, of which she had to give $400 to the woman who brought her to the man. Her mother used the money to pay down a debt and for food for the fish they raise under their floating house -- their primary income source.\u000a\u000a"Beforehand, Kieu said, 'I did not know what the job was and whether it was good for me. I had no idea what to expect. But now I know the job was not good for me.' After she lost her virginity to the man, she felt 'very heartbroken.' Her mother supposedly felt bad too, but still sent her to work in a brothel. Kieu said she did not want to go, but had to. She said, 'They held me like I was in prison.'"\u000a\u000aShe was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border. When she learned her mother was planning to sell her again, this time for a six-month stretch, she realized she needed to flee her home.\u000a\u000aHer story is all too common in Svay Pak; she was just one of the girls whose stories were told in the film. Fast forward to 2015 and "Everyday in Cambodia" was named "outstanding documentary" by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation , winning a Gracie Allen award.\u000a\u000aSorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue of child sex trafficking in Svay Pak and Cambodia, helping to raise funds for AIM to build a school that, when completed, will offer hope for more than 1,000 children in the region.\u000a\u000a"Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking," she says. "It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited."\u000a\u000aAIM also now works with an "incorruptible" police SWAT team to raid brothels where children are working.\u000a\u000aBut Sorvino adds that it's not just about helping the victims. "The demand side really needs to be addressed," she says. "If people weren't trying to buy child sex it wouldn't be being sold."

aVIvo Daalder is the former US permanent representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and is president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Dina Smeltz is a senior fellow for public opinion and foreign policy at the council. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Without cameras or fanfare earlier this month, President Donald Trump quietly signed the major Russia sanctions legislation that Congress passed by overwhelming margins in July. Clearly, Trump wasn't happy to have Congress force his hand on Russia \u2014 and not just because all presidents seek to preserve flexibility in their approach to foreign policy, which this legislation explicitly curtails.\u000a\u000aAs candidate and President, Trump has made clear that he seeks better relations with Russia, and these additional sanctions make that ever more unlikely.\u000a\u000aOther administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, share the President's opposition to the legislation. "Neither the President nor I are very happy about that," Tillerson said of the sanctions bill. In fact, the secretary of state rushed off to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov just days after the bill was signed. Tillerson wanted, as he described , "to find ways that we can bring this relationship back closer towards one another."\u000a\u000aIndeed, in an effort to cast the legislation in a more positive light, Tillerson and Trump both maintain that the sanctions "represent the strong will of the American people to see Russia take steps to improve relations with the United States."\u000a\u000aBut a new survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs shows that the American people are not interested in improving relations with Russia. A majority of Americans (53%) say the United States should actively work to limit Russia's power, rather than have Washington undertake friendly engagement with the Kremlin (43%). This is a reversal from last year, when just 39% favored limiting Russian power and 56% said cooperation was the better course.\u000a\u000aConciliation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country has been the single most consistent issue in a campaign and an administration that have prized disruption, inconsistency, and misdirection in almost every other respect. Yet few, if any, of the findings in the Chicago Council poll suggest the American people are keen on attempting another reset with Russia.\u000a\u000a-- Nine-in-10 Americans think Russia is a threat, with 42% calling it a "critical threat," up from 23% when last asked in 2002. More Americans now consider Russia a "critical threat" than at any time since 1990.\u000a\u000a-- Three-quarters (74%) of respondents believe that Russia is working to undermine US power and influence.\u000a\u000a-- Just 28% of Americans trust Moscow to deal responsibly with world problems.\u000a\u000a-- And on sanctions, a clear majority of Americans favor either maintaining (41%) or increasing (38%) them against Russia.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Kellyanne Conway's full interview on CNN Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kellyanne Conway's full interview on CNN 30:06\u000a\u000aAmerican antagonism against Russia also can be found in renewed, strong support for NATO \u2014 the most visible and strongest alliance opposing Russia in Europe. Seven in 10 Americans (69%) view the Atlantic Alliance, which Trump called "obsolete" not so long ago, as "essential."\u000a\u000aAlso, for the first time since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and invaded Ukraine, a majority of Americans (52%) support sending US troops to defend Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia if Russia attacked any of these NATO allies. This clear vote of confidence in the 29-member security organization clashes with the President's characterization that Americans are "getting ripped off by every country in NATO."\u000a\u000aIn fact, a majority of Americans say that US security alliances in Europe benefit both the United States and our allies (53%) or mostly benefit the United States (8%); only 20% think these alliances mostly benefit our allies. And even on the issue of funding NATO, the White House seems out of step with the public. A full 59% of Americans say the United States should encourage greater allied defense spending through persuasion and diplomatic means.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump scolds NATO members for low payments Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump scolds NATO members for low payments 01:30\u000a\u000aLess than four in 10 (38%) respondents said the United States should instead withhold its commitment to defend NATO members until they have paid, a strategy Secretary of Defense James Mattis hinted at earlier this year, and has been implied by Trump's reluctant and tepid endorsement of the collective defense agreement, Article 5.\u000a\u000aThe core argument of Donald Trump's campaign and presidency is that he is a more direct conduit for the will of the American people, unmediated by the presumed biases of news organizations, political parties, or government institutions. Yet on Russia and NATO at least, President Trump is at odds with the will of the American people.\u000a\u000aIt is reassuring, then, that the sanctions passed with a veto-proof majority by Congress, demonstrating that the institutions of government will enact that will even when the President would prefer not to.

aV(CNN) When photographer Richard Ross wants to talk to a child at a juvenile detention center, he knocks on their cell door. He asks them if he can come inside.\u000a\u000aThe 67-year-old Californian is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes, so he does the same in a cell.\u000a\u000a"Most of the kids, they've never had that kind of respect," he said. "But I give it to them, I give them the power. I sit on the floor so they're looking down on me."\u000a\u000aRoss doesn't begin by hammering them with questions. He wants to have a conversation.\u000a\u000a"I say, 'What's gone on in your life?' "\u000a\u000aThe result of that tenderness and patience is Ross' latest collection of photos, "Girls in Justice."\u000a\u000aThe images are unflinching. They convey the ugliness of a young person's life behind bars. The pictures are replete with the unique loneliness, anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center. But the girls also tell their stories alongside the images.\u000a\u000aPhotographer Richard Ross\u000a\u000aOne photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit, hand on her head, sitting alone in a drab, cavernous room.\u000a\u000a"I've been here 17 times," one girl says.\u000a\u000aMany of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them.\u000a\u000a"Mom's a stripper. Dad was an alcoholic, drug addict, murdered last year," said one girl explaining her past. "They took my brother and I away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down. I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do."\u000a\u000aThe photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks, staring at the wall. Some struggle with mental illness. The girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera. That works to protect their identities, but it also evokes shame. Ross seems to be saying the shame isn't the girls' -- it's ours as a society for jailing children.\u000a\u000aHis images aren't always literal. A photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire. A straight-forward photo, of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors, turns the stomach after reading the caption -- the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aRoss recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him, "I can't wait to get out of here so I can kill myself."\u000a\u000a"She was just a kid, but she was at that place where you have no hope," he said. "I feel all these stories, but that one just hit me hard. I was sobbing. You want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that."\u000a\u000aRoss, the son of a New York City police officer, had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means. He got into a decent amount of trouble growing up, and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system.\u000a\u000aBut times were different then, he said, and there's been a cultural turn in America toward criminalizing a child's bad behavior.\u000a\u000aHe recalls a detention-center director in Reno, Nevada, who asked him to visit and take photos. At intake, he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class.\u000a\u000aYou want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that. Richard Ross\u000a\u000a"This fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle," Ross recalled. "He was drinking warm milk, like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk. I can still smell that milk. That intake area smelled like elementary school."\u000a\u000aThe child's single mother couldn't pick him up for hours. She was holding down a job that wouldn't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m.\u000a\u000aThe detention-center director sent Ross' photo to every principal in the area to make a point: Children do not belong in lockup, so find another solution.\u000a\u000aRoss is adamant that he's making photographs to bring about "immediate change."\u000a\u000aHe speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates. His work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing.\u000a\u000a"I'm trying to wake people up, make them realize there are lives at stake," he said. "At the same time, I don't, I can't, position myself as the great hope. I might not be able to do much but listen. But I think I'm a good listener, and I think these kids deserve to tell their stories."

aVWashington (CNN) As Hurricane Harvey swirls through the Gulf of Mexico, speeding toward the Texas coast, it could also bring a critical test of President Donald Trump's abilities as commander-in-chief.\u000a\u000aIn an instant, natural disasters can become defining moments for a presidency, and Hurricane Harvey -- which is set to be the first Category 3 hurricane to hit the US in 12 years -- could be the first such moment for Trump, testing his administration's ability to handle a major natural disaster.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration has been preparing for months for what is forecast to be an especially active hurricane season, but Harvey is also gusting toward the US amid questions about vacancies in key administration posts -- including the helm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\u000a\u000aThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the US Coast Guard, also is without a permanent leader after Trump's decision to pluck retired Gen. John Kelly from his post atop DHS to become his White House chief of staff. Kelly's deputy, Elaine Duke, has since taken the helm as acting secretary.\u000a\u000aThe White House on Thursday expressed confidence in Duke's abilities to manage the response and noted that Kelly will also be at Trump's side as Harvey makes landfall.\u000a\u000a"There's certabinly someone at the helm," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, pointing to Duke. "And again, I think that we are in great shape having General Kelly sitting next to the President throughout this process, and probably no better chief of staff for the president during the hurricane season."\u000a\u000a"The President has been briefed and will continue to be updated as the storm progresses, and certainly something he's very aware of and will keep a very watchful eye on, and stands ready to provide resources if needed," Sanders said.\u000a\u000aDHS press secretary David Lapan pointed out Friday on Twitter that Duke is a "DHS veteran w/ extensive experience in previous assignments," and said FEMA administrator Brock Long is "leading experienced career staff" at FEMA.\u000a\u000aDuke is not the only interim official leading a critical component of the federal government's natural disaster response and monitoring efforts.\u000a\u000aTrump's pick for FEMA administrator was confirmed in June, but officials at NOAA are still waiting for Trump to nominate someone to lead the key weather monitoring agency. The post remains vacant -- and without a Trump nominee -- alongside dozens of other deputy, under and assistant secretary positions in the Trump administration that require Senate confirmation.\u000a\u000aAnd while Trump nominated two deputy directors for FEMA, they have yet to be confirmed into their positions.\u000a\u000aUnrelated to those nomination woes, the National Hurricane Center is still fielding applications for a permanent director after its chief resigned in May.\u000a\u000a"The people acting in an acting capacity are 110% capable," said Dennis Feltgen, the National Hurricane Center's public affairs officer.\u000a\u000aBut Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who helped organize relief efforts to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as commander of Joint Task Force Katrina, said he was concerned about NOAA having a temporary leader as the hurricane season ramps up.\u000a\u000a"It is a concern," Honoré said. "We don't allow temporary coaches in the SEC, so why the hell are we running a federal agency with a temporary leader? It doesn't create a team."\u000a\u000aHonoré expressed confidence in the career staffers who have taken over key posts in the interim, but said the Trump administration should not have entered hurricane season without a permanent director at the helm of NOAA.\u000a\u000a"A temporary person doesn't have the gravitas," Honoré said.\u000a\u000aA NOAA spokesman said Friday that the agency is "fully prepared for the hurricane season" and is launching new and improved services , such as issuing storm surge watches and warnings along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.\u000a\u000a"Under our acting administrator, NOAA continues to provide the American public with science and services important for public safety, the nation's natural resources, and the economy," NOAA's deputy communications director, Scott Smullen, said in a statement. "The National Hurricane Center has an experienced leader in Dr. Ed Rappaport, who has been acting director before in his 30 years at the center."\u000a\u000aTrump and his White House are closely monitoring the storm.\u000a\u000aTrump tweeted Friday morning that he is "closely monitoring #HurricaneHarvey developments & here to assist as needed."\u000a\u000aHe tweeted in the afternoon that he had been briefed by Long, his new FEMA administrator, as well as Duke and his homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert. Bossert previously worked in FEMA's office of legislative affairs and oversaw emergency preparedness at the White House under President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aI have spoken w/ @GovAbbott of Texas and @LouisianaGov Edwards. Closely monitoring #HurricaneHarvey developments & here to assist as needed. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aReceived a #HurricaneHarvey briefing this morning from Acting @DHSgov Secretary Elaine Duke, @FEMA_Brock, @TomBossert45 and COS John Kelly. pic.twitter.com/cnkRZd6D6Z \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aBossert has been in close touch with the heads of the DHS, FEMA and other key federal agencies, a White House official said.\u000a\u000aBossert said Friday that Trump had three primary concerns during his Friday morning briefing. The President wanted to be sure that people were evacuating and "getting out of harm's way," that emergency management officials had the "appropriate resources," and that people in Louisiana, as well as Texas, be prepared in case the storm's path changes, Bossert said.\u000a\u000aTrump was reassured that resources to handle the storm were pre-deployed, Bossert said.\u000a\u000aTrump also headed to FEMA earlier this month to get briefed on the government's preparations for this year's hurricane season. Trump posted a video of his visit to FEMA on Twitter Thursday, as he called on the public to "#PlanAhead."\u000a\u000aLong has been widely praised as a professional and highly capable pick to lead the disaster relief agency through a hurricane season that forecasters have warned will be more aggressive than usual.\u000a\u000aNow, as Harvey approaches the US, Long told Bloomberg News on Monday that he is bracing for the impact.\u000a\u000a"We've gone 11 years without a major hurricane land-falling in the US -- that's a one-in-2,000 chance," Long said in the interview . "We're gonna get hit by a major hurricane. I worry that a lot of people have forgotten what that's like."\u000a\u000aThe last Category 3 storm to hit the US was Hurricane Wilma in October 2005, according to the National Hurricane Center. But it was another hurricane months earlier that has remained seared in the minds of government officials involved in natural disaster preparedness.\u000a\u000aHurricane Katrina, which hit the New Orleans area in August 2005, became a defining moment of Bush's administration, whose response to the hurricane was marked by a series of errors in preparation and mismanagement that sent the president's approval rating to record lows.\u000a\u000aThe disastrous hurricane response, which led to the FEMA administrator's resignation as more than 1,800 lost their lives and thousands more were left stranded in New Orleans, has become a cautionary tale for government officials preparing for natural disasters -- and for presidents, who are reminded of the stain such failures can leave on their legacy.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration, as of yet, appears to be avoiding the mistakes of their predecessors in the Bush administration.\u000a\u000aHonoré said it appeared Trump's FEMA is "leaning forward," moving the necessary resources into place as those in the storm's path brace for the worst.\u000a\u000aHe said he was watching particularly closely to see if the administration would deploy naval assets to follow the storm inland, which Honoré called a key lesson from Katrina.\u000a\u000aA White House official said the Coast Guard was doing just that, moving its assets outside of the storm's path and preparing to "rush back in when the storm passes."\u000a\u000aStill, a degree of uncertainty remained -- as it always does when storms gather and humans brace for landfall.\u000a\u000a"They don't call them disasters for no reason. Natural disasters can be devastating," the White House official said.

aVWarren Buffett has had enough of GE.\u000a\u000aBuffett's investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, dropped its remaining 10.6 million shares of General Electric sometime in the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing. As of June, Buffett's investment had been worth $315 million.\u000a\u000aThe timing of the sale was pretty solid. Those 10.6 million shares would have been worth $46 million less today than three months ago.\u000a\u000a2017 has been particularly rough on GE. The stock has cratered 20% since January. In June, CEO Jeff Immelt resigned after 16 years on the job. And the company continues to offload struggling legacy businesses as it tries to stay relevant in the digital age.\u000a\u000aStill, Buffett made hay off the investment. He poured $3 billion into GE in 2008 when the company was hit hard by the financial crisis.\u000a\u000aGE's stock grew about 40% during the time Berkshire held stock in the company. Even better: GE pays a huge dividend, helping pad Buffett's profit.\u000a\u000aRelated: GE wants to unload its iconic light bulb business\u000a\u000aThough Berkshire no longer owns any of GE, Buffett couldn't completely break up with his old investment. Berkshire bought 17.4 million shares of GE spinoff Synchrony Financial during the past quarter. The stake is worth about $518 million.\u000a\u000aSynchrony was formerly GE Capital, General Electric's lending arm that helped make GE the worst performing component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of the 21st century.\u000a\u000aShares of GE (GE) hardly budged Tuesday morning, but Synchrony (SYF) shares jumped 6% in premarket trading.\u000a\u000aA spokeswoman for GE declined to comment on the news.\u000a\u000aBerkshire also bought more Apple stock and upped its stake in Bank of New York Mellon (BKPRC).

aV(CNN) The park bench is a familiar and often overlooked design that exists in cities across the world. Typically designed to have mass appeal, and manufactured from materials that can withstand frequent use, constant exposure to the elements and vandalism, these seats provide a valuable but perhaps unrecognized service.\u000a\u000aAs part of a development project aimed at revitalizing Stockholm's Järfälla suburb, 10 leading international designers were invited to create alternative benches for the neighborhood's neglected Kvarnbacken park. The outcomes of the Superbenches project challenge the conventional notion of public seating and vary drastically in their execution, ranging from playful outdoor lounge furniture to a curving mini amphitheater.\u000a\u000aSuperbenches forms part of a wider two-year research and communication initiative called Kalejdohill , which was launched by property developers HSB, Veidekke Bostad and Einar Mattsson to help reactivate Kvarnbacken park as an attractive meeting place for local residents.\u000a\u000aFollowing an announcement that several hundred new homes will be built in the area, the developers invited curators Andreas Angelidakis and Mia Lundstrom to oversee a series of events and interventions to foster a sense of pride in the neighborhood. The project also encourages current residents to contribute ideas and suggestions that will ultimately help to shape the planning process.\u000a\u000aA close-up of "Cushy" by Hagglund & Gripner\u000a\u000aNew York-based creative director and writer Felix Burrichter was brought in to select the designers for the Superbenches installation, and set a brief that urged them to break away from preconceived notions of what a park bench should look like.\u000a\u000a"I was hoping we would achieve a great variety of different benches and that's certainly the case," said Burrichter at the project's launch. "Some of them aren't even benches in the classic sense, but what many of them do is foster the community of the overall park, as well as creating moments of leisure and pleasure and different kinds of use."\u000a\u000aPhotos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of Photos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere, the town's cultural association invited seven world-class architects, including Pritzker Prize winners Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu, to design shelters along the local bus route, offering nothing more than a week's free holiday in the region.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRemarkably, the architects accepted, and the construction was funded entirely through local community's donations, with no public money spent at all.

The resulting seven architectural visions, such as this triangular creation by Architecten De Vylder Vinck Taillieu , turn the humble, hum-drum bus stop into avant-garde landmarks.Interviews by Hide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJapanese architect Dietmar Steiner, a curator from the National Architecture Museum of Austria who was tasked with selecting the architects, initially balked at the idea after being approached by Krumbach residents: "I didn't believe it would work, it was such a crazy proposal, but what I think attracted these studios was a near complete freedom to create whatever they wanted," he said.Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto , who designed the airy construction above, wanted to create a vantage point from which people could admire the picturesque scenery around them: "By climbing up the heights people would wait -- for the bus, for a friend, for something to come, for your future, or overlooking a destination of their own," he says. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of The area in which Krumbach lies has long been known for its superb quality of craftsmanship, which was one of the main draws for the Norwegian studio Rintala Eggertsson Architects , creators of the shelter shown above. "All this talk about star architects is funny to us," says Dagur Eggertsson, "because for us it was all about meeting the star craftsmen of the region. They have embraced all the modern technology while also preserving their tradition and heritage," he adds. Hide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of Around 300 local volunteers were involved in the project, with each international architect paired with a local partner. Debora Mesa and Anton Garcia-Abril of Ensemble Studio , who were behind this rustic looking bus stop, say that they were intrigued by the extravagant nature of the commission: "It's an experimental idea. We were curious to see the outcome and be part of it." Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of\u000a\u000aRussian superstar of architecture Dietmar Steiner stresses that the effort mounted by the town's 1000 residents is like nothing he had ever seen before: "It's the most wonderful project I have ever been involved with. The shelters are like temples of the bus system, and the people of the region have built it by themselves, for themselves" he explains.Russian superstar of architecture Alexander Brodsky presented his vision in the form of a watch tower -- there is even a bench and a table for waiting in comfort in case the famously punctual Austrian bus service is late.

Hide Caption 7 of 7\u000a\u000aBurrichter also encouraged the designers to consider the idea of the folly -- an architectural intervention created purely for decorative purposes -- when coming up with their proposals for the benches. This inspiration is most evident in London-based designer Philippe Malouin' s brutalist-inflected cylindrical seating structure.\u000a\u000aDutch studio Scholten & Baijings and LA-based designer Jonathan Olivares both sought to improve the park's existing infrastructure, with the former applying colored gradients to the wooden seats and backs of five existing benches, and the latter placing a curving bench alongside a pair of renovated boules courts.\u000a\u000aAppropriately for a project aimed at engaging with the local community, the inhabitants of Järfälla will be asked in a year's time to decide which, if any, of the Superbenches they want to remain in the park. Feedback from residents at the opening event was predominantly positive, meaning these alternative benches might well become a permanent part of Kvarnbacken's future.

aVAmanda Sealy, CNN \u2022 Updated 18th August 2017\u000a\u000aEditor's Note \u2014 Amanda Sealy is a Senior CNN Producer based in the Hong Kong bureau. She knew her father had always been into photography, but became more curious to see his old photos after getting to spend time in Asia. Hong Kong is the city where her parents met.\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 My dad's first Instagram post went up on January 10, 2015.\u000a\u000aIt was a photo of our ugly kitchen table and some building blocks from IKEA. Uninspiring, but hardly the worst-case scenario when connecting with your parents on social media.\u000a\u000aMonths later, an old black and white photo featuring a group of Taiwanese school boys appeared on his feed. A welcome departure from the subject of our kitchen table, this photo marked the rebirth of one of my dad's oldest passions -- street photography.\u000a\u000aIt was taken in Asia when he served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War. He included the caption: "Kaohsiung 1971. If this is you, or you know who it is, please add a comment or send a private message."\u000a\u000aStationed in Yokosuka, Japan from 1970 to 1972, my father traveled around the region taking hundreds of photos of hundreds of people.\u000a\u000aRecently retired, my dad -- Stephen Sealy -- has redirected his focus back to those images.\u000a\u000aHaving scanned all of the negatives he dutifully kept for more than 40 years, he's now sharing the old photographs on his Instagram feed, @my_pacific_70s , in the hope of finding the strangers they depict.\u000a\u000aHong Kong (1971): "I enjoyed taking black and white pictures because there's a talent to being able to see just light and shadow."\u000a\u000aWhere did you get the idea for this project?\u000a\u000aStephen Sealy: The first thing I was going to do was scan all of my old negatives for archival purposes.\u000a\u000aWhile I was going through and scanning them I thought, "I have some really good pictures of these people that I met, but did not know and never had a chance to share the pictures with them."\u000a\u000aAnd I thought with communications that we have now with social media, maybe there's a chance I could actually share the picture with them or their family.\u000a\u000aOfuna, Japan (1971): Stephen Sealy bought a secondhand Nikomat camera from one of his shipmates. It cost him $125 and came with 50mm and 200mm lenses.\u000a\u000aWere you passionate about photography before you came to Asia?\u000a\u000aNot at all. When I joined my ship there was another sailor I met -- John Colvin -- and he had studied photography and was buying a new camera for himself.\u000a\u000aHe offered to sell me his old one at a good price, so I bought it and he taught me how to develop film and loaned me some books on photography.\u000a\u000aI learned about exposures and depth of field and how to frame pictures and looked at photography magazines including Japanese ones. I couldn't read them, but I could look at the nice pictures.\u000a\u000aHow did you convince people to let you take their photos?\u000a\u000aActually in Japan it was really common for people to be out taking pictures and if you were setting up to take a picture it was kind of obvious what you were doing. It was just non-verbal communication.\u000a\u000aThere's one picture where there's a woman who is ducking down and there's a guy giving me a startled look. That was taken on Honcho Street in Yukosuka.\u000a\u000aHoncho Street was kind of the American bar district, so he probably wasn't too happy with me taking the picture and I may have been making trouble for myself. You can take a look at that guy and see that he may have been someone you didn't want to mess with.\u000a\u000aYokosuka, Japan (1970): This is one of Stephen Sealy's favorite photos. "My sister has a framed print of this photo in her apartment," says Amanda, who interviewed her father for this story.\u000a\u000aWhich photo is your favorite?\u000a\u000aMy absolute favorite is the young Japanese girl with the dog. It's the Mona Lisa smile.\u000a\u000aI don't remember exactly the street name, but she was on the opposite side of the street as me and it was kind of a narrow street and I saw her chasing her dog, which had gotten loose.\u000a\u000aI saw that she was a cute girl and it would make a good picture.

aVDenver (CNN) When is a race more than a race? When it's an event.\u000a\u000aThat's not really a riddle as much as a puzzle Colorado race coordinators worked hard to solve after a professional bike race there was dissolved a couple of years ago.\u000a\u000aThe solution they devised is the Colorado Classic. Combined with a tandem spectator event called the Velorama, it's something like the Lollapalooza of bike racing. It may also be the most ambitious elite-level bike competition in the country after the Tour California. And year one is starting strong off the line.\u000a\u000aThe Colorado Classic is also the highest (in terms of overall elevation) bike race in North America. This year's event consisted of four days and some of the best racers in world lapping through the downtowns of three cities, up some of the state's prettiest and most demanding peaks, live-streamed by NBC, following a flotilla of pace and support vehicles, watched by hundreds of spectators and one helicopter.\u000a\u000aThe races culminated in a three-day festival in downtown Denver with food, drink, a marketplace and a concert by 20 bands including Wilco and Death Cab for Cutie.\u000a\u000aIt's a race series that seems organized more for spectators than for cyclists, which is sort of the point. The multiple laps ensure that no one misses the action, repeatedly. The Western backdrop gives the courses a cinematic quality. The bands, beer and bikes along the main streets, plus impromptu parties along the route, are all for fans of the sport and designed to make the race profitable and therefore sustainable.\u000a\u000aA new classic\u000a\u000aThe first Colorado Classic featured 16 men's teams and 15 women's for a total of 186 elite riders. The women completed 70 miles between two races in and around Colorado Springs and Breckenridge, with 8,000 feet of total elevation. The men had two additional stages, both in Denver, and over four days, they completed 313 miles with more than 21,000 feet of intense climbing.\u000a\u000aThe morning of the first stage, racers woke to the flash and boom of a thunderstorm. But by the time they kicked off in downtown Colorado Springs, the sky had turned into a blue canvas with puffy storybook clouds, broken only by a flash hailstorm in the middle of the men's race.\u000a\u000aThe Colorado Springs stage contained six laps of 93.5 total miles for the men and five laps of 38.36 miles for the women. The women's race, announced by Rio Olympic gold medalist Kristin Armstrong, kicked off dramatically with the James Bond theme blaring.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Colorado Classic bike race The Colorado Classic consisted of four days and some of the best racers in world lapping through the downtowns of three cities, starting with Colorado Springs.

It flowed up, down, left and right, past downtown shops and red moon rock formations jutting into the sky like the hands of an ancient giant. Clusters of crowds popped up along the route, many on bikes themselves, all in the shadow of fabled Pikes Peak.\u000a\u000aThe iconic sandstone formations, known as the Garden of the Gods, are located at the highest elevation of the race. It's popular with tourists and a hard-fought milestone for riders who repeatedly climbed nearly 600 feet to reach them. The Colorado Springs stage ended in cheers from the crowd downtown, followed by a traffic logjam as most of the racers and crews made their way to the next day's event, 100 miles away.\u000a\u000aStage 2 began and ended on main street Breckenridge, a pretty mining-cum-ski town 80 miles from Denver. It was mid-August, and there was still snow on the ridges of the nearby mountains. Grass freeways were visible between trees, carved out for ski runs in the winter.\u000a\u000aThe second-day race was made up of 10 laps over 64 miles for the men and five laps over 32 miles for the women. Each lap started downtown, whizzing past ski and bike rentals, après-ski bars, tourist shops, bakeries and a Smokey Bear sign (fire danger "low" on race day). Past Smokey, the field of racers began the steady climb along expensive houses and condos to the top of the mountain and then back down fun switchbacks through the natural beauty known as the Illinois Gulch.\u000a\u000aOther than the start/finish line, the most popular spot to watch the Breckenridge stage was along the steep climb known as Moonstone -- located 10,000 feet above sea level -- where bell-clanging spectators lined the road, some in costume. "The energy from the crowds was amazing," said Jillian Bearden, 36, who was taking part in her first pro race. She said Breckenridge tested her personally, but overall, the day was "epic."\u000a\u000aThe last two stages of the Classic over the next two days started in downtown Denver for the men's teams only. Stage 3 was a single out-and-back loop of 81 miles, with an elevation of 6,500 feet going through the beautiful Golden Gate Canyon park and taking a fun detour onto dirt roads in the foothills. Stage 4 was a thrillingly fast urban loop of 7.5 miles.\u000a\u000aMellow Velo\u000a\u000aAnd all that racing is just half the fun. The three-day Veloroma festival -- part concert, part craft fair -- took up more than six downtown Denver blocks over the weekend and attracted about 30,000 people who drank, ate and shopped among 200 vendors, as well as watching several more pro-am races. Velo is the French word for bike.\u000a\u000a"It was a broad, epic celebration of health, wellness and community," said Ken Gart, chairman of RPM Events, which organized the Colorado Classic. But there were some first-year problems: ATMs crashed, beer lines were long, food trucks ran out of meals before everyone enjoyed them, and some complained that the $25 to $50 entrance fee was too, shall we say, steep.\u000a\u000aThe Classic evolved from Colorado's USA Pro Challenge, which ran for five years. Despite the million spectators who came to cheer racers on, the annual event struggled to make a profit.\u000a\u000aColorado: First place for bikes\u000a\u000ato the effort and appointed Gart the state's "bike czar" to oversee the effort. Colorado is arguably the most bike-friendly state in the country . Topographically speaking, there is an extensive network of trails into mountains and along flat areas, cities are committed to bike lane expansions, and there are races all year long, both amateur and professional. Gov. John Hickenlooper even pledged $100 millionto the effortand appointed Gart the state's "bike czar" to oversee the effort.\u000a\u000aThe state's topography is well-suited for many types of recreation, from mountain climbing and biking to kayaking and fishing, but the hills and flats are ideal for bike race training and competitions. And the altitude helps any athlete increase their red blood count -- which in turn increases oxygen flow and improves performance -- a reason one of the three US Olympic Training Centers is located in Colorado Springs, next to the starting line of the Classic.\u000a\u000a"Colorado is unsurpassed in the US" in terms of outdoor recreation, Gart said. And what's special about supporting biking culture is that bike riding is "something anyone can do."\u000a\u000aReaching your own peak\u000a\u000aThe Classic invited the highest ranked racers they could get among teams licensed with the International Cycling Union. There were several national and world champions and one from the most recent winning Tour de France team. There were also sponsor teams. As if the scenery and prestige weren't enough of an incentive, prizes for racers totaled $84,400.\u000a\u000aIn order to qualify for race consideration, a cyclist must have accumulated enough points or have been a finalist in other races. For those not on the pro circuit but interested in participating, some of the Veloroma races are open to amateurs.\u000a\u000aOnce you've qualified for the Classic, your physical condition should be up to the challenge of multiple days of competition and hours of uninterrupted riding at speeds of up to 55 miles per hour, at high altitudes. But since it's possible to qualify without necessarily having done serious climbing, cyclists may still need to clock those climbing training runs.\u000a\u000aBearden trained for the Classic with "lots of climbing, every day, an average 10,000 feet a week." She also shed 13 pounds with a balanced diet in order to pull less weight uphill. And she raced elsewhere with her team so they were familiar with one another. Racers coming from lower sea levels need to build in days for acclimating to Colorado's elevation.\u000a\u000aBiking is, of course, excellent exercise, strengthening core and back in particular. Although biking has been common for more than 100 years, the sport continues to grow in popularity as a way to stay fit and lose weight (which helps in getting up those hills!). And cities around the world are getting progressively bike-friendly.\u000a\u000aMany runners turn to biking after an injury because it's easier on your knees while still engaging major leg muscles from your rear to your ankles: glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings and calves.\u000a\u000aAccording to fitness expert Dr. Tom Flaherty, who compared the two for CNN , running outdoors burned 970 calories an hour, while biking got only 570 calories. But biking uphill burns a lot more depending on steepness grade and headwind; it's two to four times the number of calories than on a flat surface.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAnd then there are the well-known mental benefits of exercise and exposure to nature. Before she started staying fit to compete, Bearden started riding to stay fit. She also loved to immerse herself in the outdoors. In general, she found biking to be an effective mental stress release, "a therapist, so to speak," she said. "It helped me move through challenges in life (and) eventually got me off antidepressants."\u000a\u000aCycling throughout Colorado, one could easily argue, is about as opposite from depressed as you can get without the use of pharmaceuticals.

aV(CNN) Adults in the United States are dying from colon and rectal cancers at an increasing rate about age 50, when they should just be beginning screenings, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society.\u000a\u000aSince routine screening is generally not recommended for most adults under 50, the cancers found in younger adults are often in advanced stages and more deadly, said Dr. James Church, a colorectal surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\u000a\u000aChurch, who was not involved in the new study, said he has seen this trend in death rates up close. Last year, on separate occasions, Church saw two 36-year-olds with stage IV colon cancer, he said.\u000a\u000aIn both of those patients, who had no relation to each other, the cancer spread to their livers, making it so he couldn't operate. Both died, he said.\u000a\u000a"They both had young families, both little girls, and they lost their father in one case and their mother in the other, forever, because of this nasty disease when it's advanced," Church said.\u000a\u000a"It makes a big impact on me, and it makes me keenly interested in trying to solve this issue," he said. "Everybody in colorectal surgical circles is seeing increased incidence of colon cancer in the young, defined as younger than 50."\u000a\u000aAccording to the previous study, adults born in 1990 could have twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer at the same age had they been born in 1950.\u000a\u000aThe reason for the rise in both incidence and death rates remains unclear.\u000a\u000a"We've known that there's this increasing trend in people under 50 for incidence, but a lot of people were saying, 'Hey, this is good news. This means people are getting more colonoscopies, and cancer's being detected earlier,' " said Rebecca Siegel, an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the new study.\u000a\u000aNow, "what (the new study) indicates is that the increase in incidence is a true increase in disease occurrence and not an artifact of more colonoscopy use," she said. "If it was just colonoscopy use, you wouldn't expect to see an effect on death rates, or even you might see a decline in death rates."\u000a\u000aColorectal cancer, which includes both colon and rectal cancers, is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States and the second leading cause in men, and this year, it's expected to result in about 50,260 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society\u000a\u000aGlobally, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer, according to the World Cancer Research Fund International\u000a\u000aA 'surprising' racial divide\u000a\u000aThe new study included data on colon and rectal cancer diagnoses and death reports for adults ages 20 to 54 in the United States from 1970 to 2014.\u000a\u000aThe mortality data came from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program , as reported by the National Center for Health Statistics, which tracks cause-specific mortality rates.\u000a\u000aAfter analyzing the data, the researchers found that colon and rectal cancer mortality rates among 20- to 54-year-olds declined overall from 1970 to 2004 but then increased by 1% annually from 2004 to 2014. In 2014, the total colorectal mortality rate in that age group was 4.3 people per 100,000.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, "when we looked at the trend by race, the increase in death rates is confined to whites, and in blacks, we see a slight decline over the entire 45-year study period in death rates," Siegel said.\u000a\u000a"That's very surprising, because whites and blacks have similar patterns in the major risk factors for colorectal cancer, like obesity," she said. "A lot of people want to look to the natural culprit, obesity, but that probably isn't what's completely driving this increase in colorectal cancer."\u000a\u000aIt turns out that what's driving the increase in both colorectal cancer incidence and death rates remains a mystery, Siegel said.\u000a\u000a"It's important to mention that still the risk for colorectal cancer is low in people under 55. We don't want to be alarmists. The risk is low," Siegel said.\u000a\u000a"In whites, the increase over the past decade was a 14% increase in the rate. So it's not enormous, but it's concerning, because the trend has changed direction," she said. "It was declining, and now it's increasing."\u000a\u000aSome key factors that can impact mortality rates include the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis, treatments received by patients and the molecular subtype of the cancer, said Dr. Nancy You, a colorectal cancer surgeon and associate professor of surgical oncology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\u000a\u000aStill, while such large population-level studies are excellent for showing large-scale trends, they often don't allow for deciphering the causes for those trends, said You, who was not involved in the new study.\u000a\u000aFor instance, the data analysis in the study didn't reveal the proportion of advanced versus early-stage colorectal cancers over time or whether the proportion of patients who received stage-specific treatments changed over time, You said.\u000a\u000a"The study also did not compare the cancer-specific mortality rates of young versus older adults with colorectal cancer in the same time," You said.\u000a\u000a"Finally, young age-of-onset rectal cancer appears to differ from young age-of-onset colon cancer, because the rise in incidence rates of rectal cancer is much more dramatic," she said. "The mortality rate difference based on colon versus rectum would also be interesting for a future analysis."\u000a\u000aYou added that, between 2004 and 2014, there were many advances in surgical and chemotherapy treatments for colorectal cancer.\u000a\u000a"So the findings reported here raise the concern that 'why are such treatment advances failing to deliver their promise of improving survival among young adults?' " she said.\u000a\u000aAll in all, the study "tells us that we need to get messages out for people when they turn 50, they need to call and schedule their colorectal cancer screening, because increasing death rates for people who should be screened is very concerning," said Siegel, the study's lead author.\u000a\u000aThe Affordable Care Act required coverage of colorectal cancer screening tests , but patients still should check with their health insurance providers to determine coverage for colorectal cancer screening, which can range in cost.\u000a\u000aScreenings can be performed using a fecal blood test, a stool DNA test, a sigmoidoscopy, a virtual colonoscopy or the standard colonoscopy, according to the National Cancer Institute , which also notes that other tests to screen for colorectal cancer are not generally recommended.\u000a\u000aJim Risk, a 51-year-old patient at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved in the new study, agreed that the study's findings are a reminder for more adults to get screened and to pay attention to potential colorectal cancer symptoms , which include diarrhea, blood in the stool, cramping or bloating.\u000a\u000aRisk was 40 when the Cleveland Clinic's Church diagnosed him with stage I rectal cancer.\u000a\u000a'Had I ignored it ... I probably wouldn't be alive today'\u000a\u000aAbout 10 years ago, Risk experienced rectal bleeding, and at first, he figured it was a result of a lingering hemorrhoid, he said.\u000a\u000aYet after he casually mentioned the bleeding to his primary care physician in an annual physical exam, Risk's doctor recommended that he get a colonoscopy to make sure the bleeding was nothing more serious.\u000a\u000aSo Risk visited the Cleveland Clinic's main campus, where "they pulled basically a golf-ball-sized polyp out of me," he said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Screening for colon cancer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Screening for colon cancer 01:08\u000a\u000aColon polyps are growths of tissue on the lining of the colon and rectum, and some polyps can become cancerous . Risk's polyp was tested for cancer, and a week later, Church called him with the test results.\u000a\u000a"He was sort of stumbling around with his words, and that's when I knew I had a problem," said Risk, who is now healthy after surgical treatment for the cancer.\u000a\u000a"I was unbelievably blessed. I caught it very early, and had I ignored it another year, I probably wouldn't be alive today," he said. "You have to be a good steward of your own body, and when you feel that there's something going on, you're probably better off getting it checked out as early as possible."\u000a\u000aEven in the new study, the researchers wrote that escalating mortality rates in young and middle-aged adults "highlight the need for earlier (colorectal cancer) detection" through age-appropriate screening and timely followups for symptoms.\u000a\u000aRisk said, "I think I've had 11 colonoscopies in my life, and the prep work is horrible, but just go in and just do it and get it over with."\u000a\u000aTo reduce your risk of colon and rectal cancers , Siegel recommended maintaining a healthy body weight, staying physically active, avoiding drinking alcohol excessively and avoiding smoking.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, regular screening tests may find colorectal cancer early, when treatment is likely to be more effective.\u000a\u000aYet whether there should be changes in screening recommendations remains to be debated, Church said. Some colorectal cancer screening tests can come with risks or false positive results.\u000a\u000aFor instance, the risk in colonoscopies includes a possible reaction to sedatives or anesthesia, bleeding, perforation of the colon, pain in the abdomen or even an extremely rare risk of fatal complications, according to the National Institutes of Health\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"The big question that we're struggling with is, as a society of doctors, should we screen people earlier? Is it worth it? And part of the big issue is, we don't know why there is this increased incidence of colon cancer in young people," Church said.\u000a\u000a"We were taught in medical school that colon cancer is more common as you get older, and we didn't expect the rates going up," he said. "What we can do right now is pay attention to symptoms and pay attention to risk factors like family history, and by we, I mean largely primary health docs and patients."

First question, senator, is do you support the idea that convention delegates should be able to vote their conscience, be unbound if they are currently bound to vote for Donald trump? [JOHNSON] Well, good morning, Dana. I'm not a delegate. I really do not know. Nobody can really predict what's going to be the outcome of our nomination process. I know there's a number of movements afoot. I'm not part of that process. I have my own race here in Wisconsin. I\u2019m going to concentrate on the areas of agreement, growing our economy, strengthening our military, defeating ISIS, securing our borders, making sure that we have judges appointed to the Supreme Court. So those are the issues, you know, economic growth so that we have - create better opportunities for the American public for the folks here in Wisconsin. I mean, that\u2019s the think I\u2019m going to concentrate on.\u000a\u000aJohnson on if he will support Donald Trump: [BASH] According to a paper from your home state you said just before an event last month "I\u2019m going to certainly endorse the Republican nominee and obviously it looks like that will be Mr. Trump." Have you endorsed him? [JOHNSON] It has been my intention to support the Republican nominee. And again nobody can predict the outcome of this thing. So I think things remain reasonably uncertain. But is my intention to support \u2013 [BASH] So are you endorsing Mr. Trump right now? [JOHNSON] I intend to support the Republican nominee and certainly support the areas of agreement, growing our economy, defeating ISIS, strengthening our military, securing our border. I mean, those - no two people agree 100 percent on everything. So I'll support the areas of agreement? [BASH] Support but not endorse, what's the difference? [JOHNSON] Well to me endorsement is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything. That's not necessarily be the case with our nominee, so I\u2019ll certainly be an independent voice where I disagree with a particular nominee. I'll voice it, whether it's Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or anybody else. I'll voice those disagreements and I\u2019ll certainly support the areas of agreement.\u000a\u000aJohnson on Facebook\u2019s cooperation on terror investigations : [BASH] And senator, three days after the Orlando shootings last week you wrote a letter to Facebook to CEO Mark Zuckerberg - Zuckerberg, forgive me - and you asked the company to turn over material relating to the accounts linked to the Orlando shooter because he was posting on that site during the attack. Has Mark Zuckerberg or anybody from Facebook responded? [JOHNSON] Yes. I\u2019m sure Facebook is going to be cooperative. They've been cooperative in the past. They've been doing very innovative - taking very innovative efforts trying to counter ISIS' vile and barbaric use of social media. So I view Facebook as a real partner in this.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFULL POST

This durability is thanks to the unique features of honey: it is low in water and high in sugar, so bacteria cannot grow on it. Honey also contains small amounts of hydrogen peroxide, which inhibits growth of microbes. This is partly why bees produce it for the young in their hives -- it is both food and protection.\u000a\u000aProcessing honey also helps as the sugars in honey are hygroscopic and tend to draw in atmospheric water, which is not ideal. However, during processing and packaging, the heat treatment first removes water and then airtight lids keeps the water out, helping it keep for longer. Although honey can go cloudy and crystallise when opened as the sugars draw in water again, this physical change can be reversed by simply warming the honey.\u000a\u000a2. Dried legumes\u000a\u000aAs with honey, the key to a long shelf-life is processing and storage. Drying beans, lentils, and other legumes increases the sugar concentration and lowers their water content, which makes it hard for bacteria and moulds to grow on them. Also, any enzymes that would naturally break down the product after harvest are put into suspended animation. If the container is airtight, they will last for years and still be a great source of protein. If you allow water in, however, then they will only last a few months.\u000a\u000a3. Soy sauce\u000a\u000aSoy sauce has the potential to last at least three years . The combination of its salt content and being fermented means that, if it is unopened, it should have a very long shelf life . How long it will last depends on the type of soy sauce and, once opened, the temperature it is stored at. If it does go off, it is likely to be due to mould growing around the lid.\u000a\u000a4. Vinegar\u000a\u000aSome may argue vinegar is in fact already spoiled wine or cider. But its acidic nature, traditionally achieved using Acetobacter bacteria to ferment it, means other bacteria struggle to grow in it, and so it can last a very long time. While white vinegar will remain almost unchanged indefinitely, other vinegars may change colour or produce a sediment . Typically, this will not affect the safety of the product, just the appearance and perhaps flavour.\u000a\u000a5. White rice\u000a\u000aWhite rice has been eaten after being stored for 30 years in tins, with the parboiled rice then passing a tasting panel test . What appears to be key for rice is atmosphere and temperature. Studies have reported that a low temperature (about 3\u2103) and a lack of oxygen appear to be important for its longevity. Brown rice, although often considered to be healthier, has a shorter shelf life. Its fibrous bran contains unsaturated fats, which can turn rancid. So if your brown rice is oily and smells like old paint, it's best to throw it away.\u000a\u000a6. Dark chocolate\u000a\u000aThere is some debate about whether chocolate goes bad. The addition of milk to chocolate may reduce its shelf life. But dark chocolate appears to last better, despite not always looking like it has. This could be because, if it is not stored at a constant temperature, the fat can rise to the surface, leaving a bloom that looks a bit like mould . If stored at a constant temperature, however, chocolate can last for two years or more, with concentrations of the compounds which some link to health benefit s remaining throughout this time. For most people, though, chocolate does not tend to last this long before it is eaten.\u000a\u000a7 & 8. Sugar and salt\u000a\u000aMany of the foods that last for a long time are high in sugar and salt. In simple terms, they draw water out, so if bacteria try to grow on it, they will simply shrivel up. This is why we use salt to make ham, sugar to make jam, and both to make gravlax\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAs foods in their own right, if salt and sugar are stored away from moisture in airtight containers, they will last indefinitely. But additives, such as iodine added to salt, can reduce its shelf life to about five years\u000a\u000aOf course, most foods don't last very long. This is because they contain the things microbes love, such as nutrients and water, and not much of the stuff they don't love, such as salt and acid.

No matter where things are right now, he knows in the long run they're getting better. You doubt it? Don't bet against it; he's made billions investing in that belief.

Because optimism isn't a belief that things will automatically get better; it's a conviction that we can make things better.

aV(CNN) President Uhuru Kenyatta won re-election in Kenya on Friday, defeating veteran opposition leader and longtime rival Raila Odinga in a tense contest.\u000a\u000aKenya's election commission declared that the 55-year-old businessman and son of the country's founding President had received enough votes to secure a second five-year term.\u000a\u000aKenyatta garnered 54.27% of the final vote, similar to what he had in a preliminary count. Odinga received 44.74%.\u000a\u000aThe President, in a nationally broadcast speech, said he and his opponent were not enemies.\u000a\u000a"We are all citizens of one republic," he said. "As with any competition, there shall always be winners and there shall be losers. But we all belong to one great nation called Kenya."\u000a\u000aKenyatta said he wanted to work with the opposition National Super Alliance (NASA).\u000a\u000a"I extend a hand of partnership knowing fully well that this country needs all of us pulling together in order for us to succeed," he said.\u000a\u000aKenya's election commission announced Friday that President Uhuru Kenyatta has won a second term. Opposition candidate Raila Odinga claimed the vote was rigged.\u000a\u000aCongratulations came from Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni as well as Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who applauded Kenyatta on Twitter "for a successful election and the trust Kenyans have placed in you!"\u000a\u000aThe President told his countrymen there was no need for violence.\u000a\u000aThe nation's top elections official, Wafula Chebukati, said the vote was carried out in a "free, fair and credible manner."\u000a\u000aOpposition calls vote a 'charade'\u000a\u000aOdinga, a 72-year-old former political prisoner who has campaigned for the presidency four times, is refusing to accept the results , claiming the vote was hacked.\u000a\u000aSpeaking before the declaration, Musalia Mudavadi, co-principal of NASA, said the organization would not be party to the announcement of Kenyatta as President, citing unresolved concerns about the veracity of the electoral process.\u000a\u000a"The issues we raised have not been adequately addressed," he said. "One can conclude that they (Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission) were not keen on taking our concerns seriously."\u000a\u000aJames Orengo, NASA party chief agent, described the process as a "disaster." "This has been an entire charade. The judgment is now out there in the court of public opinion."\u000a\u000aOdinga, running as the NASA candidate, told CNN Thursday that he doesn't "trust" the paper forms from polling stations around the country that officials used to authenticate votes.\u000a\u000aOdinga said the forms could have been "manipulated" before being returned to the capital. At a news conference Thursday, members of Odinga's party gave no evidence to support any claims of election tampering, citing only unnamed sources at the election commission.\u000a\u000aKisumu's main street "Oginga Odinga street," named for Raila's father who acted as the country's first vice president, was largely deserted on Friday.\u000a\u000aIn a letter released Friday morning, Chebukati, the chairman of the election commission, rejected the opposition coalition's evidence of election fraud, calling it "obviously and plainly falsified."\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, Chebukati said tampering with the election system "was attempted but did not succeed," without elaborating further.\u000a\u000aMonitors urge calm amid fraud allegations\u000a\u000aEarlier Friday, international observers called upon candidates to respect the final outcome and resolve any poll disputes through legal avenues.\u000a\u000aMore than 400 international election monitors -- including officials from the United States and the EU -- were deployed across the country to monitor voting, the tallying process and part of the post-election period.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED John Kerry confident about Kenyan election process Replay More Videos ...

"So by paper ballots, there is a protection of each and every Kenyan's vote."\u000a\u000aFears of violence\u000a\u000aPeaceful elections in East Africa's largest economy would help provide stability to the region but allegations of vote rigging have sparked concern with some Kenyans fearing ethnic clashes similar to those triggered a decade ago.\u000a\u000aMore than 1,000 died in months of violence and bloodshed after Odinga -- who had been defeated by the then-President Mwai Kibaki -- claimed the 2007 election had been rigged.\u000a\u000aOdinga and his party repeatedly called for calm this week as the final results were compiled.\u000a\u000aKenyan security personnel walk towards burning barricades on a road in Kisumu on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aExtra security forces have been deployed to the streets of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka told CNN. Additional police have also been installed at the airport in the western city of Kisumu as a preventative measure, according to Reuters.\u000a\u000aNairobi remained quieter than usual after the national holiday on Tuesday. Some businesses were open in the city center but mostly people were remaining indoors; other residents who went to their home villages to vote might also have stayed away.\u000a\u000aIn Kisumu, a local journalist described the city center as "a ghost town."\u000a\u000aAt least two people died in election-related violence after brief protests broke out in several Odinga strongholds -- in Nairobi and Kisumu -- on Wednesday. The day before, a polling agent from Odinga's party was killed in a machete attack in Tana River county.\u000a\u000aOdinga's hacking claims this week have ratched up tensions in his strongholds.\u000a\u000a"We do not want to see any violence in Kenya. We know the consequences of what happened in 2008 and we don't want to see a repeat of that anymore," Odinga told CNN on Thursday.\u000a\u000a"I don't control anybody. What is happening is that people just want to see justice. We also hope that the security forces are not going to use excessive force."

aVA special needs girl was reprimanded by her school for wearing this dress. (FOX5)\u000a\u000aStarting out a new school year can be tough for kids. For one little girl, school outfits have helped ease those challenges. That's why John Lillis said he made sure his six-year-old daughter was back to school ready.\u000a\u000a"Grandma picked out this dress," he said holding up a little sundress. His daughter is in first grade at Harriet Treem elementary. While the start of school is stressful every year, this year was even more difficult for the Lillis family.\u000a\u000a"Having autism is hard enough for her to fit in," Lillis said. "And this year they are mainstreaming her."\u000a\u000aAs a special needs child, Lillis said his daughter meticulously picks out clothing. He called her a perfectionist when it comes to her outfits and said her clothing choices help her start conversations with other kids.\u000a\u000a"A kid will go up to [my daughter] and say 'Hey I like your dress,'" he explained. "Sometimes her clothes help her talk to kids."\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday morning, Lillis' daughter was picking out her outfits like she usually does, and she selected a brand new sundress that her grandmother helped get her, for the start of school. The family did not realize until after the school day that there had been a problem with her selection.\u000a\u000a"They pulled her out of class and they took her to the office. You should not be doing that to any kid, and especially a special needs kid; she is sensitive."\u000a\u000aLillis said his daughter came home off the bus crying, and had gym clothes over her dress.\u000a\u000a"My daughter said 'They made me look ugly,'" Lillis said. "And I said 'No they didn't. You are not ugly, you will never be ugly, you are beautiful.'"\u000a\u000aThe following day, the Lillis family said getting their child ready for school was nerve wracking.\u000a\u000a"It's hard for her because she stands out as it is and this made her stand out even more."\u000a\u000aSchool district staff said they did not want to comment on specific cases but said parents are sent dress code guidelines during the first weeks of school. The Lillis family said that's not true, and that they had no idea the dress was against dress code because they've never seen any guidelines.\u000a\u000aThey said they are speaking out in hopes the district will not do this to any other child, especially one with special needs. They also said the school should have called them, and they would have happily brought their child a change of clothes.\u000a\u000aCopyright 2017 KVVU (KVVU Broadcasting Corporation).

aVReporters waited in the lobby of Trump Tower on Tuesday for vague remarks from President Trump about infrastructure. White House aides tamped down expectations ahead of time: they said the president was not expected to take questions.\u000a\u000aThe reporters and aides were both surprised by what came next.\u000a\u000aTrump said "both sides" were responsible for the violence in Charlottesville that left three people dead on Saturday, seemingly equating neo-Nazis with anti-racism activists.\u000a\u000aAfter the Q&A session, members of the media freely expressed shock, disappointment and sometimes outright disgust.\u000a\u000a"Wow," CNN's Jake Tapper said immediately afterward. "That was something else."\u000a\u000a"What I just saw gave me the wrong kind of chills," Chuck Todd said on MSNBC. "Honestly I'm a bit shaken by what I just heard, and I suspect it's not just me."\u000a\u000aAn editorial in Wednesday's Washington Post was titled "The nation can only weep."\u000a\u000aMSNBC's Nicolle Wallace wondered if some of Trump's aides would resign.\u000a\u000aOthers wondered aloud about the president's fitness for office.\u000a\u000aSome hosts and commentators on Fox News were also sharply critical of the president. "I'm wondering if it's actually real life what I just watched," 5 p.m. co-host Kat Timpf said. But the channel's prime time shows spent more time attacking liberals and the media.\u000a\u000aThe closest analogue to Tuesday was Oct. 8. That's the day the obscene "Access Hollywood" tape came out via a story on the Post's web site.\u000a\u000aTrump prevailed in the election one month later, in spite of all the shock and sadness about his comments on the tape.\u000a\u000aSome TV commentators tried to keep that in mind while reacting, at times emotionally and personally, to the president's remarks on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aAt one point, while speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Van Jones said, "I don't know what to say tonight... I'm just hurt."\u000a\u000aDavid Gergen said on Cooper's program that people increasingly feel like Trump is "posing a danger not just to his party but to the country. He's going to tear us apart."\u000a\u000aOther political experts spoke in equally stark terms.\u000a\u000a"I would say to all Americans: we've got a problem," presidential historian Michael Beschloss said on MSNBC. "We've got a president who sent a big message today to hate groups: I'm going to make it easier for you."\u000a\u000aA tweet by presidential biographer David Maraniss went viral, perhaps because it tapped into wishful thinking by liberals. It said: "The living former presidents -- Bushes, Carter, Clinton & Obama -- should make a joint statement calling on the racist Trump to resign."\u000a\u000aThe hashtag #ImpeachTrump was the #1 trending topic on Twitter for several hours on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, a new hashtag took over: #WhyWeMustImpeachTrumpIn7Words.\u000a\u000aTrump's unexpected Q&A was a media critique through and through. He argued with members of the press corps, assailed "dishonest" coverage, and threw in a "fake news" smear for good measure.\u000a\u000aA White House official told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that Trump had been fuming in closed-door meetings about what he saw as unfair media coverage, and it spilled out very publicly.\u000a\u000aVeteran White House reporter Mark Knoller of CBS tweeted afterward, "Have never seen as frenzied a Q&A session with a president. Or as high-decibel an exchange either."\u000a\u000aLate-night hosts ripped up their scripts.\u000a\u000aAnd some GOP pundits ripped up their talking points. The White House's nightly "communications briefing" for media outlets quickly leaked out, partly because some of the recipients thought it was ridiculous. (The first bullet point about Charlottesville said "the president is entirely correct.")\u000a\u000aRelated: 'All manner of stupid came out': Late night responds to Trump's press conference\u000a\u000aEven before those talking points came out, former Republican National Committee communications director Doug Heye, now a CNN commentator, tweeted: "I've asked the press offices at both the White House & RNC to remove me from their email lists."\u000a\u000aConservative commentator Scott Jennings offered an impassioned plea to Trump on CNN. "Mr. President," he said, "we want to be with you in policy. But you are making it impossible for us to be with you in spirit."\u000a\u000aNone of the broadcast networks televised Trump's Q&A live, because it wasn't expected to be groundbreaking. But after it happened, the broadcasters scrambled to produce special editions of their nightly newscasts.\u000a\u000aThe "CBS Evening News" devoted its entire half hour to all things Trump and Charlottesville. The other newscasts squeezed in some other stories, but still focused squarely on the Q&A and the sweeping criticism that followed.\u000a\u000a"Remember," correspondent Hallie Jackson said on "NBC Nightly News," "he came down to the lobby in the first place to talk about infrastructure."

aVSAN DIEGO \u2014 A Bengal tiger cub smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico was in good condition Friday at the San Diego Zoo\u2019s Safari Park.\u000a\u000aThe young tiger was discovered during an inspection Wednesday at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, when an 18-year-old Perris man was arrested in connection with the smuggling attempt.\u000a\u000aVeterinary staff at the hospital said they performed a thorough health exam on the tiger cub and determined that he was in good health, overall.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis heart and lungs sound good, his blood work looked great and, since he took a bottle from us, it\u2019s a good sign he\u2019ll continue to thrive,\u201d said Dr. Jim Oosterhuis, principal veterinarian.\u000a\u000a\u201cI estimate the cub to be between 5 and 6 weeks old, and he weighs in at a little over 6 pounds,\u201d Oosterhuis said. \u201cHe has teeth coming in, so he\u2019ll be teething in the next week or two \u2014 so animal care staff will have a little chore getting him through that.\u201d\u000a\u000aLuis Eudoro Valencia was charged Thursday in federal court in San Diego for the alleged smuggling attempt.\u000a\u000aAccording to a complaint, Valencia drove to the border crossing from Mexico in a 2017 Chevrolet Camaro with no license plates.\u000a\u000aAt the primary inspection area, Valencia and his passenger stated that they had nothing to declare from Mexico, authorities said. Due to issues with the vehicle identification number, the vehicle was referred to a secondary inspection area.\u000a\u000aUsing a flashlight, a Customs and Border Protection inspector saw an animal lying on the floor between the passenger\u2019s legs and asked if it was a tiger. The passenger told the inspector that the animal was not a tiger but just a cat, according to an affidavit filed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Special Agent Eduardo Nieves.\u000a\u000aOfficials seized the tiger cub and it was taken to the Safari Park, where a biologist confirmed it was a tiger cub.\u000a\u000aIn an interview, Valencia initially stated that he was in Tijuana on Monday and observed an individual walking a full-sized tiger on a leash. Valencia told investigators that he asked about the tiger and the individual offered to sell him a tiger cub for $300 and the defendant agreed, saying he intended to take the tiger cub home to Perris to keep as a pet.\u000a\u000aAuthorities said Valencia denied having pictures of the tiger cub on his phone, but a search of that phone revealed numerous photos of three different tiger cubs, including the cub he had in his car at the border.\u000a\u000aA message associated with the photos was dated Aug. 18, and Valencia admitted that he started communicating with the seller of the tiger cub on that day.\u000a\u000aValencia said he went to Mexico on Aug. 18, met the seller, then returned to Mexico on Monday to pick up the tiger cub.\u000a\u000aUnder federal law, all species of tigers, including Bengal tigers, are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.\u000a\u000aAccording to the World Tiger Recovery Project, there are only 2,500 wild specimens on earth and the population of Bengal tigers is decreasing. Based on previous investigations, Nieves said the market value of a Bengal tiger cub sold in the United States is approximately $1,500.\u000a\u000aAbout 20 years ago, customs agents working at San Ysidro Port of Entry intercepted an attempt to smuggle a tiger cub out of California and into Mexico. The animal, christened Blanca, wound up living out its days at San Diego Safari Park, CBP officials said.\u000a\u000aValencia was released after posting a $10,000 bond and was ordered to return to court Sept. 5 for a preliminary hearing.\u000a\u000aThe tiger, meanwhile, is being observed by Safari Park staff in an isolated area of their animal care center, away from other animals in accordance with San Diego Zoo Global\u2019s protocols for new arrivals.\u000a\u000aGuests at the Safari Park will be able to view the tiger cub at the center\u2019s nursery window at various times throughout the day. San Diego Zoo Global officials said care and sanctuary will be provided for the cub until U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials determine his permanent home.

aVHoward Slutsken, CNN \u2022 Updated 27th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 There are few pop culture icons better known on both sides of the Pacific than Jackie Chan. The action-movie star's work across US and Asian film made him an obvious choice to represent Hong Kong Airlines and fly on the airline's first flight to North America.\u000a\u000aThe Hong Kong-based airline -- as its name suggests -- had its maiden flight to YVR Vancouver International Airport on June 30, its first destination outside of Asia and Australia.\u000a\u000aThe carrier's flight is just the latest inaugural flight to YVR from mainland China and Hong Kong. Unlikely as it seems, Vancouver is the epicenter for the international expansion of Asian carriers.\u000a\u000aGeographically blessed\u000a\u000aIt seems a surprising hub, but consider its geographical advantage -- all its Chinese destinations are closer to Vancouver than to any other major North American city.\u000a\u000a"We have more direct mainland Chinese flights than any other airport in North America or Europe," says YVR CEO Craig Richmond. "To put that in perspective, our relatively small, 23 million passenger-per-year airport has more Chinese flights than Heathrow, JFK, Los Angeles or San Francisco. When I tell people that, they're surprised!"\u000a\u000aCathay Pacific Airways, Air China and Air Canada have linked Vancouver with Hong Kong and China for decades, but over the past few years, the number of Chinese airlines flying to Canada's West Coast has exploded.\u000a\u000aChina Eastern, China Southern, Xiamen Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Beijing Capital Airlines have started service to YVR from major and second-tier cities in China.\u000a\u000aHong Kong Airlines, which is mostly owned by Chinese industrial conglomerate HNA Group, joined that growing list on June 30.\u000a\u000a118 direct flights\u000a\u000aComing off the plane was the usual inaugural flight group of airline and airport executives, and travelers heading to YVR -- but the crowds in the terminal cheered when the airline's "ambassador," Chan, bounded off the plane.\u000a\u000aTopping off the arrival, Chan and Richmond held a mock kung fu fight to the delight of the audience and a large group of Chinese- and English-language media.\u000a\u000aHong Kong Airlines' arrival ups the total to 118 weekly direct flights to Hong Kong and China, with over 26,000 available seats between Vancouver and Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, and smaller cities including Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen.\u000a\u000aLarge Asian population\u000a\u000a"We have so many ex-pats from Hong Kong living and working in Vancouver. In recent years, more and more Mainland Chinese have come here to live, to work, and to study," says George Liu, chief marketing officer for Hong Kong Airlines.\u000a\u000a"We have also built a very extensive regional network that will support our customers and travelers going to Hong Kong. We can take them to any place they want to go to in Asia," says Liu.\u000a\u000aAnd that's in part because Vancouver also holds the title of the " most Asian city outside of Asia ," consisting mainly of Chinese, Indians and Filipinos, according to Canadian census data. In 2017, Statistics Canada projected that by 2036 around 78% of immigrants in Vancouver would be from Asia.\u000a\u000aVancouver has become such a popular destination for Chinese investors looking to spend their money abroad that the provincial government in 2016 levied a 15% tax on foreign home buyers.\u000a\u000aThe Fairmont Vancouver Airport hotel offers dramatic views of the North Shore Mountains and runway.\u000a\u000aAirplanes of choice\u000a\u000aWith its huge Chinese population base, Vancouver is at the forefront of connecting to China, which is set to become the largest air travel market on the planet by 2030. And that's driving a buying spree by Chinese airlines who are taking new long-range jets from Boeing and Airbus that efficiently connect the continents.\u000a\u000aYVR is easily within the range of the workhorse twin-aisle Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s that are in the fleets of many Asian carriers.\u000a\u000aAnd the newest generation of airliners, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350, are being used by these airlines to establish new "long and thin" routes -- with long distances, but lower passenger demand -- like those from the second- and third-tier Chinese cities to Vancouver.\u000a\u000a"These airplanes also provide these Chinese carriers with the prestige they need to compete shoulder to shoulder with Air Canada and any other airline flying not just from Canada to China, but from the US as well," according to travel analyst Henry Harteveldt, Atmosphere Research Group.\u000a\u000aAppeal of the familiar\u000a\u000aWith a massive market of Chinese passengers wanting to travel to and from Vancouver, the option of flying on a "home airline" may be appealing. Travelers tend to prefer flying on airlines of their home country.\u000a\u000a"The airline may accept their preferred form of payment, there are people who speak their home language on the plane, and travelers know that meals, beverages and the in-flight entertainment is more likely to please them," says Harteveldt.\u000a\u000aPassengers who connect to or from the United States will find the process at YVR simple and swift.\u000a\u000aThose coming in from the United States can bypass Canada Border Services and Immigration, and go directly to their international departure gate. Passengers transiting to the US from other countries also bypass Canada Border Services and proceed directly to US Preclearance.\u000a\u000aAs with all major Canadian airports, passengers clear US Customs and Border Protection before they board their US-bound flights. Travelers arrive at their US destination as if it's a US domestic flight.\u000a\u000a"It's easy to make those connections," says YVR's Richmond. "We have to continuously improve on making things frictionless for the passenger."\u000a\u000aAnd the airport wins high marks from travelers. It was voted Best Airport in North America for the eighth consecutive year at the Skytrax World Airport Awards.\u000a\u000aHong Kong Airlines might be the most recent carrier to choose Vancouver as a destination, but it won't be the last. Richmond hints that another Chinese carrier will announce service to YVR "later this year."\u000a\u000aVancouver is only the start of North American flights for Hong Kong Airlines.\u000a\u000aLos Angeles is next, with the airline beginning service in December with its soon-to-be-delivered Airbus A350s.

aVCyrus R. Vance, Jr. is the Manhattan District Attorney and co-chair of Prosecutors Against Gun Violence. This views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) New York's turnaround on violent crime has improved the lives of all New Yorkers. In 1990, there were more than 2,000 murders in our city. Last year, there were 335 . Our safe streets have subsequently enabled an economic resurgence that has proven especially beneficial to real estate developers like President Donald J. Trump.\u000a\u000aI'm proud to say that New York remains the safest big city in the nation, at least according to the Economist's Safe Cities Index.\u000a\u000aBut this progress could come to a screeching halt if the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, known as CCRA, passes Congress. Every state has had the right to craft its own firearms licensing laws. In New York, we have crafted our laws to consider unique factors like our state's population density, culture and history. The CCRA would override our state's restrictive concealed-weapons permitting system and force New York to honor concealed-carry firearms privileges issued in other states, even though many other states have much looser standards.\u000a\u000aSimply put, this means that the gun laws of Arkansas, for example, could be forced upon New York by federal mandate. I can only imagine how angry citizens of Arkansas would be if Washington politicians forced them to follow laws from New York.\u000a\u000aConsider this: Eleven states grant concealed-carry privileges to individuals who have not undergone any safety training. Twenty states grant permits to people who have been convicted of violent crimes. And 12 states do not require any kind of permit or license to carry a concealed firearm. The CCRA would make it legal for someone to carry that concealed, loaded firearm into New York or anyplace else, regardless of local law.\u000a\u000aPublic safety is like oxygen. We don't always notice when we have it, but if it went away, we'd realize quite quickly. Without security and stability, tourists wouldn't visit. Developers wouldn't have the confidence to invest. Businesses would lose out on top talent, and their customers would flee.\u000a\u000aPublic safety also means not having to worry when our children ride the bus to school or take the subway to visit a friend on a Friday night. Public safety is the reason we feel comfortable living, working and raising families in places like Manhattan.\u000a\u000aAs the No. 1 tourism destination in the United States, my city receives more than 46 million adult visitors from other states each year, and 6.5% of American adults have a concealed handgun permit. Passage of CCRA could unleash countless new concealed weapons on the streets of New York. That could mean more shootings, more victims and more tragedies in America's safest big city.\u000a\u000aNo one will bear the burden of those tragedies more heavily than our police. Under the CCRA, cops would have to patrol our streets surrounded by hidden, loaded guns. They would have no way to confirm whether an out-of-state permit is legitimate and no database to check on the status of those permits. And because many states don't even require permits to carry, the NYPD would have to take armed individuals at their word.\u000a\u000aSo police officers are against this bil l. Prosecutors, like me, are against this bill. Who would actually be for this bill? I can offer one answer: ISIS.\u000a\u000aAccording to George Washington University's Extremism Tracker, New York is the top ISIS terror target in America. Meanwhile, ISIS is increasingly recruiting radicalized attackers to murder as many people as possible, using any means available.\u000a\u000aLet's not kid ourselves: ISIS is following the gun debate. Look no further than Rumiyah, its official magazine and how-to guide for terror. In its May 2017 issue, under a section titled "Just Terror Tactics," ISIS specifically told aspiring terrorists how to exploit America's lax gun laws to commit mass shootings on our soil:\u000a\u000a"In most US states, anything from a single-shot shotgun all the way up to a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle can be purchased at showrooms or through online sales -- by way of private dealers -- with no background checks, and without requiring an ID or a gun license."\u000a\u000aThe CCRA is a gift to these terrorists. A person on a watch list could purchase multiple handguns at a gun show, take those guns into Manhattan and carry them, fully loaded, into Times Square. It wouldn't be a crime until they started shooting.\u000a\u000aDespite this astounding possibility, the CCRA already has more than 200 sponsors in the House of Representatives, and the National Rifle Association has called passing the bill its No. 1 priority. The gun lobby is making it politically dangerous to oppose this bill. We have to make clear that what's in this bill is even scarier.\u000a\u000aRepublican members of Congress have long championed the rights of states to establish their own laws that reflect local needs and concerns over national legislation -- particularly when it comes to public safety. The CCRA tramples on those rights. If for no other reason, Congress should reject this unprecedented exercise of federal power.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aIf they do not, the President should exercise his veto authority. Trump is a New Yorker -- perhaps the most famous one we have. Presumably, he understands that guns in the hands of criminals and terrorists would be bad for New York. He also states frequently that he is a strong supporter of police.\u000a\u000aIf the CCRA passes Congress, the President should align himself with law enforcement -- including, among others, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major City Chiefs Association and Prosecutors Against Gun Violence -- and veto this dangerous legislation.\u000a\u000aThe public safety we take for granted in cities like New York depends on defeating this bill.

aVThe Friday, Sept. 28th edition of Amanpour, host Christiane Amanpour will include an interview with Brigadier General Manaf Tlass. General Tlass, formerly a life-long friend of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, defected from the Syrian Republican Guard this summer. In this advance excerpt from the interview that will air today on CNN International, he speaks to Amanpour about the moment he knew he could no longer serve his president:\u000a\u000aAMANPOUR: Bashar al-Assad was your friend. Describe him. Describe his character.\u000a\u000aTLASS: This question is really embarrassing because I defected because I started to feel the feelings of a citizen.\u000a\u000aI remember very well how I defected. I cannot speak in that light. Because I remember that video that I saw when they stepped on the head of a Syrian citizen in Banias. I could no longer call Bashar al-Assad a friend. But when I told him after seeing that video, that person who stepped on the head of the Syrian citizen must be punished, ever since then I can no longer be a friend of Bashar's.\u000a\u000aHe has different qualities, he is humble.

It tracked an aircraft which did a turn back, but they were not exactly sure whether it was MH370. What they were sure of was that the aircraft was not deemed to be hostile.\u000a\u000aQUEST: Where they tracking it on the night, at the time it was flying? Or is that an expo facto, when they went back and looked at it?\u000a\u000aPM NAJIB: There were, I believe there was a man who was monitoring the radar screen but the interpretation was done after the event.\u000a\u000aQUEST: So, no planes were sent up on the night to investigate?\u000a\u000aPM NAJIB: No because, simply, it was deemed not to be hostile.\u000a\u000aQUEST: Don\u2019t you find that troubling that a civil aircraft can turn back, fly across the country and nobody thinks to go up and have a look? Because one of two things \u2013 I understand the threat level \u2013 either the plane is in trouble and needs help or it\u2019s nefarious and you really want to know what someone going up there to do. So, as the prime minister, don\u2019t you find that troubling?\u000a\u000aPM NAJIB: You see I\u2019m coming back to my earlier statement \u2013 they were not sure whether it was MH370.\u000a\u000aQUEST: Even more reason to go have a look.\u000a\u000aPM NAJIB: They were not sure. But it behaved like a commercial airline following a normal flight path.\u000a\u000aON WHETHER THE PLANE AND PASSENGERS ARE LOST\u000a\u000aPM NAJIB: At some point in time I would be, but right now I think I need to take into account the feelings of the next of kin - and some of them have said publicly that they aren't willing to accept it until they find hard evidence.\u000a\u000aVIDEO:\u000a\u000aPART 1: http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2014/04/24/mh370-malaysia-pm-najib-razak-quest-intv.cnn.html\u000a\u000aPART 2: http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2014/04/24/mh370-malaysia-prime-minister-najib-razak-quest-part-2.cnn.html FULL POST

aVChinese billionaire Wang Jianlin is fighting back against talk that his sprawling business empire is in trouble.\u000a\u000aWang's Dalian Wanda Group is one of China's biggest conglomerates, with several international acquisitions under its belt. Less than a year ago, Wang was promising to become the world leader in real estate, tourism, entertainment and sports.\u000a\u000aNow he's on the defensive. Last week Dalian Wanda sold several theme parks and dozens of hotels for $9.3 billion, marking the end of Wang's dream to defeat Disney (DIS) in China. The billionaire said the deal would reduce his company's debt burden.\u000a\u000aIt followed several reports that Beijing regulators were investigating some of Wanda's overseas deals for breaching investment rules, and that they had warned state banks not to lend to the company.\u000a\u000aWanda has not responded to CNNMoney's requests for comment on these reports, and the Chinese government has declined to comment.\u000a\u000aBut Wang used a speech in Beijing on Wednesday to defend the heart of his real estate business, Wanda Commercial Properties.\u000a\u000a"Many people are concerned about the liabilities of Wanda Commercial. However, while most of them care about it out of real concern, a few spread rumors and attempt to make trouble," he said.\u000a\u000aRelated: China's richest man gives up on plans to beat Disney\u000a\u000aWanda Commercial had decided to pay off most of its bank loans, Wang said, adding it has cash of more than $25 billion and for-sale properties on its books worth $19 billion.\u000a\u000a"It is projected that, in terms of rent, Wanda Commercial will enjoy an average annual growth rate of approximately 20% over the coming five years. Is Wanda Commercial running a good business? You can make your own judgment," Wang added.\u000a\u000aBut uncertainty about the conglomerate has spooked investors in other Wanda companies. Shares in Wanda Film Holdings were suspended earlier this month due to "major events" and haven't traded since.\u000a\u000aAnd after its shares plunged 10% this week, American movie theater chain AMC Entertainment, (AMC) which is controlled by Wanda, issued a statement saying it does not depend on financing from its parent company.\u000a\u000a"Dalian Wanda has never been a source of acquisition funding for AMC," the company said. AMC has also "never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose, including for acquisitions."\u000a\u000aWanda's global expansion had stalled earlier this year. In March, a $1 billion deal to buy Dick Clark Productions was terminated after Wanda "failed to honor its contractual obligations," the production company's owner Eldridge Industries said.\u000a\u000aRelated: China's richest man still wants to buy a Hollywood studio\u000a\u000aWang's remarks came at an event to announce an abrupt reworking of the deal to offload Wanda's theme parks and 76 hotels to Sunac Holdings, one of China's top real estate firms.\u000a\u000aUnder the new terms, Wanda is selling the hotel portfolio (now 77 in total) to R&F Properties for $2.9 billion. Sunac will still buy the theme parks and has already made a down payment, the companies said.\u000a\u000aWanda said the "object and total amount of the transaction are basically the same" as the original deal.\u000a\u000aBut the hasty new agreement has raised more questions about Wanda's finances.\u000a\u000aRelated: Billionaire: Chinese real estates is the 'biggest bubble in history'\u000a\u000aIn the original agreement, Wanda Commercial was going to lend Sunac billions of dollars to help it finance the purchase, according to a public filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange.\u000a\u000aUnder the new structure, Sunac no longer needs the loan, so Wanda will receive more cash from the deal.\u000a\u000a"From a cash flow perspective it's a bit better for Dalian Wanda," said Franco Leung, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aMoody's has a negative outlook on Wanda Commercial's credit rating, which it downgraded earlier this year. The negative outlook means the agency could further lower the company's rating in the medium term.\u000a\u000a"The company is still having relatively high debt leverage, and that's why we have a negative ratings outlook," said Leung.\u000a\u000aWang has seen his fortune shrink amid the turmoil.\u000a\u000aThe billionaire was China's richest man, according to the most recent annual rankings, with an estimated net worth of around $30 billion. Based on current estimates, he's falling behind tech tycoons Jack Ma of Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) and "Pony" Ma Huateng of Tencent (TCEHY).

aVWith so many social networks to keep track of, it's not surprising if you haven't heard of an app called Sarahah, which has millions of users and a teen fanbase. So what is Sarahah exactly?\u000a\u000aSarahah is a free social media app that lets you receive comments from friends and strangers anonymously. You can also comment on friends' and strangers' profiles without them knowing it's you.\u000a\u000aThe app's name means "honesty," roughly, in Arabic, and was supposedly designed to allow employees to share feedback with each other anonymously. With a way to connect the app to Snapchat, teens have taken to the platform and it now has millions of users and has risen to the top of the App Store in several countries\u000a\u000aRead Common Sense Media's full review of Sarahah , and help your kids use it safely -- if at all -- with answers to parents' most frequently asked questions below.\u000a\u000aWhat is Sarahah?\u000a\u000aSarahah is an anonymous feedback app that teens are using to pass anonymous digital notes to each other. The app lets you create a profile and works as an add-on to popular social networking app, Snapchat.\u000a\u000aDrawing upon the contact list on your phone, it lets you connect with friends and send anonymous comments to them. It also lets you search for users and send anonymous messages to them as well, even if you don't know them.\u000a\u000aHow safe is Sarahah?\u000a\u000aUsers can choose not to have their name or profile picture appear in the app's search or receive messages from unregistered users, but they must opt out to make this happen. If they don't, the name and photo they use to register will appear if other users search for them.\u000a\u000aHow does Sarahah work?\u000a\u000aSarahah is a very simple app. Once you register with a username and password, you can share your profile link on any social platforms and ask that people use the link to give you feedback. People can type anything anonymously and it will be delivered to you through the app or site. You can also give feedback on others. You can find people to comment on by using the search function or a direct link.\u000a\u000aIs Sarahah appropriate for kids?\u000a\u000aSarahah is easy to use, so kids won't have any trouble figuring out how to operate the app. But because all comments are anonymous, it&'s very easy for people to say mean and hurtful things without any repercussions. Reviews on the App Store indicate that Sarahah is being used as a cyberbullying tool. For these reasons, Sarahah is not appropriate for kids.\u000a\u000aWhat age is Sarahah recommended for?\u000a\u000aSarahah is not recommended for kids. Both Common Sense and the App Store rate it for age 17 and up.\u000a\u000aHow are Sarahah and Snapchat related?\u000a\u000aSnapchat users can link Sarahah to their accounts so that they can share screenshots of comments they receive through Sarahah with their Snapchat friends. Users might want to share particularly nice, mean, or funny messages.\u000a\u000aHow can I protect my privacy on Sarahah?\u000a\u000aIf kids decide to use Sarahah, they should use the settings to opt out of their name or profile photo appearing in search. They should also opt out of allowing unregistered Sarahah users comment on their accounts as a further line of defense. They should also consider only sharing their profile link with specific people, though they can't be sure that those people won't share the link with others.\u000a\u000aWhat if my kid wants to use Sarahah?\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIf your kid wants to use Sarahah, talk with them about why. Discuss the downsides of anonymous apps including how some people feel like they can be meaner behind a screen, and especially when they won't face any repercussions.\u000a\u000aTalk about how they can participate in activities with their friends -- including using certain apps and games -- while still avoiding unnecessary drama. Also, come up with some strategies together for how to handle online insults or abuse.

aVBeijing (CNN) The global outpouring of grief and anguish over Liu Xiaobo's death stands in marked contrast to the muted reaction in his homeland.\u000a\u000aThe Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer and human rights activist died Thursday evening of liver cancer while in custody at a hospital in Shenyang in northeastern China. He was 61.\u000a\u000aLiu's funeral was held Saturday morning in Shenyang and attended by his "family members and close friends," according to a city government spokesman. Liu's body had been cremated, and his ashes had been dropped into the sea in a private ceremony, he said.\u000a\u000a"The authorities can't afford to see Liu's grave turn into a landmark and symbol where people gather to pay tribute," said Hu Jia, a leading Chinese human rights activist who has known Liu's wife for years and has served prison terms for his own advocacy. "They want to erase all traces of him."\u000a\u000a"But three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered by water," he added. "His grave is now everywhere."\u000a\u000aIn a government-organized news conference, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother -- who Liu's supporters say had never approved his activism -- on Saturday afternoon expressed the family's "profuse gratitude" to the state for showing "humanity" in providing medical treatment and arranging "perfect" funeral services for Liu. He left without taking questions.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese government, which had long banned Liu's work and even his name, continues to censor the story of his death, deleting social media posts mourning him -- including those simply displaying the image of a burning candle -- and blocking online searches containing variations of his name and famed quotes.\u000a\u000aCNN's broadcast is blacked out in China every time Liu's images or story appear.\u000a\u000aA poster of Liu Xiaobo is held up during a protest in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aDomestic media outlets, all controlled by the ruling Communist Party, mostly have ignored the news. Dominating Friday's front page of the party mouthpiece, People's Daily, was a photo of a beaming President Xi Jinping meeting his Canadian counterpart.\u000a\u000aA few English-language outlets carried short reports on Liu's death, highlighting his "criminal" background and Chinese doctors' effort to save him.\u000a\u000a'Inciting subversion'\u000a\u000aBefore he was granted medical parole last month, Liu had been serving a 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion of state power." His conviction in late 2009 stemmed from his co-authorship of a manifesto calling for human rights and political reform in China.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, while he was in prison, the Nobel committee awarded Liu the peace prize for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" -- a move that infuriated Beijing.\u000a\u000aIn a harshly worded, English-language editorial published Friday by the nationalistic tabloid, The Global Times, the state-run newspaper painted Liu as "a victim led astray by West."\u000a\u000a"Liu lived in an era when China witnessed the most rapid growth in recent history, but he attempted to confront Chinese mainstream society under Western support," it said. "This has determined his tragic life."\u000a\u000a"The West has bestowed upon Liu a halo, which will not linger," it added.\u000a\u000aA protester holds up a picture of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo on June 30, 2017, in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aThe newspaper had posted a since-deleted message in Chinese on Sina Weibo, a platform similar to Twitter, mocking the international reactions to Liu's death: "The person's gone but a blockbuster tear-jerker is just on -- we'll sit back and enjoy the show."\u000a\u000a'Improper comments'\u000a\u000aAmid an avalanche of condolences and condemnations from politicians and activists around the world, the Chinese government took the unusual step of issuing a statement shortly after 2 a.m. Friday to respond to what it called "improper comments" by foreign officials.\u000a\u000a"The handling of Liu Xiaobo's case belongs to China's domestic affairs, and foreign countries are in no position to make improper remarks," said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. "We call on relevant countries to respect China's judicial sovereignty and not to meddle in China's domestic affairs with this individual case."\u000a\u000aThe statement was sent directly to foreign journalists and was nowhere to be found on the ministry's website -- just like all previous official responses to questions about Liu.\u000a\u000aChina has conveyed its "strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" to all governments and international entities that commented on Liu's death, including the United States and the United Nations' human rights commission, Geng said at a regular news briefing Friday afternoon.\u000a\u000aChina's warning seems to have gone unheeded, with even the US President -- not known as a public champion of human rights activists -- expressing his sorrow over Liu's death and calling him a "political prisoner" in a statement.\u000a\u000aEchoing myriad other world leaders, Donald Trump made a point of mentioning Liu Xia, a poet and artist who married Liu Xiaobo in 1996 while he was serving an earlier prison sentence.\u000a\u000aLiu Xiaobo has become an icon of the democracy movement in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aAs her husband remained behind bars until recently, Liu Xia, 56, paid a heavy price for simply being his wife. Under de facto house arrest since his Nobel win, Liu Xia saw her communication with the outside world almost completely cut by the government.\u000a\u000aShe has been suffering severe depression, according to close friends, especially after authorities sentenced her brother to 11 years in prison over what supporters call trumped-up charges of business fraud.\u000a\u000aStruggle continues\u000a\u000aNow, Liu Xia is increasingly the focus of an international campaign calling for her freedom and right to live abroad, which many friends and supporters say were her husband's dying wishes.\u000a\u000a"He loved her so much that he felt he owed it to her," said Liao Yiwu, a prominent Chinese writer and longtime friend of the Lius who now lives in Germany.\u000a\u000a"He didn't know about her condition and what had happened at home until not that long ago," Liao said. "That's why he agreed to go abroad with her."\u000a\u000aIn a hastily arranged news conference in Shenyang after his death, Liu Xiaobo's Chinese doctors acknowledged for the first time that he had sought treatment overseas but insisted that his medical condition by then had made international travel impossible.\u000a\u000aThey confirmed that Liu Xia was by her husband's bedside when he died -- and his last words urged her to "live a good life."\u000a\u000aDespite worldwide solidarity behind Liu Xia, many supporters sense the Chinese government's fear of her turning into an international symbol and rallying cry for human rights. They foresee an uphill battle for her ahead.\u000a\u000a"Few knew Liu Xiaobo's thoughts in the last eight years, but she did, and they talked during his last days," said Hu, the Chinese activist. "I think the authorities are afraid of seeing even the simplest last words from him get out and spread."\u000a\u000aGeng, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, repeatedly declined to say Friday whether the government would allow Liu Xia to leave China, insisting that Beijing would handle her case "in accordance with law."\u000a\u000a"Liu Xia is free," the Shenyang city government spokesman said Saturday, but needs privacy to mourn her painful loss.\u000a\u000aIn government handout photos of her husband's funeral, a grief-stricken Liu Xia, wearing all black and sunglasses, can be seen bowing to the open casket and holding a portrait of Liu Xiaobo.\u000a\u000aThe authorities later released videos that they said proved Liu Xia's consent to the burial arrangement. One clip purportedly shows a handwritten note by Liu Xia on Thursday requesting a private sea burial, while the other appears to be a hidden-camera recording of her saying the same thing.\u000a\u000aIn a brief appearance before reporters, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother said Liu Xia was unable to join him due to her "extremely weak condition" that may require medical attention. He did not respond to shouted questions about her whereabouts amid growing international concern over her freedom and welfare.\u000a\u000aAcross the closely monitored cyberspace in China, some internet users have evaded censors to post lines from Liu Xia's poems that were dedicated to her late husband -- including verses from "Wind": "Walls make you suffocate / you are the wind, and the wind / never tells me / when it comes and when it goes."

aVPresident Trump's trade team didn't mince words on the first day of trade talks with Canada and Mexico.\u000a\u000aLeaders from the U.S., Canada and Mexico on Wednesday officially began renegotiating NAFTA, the three-nation trade pact, in Washington.\u000a\u000aMexican and Canadian leaders started a press conference on a positive note, touting the advantages of NAFTA and saying the new agreement must work for all three nations.\u000a\u000aThen, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke. He noted that NAFTA has benefited many Americans, such as farmers, and said the U.S., Canada and Mexico have a strong friendship.\u000a\u000aRelated: Renegotiating NAFTA -- in 14 easy steps\u000a\u000aBut he soon tore into NAFTA, Trump-style.\u000a\u000a"For countless Americans, this agreement has failed," Lighthizer said. "We cannot ignore the huge trade deficits, the lost manufacturing jobs, the businesses that have closed or moved because of incentives, intended or not, in the current agreement."\u000a\u000aLighthizer said at least 700,000 American jobs have been lost due to NAFTA. He added "many people believe the number is much, much bigger than that."\u000a\u000aThe stakes of renegotiation are high. Millions of jobs and thousands of companies rely on NAFTA. American consumers benefit immensely from free trade while factory workers say they've gotten the short end of the deal, with their jobs outsourced to Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe threat facing the pact is real, too. Trump says if the U.S. can't get a better deal, he'll withdraw from NAFTA. He's also threatened to slap tariffs on Mexico, and he's already slapped some on Canada. They have in turn cautioned that they'll retaliate against any U.S. tariffs.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump's NAFTA could be a big win for Amazon\u000a\u000aMexican and Canadian leaders framed their desires around "modernizing" NAFTA to reflect more of today's global economy, including guidelines for e-commerce, which isn't included in the 23-year-old deal.\u000a\u000a"The issue is not tearing apart what works, but rather making our agreement work better," Mexico's economy secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said on Wednesday.\u000a\u000a"We want to protect NAFTA's record of job creation and economic growth," Canada's foreign minister Chrystia Freeland said. Freeland also delivered remarks in Spanish, which appeared to be a gesture of goodwill toward Mexico.\u000a\u000aNegotiations will begin with what isn't in NAFTA already -- digital trade, protection of intellectual property and energy trade, among other topics.\u000a\u000aLeaders admitted that's the easy part. "After modernizing, the tough work begins," Lighthizer said.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump's objectives for NAFTA\u000a\u000aFuture rounds of negotiations will take place in Mexico and Canada over coming months.\u000a\u000aThorny issues surround several topics, including where and how car companies manufacture vehicles. Trump's team sees this as an area where they can reshape NAFTA to create more factory jobs.\u000a\u000aRight now, 62% of the parts of a car sold in North America have to come from the region. U.S. officials will likely aim to raise that level, though it's unclear how much.\u000a\u000aBut experts caution if companies have to produce more parts in the U.S., it will likely cause American consumers to pay higher prices on cars, clothing and other goods.\u000a\u000a"It sounds difficult to achieve both things, something has to give," says Marcelo Carvalho, head of emerging markets research at BNP Paribas.\u000a\u000aAnother challenge facing the negotiators: Time. Mexico has a presidential election next year and the front runner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is a major critic of Trump. Current Mexican officials warn that NAFTA talks need to end before Mexico's election season starts next spring because it will be very hard to ratify a deal in that political environment.\u000a\u000aRelated: Spurned by Trump, China and Mexico talk up possible trade deal\u000a\u000aAnd Lighthizer noted that Trump isn't interested in "tweaking" NAFTA. They want a "major improvement."\u000a\u000aExperts say the administration will be challenged to get a truly new deal done before the spring.\u000a\u000a"I'm skeptical that you can fundamentally rewrite the agreement in six to eight months," says Matthew Rooney, economic growth director at the Bush Institute in Texas.\u000a\u000aAs talks get underway, one lingering question hangs over the three nations.\u000a\u000a"If they can't get an agreement, does President Trump get rid of it entirely?" said Lori Wallach, global trade watch director at Public Citizen, a non-profit. "It depends on the will of the parties."

aV(CNN) While "The Big Bang Theory" producer Chuck Lorre clearly felt liberated plying his trade for Netflix, the resulting stoner comedy, "Disjointed," runs on fumes. Kathy Bates stars as the proprietor of "Southern California's finest and friendliest marijuana dispensary," but there's not enough weed in the Golden State to wring consistent laughs from a show that's mostly as stale as an unwashed bong.\u000a\u000aLike "The Ranch," "Disjointed" brings the style of a traditional multi-camera comedy to the streaming service, complete with studio-audience laughter. But the writers also play with those conventions, such as incorporating commercial spoofs for pot-themed products, which is probably the cleverest recurring bit the show has to offer.\u000a\u000aOther than that, "Disjointed" puffs out a series of tired gags about Bates' earth goddess, Ruth, and her stoned-out staff of "budtenders" -- a stock assortment of characters except for one emotionally deeper thread regarding the security guard Carter (Tone Bell), a war veteran. The show veers back to more familiar terrain with the prickly relationship between Bates' free spirit and her MBA son Travis (Aaron Moten), who has his own ongoing flirtation with a coworker (Elizabeth Alderfer). (There are jokes about Travis's dad being an African-American, the only reason to note that wrinkle.)\u000a\u000a" allowfullscreen>\u000a\u000aInevitably, a few funny lines emerge amid the banter, such as one character telling another, "You'll be happy to know that you're a stereotype." But there's simply not enough inspiration to warrant sticking around after inhaling a four-episode sampling of the 20 half-hours ordered.\u000a\u000aTV's increasingly casual attitude toward pot can be seen in a number of reality shows devoted to the business of medicinal marijuana, as well as its use within premium series. Relaxed laws in various U.S. states are indicative of how far public opinion has moved since the "Reefer Madness" era, with clips from vintage pot-as-devil-weed fare cheekily featured in the opening credits.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVWe can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out.\u000a\u000aThis article is from the archive of our partner . We can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out. After the Times ran a column giving employers tips on how to deal with Millennials (for example, they need regular naps) (I didn't read the article; that's from my experience), Slate's Amanda Hess pointed out that the examples the Times used to demonstrate their points weren't actually Millennials. Some of the people quoted in the article were as old as 37, which was considered elderly only 5,000 short years ago. The age of employees of The Wire, the humble website you are currently reading, varies widely, meaning that we too have in the past wondered where the boundaries for the various generations were drawn. Is a 37-year-old who gets text-message condolences from her friends a Millennial by virtue of her behavior? Or is she some other generation, because she was born super long ago? (Sorry, 37-year-old Rebecca Soffer who is a friend of a friend of mine and who I met once! You're not actually that old!) Since The Wire is committed to Broadening Human Understanding\u2122, I decided to find out where generational boundaries are drawn.\u000a\u000aI started by calling the Census Bureau. A representative called me back, without much information. "We do not define the different generations," she told me. "The only generation we do define is Baby Boomers and that year bracket is from 1946 to 1964." Next, I spoke with Tom DiPrete, a sociology professor at Columbia University. And he agreed with the Census Bureau. "I think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media," DiPrete said, "and the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation." DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation. It "had specific characteristics," and occurred within an observable timeframe. World War II ended. You had the post-war rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family. Then societal changes disrupted those patterns, and the generation, for academic purposes, was over. His main point: "History isn't always so punctuated." I understood why Generation X, a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty, would be poorly defined. But what about Millennials? Doesn't their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers? "I actually haven't seen efforts to document [generations] rigorously, and I would be somewhat skeptical that they can be documented rigorously." DiPrete said. The things that have shaped Millennials \u2014 the rise of technology and social networks, for example \u2014 "affect people's lives differently."

aVThursday marks 34 years to the day since former France international Jean-Pierre Adams entered into a coma following a botched operation on his knee. His story is being republished to take into account the anniversary of his operation and his 68th birthday, meaning he has now spent half his life in a coma. The article was first published on 4 January.\u000a\u000aNimes, France (CNN) What present do you buy a man who has been in a coma for more than 30 years?\u000a\u000aThat's the question the family of former France international Jean-Pierre Adams, whose life was brutally turned upside down in 1982, asks itself every year on key anniversaries.\u000a\u000aThirty-four years ago the beefy footballer, then 34, walked into a Lyon hospital for some routine surgery to correct a troublesome knee.\u000a\u000aBy the time he left, he would never talk, walk or move any of his limbs again.\u000a\u000aHis wife Bernadette has tended to him ever since, barely missing a day's care over the last three decades.\u000a\u000a"No one ever forgets to give Jean-Pierre presents, whether it's his birthday, Christmas or Father's Day," Bernadette told CNN.\u000a\u000aThe 68-year-old can breathe on his own, without the assistance of a machine, and has his own room, where he spends most of the day in the type of modified bed normally found in a hospital.\u000a\u000a"We buy presents like a T-shirt or a jumper because I dress him in his bed -- he changes clothes every day," his wife explains at the family home near Nîmes, in the south of France, where Bernadette cares for Jean-Pierre.\u000a\u000a"I'll buy things so that he can have a nice room, such as pretty sheets, or some scent. He used to wear Paco Rabanne but his favorite one stopped so now I buy Sauvage by Dior."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Jean-Pierre and Bernadette Adams: A love like no other Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jean-Pierre and Bernadette Adams: A love like no other 03:13\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's disastrous surgery reduced a flamboyant character, who had risen from humble beginnings in Senegal, to one who has been in a persistent vegetative state ever since.\u000a\u000aA France international player in the 1970s, Jean-Pierre is now incapable of nearly all voluntary movement but can digest food as well as open and close his eyes.\u000a\u000aBernadette looks after her husband with an unfailing love -- dressing, feeding and bathing him, turning him over in his bed to avoid sores, and often losing her own sleep to ensure he gets his.\u000a\u000aIt's a measure of their bond that on the rare occasions Bernadette spends a night away from home, Jean-Pierre's carers notice his mood seems to change.\u000a\u000a"He senses that it is not me feeding him and looking after him," says his wife of 47 years. "It's the nurses who tell me, saying he is not the same.\u000a\u000a"I think he feels things. He must recognize the sound of my voice as well."\u000a\u000aThe period of enlightenment\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre and Bernadette may have been born in Senegal and France respectively, but their lives started to converge in the mid-1950s.\u000a\u000aThat was when Jean-Pierre's grandmother took him to Europe on a religious pilgrimage, enrolling the 10-year-old at a school in France as she did so.\u000a\u000aSoon adopted by a local French couple, his African existence rapidly started to disappear behind him.\u000a\u000aIt was in the late 1960s, that Jean-Pierre, then an amateur footballer, met Bernadette at a dance.\u000a\u000aIt was a time of change, with the uprising of May 1968 heralding a new era as students and workers altered France's cultural outlook as they challenged the conservative nature of General de Gaulle's government.\u000a\u000a"I can't hide the fact that it was very difficult for my family at the beginning," Bernadette recalls, reflecting on the challenges they faced as a mixed race couple.\u000a\u000a"At the time, a black man and a white woman being together wasn't well-regarded.\u000a\u000a"But we began to live together and then decided to marry. I wrote to my parents giving the news, the wedding date and an invitation, and my mother invited us to dinner.\u000a\u000a"After that, everything was fine and he was seen in a better light than me: 'Jean-Pierre, Jean-Pierre' -- they only spoke of Jean-Pierre!"\u000a\u000aThe couple first lived just south of Paris -- in Fontainebleu -- where Adams was helping the local side win its amateur championship, but shortly after their 1969 marriage, they moved to Nîmes as Jean-Pierre signed for the city's then first division side.\u000a\u000aWithin two years, not only had Nîmes finished runners-up but Jean-Pierre was playing for France -- one of the first black players to do so.\u000a\u000a"He was a force of nature, very strong physically, and he had great determination and willingness," Henri Michel, who played in Adams' first competitive France international in 1972, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"He was formidable, very patriotic and it was a pleasure to play with him," added a man who coached France at the 1986 World Cup. "He started as a forward but then played at the back."\u000a\u000aThere, Adams formed a central defensive partnership known as the "Garde Noire" -- "Black Guard" -- alongside Marius Trésor, a player the Brazilian Pele named, in 2004, among his 125 greatest living footballers.\u000a\u000a"Adams and Trésor have formed one of the best central defensive pairings in all of Europe," no less a figure than German World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer told French football magazine "Onze" at the time.\u000a\u000aArguably, along with previous black internationals like Larbi Ben Barek and Lucien Cossou, the "Garde Noire" helped pave the way for France's 1998 World Cup success. Key players such as Patrick Vieira, Marcel Desailly and Lilian Thuram were born in Senegal, Ghana and Guadeloupe respectively.\u000a\u000aIn total, Jean-Pierre won 22 caps and also played for Paris Saint-Germain and Nice, narrowly failing to win the French title with the latter (again), while also knocking Barcelona out of the 1973-4 UEFA Cup.\u000a\u000aLife was just good off the pitch.\u000a\u000aWith a love of music -- particularly from Brazil -- and a taste for cigars, clothing and bling, Jean-Pierre fully enjoyed 1970s life with Bernadette.\u000a\u000a"He was the 'joie de vivre' embodied in human form -- a laugher and joker who liked to go out," says Bernadette, who is dressed in an à la mode Desigual T-shirt and spotless white trousers on the day we met. "Really, a smile was always bursting out. He loved the good life and was loved by everybody as well."\u000a\u000aAs his career faded, dropping down the divisions, Adams decided he wanted to coach youths and one March day in 1982, he headed off to Dijon for three days of studying and training.\u000a\u000aHe damaged a tendon in his leg while there -- an innocuous injury that would ultimately cast a huge shadow over the Adams family.\u000a\u000aThe 'perfect storm'\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre traveled to the Édouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon for his X-ray.\u000a\u000a"From there, he was to come home," recalls Bernadette. "But he was walking along a corridor in the hospital -- where he knew no one -- when a doctor who knew all about football, since he looked after the Lyon team, walked past."\u000a\u000aStopping to talk, the doctor instantly offered to help and after an instant consultation, he decided upon surgery and booked Jean-Pierre in for an appointment: Wednesday 17 March 1982.\u000a\u000aWhen the date came around, there was a problem. The hospital staff were on strike.\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's case was far from urgent -- he could have soldiered on for a bit -- but the surgery went ahead nonetheless.\u000a\u000a"The female anesthetist was looking after eight patients, one after the other, like an assembly line," says Bernadette.\u000a\u000a"Jean-Pierre was supervised by a trainee, who was repeating a year, who later admitted in court: 'I was not up to the task I was entrusted with.'\u000a\u000a"Given it was not a vital operation, that the hospital was on strike, they were missing doctors and this woman was looking after eight patients, in two different rooms, someone should have called me to say they were going to delay the operation."\u000a\u000aThey never did -- and between the anesthetist and trainee, numerous errors were made.\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre was badly intubated, with one tube blocking the pathway to his lungs rather than ventilating them, meaning he was starved of oxygen whereupon he suffered a cardiac arrest.\u000a\u000a"I found him lying on a bed, tubes everywhere," she remembers after rushing to the hospital. "I didn't leave the hospital for five days. I thought he was going to wake up and that I needed to be there."\u000a\u000aWhen she felt fresh air again, the world had become a very different place.\u000a\u000aLife now\u000a\u000aAfter 15 months in hospital, local authorities suggested to Bernadette that the best place for her husband would be a nearby home for the elderly.\u000a\u000a"I don't think they knew how to look after him, so I said to myself: 'He will come home' and I've looked after him ever since," says Bernadette.\u000a\u000aEvery day, she wakes just before seven o'clock and has her breakfast -- precious minutes spent alone -- as she readies herself to care for her husband.\u000a\u000aIt's a mix of changing clothes, shaving, preparing food -- all of it blended -- and delivering it, which can take an hour, helping Jean-Pierre go to the toilet, while also helping the kinesiologist ensure his lungs are clean and his muscles exercised to avoid choking and atrophying.\u000a\u000aIf she is lucky her day finishes at eight, when Jean-Pierre might go to sleep.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes when the night goes badly, I'm up for the whole thing."\u000a\u000aThe round-the-clock care leaves little time to earn a living, but thankfully for the stoic Bernadette, she receives an annuity after a court ruled in her favor -- albeit after a decade-long legal battle.\u000a\u000a"The process lasted nearly 12 years. I think it's designed to discourage people," she ventures. "If I hadn't had the support of football, I would have been completely broke."\u000a\u000aThe French league, football federation and the Variety Club of France -- a club for former France internationals -- all rallied together to help with her legal fees.\u000a\u000aAlthough the accident occurred in 1982, it wasn't until 1989 that the medical staff were found guilty of 'involuntary injury' --- and even then, it still needed nearly five more years to decide the family's dues.\u000a\u000a"We've played five or six games over the years because we knew that Bernadette was in financial and psychological difficulty," Jacques Vendroux, the general manager of the Variety Club of France, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"Jean-Pierre was someone very appealing and deserved help. He is still alive and that is amazing."\u000a\u000aHe's also made to feel as much part of family life as possible, with his room adjoining the house's focal point, the kitchen-cum-living room.\u000a\u000a"I talk to him all the time -- about TV, what's in the mail, anything!" Bernadette says. "There is always movement around him. He is always next to us."\u000a\u000aWhen I ask whether she ever imagines conversations the pair might have had, the 72-year-old Bernadette momentarily chokes up -- a brief insight into the true cost of the accident for a proud and serene woman.\u000a\u000a"I don't know," she replied. "It's difficult to say. I say he doesn't understand my words but there might be moments when he has a flash. Perhaps for an instant, just an instant, he understands something."\u000a\u000aIt's unlikely though.\u000a\u000aGray hairs\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's brain was so starved of oxygen he suffered catastrophic brain damage, making the prospect of recovery very slim.\u000a\u000a"The more time that passes, the more bothered I get," she says. "His condition does not get any worse, so who knows? If one day, medical science evolves, then why not? Will there be a day when they'll know how to do something for him? I don't know."\u000a\u000aWhile she relentlessly hopes there is, she continues to preserve both his legacy and dignity.\u000a\u000aShe told me long before our meeting that no pictures of Jean-Pierre would be allowed and when I asked if I could photograph the entrance to his room, the answer was Bernadette pushing the door shut -- gently but firmly.\u000a\u000aBut she happily introduces me to Jean-Pierre, who turned 68 on 10 March, but he still looks very youthful -- with just a light sprinkle of gray hairs. He was sleeping, I was told, even though his eyes were open.\u000a\u000aOn his bed was a bright bedspread, a present from many years back, and in the corner a small TV.\u000a\u000aAt one point after he had woken up, Bernadette briefly left the room.\u000a\u000aI stood there awkwardly -- all notions of explaining how I once lived in Senegal pushed to one side as such inane conversation seemed so glib I fell into silence instead.\u000a\u000aWith Jean-Pierre's eyes unable to follow, I felt invisible and, given his situation, both sad and angry.\u000a\u000a"The hospital has never apologized," Bernadette had said just minutes earlier.\u000a\u000aFuture conditional\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's wife is troubled at present. By the future.\u000a\u000a"Imagine if I die before him, then what would become of him?" she asks.\u000a\u000a"He'll die without being looked after. He needs me to be able to eat, to meet his primary needs. If I don't do it, who will?"\u000a\u000aWhen I ask whether her sons -- Laurent and Frédéric, who were 11 and four respectively at the time of the accident -- could help, she revealed that she was desperate to spare them such a fate.\u000a\u000aHad she ever considered euthanasia for Jean-Pierre?\u000a\u000a"What do you want me to do -- deprive him of food? Let him die little by little? No, no, no," she railed.\u000a\u000aThirty-three years ago as Bernadette drove to Lyon that was also a question that haunted her, terrified she would be asked to agree to switch off the life support machine Jean-Pierre was then on.\u000a\u000a"I try not to think about the accident every day but I have no choice," says Bernadette, who is now a grandmother of three. "Every time I look at him, it is present in my head."\u000a\u000aIn the mid 1990s, when the court adjudicated on the case, both the anesthetist and trainee were given what would appear to be relatively light punishments: a one-month suspended sentence and a fine that translates to some 750 Euros ($815) today.\u000a\u000aDecades on, the Adams family are still paying a far heavier price.

aVPresident Trump's news conference left many shocked while leaving late night hosts, such as ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, ready to respond -- even if they had other things planned.\u000a\u000a"We had so much fun stuff planned for you tonight, we worked on it all day," Kimmel told his "Jimmy Kimmel Live" audience on Tuesday. "Then he opened his mouth and all manner of stupid came out."\u000a\u000aKimmel was referring to Trump's news conference on Tuesday in which the president spoke about the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and equated white supremacists on one side with what he called the "alt-left" on the other.\u000a\u000a"And I'm not joking when I say I would feel more comfortable if Cersei Lannister was running this country," Kimmel said, referring to the "Game of Thrones" character. "It started as a press conference about infrastructure, and ended with our president making an angry and passionate defense of white supremacists. It was like if your book club meeting turned into a cockfight. It really was remarkable."\u000a\u000aKimmel added that with "reasonable certainty" the president "is completely unhinged."\u000a\u000a"The wheels are off the wagon and hurtling towards the moon right now," he said.\u000a\u000aOther late show hosts like CBS' Stephen Colbert shared Kimmel's sentiment\u000a\u000a"He held a press conference today in, I believe, the seventh circle of Hell," Colbert said while opening his show.\u000a\u000aThe "Late Show" host noted that during the press conference Trump said that the reason he waited two days to properly respond to the violence was because he needed the facts.\u000a\u000a"I wait for the facts, okay?" Colbert said, impersonating Trump. "Just ask the millions of illegal voters who refused to look for Obama's birth certificate during my record breaking inauguration, okay? It's all on the Obama wiretaps."\u000a\u000aTONIGHT: It took two days for Trump to condemn the racist hate groups in Charlottesville... and one press conference to empower them. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/GCFVNE3SYo \u2014 The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) August 16, 2017\u000a\u000aNBC's Seth Meyers also chimed in about Trump's press conference with a segment called "Breaking Crazy."\u000a\u000a"President Trump this afternoon gave a press conference that can only be described as clinically insane," Meyers said in a clip from Tuesday's broadcast. "You know that list of side effects at the end of a pharmaceutical ad? He apparently has all of them."\u000a\u000aMeyers showed clips from the press conference and seemed beyond bewildered by what the president was saying.\u000a\u000a"Usually when someone is talking that level of crazy, Batman crashes through the ceiling and punches him," the "Late Night" host remarked.\u000a\u000aThe host then described Trump as a "bad waitress in a crappy diner who is trying to get fired so she can go to a concert."\u000a\u000a"Congress, isn't this enough? Cut bait on the president," Meyers said. "It's time to let this crazy bitch go to the concert."

aVHannah Seligson, CNN \u2022 Updated 14th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 While the shuttered storefronts around downtown indicate an economy still very much in recovery, make no mistake that Athens, the Greek capital, has a vibrant and fighting spirit.\u000a\u000aDespite everything the country has been through since 2008, there are new restaurants, stores, cultural institutions and a strong artistic presence. One big coup: Documenta, the longstanding European contemporary art fair, held its first expansion of the exhibit outside of Germany in Athens from April to July.\u000a\u000aOn many fronts, Greece is mining -- and reviving -- its long, rich history to build on traditions of innovation, creativity, and culinary ingenuity. This is to say that Athens isn't a place to just pass through on your way to the islands. Stay a few days to take in an ancient metropolis that should not be brushed aside because of its economic woes.\u000a\u000aHere's a brief guide, but certainly not a definitive list, of what's new and what's not to miss:\u000a\u000aBeyond spanakopita: where to eat\u000a\u000aVegetables become art at The Funky Gourmet.\u000a\u000aNolan\u000a\u000aOpened in 2015, Nolan has already received a Michelin star for the Greek-influenced Japanese cooking of Sotiris Kontizas, who was raised, appropriately, by a Greek father and a Japanese mother.\u000a\u000aBut this isn't fusion of the early aughts with lots of sauces and too many flavors. These dishes are clean and simple, mirroring the minimalist space in which Nolan is located in the city center.\u000a\u000aAn ideal meal includes these items: zucchini and eggplant salad with miso, soba noodles with smoked salmon and shrimp with rice paper.\u000a\u000aSushimou\u000a\u000aAround the corner from Nolan is the Sushi Nakazawa of Athens: in other words, the most competitive sushi reservation in town. (The bar only seats 12, and it can take four to six weeks to land a reservation.)\u000a\u000aSushimou lives up to the hype. The chef, Antonis Drakoularakos, was recently named one of the top 100 chefs in the world at the Chefs World Summit.\u000a\u000aDrakoularakos has mastered Japanese sashimi knifework and presentation to perfection while relying primarily on local Mediterranean fish -- a winning combination.\u000a\u000aHis secret weapon is that he relies on one trusted fisherman to bring him the best quality fish, which he then hand selects from daily catch. The sashimi is silky, the atmosphere relaxed, and the whole meal is a work of mouth-watering genius.\u000a\u000aThe Funky Gourmet\u000a\u000aIn an unmarked building in the artsy area of Keramikos is one of two two-Michelin star restaurants in Greece.\u000a\u000aThe decor is aesthetically intense, creating a vibe that's half speakeasy, half temple. Chefs and co-owners Georgianna Hiliadaki and Nick Roussos call their food "Modern Greek Cuisine."\u000a\u000aOver the span of four hours and 14 courses, diners enjoy dishes such as cuttlefish Oreo, sea urchin pasta, miniaturized picnic foods, picture-perfect sculpted dishes that are miniatures or reproductions of familiar items with a twist, and one of the most inventive Greek salads you'll ever eat.\u000a\u000aThe meal is for the culinarily adventurous -- one course is lamb brains -- but anyone who appreciates a good performance and beautifully conceived food will find this restaurant satisfying. The service flows like a well-conducted orchestra (145 euros per person; tasting menu only). Budget permitting, splurge for the alcohol pairings, which are almost as adventurous and varied as the food.\u000a\u000aPapadakis\u000a\u000aFor more straightforward Greek cuisine, head to Papadakis in Kolonaki, a neighborhood that resembles the 16th arrondissement in Paris or New York's Upper East Side. Located on a quiet, shady residential street on a steep hillside, this is the perfect place to get away from the crowds.\u000a\u000aStart with the stewed chickpeas and eggplant. If you're hungry, order a whole grilled fish, which can run close to 80 euros. The pastas are excellent. There's also good people-watching to be had in this refined, upscale establishment, where the posh Greek crowd starts pouring in, but only after 9:30 or 10 p.m.\u000a\u000aNolan , 33, Voulis 31, Athens 105 57, Greece, +30 21 0324 3545\u000a\u000aSushimou , Skoufou 6, Athens 105 57, Greece, +30 21 1407 8457\u000a\u000aThe Funky Gourmet, 13 Paramithias, Athens 104 35, Greece, +30 210 5242727\u000a\u000aPapadakis , Fokilidou 15, Athens 106 73, Greece, +30 21 0360 8621\u000a\u000aSleep it off\u000a\u000aThe New Hotel is a design lover's dream.\u000a\u000aHotel Grande Bretagne\u000a\u000aThe grande dame of hotels in Athens sits opposite the Parliament on Syntagma Square and has been a beacon of luxury and sophistication in the city for many years.\u000a\u000aThere are many draws to this 1842-vintage building that used to be a private mansion. Today, the 321-room hotel boasts a rooftop restaurant and bar with some of the best views of the Acropolis, a spa with three kinds of steam rooms, a sauna, a large indoor pool and a gift store called GB Corner that carries a well-curated selection of luxury items.\u000a\u000aThe rooms have high ceilings and crown moldings, but with fully modern and updated bathrooms.\u000a\u000aNext door is the Hotel Grande Bretagne's sister property, The King George, which has 102 rooms, including 39 suites, and has a more intimate feel and scale with a modern touch, but maintains the same level of elegance.\u000a\u000aNew Hotel\u000a\u000aAt this 79-room hip boutique hotel in the centrally located neighborhood of Syntagma, it's all about the design. After all, the hotel is owned by Dakis Joannou, one of the most famous art collectors in Greece.\u000a\u000aThe decor includes work from the Venice Biennale and an area called the "New Art Lounge," a space that includes 2,000 art book titles. There's an excellent ground level cafe, as well as a stunning rooftop that serves an excellent salmon tartare.\u000a\u000aThe rooms are sleek and minimalist, and there's a gym, Jacuzzi and steam bath.\u000a\u000aElectra Metropolis Hotel\u000a\u000aThe Electra Metropolis Hotel opened last year, joining two other Electra hotel locations in Athens.\u000a\u000aThis 216-room hotel has sweeping views of the Parthenon, an outdoor pool, and is centrally located near Syntagma Square.

It's equal part feast for the eyes and history museum, not to mention the only jewelry museum in Greece.\u000a\u000aThere's also a great gift shop that sells beautiful, well-priced scarves. Also, don't miss the tranquil outdoor cafe that's the perfect place to gather your strength to climb up to the Acropolis.\u000a\u000aLast year, The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center was unveiled, heralding one of the city's most ambitious projects in the past decade. The $867 million Renzo Piano-designed structure that has vistas of Athens and the Aegean Sea is one of the most sustainable buildings of its size.\u000a\u000aThis fall, the center will become the official home of the National Library of Greece and the Greek National Opera . The complex boats a 40-acre landscaped park, a much-needed addition to Athens, which has the lowest green space per capita of any city in Europe. The park includes playgrounds, water fountains, an esplanade for running, biking and walking and a glass-walled lighthouse at the park summit.\u000a\u000aThe Acropolis Museum , opened in 2009, is a must-visit before heading to the actual site.\u000a\u000aThis airy space frames the antiquity exhibitions and puts the Acropolis in historical context. In fact, the museum tracks the entire history of Athens.

aVEach year, tens of thousands of Indian students head to the U.S. in order to get a college degree, find a job and pursue the American Dream.\u000a\u000aBut as India's economy booms and the U.S. continues to tighten its immigration policies, many of these young Indian professionals are making their way back home instead.\u000a\u000aNatasha Jain, 28, is one of them.\u000a\u000aOriginally from Ambala in Northern India, she graduated with a master's degree from Stanford University in 2012, landed a good-paying job in Silicon Valley and even started her own company. But she struggled with the constraints of the U.S. visa system and eventually gave it all up.\u000a\u000a"Within just three years of moving back [to India], I have been able to establish a tech startup and manufacturing business and create many job opportunities," said Jain. "All of this would have been harder for me to do as a foreigner living in the U.S."\u000a\u000aIndia's fast-growing $2 trillion economy means there are more opportunities for Indians like Jain to find work or start their own ventures. The Indian government, too, is aggressively courting non-resident Indians with programs such as Startup India, designed to ease bureaucratic restrictions and provide funding.\u000a\u000aBut there's also an undercurrent of nervousness and anxiety that is spurring more Indian expatriates to return home as well.\u000a\u000a"The Trump administration is pursuing more stringent immigration policies, which could make it much harder for us to stay in America," said Mani Karthik, 36, who worked at a technology consulting firm in Silicon Valley before returning to India earlier this year.\u000a\u000aKarthik pointed to the RAISE Act, which President Trump endorsed earlier this month. The proposed bill seeks to cut legal immigration to the U.S. by 50% within a decade. "These policies send a message that rules are going to be stricter and tougher," he said.\u000a\u000aMany Indians have also grown concerned about increasing violence against foreign born workers, he added. Earlier this year, two Indian-American engineers were shot, and one of them killed in Olathe, Kansas in an incident law enforcement investigated as an alleged hate crime.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunate hate crimes against Indians... have shocked me. They've shocked a lot of us," Karthik said. "I started to think maybe this isn't the right time for me to stay in the U.S.," he said.\u000a\u000aRelated: This Indian technologist creates factory jobs in America\u000a\u000aKarthik came to the U.S. in 2010 on an H-1B visa sponsored by a telecommunications company, where he did consulting work for some of the biggest firms in Silicon Valley. Later, another employer sponsored him for a green card, which would have given him permanent legal residency status.\u000a\u000a"I was maybe two years away from getting it," he said.\u000a\u000aKarthik wanted to stay. "But I made a big U-turn," he said. "There's so much uncertainty here now about immigration and attitudes toward immigrants. I wasn't happy."\u000a\u000aWhile he was preparing to leave the U.S. Karthik launched ReturntoIndiakit.com, which features a checklist of helpful content about how to wind down life in America and start anew in India. The site explains things like how to sell your house and car, apply for an Indian version of a Social Security card and how to pick the fastest Internet service in India.\u000a\u000aSince its launch in March, the site has had close to 700,000 visits, Karthik said.\u000a\u000aKarthik knows of five people who have used the site and relocated to India. "Five or 10 years ago, none of these conversations would be taking place about going back to India, " he said.\u000a\u000aKarthik arrived in India in May and he's already gearing up to launch an online publishing startup. "I'll have it registered by the end of the month," he said.\u000a\u000a"Reverse brain drain"\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to student visas in the U.S., India ranks second only to China, accounting for every sixth international student studying in the U.S., according to the State Department. In 2016, the U.S. issued more than 62,000 student visas to Indian nationals -- that's nearly two and half times the number of student visas it issued to Indians in 2011.\u000a\u000aOver the past couple of decades, India lost much of its young professional talent to the U.S., said Devesh Kapur, professor of political science at University of Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aWhile exact numbers are hard to come by, Kapur said anecdotal evidence indicates that a growing number of graduates are now returning to India after gaining a few years of experience in America. "It's not huge but it is noticeably picking up," said Kapur.\u000a\u000a"On average, Indians have to wait at least 10 years to get a green card if they want to transition to it from an H-1B," he said. "That's a long time to put your life on hold. And who know if policies can keep changing in the interim."\u000a\u000aAfter graduating from Stanford with a graduate degree in management science and engineering in 2012, Jain landed a full-time job as a supply chain manager at a medical devices firm on an H-1B work visa. She also had a side business, a startup called Freshmentors, that she had worked on with classmates while at Stanford.\u000a\u000aBut juggling her new job and launching the business -- a fee-based online college mentoring platform to help international students through the process of applying to U.S. colleges -- proved more challenging than she expected.\u000a\u000aHer visa status presented the biggest hurdle.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump immigration plan to cost 4.6 million jobs, Ivy League study finds\u000a\u000a"As an H-1B employee with one company, I can't also be employed by another company and earn money at the second company," she said. "I can have equity in my business and be a shareholder but can't earn a salary."\u000a\u000aJain decided she wanted to be her own boss.\u000a\u000aSo she shut down Freshmentors and returned to India in 2014, armed with a business plan for another startup: Ruplee, a mobile payment app.\u000a\u000aShe built the platform, found retail partners and amassed users. Two years later, Ruplee was acquired. "By then, we had one million users and 1,500 merchants using it," Jain said.\u000a\u000aJain is now on her third startup, Bent Chair, an online furniture and home decor business she co-launched with her father in 2016. It employs 100 people, half of them artisans and designers. The startup has logged more than $1 million in sales and she is looking to expand both in India and internationally.\u000a\u000a"The trend of reverse brain drain is increasing," said Jain. "Given the excessive visa restrictions, a lot of people are choosing to move back."\u000a\u000a"Also, coming back to India with everything you have learned in the U.S. always gives you a great advantage," she said.

aV(CNN) Much has changed since the height of the refugee crisis that gripped Europe in the summer of 2015. Since the shocking images of drowned Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi went viral, the crisis has largely been out of international headlines.\u000a\u000aBut it doesn't show any signs of stopping.\u000a\u000aSince 2015, Europe has scrambled to cope with the arrival of around 1.5 million people by sea.\u000a\u000aIn an effort to stem this flow, many European countries have tightened their policies and borders. In 2016, the European Union forged a controversial "one in, one out" deal with Turkey to stop the tide of migrants and refugees fleeing to the continent from the Middle East. And, this year, Italy has adopted an aggressive approach to halting migration across the Mediterranean from North Africa, backing the Libyan coast guard's rescue efforts and cracking down on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operating off the country's coast.\u000a\u000aWith each new twist and turn, the number of arrivals has dropped. But new migrant routes keep cropping up. People seeking alternative passages have moved westward -- seen in the recent spike in migrants arriving in Spain from northern Morocco -- while others are turning in desperation to new destinations such as Yemen\u000a\u000aFootage that surfaced on social media in early August showed stunned sunbathers watching as a dinghy packed with dozens of African migrants landed on a Spanish beach -- the latest sign of an evolving crisis.\u000a\u000aHere's what has been happening in the Mediterranean:\u000a\u000aWhy are NGOs suspending migrant search-and-rescue (SAR) operations in the Mediterranean?\u000a\u000aThree aid groups operating in the Mediterranean -- Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Save the Children and Sea Eye -- suspended their rescue operations in August, citing security concerns after Libya blocked foreign vessels from a stretch of sea off its coast. The MSF said an increasingly "hostile environment" had made their efforts untenable, while Sea Eye alleged that the Libyan government had issued an " explicit threat " against NGOs.\u000a\u000aWhat is the Libyan coast guard doing?\u000a\u000aLibya has extended its SAR zone into international waters, restricting access to humanitarian vessels. The Libyan navy, emboldened by its agreement with Italy, has recently fired warning shots at humanitarian aid vessels patrolling in this area. Libyan Navy spokesman Brigadier Ayoub Qassem told CNN: "We are fed up with these organizations. They increased the number of immigrants and empowered smugglers. Meanwhile, they criticize us for not respecting human rights."\u000a\u000aA Libyan coastguardsman patrols the SAR zone between Sabratha and Zawiyah in July 2017.\u000a\u000aLibya has asserted its right to operate beyond the territorial limit of 12 nautical miles from the coast. According to Save the Children , Libya has extended its SAR zone to 70 nautical miles from its shoreline. The move has led to clashes with NGO vessels at the edge of Libyan waters.\u000a\u000aWhat assistance is Italy providing to the Libyan coast guard and why?\u000a\u000aIn August, Italy announced it would deploy two naval ships to Libya -- a patrol vessel and a technical and logistical support unit -- in an effort to deter illegal migration and human smuggling into Europe. The move came after Libya's UN-recognized government of national accord requested help. The initiative has been widely panned by NGOs, which have warned that the move will expose migrants to far more danger and abuse.\u000a\u000aA member of Aquarius, a rescue ship run by NGO SOS Méditerranée and Doctors Without Borders, brings a young girl on board in August 2017.\u000a\u000aWhat restrictions has Italy imposed on NGOs?\u000a\u000aIn late July, Italy's Parliament passed a controversial "code of conduct" for NGOs operating search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean. Among the measures are:\u000a\u000a\u2022 Ban on entering Libyan waters except in situations of grave or imminent danger\u000a\u000a\u2022 Ban on phone calls to help migrant departures\u000a\u000a\u2022 Ban on transferring rescued migrants to other vessels\u000a\u000a\u2022 Commitment to allow armed police onto vessels to monitor activities\u000a\u000aA child, who was aboard the Aquarius rescue ship, receives flip-flops upon her arrival in the port of Pozzallo, Italy, in August 2017.\u000a\u000aThree of the eight humanitarian groups operating in the Mediterranean agreed to the terms, while Doctors Without Borders refused to sign, saying it could increase deaths at sea. The mayor of Catania, Italy, told CNN that he believes the code of conduct is behind the recent drop in migrant arrivals there; critics say it is too early to tell.\u000a\u000aWhat is happening to migrant arrivals in Italy?\u000a\u000aMigrant arrivals to Italy dropped in July -- cut in half from the same month last year -- figures from Italy's interior ministry showed. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) , 94,802 migrants have reached Italian shores so far this year -- 85% of all arrivals in Europe.\u000a\u000aHow is that affecting migrant arrivals elsewhere?\u000a\u000aThe UN says over 9,000 migrants have arrived in Spain so far this year, most of those in the past two months. It's the most the country has seen since the start of the crisis. And it's flared in August -- with a staggering 604 migrants rescued in just 24 hours. Increasingly, African migrants are seeking a cheaper and easier path to Europe, setting sail for Spain from Morocco in toy dinghies and on jet skis. The average price to cross from the Moroccan coast to Spain is around 500 euros (about $590), according to Frontex\u000a\u000aRescued migrants arrive in the port of Motril, Granada, southern Spain, in August 2017.\u000a\u000aWhy has the Italian government shifted its strategy on refugees?\u000a\u000aItaly's beefed-up approach to tackling the flow of migrants into the country followed local elections in June, which saw a wave of anti-immigrant mayors and local councilors ushered into office. Critics say the result has left the governing center-left party reeling, forcing Italian leaders to seek short-term solutions at the cost of migrants' lives.\u000a\u000a"Our goal is to govern the migration flows," the Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, said in an August news conference. "A big democracy, a big country, doesn't endure migration's flow, but tries to govern them."\u000a\u000aWhat is happening to migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard?\u000a\u000aMigrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard are being returned to the north African country. Human Rights Watch , and other humanitarian organizations, have warned against returning migrants to Libya, a war-torn country where migrants are exposed to torture, slavery and detention, they say.\u000a\u000aMigrants react after being returned to a detention center in Libya.\u000a\u000areport published in June by the UN Panel of Experts on Libya contained serious allegations that factions of the coast guard were colluding with smugglers, and abusing migrants they intercepted. The same report detailed inhumane conditions in multiple migrant detention centers. It echoed another report by the UN support mission in Libya and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, published in December last year, which included similar claims.\u000a\u000aWhat is the EU's strategy to address the refugee crisis, and how has it changed?\u000a\u000aSince the height of the crisis in 2015, governments across Europe have sought to fortify their countries' borders. In February 2017, EU leaders outlined plans to stem the flow of migrants traveling across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy, and boost the ability of the EU to send people back.\u000a\u000aMembers of the Aquarius crew attend to migrants rescued off the Libyan coast in August 2017.\u000a\u000a"The key priority is reducing the flow without any consideration for the causes of migration," Nando Sigona, an expert in migration at Birmingham University's School of Social Policy, told CNN\u000a\u000aWhat about the anti-immigrant patrols in the Mediterranean?\u000a\u000aAn anti-immigrant vessel has underlined just how fraught the debate on refugees has become in Europe. The Defend Europe group deployed its C-Star vessel to the Mediterranean this summer, vowing to stop the "invasion" of refugees attempting to sail to Europe.\u000a\u000a"It's created pressure, pressure for the NGOs as we were here, always watching them, documenting them and basically paralyzing them. We've seen it, I think during our operation time, the whole thing has turned against the NGOs. They've lost most public support; many have given up," Martin Sellner, one of the group's leaders told CNN. "We came and they went so definitely a success."\u000a\u000aThough the C-Star has been allowed to continue operating in Libya's SAR zone, the Libyan Navy's Qassem told CNN that the coast guard would not work them directly.\u000a\u000a"They combat immigration through a spiteful, racist standpoint," Qassem said. "We don't work with racism."\u000a\u000aWhat is happening to the charities that are continuing their missions?\u000a\u000aThe Spanish aid group Proactiva Open Arms is among several NGOs that have continued to conduct rescue operations in the Mediterranean despite restrictions. Its crew recently reported that the Libyan coast guard fired warning shots while the vessel was in international waters.\u000a\u000aMigrants watch sunrise from the Aquarius rescue ship after their transfer from the NGO Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) in August 2017.\u000a\u000a"They were warned and told that they could be detained. We gave them a chance to leave and they did," Libyan navy spokesman Qassem told CNN. "They have to respect our sovereignty. They consider themselves above the law and Libyan sovereignty."

aVKayla Harrison is a two-time Olympic champion who, at London 2012, became the sport's first American Olympic gold medalist. Four years later, in Rio, she retained her Olympic title. Ahead of the 2017 World Judo Championships in Budapest, which runs from August 28 to September 3, Harrison writes exclusively for CNN Sport.\u000a\u000aThe sport gave me a goal, gave me something to wake up for. If I didn't have that when I was a teenager, I might not even be here.\u000a\u000aWhen I was 16, having just moved to Boston to train with the Olympic coaches Jimmy Pedro and his father, I'd also just revealed to my mom that my first coach had sexually abused me. It was a tumultuous time.\u000a\u000aEveryday I thought about quitting the sport.\u000a\u000aI thought about running away, of being a Barista in New York where no-one would know me or look at me.\u000a\u000aI struggled with thoughts of suicide for years, during the abuse and after the abuse, but having a goal -- the dream of being an Olympic champion -- and strong people around helped in my darkest hour.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Kayla Harrison's golden career Kayla Harrison celebrates successfully defending her Olympic gold medal at last year's Rio Olympics.

If I wanted to be in the judo house I had to follow the rules.\u000a\u000aThere were days when my teammates would drag me out of bed and drive me to school and they would watch me walk through the school doors.\u000a\u000aJimmy, the coach, didn't usually take kids who were under 18, but these were special circumstances. My mom had nowhere else to go and I'm really thankful he said OK. A lot of people wouldn't have considered having a 16-year-old car wreck.\u000a\u000aKayla Harrison and Jimmy Pedro at Harrison's homecoming party after London 2012\u000a\u000aI had to pay the rent so I worked in a hardware store for 50 hours a week, as well as going to school and training, before eventually working at the judo school and that is when judo became work and play.\u000a\u000aI'd always dreamed of being an Olympic champion. From the age of six I wanted to be the best in the world at something.\u000a\u000aWhen I was little, I saw a karate commercial on TV and so I was running around, kicking things in the house, breaking them, and my mom -- who did judo as self defense -- decided that, if I was going to do martial arts, judo was the safest.\u000a\u000aAnd from the first time I stepped on the mat I just loved it. I was hooked.\u000a\u000aI loved having to bow, I loved flying through the air without getting hurt and loved learning to throw the boys!\u000a\u000aA sexist comment, a playground tussle\u000a\u000aBut I also loved judo because judo made me feel special.\u000a\u000aNobody from my school really knew what judo was and I remember teaching the kids all these throws. I was the cool kid.\u000a\u000aIn high school my nickname was "Judo." "What's up, Judo?" my friends would say.\u000a\u000aI got to go to tournaments at weekends. They were only in Indiana, which was just two hours away from my home in Ohio, but it was still exciting, still special.\u000a\u000a#TBT young and hungry! \U0001f643 A post shared by Pursuing Excellence. (@judo_kayla) on Feb 18, 2016 at 8:24am PST\u000a\u000aFast-forward 20 years and I'm traveling all over the world with my best friends doing what I love for a living.\u000a\u000aIt's often assumed that people try to fight me all the time, but the only time I've been in a fight was at school when I was six years old.\u000a\u000aI was in the playground and a friend wanted me to show him a throw, then he wanted me to show all of his friends! I showed this boy a throw and he stood up and pushed me, so I threw him again and we started to tussle.\u000a\u000aA teacher came over and I'll never forget what she said. "It's one thing seeing one of the boys wrestling," she shouted. "But I come over and see a pony tail, Miss Harrison!"\u000a\u000aAt the time, I was mortified. I'd never been in trouble. I cried when I arrived home and wrote a letter and apologized, that's what the good kids did, but years later I realized I should have been allowed to wrestle.\u000a\u000aIt was such a sexist thing for that teacher to say and I don't think it would have been said in this day and age, thankfully.\u000a\u000aA lonely existence, living out of a suitcase\u000a\u000aFrom a really young age everyone just assumed I was going to be successful. I don't know why. I wasn't even that good. I didn't win a tournament during my first three years of doing judo -- I didn't even win a match -- but I was really determined.\u000a\u000aPeople believed in me so much. My teachers in middle school raised money for my first big international trip, which was in Estonia. I lost in the first round!\u000a\u000aThe thing people don't truly understand about life as an Olympian is that it is not only about me. I'm not the only one who has made sacrifices. My coaches, my family, every doctor who has taped my knee or helped me recover from an injury, anyone who's taken a fall for me or sparred with me, helped me be successful.\u000a\u000aThe life of a judoka is extremely grueling so you need that support. It can be a very lonely existence -- it's just you and another person on the mat.\u000a\u000aAnd if you want to be successful, you have to do it for yourself. Judo in the US is not that popular yet, so I wasn't doing it to be famous, rich or a national hero.\u000a\u000aPeople think that I'm now a national hero, but for 20 years nobody knew my name.\u000a\u000aIt's a hard lifestyle. I spent half my life living from a suitcase, going to Japan, Germany, the UK. You go where the competition is.\u000a\u000aBut I wouldn't change a second of it because it gave a kid from a middle of nowhere town in Ohio a chance to see the world.\u000a\u000aPost-Olympic depression, turning to MMA\u000a\u000aNow I'm retired, I'm just figuring out what I want to do with the rest of my life.\u000a\u000aI didn't really believe in post-Olympic depression. How can you be depressed after competing in the Olympics? But it's real.\u000a\u000aAfter winning gold in London, I knew I was going to Rio so I had a bit of fun, took time off, then it was back to training and the life I always knew.\u000a\u000aBut the night after I won gold in Rio I couldn't sleep. I didn't know who I was or what I was going to do with my life. Who was I without that discipline, those habits I had had for the last 10 years? Who is Kalya Harrison if she doesn't have to wake up for practice? I didn't know that girl.\u000a\u000aI was definitely depressed for about six months. I met all my responsibilities, did all the media, but I would come home and the alarm would go off and my boyfriend would get up for work and I would just lie in bed. That was just not like me.\u000a\u000aI still get some bad days, but I'm keeping busy.\u000a\u000aI work out, I'm writing a book, I'm commentating for MMA, though it's not the same as having one singular goal.\u000a\u000aFor years I'd wake up and there was a deadline, an Olympic gold medal to be won on August 2 and August 11, so to not have that goal is really scary.\u000a\u000aI go back and forth on whether I'm going to compete in MMA because it's so different to judo.\u000a\u000aThe first thing you do on a judo mat is bow to your opponent, the first thing you do in MMA is trash talk your opponent.\u000a\u000aThe Professional Fighters' League i s trying to change that, and I'm interested. They want to give their fighters a monthly salary and health benefits, and even in the fighters' contracts it says the must not swear. That's a much more feasible fit for someone like me.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Legends of judo: Teddy Riner, the best ever? Replay More Videos ...

It hurts, it's so unforgiving.\u000a\u000aAfter my first cage practice I felt good, had a great workout, but woke up the next morning and my elbows, my back, my bum -- everything -- was bruised. Couldn't it have been couch fighting!\u000a\u000aI know I'm done with judo.

He's got to take shots of insulin, and most likely he'll be dead by 25. If not, he'll either be blind or have renal failure,'" he said.\u000a\u000aRacing uphill\u000a\u000aAs he grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, Southerland was determined not to let this death sentence stop him. At 6, he was already managing his Type 1 diabetes on his own.\u000a\u000a"For me, it was all I ever knew. I knew I had to breathe, I knew I had to eat and I knew I had to check my blood sugar and give myself insulin shots."\u000a\u000aHis parents stored only healthy food in the house to keep him from making bad choices. But at 12, Southerland disobeyed the rules and ate a candy bar. That decision would change his life.\u000a\u000a"I figured OK, I don't want to wait two hours for my insulin to kick in. I do want to eat these candy bars. How can I do it?" he recalled.\u000a\u000aSo he hopped on his bike and rode through the neighborhood until his legs got tired.\u000a\u000a"That was my journey to start riding," he said. "The bike for me was freedom."\u000a\u000aThe more he exercised, the less insulin he needed, and the easier it was to manage the disease.\u000a\u000a"The bike gave me the discipline and motivation I needed to control my diabetes," he added.\u000a\u000aSoutherland started competing and won a lot of cycling races. In college, he got the idea to start a nonprofit called Team Type 1 Foundation , based in Atlanta, to empower other athletes with the disease.\u000a\u000aThe first sporting goal of the organization was to have a team of athletes compete in the Race Across America, a 3,000-mile bike trek through 12 states.\u000a\u000aSoutherland leads his first all-diabetic cycling team for Team Type 1.\u000a\u000a"We lost the race by three minutes," Southerland said. "So we came back the next year a little smarter in how we manage diabetes, a little more experienced in the race, and we set a world record of 5 days, 15 hours and 43 minutes."\u000a\u000aTo ensure safety, the organization provides a medical team to support riders during a race. Cyclists undergo a stringent testing regime in the three hours leading up to a race. They also use continuous glucose monitoring, which will sound an alarm if their levels get too high or too low.\u000a\u000aCheating death\u000a\u000aIn 2008, Southerland created a professional team of diabetic cyclists.\u000a\u000a"I was supposed to be dead when we started Team Type 1 as a professional cycling team," he said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aBut he was far from it. Southerland competed as a professional cyclist for two years until some injuries took him out of the sport.\u000a\u000aNow 35, Southerland's goal is to field the first all-diabetic team in the Tour de France by 2021.\u000a\u000a"I believe sport can be the unifying point for people with diabetes," he said.\u000a\u000aSoutherland's other passion is helping diabetic kids in Rwanda get much-needed medical supplies.\u000a\u000a"I nearly put our company out of business in 2010 ... because I bought 400 blood glucose monitors, and I took about 40,000 test strips in bike boxes to the Tour of Rwanda," he said.\u000a\u000aSoutherland is dedicated to helping kids with diabetes in Rwanda.\u000a\u000a"We gave them out to the kids there. Their parents were all in tears because their kids have this tool, which is gonna help them live," he added. "It ripped my heart out."\u000a\u000aEvery year since then, the organization has continued to send supplies to Rwanda.\u000a\u000a"I want every kid with diabetes to know that they are the hero. Every person with diabetes to know that their dreams can come true."

aVMs. Soffer and Ms. Birkner found the emotional and psychological support resources for people in their early adult life-stage lacking. \u201cI went to a family of homicide victims support group run through Safe Horizons in a church basement in Harlem when I was living on the Upper West Side and there was no one in my generation,\u201d said Ms. Birkner, a Brooklyn-based writer and editor. \u201cStill, it did save my life.\u201d Ms. Soffer said she was the only person under 65 at the grief support groups she joined, adding that among those her own age, \u201cI barely know anyone who had lost both their parents.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor a generation known for broadcasting internal monologue across the Internet, some of its members seem eager for spaces to express not just the good stuff that litters everyone\u2019s Facebook newsfeed, but also the painful. In November, Melissa Lafsky Wall, 35, the founder of New York-based Brick Wall Media, turned to Modern Loss after a miscarriage, posting an essay called \u201cThe Silent Sorrow.\u201d \u201cThe Internet should speak to the parts of life that we all experience, but aren\u2019t represented in most media, a large one being grief and loss,\u201d Ms. Wall said, adding that the feedback she got was all positive, which she attributes to the site. \u201cIf you are going to write about your miscarriage on Reddit, for instance, it\u2019s going to be a very different community.\u201d\u000a\u000aModern Loss is a repository of essays, resources and advice that the founders try to edit so that it doesn\u2019t sound glib, overly religious or trite. For instance, you\u2019ll never hear, \u201cAt least they are in a better place.\u201d (\u201cOur least favorite line ever,\u201d Ms. Soffer said.) The website also examines decidedly 21st century topics like what to do when Gmail keeps suggesting someone who has died as a contact, a topic that Esther D. Kustanowitz, the founder of the blog My Urban Kvetch, explored in a post called \u201cDeleting My Mother.\u201d Befitting the target audience, it is not overly earnest. \u201cStay tuned for upcoming Modern Loss events in real life,\u201d the site\u2019s \u201cabout us\u201d page says. \u201cBecause misery loves company, and nachos. And margaritas.\u201d\u000a\u000aMs. Soffer, a former producer at \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d said of the site, \u201cYou have to have a sense of humor.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother mourning site speaking to the younger generation is Lisa Frank Mixtape, promising \u201c90s Music, 21st Century Grief.\u201d Its founder, Zoe Feldman, 29, solicits essays about human loss (sorry, no pets), sending her contributors a mix tape in return for submitting an essay about a human loss they have experienced. Named after the company Lisa Frank, known for its brightly colored products that Ms. Feldman said are to her the antithesis of grief, the venture was inspired after her former girlfriend and Smith College classmate, Rebecca Rosenthal, known as Becca, died in October 2012 at age 27.\u000a\u000a\u201cI went to a Shaman, a healer and every psychiatrist in Manhattan, and the only thing that helped me was talking to people my age who had experienced some devastating loss,\u201d said Ms. Feldman, who works on business strategy for PepsiCo in New York and has mailed around 50 mixtape cassettes (she will burn a CD for those who don\u2019t have a tape player). \u201cOne person wrote and said it\u2019s like being part of a weird, sad tribe,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThose who are accustomed to social media as a way to tout how fabulous your life is, beware: these sites can be unflinchingly graphic and wrenching. In November, K. H. (submitters use their initials on Lisa Frank Mixtape) wrote, \u201cMy dad passed away on May 31, 2003 in my arms as I tried to give him CPR.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aMs. Doughty, the author of a forthcoming book \u201cSmoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons From the Crematory,\u201d to be published by W. W. Norton in September, said she is seeing a cultural shift happening around what she calls \u201cdeath awareness.\u201d Her peers are engaging in more-open and public discussions about mortality and loss, a movement of which her \u201cAsk a Mortician\u201d channel on YouTube is on the frontier.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThe series has received over a million views since 2011, fielding questions such as: \u201cHow do you become a mortician?\u201d (Go to mortuary school) and \u201cCan you bake cremated remains into a chocolate cake?\u201d (Yes, but it\u2019s kind of gross.) On Ms. Doughty\u2019s blog, contributors discuss issues like, \u201cWhat do dead bodies really look like?\u201d and \u201cSuicide is the cause of death. Do you share?\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, \u201cGirls,\u201d the HBO show about young people making their way in modern-day Brooklyn, has twice tackled the issue of grief and death this season, first when Hannah Horvath\u2019s e-book editor, David, is found dead in the Hudson River. \u201cDo you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?\u201d Ms. Horvath asks her editor\u2019s widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, \u2018look at me\u2019 behavior.\u201d On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, \u201d said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.\u000a\u000aThen there\u2019s the lingua franca of social media \u2014 the like button \u2014 that\u2019s totally discordant with death. \u201cMy God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing \u2018136 people like this\u2019 underneath?\u201d Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a \u201csympathize button,\u201d something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company. (Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, but allows friends and family, depending on privacy setting, to leave posts on the timeline.)\u000a\u000aThe fact that the Internet is perhaps not the best channel for grief (with gaffes immortalized in cyberspace) is why David Fajgenbaum, 28, the founder of National Students of AMF, a support network for college students with sick or deceased parents, said his organization of 40 chapters on campuses has been cautious about integrating an online component. \u201cSomeone could say the wrong thing online, and could really hurt someone,\u201d said Mr. Fajgenbaum, who started the support group in his mother\u2019s memory while an undergraduate at Georgetown.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aMiss Manners, a.k.a. Judith Martin, writes rather unequivocally on the matter. \u201cLetters of condolence should be written by hand,\u201d she said. \u201cBurdensome as it may be, it offers the comfort of knowing that one is representing the deceased to those who cared about him.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut as Mr. Fajgenbaum acknowledged, young people are eager for that virtual connection; after all, technology and the Internet are a ubiquitous part of their existence. That\u2019s what Jason Feifer, 33, creator of the instantly viral Tumblr \u201cSelfies at Funerals,\u201d discovered when he posted a few dozen photos of teenagers taking pictures of themselves at funerals. In doing so, Mr. Feifer, an editor at Fast Company magazine, said he was documenting a newfangled mourning practice. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the older generation to see more than disrespect and to see some kind of genuine communication,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, though, some of the images made him cringe, in particular the young woman who wrote: \u201cLove my hair today. Hate why I\u2019m dressed up #funeral.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Feifer said, \u201cI think there are a lot of kids who saw this Tumblr and will not take a selfie at a funeral, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the kids who did take these photos don\u2019t know how to grieve.\u201d

aVPrevention of these and other adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) should be society's primary goal. However, these experiences continue to be pervasive and are often left unresolved for adult survivors.\u000a\u000aThe time has come for all systems engaged with the care of children to tackle this problem head-on. By building children's resilience early in their lives, we can better prepare them to handle past and future trauma and grow into healthy adults.\u000a\u000aHealthy attachment starts early in life\u000a\u000aFor children, building resilience means learning skills that can increase their ability to manage and regulate their emotions and response to stress.\u000a\u000aOne key way to build resilience is to strengthen families. This can include teaching caregivers about child development, providing concrete help in times of need and bolstering their abilities to manage stress and develop positive social connections.\u000a\u000aThese are just some of the ways to provide a safe and supportive environment where children can develop a strong bond with their caregivers. Research shows that healthy, securely attached children are less likely to show separation anxiety. Meanwhile, insecurely attached children tend to be avoidant and struggle to express negative feelings.\u000a\u000aThe quality of caregiver-child attachment can be affected by everything from facial expressions to the type of touch caregivers provide.\u000a\u000aDeveloping healthy attachment early in life helps children learn to better self-regulate (PDF). These children will display an ability to express their feelings openly and exhibit less fear and avoidance of the parent. In addition, adults' attachment style with their own children is highly influenced by the quality of the relationship they once had with their caregivers.\u000a\u000aACEs disrupt the development of healthy caregiver-child attachment. For example, parents with depression or substance use problems may be unavailable to care for their children and provide the support they need. In fact, in a recent study, ACEs were found to be associated with unresolved attachment style in adulthood. These early life events can increase the risk of substance use, which is often used as a coping mechanism.\u000a\u000aHelping children cope\u000a\u000aThe home is not the only place where children can experience trauma. Trauma can be experienced in multiple ways and contexts -- from problems at school to natural disasters that hit the community.\u000a\u000aFor example, when teachers observe a child having behavioral difficulties, they must be prepared to respond in a calm and nonreactive manner. Adults must be aware of their own stresses and triggers in order to avoid potentially retraumatizing the children they care for. Children need to be reassured they are in a safe, supportive and caring environment.\u000a\u000aAdults can help children physiologically relax by providing sensory inputs that calm the stress response. For example, listening to sounds that are calming, breathing deeply and taking a walk can help individuals bring the nervous system back to a balanced state. Yoga, creative arts and journaling can also help children relax and process negative emotions.\u000a\u000aIncreasing awareness\u000a\u000aOnce a traumatic event occurs, it cannot be undone. But early intervention can help children recover quickly and more successfully. Therefore, the better informed we are about the signs and symptoms of trauma, the better we will be able to recognize them.\u000a\u000aTrauma-informed care (PDF) takes adverse experiences into account. This approach emphasizes safety and encourages empowerment throughout the recovery process. Ultimately, it's about changing the culture of how we work with children and adults.\u000a\u000aTo fully embrace trauma-informed care, we must first build awareness that childhood stress and trauma is widespread across the population. Second, anyone who works with child or adult survivors must learn to recognize the symptoms of trauma and stress. Some of these include (PDF) anxiety, depression, problems with emotional regulation, hyperactivity, substance abuse and eating disorders.\u000a\u000aCurrently, there is controversy in the public health and medical community over whether we should ever assess for ACEs in adults and children. Some worry that asking about childhood experiences may open Pandora's box. "What do we do when we find out about trauma?" This is a natural response for individuals working in systems that do not have knowledge, skills or experiences about evidence-based approaches to trauma healing and recovery.\u000a\u000aHowever, if we want to provide trauma-informed care, we need assessments (PDF) to have a better understanding of the population overall for treatment and recovery. Assessment should only be conducted if there are appropriate programs and treatments to refer individuals or families.\u000a\u000aWhile more institutions, such as schools, are now starting to assess childhood trauma, we must be cautious in reading too much into what that trauma means. Assessment is not a means to diagnose, judge or label individuals. It is a tool that informs us about who we are working with and helps us foster understanding and compassion.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIf organizations want to provide trauma-informed care, they will need commitment from leadership and staff to change their organization's culture. This means implementing policies that focus on safe, supportive and collaborative environments. It means accepting that our society has experienced historical, cultural and gender-related trauma. There must be recognition by everyone that we all come from different backgrounds and experiences, which make us who we are.\u000a\u000aAll of this may be difficult to embrace. But we must equip our children -- the future of society -- with the skills for their physiological and psychological resilience so that they can lead healthy, productive lives.

aV(CNN) China is no stranger to contemporary architecture that boggles the mind or appears to side-step common sense, from an LED-lit horseshoe in Huzhou to a glowing teapot in Wuxi. But in 2016, China's State Council released guidelines forbidding the construction of "bizarre" and "odd-shaped" buildings lacking character or cultural heritage, shifting their focus to the "economic, green and beautiful."\u000a\u000aNewly unveiled plans for Liuzhou Forest City, designed by the Italian firm Stefano Boeri Architetti to be built in southern China, certainly seem to fit the bill. The 342-acre, self-contained neighborhood will comprise more than 70 buildings -- including homes, hospitals, hotels, schools and offices -- all of which will be covered with 40,000 trees and almost a million plants. Eventually, up to 30,000 people could call the Forest City home.\u000a\u000a"(This is) the first experiment of the urban environment that's really trying to find a balance with nature," firm principal Stefano Boeri said on the phone from Milan.\u000a\u000aThe plant life is expected to absorb almost 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide and 57 tons of pollutants per year, and produce 900 tons of oxygen a year, while also decreasing the air temperature and providing a new habitat for displaced wildlife.

aVA new Senate bill to repeal Obamacare would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 than under current law, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe Republicans' latest attempt to fulfill their years-long pledge would effectively repeal Obamacare in 2020, giving lawmakers until then to come up with a replacement plan.\u000a\u000aThe ramifications of not replacing the law immediately would be severe. Three-quarters of the nation would live in areas with no insurers participating in the individual market by 2026 -- leaving many without an option if they do not have employer-provided or government health insurance, such as Medicare or Medicaid.\u000a\u000aAlso, premiums would about double by 2026, compared to current law, the CBO found.\u000a\u000aIt's unlikely GOP lawmakers will approve this bill, though these frightening figures will make it even harder for them to proceed down this path. House Republican leaders cast aside an attempt to swiftly and simply repeal Obamacare earlier this year after encountering stiff opposition from fellow lawmakers and others, who said it was critical to come up with a replacement bill at the same time.\u000a\u000aThe idea unexpectedly resurfaced earlier this week after Republicans' effort to repeal and replace Obamacare ran aground in the Senate on Monday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would call a vote on a repeal bill modeled on 2015 legislation that was passed by both chambers before being vetoed by then-President Obama.\u000a\u000aThis bill, unveiled Wednesday afternoon, is meant to be a wake-up call for Republican senators, to serve as a reminder that most of them voted for it just two years ago. McConnell is essentially daring Republicans to reverse their vote and support the status quo they've been campaigning against for seven years.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump to GOP senators: 'Inaction is not an option'\u000a\u000aThe CBO score could also pressure Republicans to consider going back to the negotiating table to find a path forward on their more comprehensive health care bill, which would leave 22 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade. That is what President Trump asked them to do on Wednesday during their lunch at the White House, though earlier in the week he called for lawmakers to repeal the Obamacare now and replace it later.\u000a\u000aThe administration pushed back on the report.\u000a\u000a"We continue to believe that CBO's methodology is flawed, and this score fails to take into account the president's full plan, which includes a replacement for Obamacare and administrative actions to reduce costs and expand access to quality, affordable care," a White House official said.\u000a\u000aHere's what the new bill would do:\u000a\u000a-- Get rid of the individual and employer mandates, two of the least favorite provisions of the law, by reducing the penalty to $0. This provision would be retroactive to 2016.\u000a\u000a-- Effectively end Obamacare in 2020 by eliminating the federal subsidies that help people afford individual coverage.\u000a\u000a-- Eliminate Medicaid expansion starting in 2020.\u000a\u000a-- Repeal taxes on the wealthy, health insurers, medical device makers and others.\u000a\u000a-- Defund Planned Parenthood for one year.\u000a\u000a-- Increase funding for substance abuse and mental health needs by $1.5 billion over two years.\u000a\u000aEnacting the legislation would decrease deficits by $473 billion over the next decade, however this doesn't take into account the cost of a replacement plan.\u000a\u000aRelated: Will Obamacare really fail?\u000a\u000aIn some important ways, however, this bill repeals less of Obamacare than the legislation that passed the House and the version that was under consideration in the Senate until this week. It doesn't touch Obamacare's insurance provisions, including the immensely popular protections for those with pre-existing conditions. That will make it more likely to comply with Senate rules that will allow it to be passed with a simple majority.\u000a\u000aAlso, it would not curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program as the House and Senate health care bills would have.\u000a\u000aStill, repealing Obamacare without replacing it would throw the individual market into chaos, prompting insurers to start exiting swiftly. Lawmakers wouldn't have a lot of time to come up with a replacement, said Cynthia Cox, associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u000a\u000aInsurers are mid-negotiation for participating next year. Repeal without a replacement will destabilize the market in 2018. \u2014 Cynthia Cox (@cynthiaccox) July 19, 2017\u000a\u000aSome 17 million fewer people would be insured next year, leaving only an estimated 84% of Americans covered, compared to 90% under current law, the CBO found. Premiums would be roughly 25% higher mainly because many younger and healthier people would drop their coverage since they would no longer be penalized for being uninsured.\u000a\u000aBy 2026, a total of some 59 million people would lack coverage under this bill, compared to 28 million under current law, the agency estimated.\u000a\u000aCNN's Lauren Fox and Dan Merica contributed to this report.

aV(CNN) One day after school in January, 8-year-old Gabriel Taye returned to his Cincinnati home and hanged himself with a necktie, his family's attorney says.\u000a\u000aHis mother, Cornelia Reynolds, found his body that afternoon in his bedroom. His family sued his school district last week, alleging that he'd been bullied and that the school didn't inform his relatives.\u000a\u000a"Gabriel was a shining light to everyone who knew and loved him," his mother said in prepared statement released to the news media. "We miss him desperately and suffer every day."\u000a\u000aSuicides among US children under 13 are rare, but perhaps more frequent than you think. And 8 is hardly the youngest.\u000a\u000aMore than 1,300 dead since 1999\u000a\u000aFrom 1999 through 2015, 1,309 children ages 5 to 12 took their own lives in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\u000a\u000aThat means one child under 13 died of suicide nearly every five days, on average, over those 17 years.\u000a\u000aThe frequency was higher from 2013 to 2015 -- once every 3.4 days -- thanks mostly to a 54% spike in the suicides of 11- and 12-year-olds compared to the three years prior. That jibes with the CDC's announcement of a recent rise in suicide rates in ages 10-14\u000a\u000aStill, some perspective: Suicides before the teen years are infrequent compared to other groups.\u000a\u000aThere were 0.31 suicides per 100,000 children ages 5-12 during those 17 years. Compare that to 7.04 suicides per 100,000 people ages 13-18, or 17.39 per 100,000 for ages 18 to 65.\u000a\u000aChild suicide rates rise with age. But, yes, the CDC has recorded suicides of 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds. From 1999 to 2015 (the most recent year for data), those numbers were two, four and eight, respectively.\u000a\u000aWhy does it happen?\u000a\u000aSuicides for elementary school-age children have been little examined, but a study published last year in the journal Pediatrics saw some differences in factors from suicides in older children.\u000a\u000aThat study examined suicides in 17 states from 2003 to 2012, and broke down the factors among ages 5-11 and 12-14.\u000a\u000aRelationship problems -- such as arguments or other issues with friends and relatives -- were the most common factor for both groups. Given their ages, the problems, naturally, were more likely to involve boyfriend/girlfriend issues in the older group.\u000a\u000aDocumented mental health problems were equally prevalent in both groups (about 33%). But differences in the types of mental issues were intriguing.\u000a\u000aAttention-deficit disorder was more common in the 5-11 group, whereas the 12-14 set was more likely to have had been diagnosed with depression, lead study author Arielle Sheftall said.\u000a\u000aThat might mean the younger kids are more susceptible to responding impulsively to problems, said Sheftall, a research scientist at the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio.\u000a\u000a"I think having (the) information that we are seeing ADD/ADHD in kids (5-11) dying by suicide may help us to intervene differently in that age group," Sheftall said.\u000a\u000aMost are boys\u000a\u000aBy far, most children under 13 who kill themselves are boys: 76% of those who died in 1999-2015 were male.\u000a\u000aGET HELP Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-(800)-273-8255\u000a\u000aThat dovetails with research showing most of those taking their own lives across all ages are male. That same research, however, shows females attempt suicide more frequently\u000a\u000aBut Sheftall said it's not yet clear how many boys and girls ages 5-12 attempt suicide.\u000a\u000aSeparate research presented in May showed the number of children ages 5-17 who were hospitalized for suicidal thoughts or actions in the US doubled over nearly a decade.\u000a\u000aA growing racial divide?\u000a\u000aSheftall's team found something else: 36.8% of the 5-11 set who died by suicide were black -- nearly double the rate reported in the same demographic group between 1993 and 2002.\u000a\u000aThe researchers were keen to see whether there were differences in precipitating circumstances among races, citing previous research showing that "black youth may experience disproportionate exposure to violence or traumatic stressors," and are "less likely to receive services for depression, suicidal ideation and other mental health problems."\u000a\u000aBut "when potential racial disparities in precipitating circumstances ... were examined in the current study, few differences were found," the authors wrote.\u000a\u000aExperts: More research is needed\u000a\u000aSheftall said more research is needed, both to understand the increase in suicide rate in black children, and to determine whether and how suicide prevention efforts should be tailored to preteens.\u000a\u000aPre-13 suicides have been understudied, Sheftall said, largely because it's hard to imagine children this young want to kill themselves.\u000a\u000a"That's why we're making an effort to say, 'Yes, this is occurring. Now, what can we do to help?' "

aVStory highlights Two people killed identified as Finnish nationals\u000a\u000aPolice: 18-year-old Moroccan citizen taken into custody\u000a\u000a(CNN) Stabbings in the Finnish city of Turku that left two people dead and injured eight others are being treated as acts of terror, police said.\u000a\u000a"The incidents were initially investigated as murders, but in the light of further information received during the night, the offenses include now murders with terrorist intent and their attempts," police said.\u000a\u000aAn 18-year-old Moroccan citizen was taken into custody after the attacks. He was injured while being apprehended by authorities, police said. A motive has not been revealed.\u000a\u000aThe stabbings occurred Friday at two markets close to each other in the city's center.

aV(CNN) Maegan Sheiman and her husband, Josh, just wanted to have a baby. But it was never going to be that simple.\u000a\u000aThe quest to grow their family has been a roller coaster ride of exciting ups and terrifying downs. "Every good thing that happened, something bad would happen," she said.\u000a\u000aBut with an amazing amount of love and care, their hope has a reason to thrive.\u000a\u000aDefying the odds\u000a\u000aSheiman, 33, has two rare diseases: medullary sponge kidney disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The kidney disease causes her body to create and pass a multitude of kidney stones. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare genetic disease that affects connective tissue and blood vessels.\u000a\u000aNeither was confirmed until she encountered complications during her first pregnancy in 2005, during a previous marriage. She gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Isabella, in 2006, but had a hysterectomy that year.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans searched for an egg donor as well as a surrogate in 2015, two years after getting married. They found a donor with a strong resemblance and similar background. They were also excited to locate a surrogate, LaToya, in their hometown of Humble, Texas. LaToya had had a healthy child of her own and was eager to help other families bring children into the world.\u000a\u000a"I anticipated whoever would be carrying our baby would end up being part of our family forever," Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aMaegan Sheiman with LaToya and her daughter while LaToya was pregnant with Beckham.\u000a\u000aSheiman and LaToya bonded quickly and easily. LaToya agreed to change to an all-organic diet and was happy to have Sheiman accompany her to every appointment. They texted every day.\u000a\u000aSheiman's daughter, Isabella, was hoping for a baby brother. She received her wish when a faint line showed up on LaToya's pregnancy test and the Sheimans threw a gender reveal party at the end of 2015. The baby was due on May 5, Cinco de Mayo. They joked that he was destined to be a party baby.\u000a\u000aBut Sheiman knew that something was wrong when she received a scared phone call from LaToya late one night, not long after Josh's birthday in January 2016. LaToya was being rushed to the hospital with bleeding.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans rushed to the hospital. Only one person was allowed into the cramped room in the maternity ward, so Maegan went in. LaToya was screaming, in excruciating pain.\u000a\u000a"I knew something bad was happening," Sheiman recalled. "I didn't think that he would be born alive."\u000a\u000aDoctors told her the baby was coming, and there wouldn't even be time to give LaToya medication.\u000a\u000aForty-five minutes later, on January 19, Beckham came into the world at 24 weeks gestation, weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces. The nurses rushed him into an incubator and kept him warm to ensure that he would survive. Doctors still aren't sure what caused the early birth.\u000a\u000a"I got a glimpse of him and have never seen anything so small in my life," Sheiman said. "I did not know that a human could be that small and look like a human. He had a strong heartbeat, and he came out kicking like crazy. I'll never forget it. It was ironic, because his name is Beckham," like the soccer star.\u000a\u000aBaby Beckham in the neonatal intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aSheiman was told that Beckham would be rushed to Texas Children's Hospital, an hour away through rush-hour traffic in Houston. That's when she realized her husband had been in the waiting room the entire time, unaware of what was happening.\u000a\u000aWhen he saw Beckham, he asked in shock, "Is that the baby?"\u000a\u000aNew normal at the NICU\u000a\u000aDr. Mona Khan, a neonatologist at Texas Children's, greeted the stunned Sheimans when they arrived. Beckham had been placed in an incubator and was connected through tubes and IVs to numerous machines and devices.\u000a\u000aKhan could tell how nervous they were. Together, they pulled stools together around Beckham's incubator and talked about what to expect. Sheiman had plenty of questions.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans were told not to be too hopeful the first week, considered the "honeymoon phase" in which things can initially go well before going horribly wrong.\u000a\u000aA family advocacy group at the hospital gave Sheiman a notebook and told her to document everything. She wrote down every stat, every oxygen measurement, every discussion with every doctor and the trends tracking her son's improvements and declines. It helped her understand and feel in control of things.\u000a\u000aThe hospital staff impressed upon Sheiman how important her presence would be, not just to make critical decisions but to bond with a baby she couldn't even touch.\u000a\u000aA physical therapist holds Beckham in the NICU.\u000a\u000aShe was able to take time off from her consulting work as a project manager thanks to the generosity of her co-workers, who contributed their time off to carry her to August 1. This was vital for the family breadwinner.\u000a\u000a"We treat the family as part of the medical team," Khan said. "Every piece of information has to be discussed with them, and they have to feel that they are part of the decision-making process. We are all advocates for these babies, but they are their baby's strongest advocates."\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans moved into the Ronald McDonald House to be close to Beckham and see him every day for the first two months.\u000a\u000aBeckham was tiny, his head the size of a kiwi. An incubator monitored heat and humidity to keep his frail, bright pink, almost translucent skin from drying out. A bit of sticky fabric used with an instrument to detect oxygen ripped the skin off his foot.\u000a\u000aAnd then, a succession of issues arose: bowel perforation and surgery to repair it, a hernia, brain bleeds, heart defects and issues, a blood clot, a staph infection, pulmonary hypertension and even the threat of blindness. Those are just the big ones, Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aBeckham going into one of his many surgeries.\u000a\u000aKhan and the entire medical team became invested in taking care of Beckham. On nights when things looked bad, the attending physician would pull up a cot and sleep next to him. Even nurses who weren't assigned to him would ask Khan how he was doing each day.\u000a\u000a"You get really invested," Khan said. "This is your patient. You are taking care of them, and there is so much that is happening. Anytime there is a bad outcome, there is a slice of your soul that is taken away. With us, it's definitely emotional. Health care professionals, respiratory therapists, nurses, physical therapists -- everyone was very invested and involved. He has a special place in a lot of people's hearts."\u000a\u000aSheiman holds Beckham for the first time.\u000a\u000aIn addition to providing around-the-clock care, the doctors talked with Sheiman about "kangaroo care," in which mothers are encouraged to hold their babies with skin-to-skin contact.\u000a\u000aSheiman held Beckham for the first time two weeks after he was born. It took four people at the hospital, as well as her husband, to help tape all the boy's tubes and wires to her shoulder so she could hold him without doing any damage.\u000a\u000a"He was so small, I didn't feel like I was holding anything," Sheiman said. "But I was so excited to finally hold him and have that bonding time I had been craving."\u000a\u000aEvery time she held him through the kangaroo care method, his oxygen levels would improve. "If you had not been there every day, he would've ended up with a breathing tube surgically implanted in his neck," the doctors told her.\u000a\u000a"It gives such a good feeling to parents to be doing something to help their baby," Khan said. "What greater feeling is that?"\u000a\u000aA poem of gratitude\u000a\u000aMaegan, Josh, Isabella and Beckham Sheiman.\u000a\u000aIn April, Beckham finally got to meet his sister. Isabella was so happy she cried while smiling her biggest smile, Sheiman said. It laid the groundwork for a deep bond. If Beckham doesn't feel like smiling, he needs only to see his sister to start laughing again.\u000a\u000aLaToya recovered but faces long-term consequences. Any future children will be at risk of being born prematurely. The single mother putting herself through law school is an inspiring superhero, Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aAlthough LaToya felt guilty about what happened to Beckham, Sheiman insisted it wasn't her fault and urged her to come see Beckham. Now, they visit regularly.\u000a\u000aAfter 185 days in the NICU, Beckham went home for the first time in July. He's still on oxygen and can't be around other children because of the dangers of flu season, but the Sheimans are hopeful for the future.\u000a\u000aEven when he's having blood drawn every month or enduring painful procedures, he remains "the happiest baby," Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aBeckham celebrates his first birthday.\u000a\u000aIn January, Beckham turned 1 year old. All of his doctors and nurses were invited to his birthday party. Sheiman wanted to deliver a speech to thank everyone who cared for Beckham. It turned into a poem.\u000a\u000a"Everyone put their heart and soul into saving his life," Sheiman said. "They needed to know how much it meant to us. While we were there for 185 days, we won't forget it. They're practically raising our kids."\u000a\u000aShe shared the poem at the party but also created cards and had them sent to the hospital. The poem was also included in a hospital-wide newsletter two weeks ago.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"It was beautiful," Khan said. "Everybody was just really overwhelmed. It's a tear-jerker, full of emotions and very raw.\u000a\u000a"We love happy endings. We call them our graduates, these little babies that have been here for so long. We love seeing them. It makes us feel that we are doing something that makes it all worth it."\u000a\u000aBeckham still has quite a journey ahead of him, but the Sheimans remain hopeful.\u000a\u000a"He was not born normal, and I don't think he will be a normal kid," Sheiman said. "I want him to grow up to be happy and healthy, but however he turns out is however he turns out, and he will always be extra special, and he will have big things planned for his life."\u000a\u000aBeckham, then and now.\u000a\u000aThe full text of Sheiman's poem is below:\u000a\u000aI'm just a mother not big and not small\u000a\u000aAn ordinary mother and that is all\u000a\u000aI have a child my sweet baby boy\u000a\u000aWho has never been just an ordinary boy\u000a\u000aHe came to this world 1 pound and some ounces\u000a\u000aHis parents unsure if they could announce\u000a\u000aHis early arrival of 24 weeks\u000a\u000aAt 12 inches long we weren't ready to meet\u000a\u000aTo the NICU is where we were quickly sent\u000a\u000aOverwhelmed by this new place our time would be spent\u000a\u000aYou were covered in tubes and kept in a case\u000a\u000aOn meds and support, what on Earth was this place?\u000a\u000aNoisy and dark we were filled with fear\u000a\u000aAll the while we could not hold you near\u000a\u000aSo overcome by percentages and numbers\u000a\u000aTreatments and surgeries, survival rates stole our slumber\u000a\u000aThrough incubators, warmers, lights and lines\u000a\u000aOne day we were told you would run out of time\u000a\u000aWe cried so hard and couldn't stay strong\u000a\u000aSo you showed everyone that you could hold on\u000a\u000aWhen one thing was fixed another would break\u000a\u000aFrom your bowels to infection, lungs and your brain\u000a\u000aYour heart and your liver what more could go wrong\u000a\u000aYou never gave up you always stayed strong\u000a\u000aYou had countless transfusions, PICS and scans\u000a\u000aThe blood tests sometimes just got out of hand\u000a\u000aThe numbers we tracked and monitors watched\u000a\u000aWas all forgotten once in my arms you were caught\u000a\u000aBut there's more to this boy than his numbers and stats\u000a\u000aHis procedures and therapies, appointments and chats\u000a\u000aIt's not how he started that makes him so grand\u000a\u000aBut what he accomplished and who held his hand.\u000a\u000aIt's the doctors and nurses, therapists and techs\u000a\u000aWho have given their all to save our sweet Becks\u000a\u000aWho studied and fought, collaborated and led\u000a\u000aAnd stopped at nothing to get this boy fed\u000a\u000aIt's not just our preemie who suffered and fought\u000a\u000aBut also his team who we care for a lot\u000a\u000aIt's more than the meds and treatment plans given\u000a\u000aIt's the comfort and guidance the things that were hidden\u000a\u000aThe things that you know others won't see\u000a\u000aOnly the families you treat and have to let be\u000a\u000aWe come and we go and you send us away\u000a\u000aYou jokingly tell us to never come back your way\u000a\u000aBut we never forget the 185 days\u000a\u000aWhere we were all a family with this boy to raise\u000a\u000aTo help him to grow and fight and to live\u000a\u000aSo that he may go home and love we can give\u000a\u000aWe appreciate all you have sacrificed\u000a\u000aAnd a quick goodbye just doesn't suffice\u000a\u000aYou will always be family this we know\u000a\u000aAnd I hope you continue to watch Beckham grow\u000a\u000aIt is because of you that he is here\u000a\u000aIn our hearts, you, we hold so very dear\u000a\u000aWe love you so much and it was so hard to go\u000a\u000aYou have given our family this time to grow\u000a\u000aSure it's been hard he has the scars to prove it\u000a\u000aHis machines and that g tube how we want to remove it!\u000a\u000aHe loves to set his alarms off every night\u000a\u000aAnd yank on his tubes to give us a fright\u000a\u000aNow he is one he smiles and he laughs\u000a\u000aHe grabs and he cries and he bites his giraffe\u000a\u000aHe sits and he stands and even rolls over\u000a\u000aHe screams and he bangs until mommy comes over\u000a\u000aHe may still have quite a long way to go\u000a\u000aAnd the whole way we know we'll be kept on our toes\u000a\u000aHe will never be ordinary this we all know\u000a\u000aAnd before we all know it he'll be on the go\u000a\u000aI have no doubt he will continue to amaze\u000a\u000aWe will ooo we will ahhh at all of his ways\u000a\u000aAs he shows us what it truly means to overcome\u000a\u000aThis life he fought for he surely has won\u000a\u000aSo I say happy birthday to my un ordinary boy\u000a\u000aWho has given us worry overcome by joy\u000a\u000aWhat a miracle he is to be here in this world\u000a\u000aHe has made this "just mom" an un ordinary girl

aVStory highlights David Doubilet: Rising temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef are causing immediate coral bleaching and could ultimately cause sea levels to rise and endanger green sea turtles\u000a\u000aThe water could submerge Raine Island, where the turtles travel to safely lay their eggs in the sand, he writes\u000a\u000aDavid Doubilet began taking underwater photographs at the age of 12 and is a contributing photographer for National Geographic . He has won many awards and has produced several books, including "The Kingdom of Coral: Australia's Great Barrier Reef." He is a member of the Academy of Achievement, International Diving Hall of Fame, Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and a Rolex Ambassador. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Hold your pinky nail out in front of you. Now divide your nail into quarters. This is the size of one of the most remarkable animals in the world -- the coral polyp. The life of this tiny creature represents a biological process that helps produce geological fact in the form of coral reefs. These minute organisms are the building blocks of The Great Barrier Reef, which at 1,400 miles long is the largest living structure on Earth -- visible even from space.\u000a\u000aDavid Doubilet\u000a\u000aSome of my most memorable moments in the sea have occurred in this remarkable ocean ecosystem. One mid-October night in the Australian spring our team, led by Dr. Peter Harrison, sank beneath the surface off Heron Island into a dark world that that resembled a galaxy of stars created by many different species of reef-building corals that release their eggs and sperm into a warm sea with precision timing in a single night. These bundles of eggs and sperm combine to eventually produce coral larvae. The morning sea is coated with oily pink coral spawn, and a tangy coralline odor, unlike any other smell in the world, hangs in the humid air, evidence of millions of years of evolution and one of the most intricate mass spawning events in the world.\u000a\u000aToday, this living structure is facing an uncertain future in a warming sea.\u000a\u000aAcropora millepora release egg and sperm bundles that rise to the surface, creating a sea that resembles a starry night in the waters off Heron Island.\u000a\u000aSequential coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 have affected nearly 900 miles of the reef. Thermal stress causes the coral polyp to lose its symbiotic algae, which provides valuable nutrients and gives coral its color. If temperatures return to normal quickly, coral can recover with time. But these unprecedented back-to-back bleaching events give the already stressed coral little time to recover. The reef is literally in hot water, living under the Damoclean sword of ocean acidification and rising sea levels.\u000a\u000aThe Great Barrier Reef may be located in Queensland, Australia, but it really belongs to the world as the most well-known of all corals reefs on our planet. I am confident that even the most landlocked of Americans in the heartland know what it is and vaguely where it is.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Seven-year-old Julian Cadman on Sunday became the latest victim of the Barcelona terror attack to be named among the dead as more details about those who lost their lives began to emerge.\u000a\u000aCitizens from at least 34 countries were among the 14 killed and more than 120 injured in attacks in Barcelona and the coastal town of Cambrils , according to officials.\u000a\u000aCadman, an Australian-British boy, who was in the city to attend to a family wedding, was reported missing in the aftermath of the attack on Las Ramblas after becoming separated from his mother.\u000a\u000aThe boy's mother was injured and taken to a hospital, where she told hospital workers before losing consciousness that her son had been with her, according to Francisco Jimenez, coordinator of SOS Desaparecidos -- a nonprofit organization that shares information about missing people.\u000a\u000aThe Catalan interior ministry issued a statement Sunday clarifying that Julian "had never been lost," but officials did not include him among the victims until his identity was confirmed and his family was notified.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, Cadman's family said: "Julian was a much loved and adored member of our family ...

Krill is a licensed attorney, board certified alcohol and drug counselor, author and advocate. He is the director of the Legal Professionals Program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) "Rob Ford fought cancer with courage and determination. My condolences and best wishes to the Ford family today". --Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, via Twitter.\u000a\u000aPatrick R. Krill\u000a\u000aAs is now customary with the passing of public figures, social media exploded with condolences for the family of the late Mayor Rob Ford on Tuesday, making it clear that a man once the subject of merciless ridicule was now being afforded a level of sympathy and kindness unfathomable just a few short years ago.\u000a\u000aAcross the Internet and media, punchlines have largely been replaced by dignified tributes, and crude caricatures by staid, objective reporting. Why? Because Rob Ford, alive as an alcoholic, was apparently less deserving of compassion and understanding than Rob Ford, now dead from cancer.\u000a\u000aTrue, the fond remembrances and generous consolations are heartening, refreshing expressions of decency towards a family in grieving, and yes, they should be acknowledged and welcomed as such. To be clear, however, they are also the indisputable byproduct of the type of image makeover nobody wants \u2014 a cancer diagnosis.\u000a\u000aFueling Ford's trajectory from viciously mocked to politely mourned, his cancer demonstrated how malleable our emotional responses are in light of our moralizations. Rob Ford was, after all, a man who suffered from two life-threatening diseases but garnered sympathy for only one. Perhaps that dichotomy is worth us, as a society, examining.\u000a\u000aRead More

Then the bombs came.\u000a\u000aChildren could no longer go to school. Their parents could not get to work. Over time, the explosions increased. Residents feared for their lives.

aV(CNN) Deep in the Dja Faunal Reserve in southeast Cameroon, Baka Pygmies endeavor to live as they have always done: off the forest and firmly within it.\u000a\u000aAnthropologists estimate the Baka hunter-gatherer culture has endured for over 40,000 years, and Central Africa's Pygmy population -- somewhere in the region of 500,000 to 900,000 people -- is on a genealogical par with the San of Southern Africa. "They are, in effect, who we are all related to," explains Jerome Lewis of University College London. "These are civilizations that make ancient Egypt look like a spring chicken."\u000a\u000aBut the Baka way of life is changing -- forcibly so. Territory is shrinking for communities as alleged conservation and industrial interests create obstacles for a nomadic existence. Where the canopy was once a shelter, many Baka now live in roadside huts, pushed to the forest's edge and away from what they know.\u000a\u000aThe city lights are calling, too. Cameroon is a nation of approximately 220 ethnic groups, and the melting pot of its capital, Yaounde, promises much to young tribespeople.\u000a\u000aModernity, in one shape or another, is at the Baka's door. So what next?\u000a\u000aDifferent worlds\u000a\u000aBidjima Emmanuel is 19 years old and was born into the 1,900 square mile expanse of Dja. Emmanuel is one of a handful of Baka receiving a Western education courtesy of Spanish nongovernmental organization Zerca Y Lejos . Cameroon's Pygmies are among its most discriminated against minorities, but at the fee-paying College Vogt in Yaounde, Emmanuel rubs shoulders with the sons of government ministers and the scions of high society.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED At school in the forest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH At school in the forest 04:35\u000a\u000a"It was another world, a different world," he says, describing parents dropping their children off in cars and showering them with gifts. Emmanuel has faced prejudice from some of these city boys: "They mock you saying things like 'You're a villager ... you're poor, you're this, you're that.' It affects my mind," he admits.\u000a\u000aBut Emmanuel is excelling, say his teachers. Literature has become an outlet for the teenager, with "The Contemplations," a poem by Victor Hugo, a personal favorite:\u000a\u000a"I know that you await me.\u000a\u000a"I will go through the forest,\u000a\u000a"I will go across the mountain.\u000a\u000a"I can no longer remain away from you."\u000a\u000aHugo's reflections on the death of his daughter seem pertinent to Emmanuel's relationship with the Dja. The pull of the forest is strong. After nine months at boarding school, CNN followed his 155-mile journey home for the summer; one which highlights the shifting life of the Baka.\u000a\u000aA place called home\u000a\u000aBaka life began to change around a century ago, when missionaries made contact and were piqued by the people's adherence to monotheism. The Baka deity Komba is still followed by many, but some, like Emmanuel, have converted to Christianity.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, state policy has had a huge impact.\u000a\u000a"The Cameroonian government made a first push to get the Baka out of the forest in the '60s," explains Lewis. "There was an initial pressure ... due to communist rebels hiding out there."\u000a\u000a"Once they'd cleared up the insurgency, people returned to the forest. But then this process of zoning the forest -- which the World Bank promoted in the '90s -- marked the death knell of Baka hunter-gathering culture," he argues.\u000a\u000a"So instead of the Baka having access to their forest, safari hunters have it, or miners or loggers. The result was they had nowhere to go."\u000a\u000aLewis says forest roadsides became the only place the Baka "were allowed to be," and it is along one such roadside in Dja, in a village called Bifolon, that Emmanuel's family lives.\u000a\u000aDja, a largely undisturbed UNESCO World Heritage Site , contains an abundance of flora and fauna the Baka have relied upon to survive. The forest floor contains rodents and other mammals, the trees birds and honey.\u000a\u000aIt's not just nature's larder, but pharmacy, too. One plant, gouga, when boiled with water, is claimed to cure malaria; another, pando, purportedly soothes pain when rubbed on the skin. "The forest encloses many secrets," says Sylvain, Emmanuel's former teacher. "The forest is very rich and they know the forest."\u000a\u000a"This way of living in the forest seems to outsiders to be primitive, but it's in fact extraordinarily sophisticated," Lewis adds. "It's almost a zen-like affluence they have, because all the resources they need for their lives are around them."\u000a\u000aBut this abundance is curtailed if territory is limited.\u000a\u000a"(The Baka) are used to living in the forest," says Emmanuel. "Baka people don't want to be on the roadsides as they are now."\u000a\u000aNegotiating the future\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Baka Pygmies: 40,000 years and counting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Baka Pygmies: 40,000 years and counting 10:21\u000a\u000aReturning to Dja, Emmanuel is welcomed in the traditional fashion, with music, perhaps the Baka's most lauded cultural export. Known as a symbol of their communality and relationship with nature, the Baka employ polyphonic singing and water drumming to create their sound -- similar to the Aka, a neighboring Pygmy people in the Congo Basin, whose oral traditions have been declared Intangible Heritage by UNESCO.\u000a\u000aMusic, food and family bring joy and comfort, but already the 19-year-old has his goals set elsewhere. "If I finish my studies in Cameroon with good grades, my wish is to travel abroad to study more," he says. "I have to discover a life far from my parents in order to know what I should do with my future."\u000a\u000a"I am so proud of him," says his mother. "It makes me sad not to see him all the time, but I know this will give him the chance one day to get out of this poverty." It's a poverty, one must note, that has been newly found.\u000a\u000a"I don't want Baka people to lose sight of their origins, even if they are moving towards modernity," Emmanuel argues. "We should always return to the forest; to never forget what we have always done in the past."\u000a\u000aEmmanuel has opportunities never afforded to his parents, nor theirs. But likewise, his prospects in his ancestral home are not the same once afforded to them. Change, to some extent, has been thrust upon him.\u000a\u000a"Education has an important role for helping Baka negotiate their futures with more understanding and appreciation of the alternatives that are available to them," adds Lewis. "Education is absolutely vital to the Baka to find their space in the modern world."\u000a\u000aThere's an education that classrooms cannot teach, however; one Emmanuel's father hopes he will never lose. "Even if he leaves the forest, he must never forget what we have taught him: to hunt, to catch animals, to fish. It will protect him forever."

aVHong Kong (CNN) Top US and Chinese military commanders have signed a deal to improve communications between the two forces amid ongoing disputes in the South and East China seas.\u000a\u000aUS Marines Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Fang Fenghui, signed the so-called joint staff dialogue mechanism Tuesday at the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing.\u000a\u000aSuch communications are especially crucial now, officials said, "as the region and world are facing the dangers of a nuclear-armed North Korea."\u000a\u000a'Difficult issues'\u000a\u000aDunford, who is currently visiting Asia, said the United States and China "have many difficult issues where we will not necessarily have the same perspectives," according to a Defense Department statement.\u000a\u000aHe added improved military contacts would reduce the chances of "miscalculation."\u000a\u000aGen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Chinese Gen. Fang Fenghui on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe two nations have clashed over the disputed waters of the South China Sea -- almost all of which is claimed by Beijing, which has militarized and built up islands and reefs it controls in the region.\u000a\u000aLast week, a US destroyer sailed near a man-made island constructed by China as part of a "freedom of navigation" operation the United States conducted in a challenge to Beijing's territorial claims.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese Defense Ministry denounced the operation as a "provocation" and said it was "firmly opposed to such flaunting of force and promotion of militarization in the region by the US, which could easily trigger accidents at sea and in the air."\u000a\u000aWashington this month called on Beijing to endorse a legally binding code of conduct over the disputed region, with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson joining his Australian and Japanese counterparts in promising to "continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows."\u000a\u000a"Thus this mechanism is a step to reduce misconceptions in either side's military intention, although the probability of all-out war with North Korea is low," she said.\u000a\u000a"Before the 19th (Party) Congress, China fears more of its border instability than a nuclear-armed (North Korea). Official military talks with the US will be a deterrence to North Korea."\u000a\u000a'Unsafe' intercepts\u000a\u000aAccording to US officials, in recent months Chinese jets have carried out several "unsafe" intercepts of US planes while patrolling international airspace over the East China Sea.\u000a\u000aIn the most recent incident, an armed Chinese J-10 fighter jet came within 300 feet (90 meters) of a US EP-3 reconnaissance plane, forcing it to take "evasive action," a US defense official told CNN.\u000a\u000aChina maintains an "Air Defense Identification Zone" over much of the East China Sea, something the United States does not recognize.\u000a\u000a"This is uncharacteristic of the normal safe behavior we see from the Chinese military," Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said after the incident.\u000a\u000aAnother US official warned "encounters like this, ones that show a lack of control by the Chinese pilot, do nothing but increase the risk of miscalculation."

aVMichael D'Antonio is the author of the new book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Given a straighforward opportunity to disavow the most dangerous brand of hatred in American history, the man who has declared, "I'm, like, a really smart person" couldn't do it.\u000a\u000a"I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists," said Donald Trump in a response to CNN's Jake Tapper. "So I don't know. I don't know -- did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists."\u000a\u000aThe statement was classic Trump: a chopped salad made out of words. But the two parts were clear. "I know nothing about David Duke," he said. "I know nothing about white supremacists." (Trump later tweeted a disavowal.)\u000a\u000aEvery literate American adult, and certainly anyone running for president, must know that Duke is the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and that white supremacists promote a violently racist ideology that plagues America.\u000a\u000aThe 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, including 21 kids in a daycare center, was associated with if not inspired by white supremacy.\u000a\u000aSince 9/11 white supremacists and other domestic terrorists have carried out more deadly attacks on American soil than Muslim extremists. It was a white supremacist who killed nine people at a Bible study at a Charleston, South Carolina, church last summer.\u000a\u000aConcern about racist support for Trump arose last week when David Duke said on Facebook that he liked Trump's stands on certain issues and the way the candidate exposed "lies" perpetrated by the press and believed he will ensure "that White-Americans are allowed to preserve and promote their heritage and interests just as all other groups are allowed to do."\u000a\u000aWhen first informed of Duke's support on Friday, Trump didn't have any trouble recognizing the name. "David Duke endorsed me?" he said. "OK, all right. I disavow, OK?" This makes sense, given the fact that Duke is notorious for hate-mongering and Trump named him years ago when he explained why he dropped out of the old Reform Party. Back then, and again on Friday, he knew who Duke was and seemed to recognize that he's political poison.\u000a\u000aTrump's tune changed 48 hours before polls would open for Super Tuesday primaries, many of them in Southern states. Suddenly he was unable to place Duke's name and he didn't know a thing about the movement that keeps white racist extremism alive in America.\u000a\u000aThis from a fellow who is famous for recalling every detail of every deal he ever made and who never forgets those who offend him. If Duke was so bad that his presence drove Trump out of the Reform Party, it's unlikely he's forgotten him.\u000a\u000aWhat's going on here? As someone who has spent many hours with Trump and devoted two years to piecing together the story of his life, I can tell you that Trump is not speaking out of ignorance. He is, as he says, "very smart," and he understands the effects of what he says. And he has been signaling where he stands when it comes to race for many years.\u000a\u000aBefore declaring for president, Trump spent much of the Obama presidency as the loudest voice of the "birthers" who repeatedly claimed that Barack Obama was born, not in Hawaii, as documents prove, but abroad. And therefore he was not a U.S. citizen, and not a legitimate president, in Trump's eyes.\u000a\u000aBirtherism was a barely disguised effort to paint the first black president as an un-American other and was energized by racial animus. Trump played the game long after others disavowed it and went further, suggesting the President might not be a Christian, as he says, but perhaps instead a Muslim.\u000a\u000aThe insinuation, like Trump's suggestion that the truth about Obama's college years was somehow clouded, was a divisive kind of gutter politics.\u000a\u000aAlways comfortable going further than others, Trump was the man who responded to the arrest of five minority youths in the 1989 assault of a jogger in New York's Central Park with newspaper ads that said, "Bring Back The Death Penalty, Bring Back the Police."\u000a\u000aWhen Trump and I discussed the five -- who were coerced into false confessions but eventually cleared of the crime -- he wasn't interested in discussing any part of it except for his belief that they were bad characters who deserved no consideration for the years they spent in prison.\u000a\u000aThe Trump record on race also includes the ridiculous assertion, made in a TV interview with Bryant Gumbel, that "A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market."\u000a\u000aTrump also appeared as a witness at a congressional hearing on Indian casinos -- they were his competitors -- and said, "Organized crime is rampant on Indian reservations." He then offered his belief that Native Americans at the hearing where he spoke "don't look like Indians to me, and they don't look like Indians to Indians."\u000a\u000aTrump's tendency to play with racial fire is a longstanding element of his style and personality. When he was a marginal political figure, no one dwelled much on this problem. But as he lurches toward the Republican nomination for president, it's important to understand that he always knows what he is saying and always acts with an intention in mind. He is, after all, a really smart person.

aVFrancesca Street, CNN \u2022 Published 15th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 What's your favorite hotel perk: Is it the swanky gym, the fluffy pillows, the opulent spa? Or maybe it's the simple but luxurious treat that is room service. After all, once you've ordered an indulgent breakfast in bed, it's hard to go back to making it yourself.\u000a\u000aOne hotel in Singapore is taking room service to a new level thanks to AURA, the room service robot.\u000a\u000aAURA works in the M Social Hotel in Singapore -- a lifestyle hotel designed with the business-traveling millennial in mind.\u000a\u000a"The inspiration behind AURA the Relay Robot is to bring convenience and delight to guests and to help staff focus on improving guest experiences," Lee Richards, Millennium Hotels and Resorts' vice president of operations, tells CNN Travel.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 6 The room service robot: Meet AURA, who works at the M Social Hotel in Singapore. She can fetch you towels and bottled water and knows how to operate an elevator.\u000a\u000aFirst in Asia\u000a\u000aThe brainchild of robot-builders Savioke , AURA is designed to deliver room amenities to guests.\u000a\u000aShe's the first of her kind outside the United States, so her role at M Social marks a turning point in the Southeast Asian hospitality industry.\u000a\u000a"Savioke [...] is committed to measurably improve the lives of people by creating and deploying friendly service robots that work safely, securely and reliably in human environments," says Richards.\u000a\u000aAURA is compact, stylish and skilled. She can operate an elevator, navigate her way to guests' doors and let them know when she has arrived outside.\u000a\u000aRobot takeover?\u000a\u000aLee Richards and AURA, his room service robot.\u000a\u000aAURA's deployment at M Social has been successful, but Richards is quick to stress that this doesn't mean the future will be hotels with all-robot staff.\u000a\u000a"The heart of hospitality is really about people," he says. "We are not simply replacing people with robots or technology. Instead, we want to use technology to further enhance our services."\u000a\u000aThe idea is that if AURA is handling the task of taking room deliveries of bottled water and towels, the human staff can focus on other jobs.\u000a\u000a"[We can] focus on providing personalized touches and surprises to delight guests who stay with us on special occasions or have special requests," Richards adds.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, more robots are in the works for Millennium hotels -- including AURA's brother, who has the ability to cook different types of eggs and should be in service by 2018.\u000a\u000aTechnology and hospitality\u000a\u000aAURA is M Social's first robot, but more are on the way.\u000a\u000aRichards says these advancements are integral to the future of the hotel industry -- technology and hospitality go hand in hand.\u000a\u000a"Innovation is extremely important for sustainable growth in any industry," he says. "Especially in the hospitality industry where we often face the challenges of labor shortage, technology can assist the team in delivering the best for our guests, efficiently and effectively."\u000a\u000aAs millennials become a key business travel demographic, their drive for unusual experiences will continue to influence brand decisions.

aVSteven Holmes, a former reporter and editor for the New York Times and Washington Post, is an executive director in CNN's News Standards and Practices Department. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000aGeneral James Longstreet was an important figure in the Confederate Army; as important as Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, J.E.B. Stuart or A.P. Hill; nearly as critical to the Confederate cause as Robert E. Lee.\u000a\u000aA genius at combining offensive and defensive maneuvers, Longstreet led his 28,000 men in a flanking movement -- described as the largest simultaneous mass assault of the war -- and routed the Union Army at the Second Battle of Bull Run in 1862. The carnage that Longstreet's stout defense inflicted on attacking Union troops during the Battle of Fredericksburg a month later was so great that Lee, watching it, observed, "It is well that war is so terrible, or we should grow too fond of it." Longstreet's defeat of the northern troops during the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863 provided the Confederacy with its only major victory after Lee's defeat at Gettysburg.\u000a\u000aHe was, by most accounts, Lee's most trusted general. Lee once termed him "the staff in my right hand," and by the end of the war made Longstreet his second-in-command.\u000a\u000aYet outside of a roadside sign near his birthplace in Edgefield, South Carolina, one statue in Gainesville, Georgia, where he died, and his name on a few streets in a handful of Southern towns, there are virtually no memorials to Longstreet throughout the South -- or the entire country, for that matter.\u000a\u000aA World II tank was named after Stuart. Military bases are named after Braxton Bragg, John Bell Hood and eight other Confederate generals.\u000a\u000a"Stonewall" Jackson's visage is carved on Stone Mountain outside Atlanta. But few people, apart from ardent Civil War buffs, have ever heard of Longstreet.\u000a\u000aAt a time of debate over the removal of Confederate monuments and amid charges that some protestors want to "erase history," Longstreet's near-expungement raises questions about whose history is being scrubbed away and why that history was created in the first place. It underscores that history -- and particularly the history of the Civil War -- is not simply an objective chronicling of facts. It is often shaped by people to promote particular political agendas and ideologies.\u000a\u000aDespite his distinguished war record, Longstreet's absence from the pantheon of Confederate heroes was no accident. It was the result of a deliberate campaign by Southerners to punish him for his actions following the war.\u000a\u000aAfter the end of the war, Longstreet eventually settled in New Orleans. There, unlike many of his compatriots, he spoke out in favor of Reconstruction. He became a Republican. He endorsed Ulysses S. Grant -- who was reviled by Southerners -- for president in 1868. In 1874, he had the temerity to lead a predominantly black force of state militia in pitched gun battles against white supremacists in the streets of New Orleans. To many in the South, these efforts branded Longstreet a traitor to the white race to be either vilified -- or forgotten.\u000a\u000a"He was nearly erased from Confederate history," says William Garrett Piston, professor emeritus of history at Missouri State University, who wrote a biography of Longstreet. "There were complicated circumstances. But at the bottom it was because of the fact that Longstreet shocked and outraged white Southerners, because he was willing to participate in biracial politics."\u000a\u000aLongstreet was no racial saint. He argued privately that whites needed to embrace Reconstruction so that they, and not the newly freed blacks, would be in charge of rebuilding the South.\u000a\u000aStill, any attempt at cooperation with the victorious North and the newly emancipated slaves ran afoul of the growing "Lost Cause" movement in the South. Lost Cause adherents glorified the antebellum South, painting a bucolic tableau of Southern belles, stately plantations and happy slaves. They created the myth of "gallant" Confederate soldiers who only lost the war because they were ground down by the overwhelming numbers of the Union army. They cast Reconstruction as a corrupt and ineffective exercise foisted on the South by "radical" Republicans and carried out by incompetent black freedmen, evil Yankee "carpetbaggers" and traitorous Southern "scalawags."\u000a\u000aLost Cause advocates took over the Southern Historical Society, and later convinced Northern historians to accept their view of the war and its aftermath. As a result, for the rest of the 19th Century and most of the 20th Century, this view became settled in both popular history and culture, influencing such important -- and, some say, racist -- works as D.W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling book -- later a blockbuster movie -- "Gone With the Wind."\u000a\u000aOf course, many of these apologists for the South didn't just want to rewrite history to glorify the Confederate cause. A spate of constructing monuments to the Confederacy took place in the period when Jim Crow laws were being imposed, the Ku Klux Klan was at its zenith and blacks were being subjected to a campaign of terror. The NAACP, which did its best to keep track of this grisly statistic, noted that more than 2,500 black people were lynched in the South between 1889 and 1918 -- prime building years for Confederate monuments.\u000a\u000aErecting a statue to someone like Longstreet, who urged political cooperation with blacks, did not fit into this campaign of intimidation.\u000a\u000aLost cause "historians" also set out to destroy Longstreet's military record. After Lee's death in 1870 when the venerated general was no longer around to defend his trusted lieutenant, Lost Cause adherents perpetrated a false story that Longstreet had deliberately disobeyed Lee's order to attack the Union lines at sunrise on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. That disobedience, they argued, lost the battle -- and, in their eyes, the war.\u000a\u000aThough he publicly and vociferously disagreed with Lee's tactics during Gettysburg, historians now agree that Longstreet had dutifully followed Lee's orders. On the third day of the fight, he sent his troops, led by one of his chief subordinate, Gen. George Pickett, to attack the fortified Union lines on Cemetery Ridge. Marching across an open field, the Confederates were cut to pieces.\u000a\u000aFor decades, textbooks have glorified "Pickett's charge" as the epitome of Southern bravery. There is even an army base in Virginia named after him. But because Longstreet dared to work for some kind of reconciliation after the war, hardly anyone remembers who gave Pickett the order.\u000a\u000aLongstreet did not help his reputation after the war when, in his memoirs and other writings, he was highly critical of Lee's decision to invade the North in 1863 and Lee's tactics at the battle of Gettysburg. For Lost Cause adherents, and many other Southerners who had elevated Lee to almost God-like status, this was seen as heresy.\u000a\u000a"There were certain things you could do in the South after the war, and certain things you couldn't do." says Christopher Gwinn, chief historian at Gettysburg National Military Park. "One of the things you couldn't do was criticize Robert E. Lee."\u000a\u000aIn recent years, Longstreet's reputation has undergone rehabilitation among historians, if not the general public. In 1998, a grassroots campaign raised enough funds to build a statue to him at the Gettysburg park. It was one of the few major monuments to Confederate soldiers at Gettysburg that was not paid for by taxpayers in the states of the former Confederacy.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aIt is also, according to some historians, one of the least impressive. It is not mounted on a pedestal. It is almost hidden away behind a screen of trees, set in an out-of-the-way section of the 6,000-acre park away from the more majestic memorials that honor Confederate -- and Union -- soldiers.\u000a\u000a"Until that monument went up, there was no monument to Longstreet anywhere in the country. And there are still very few in the South compared to the dozens and dozens dedicated to Lee, Jackson and others," says James McPherson, author of the Pulitzer prize winning history of the Civil War,"Battle Cry of Freedom."\u000a\u000aWith President Trump lamenting the loss of "beautiful" statues of Confederate soldiers and generals, he, and others who hold similar views, might contemplate why the "beauty" of Longstreet's military record and of his vision -- however flawed -- of biracial politics in the South after the war were hoisted on so few pedestals.

She now lives in Erie, Pennsylvania, with her husband and the youngest of their three daughters.\u000a\u000aIn this country, her medical license is no longer valid.\u000a\u000a"I miss being a doctor. I miss it so much," said 51-year-old Sulaiman. "I (was) never meant to be a housewife."\u000a\u000aSulaiman is one of many refugees -- though no one knows exactly how many -- who practiced medicine in their home countries. Many are now in low-skilled jobs, driving taxis and working in grocery stores.\u000a\u000aUnderutilizing the skills of immigrants and refugees amounts to tens of billions of dollars in unearned wages that could be pumped back into the US economy, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.\u000a\u000a"The brain waste is appalling," said Dr. José Ramón Fernandez-Peña , an associate professor of health education at San Francisco State University who studied medicine in his native Mexico. He is also the founder and director of the Welcome Back Initiative , which has helped foreign-trained providers get health care jobs in the United States since 2001.\u000a\u000a"These are individuals who could be taking care of children with asthma and instead are working at a car wash," he said.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump backed a Republican-led immigration plan last week that would cap the number of refugees sent to the United States at 50,000: fewer than half of President Barack Obama's 2017 goal of 110,000.\u000a\u000aThe new immigration bill also favors highly skilled workers and gives "points" to those with advanced degrees, including medical doctors. However, if medical doctors are selected under the proposed system, they still face what many in health care have argued is a long, costly road to getting a medical license in the United States. This process hinders doctors like Sulaiman from going back to work, she said.\u000a\u000aSulaiman had hoped to be relocated to Australia, where her sister-in-law lives and where there are accelerated paths for foreign doctors. Had she gone to a country like Canada, she could have practiced with some restrictions while obtaining a full license.\u000a\u000aBut she ended up in the United States, where she must start her training from scratch.\u000a\u000a"It's a complete waste of people's experience, talent and expertise," Fernandez-Peña said.\u000a\u000aBack to step one\u000a\u000aThings began to turn around for Sulaiman starting in 2011 when her daughter's principal suggested that she volunteer at school. She occasionally helped the school nurse take care of sick students, and other times, she toiled away in the cafeteria.\u000a\u000aNo longer idling at home, Sulaiman emerged from her depressed state and decided it was time to go back into medicine.\u000a\u000aTo do that, Sulaiman would have to apply to residency again -- just like a medical student who has never practiced. Even if she gets into a program, it could require her to move across the country, away from the home she has re-established.\u000a\u000aShe would now be competing with thousands of newly minted doctors. She would also spend more than $5,000 preparing for and taking the exams.\u000a\u000a"That's become a bottleneck for training for people from abroad," said Jonathan Weiner , professor of health policy and management at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins.\u000a\u000aTo apply, foreign doctors must take a series of hours-long exams, studying for weeks or months in English, which may or may not be their first language.\u000a\u000aRefugees may have additional struggles, advocates say. For example, many must leave their home countries on short notice, making it difficult for longtime doctors to track down old transcripts and records.\u000a\u000aSulaiman passed these exams and applied to residency in 2015 and 2016. She hasn't even gotten an interview.\u000a\u000aWithin the United States, there are more residency slots than medical students to fill them. This year, more than 22,000 American-educated students vied for nearly 29,000 first-year residency slots, according to the National Resident Matching Program.\u000a\u000aThe rest of these positions were filled largely by foreign graduates and US citizens who studied abroad, many in Caribbean medical schools. But they have a much lower acceptance rate: just over 50%. For American-trained MDs, that rate jumps to 94%.\u000a\u000aSome experts predict a doctor shortage of 40,800 to 104,900 by 2030, according to an analysis commissioned by the Association of American Medical Colleges. The group has called for more residency positions to be funded.\u000a\u000a"I hear all the time there is shortage in doctors," Sulaiman said. "We are just ready to help. We are ready to serve. Just give us a chance."\u000a\u000aTo train residents at teaching hospitals, the federal government budgeted over $10 billion of mandatory funds in 2016. The majority of this money -- about 90% -- came from Medicare, and the rest came from Medicaid. These funds have been capped for 20 years.\u000a\u000aThe cap may also make the process more competitive for international doctors. American medical school enrollment jumped over 27% between 2002 and 2016 , according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. But this did not mean 27% more doctors are being trained in the US.\u000a\u000aWith the funding cap, more American graduates may come at the expense of international doctors, according to Dr. Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer with the Association of American Medical Colleges. The association has said that both American and international medical students are necessary to address the nation's health care needs.\u000a\u000aFernandez-Peña said that putting foreign-trained doctors to work in America is a no-brainer.\u000a\u000a"Why not invest in this freebie?" he asked. "They've already been trained. We would be reaping the benefits that (another) country has spent money in training their work force."\u000a\u000aReady to serve\u000a\u000aSome experts have defended the long road to medicine in the US, saying that the process is necessary to ensure the best quality care.\u000a\u000a"The primary mission of state medical boards is public protection," Dr. Humayun Chaudhry , president of the Federation of State Medical Boards , said in a statement. "These requirements are put in place to ensure that only individuals who are fully qualified to practice medicine are granted licenses."\u000a\u000aCurrently, he said, foreign-educated doctors in the United States come from nearly 2,000 medical schools in 160 countries.\u000a\u000a"It is through this process that the public can be assured of a consistent level of health care," Chaudhry said.\u000a\u000aOther experts say that foreign-trained doctors may actually outperform their American peers in some ways.\u000a\u000a"These guys often have better-honed clinical skills at the bedside than many of us will ever learn because they couldn't rely on all the technology that we have," said Dr. Atul Grover , executive vice president of the Association of American Medical Colleges.\u000a\u000aA study published in February in the BMJ showed that US patients treated by foreign-trained doctors were less likely to die within 30 days of a hospital stay.\u000a\u000aGroups like Fernandez-Peña's Welcome Back Initiative continue to help doctors from around the world earn back their white coats in the United States. He is also working with the American Public Health Association and Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California to introduce legislation that would help fund organizations that do the same kind of work.\u000a\u000aMinnesota is one state that awards grants to programs that help foreign-educated doctors who want to work in the United States. Its Department of Health has a roster of nearly 150 international medical graduates in the state, but the office suspects there could be up to 400, according to a February report.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"The majority is working in literally -- I kid you not -- in the McDonald's and driving taxis," Fernandez-Peña said of the doctors he has met through the Welcome Back Initiative.\u000a\u000aSulaiman, however, said she has no plans to back down.\u000a\u000a"I'm so hopeful that one day I will be able to serve at least my community here," Sulaiman said. "They did a lot for me, and I'd like to serve them."

It was two days after I finished shooting the last movie," Craig said. "Instead of saying something with style and grace, I gave a really stupid answer."\u000a\u000aThis will be the fifth time that Craig has played Bond. He made his debut in 2006's "Casino Royale" and is considered by some fans and critics to be the best ever to take on the iconic role.\u000a\u000aIt was announced in July that a new James Bond film would hit theaters in 2019.

aV(CNN) Apple cider vinegar is one of the most popular natural health products around, with claims for everything from sanitizing toothbrushes to whittling waistlines.\u000a\u000aBut how much of its popularity is based on hype? Could you be wasting your time or -- even worse -- harming your health?\u000a\u000aHere are 10 of the top ways people are using apple cider vinegar and what the science says.\u000a\u000aDiabetes\u000a\u000aWhat's the most popular use for apple cider vinegar? If a simple internet search is any measure, it involves diabetes.\u000a\u000aDietitian Carol Johnston has been studying the effects of the main component of any vinegar, acetic acid, on diabetic blood glucose levels since 2004. She's conducted 10 small randomly controlled studies and published six papers on the subject.\u000a\u000aHer studies indicate vinegar can help lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes; in those who are prediabetic, also called insulin-resistant; and even in healthy control subjects. The improvement was slight for all but those at risk for diabetes, she says.\u000a\u000a"In pre-diabetics, it was too good to be true," says Johnston, who is also associate director of the Arizona State University's School of Nutrition and Health. "It fell a good bit and stayed that way. It may be this is the group that could benefit the most."\u000a\u000aBut this antiglycemic response can be induced by any sort of vinegar, she says: red and white wine vinegars, pomegranate vinegar or even white distilled vinegar. She suggests adding it to salads, as in the Mediterranean diet, or diluting it in water and drinking it before a meal.\u000a\u000a"Basically, what acetic acid is doing is blocking the absorption of starch," Johnston says. "If my study subjects eat a starch and add vinegar, glucose will go down. But if they drink sugar water and add vinegar, nothing happens. So if you're having bacon and eggs, don't bother. It only helps if you are consuming a starch."\u000a\u000aIf you choose to use apple cider vinegar, be sure to tell your doctor, says nutritionist Lisa Drayer.\u000a\u000a"If you're taking a diabetes drug, the vinegar could amplify the effects of your meds," she warns, "and your doctor might want to adjust your dosage."\u000a\u000aMost important, if you're expecting vinegar to significantly alter or prevent diabetes, science suggests you reconsider.\u000a\u000aJohnston notes that there is no evidence, in her studies or others, to establish that connection.\u000a\u000a"I simply determine if your glucose level goes up and down," she says. "If I was to show that vinegar slows progression to diabetes, then I would need hundreds of people and millions of dollars to do the studies, because diabetes has a lot of causes, including genetics."\u000a\u000aWeight loss\u000a\u000aWeight loss, or dieting, is another popular use for apple cider vinegar and there is some evidence that it can help.\u000a\u000aThe most cited study was done with 175 heavy but otherwise healthy Japanese subjects. The 12-week treatment produced lower body weight, body mass index, visceral fat, waist measurements and triglyceride levels. Sounds great, right?\u000a\u000a"People didn't really lose that much weight," Drayer says. "Only 2 to 4 pounds in three months over a placebo. That's only a third of a pound a week."\u000a\u000aJohnston agrees the study showed "a very, very modest weight loss.'\u000a\u000a"In fact, I would say most people who are on a diet for 12 weeks and only lose a couple of pounds aren't going to be very happy," she adds.\u000a\u000aIf you are using apple cider or other vinegars as one part of an overall plan, combining it with a healthy diet, portion control and exercise, it might help, Drayer says. She suggested using balsamic vinegar on salads, in a 4:1 ratio with oil, or adding it to sauces for poultry and fish.\u000a\u000aThe best way to consume apple cider vinegar is on your salad, experts say.\u000a\u000a"If you were doing all the other things to lose weight, it might give you a slight edge," Drayer says. "Also, if you're drinking it in water, that's good, as water makes you feel full."\u000a\u000a"Sometimes, people get really excited to try something new, and then their other behaviors change, too," she adds. "So if this helps people be more careful overall, that's a good thing."\u000a\u000aTeeth cleaning and whitening\u000a\u000a"Some people like to use it to remove stains and whiten their teeth," according to one of many online articles touting apple cider vinegar for this purpose: "To try this, rub a small amount of apple cider vinegar onto your teeth with a cotton swab."\u000a\u000a"I let out an audible gasp when I read about this!" says Chicago dentist and American Dental Association spokeswoman Alice Boghosian. "It made me cringe, to be honest with you. What are people doing?"\u000a\u000a"You're putting acid on your teeth," Boghosian continues, "the last thing you'd want to do to promote oral health. What would be a healthier option is to brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes, with a whitening toothpaste with the ADA seal. That shows it's been tested to do what it's supposed to do."\u000a\u000aOther articles promote rinsing your mouth with apple cider vinegar, soaking dentures with a diluted mixture or using it to clean a toothbrush.\u000a\u000a"You just have to rinse off your toothbrush, get all the toothpaste out, and let it air out. That's all you have to do," Boghosian says. "Cleaning dentures or rinsing with vinegar is not a good idea. It too could put your teeth at risk. And just think how it might affect the metal on partial dentures."\u000a\u000aA pH of 7 is neutral, explains Boghosian; anything less is acid. She said many of today's popular apple cider vinegars are in the 2 to 3 range -- about the same as stomach acid.\u000a\u000a"Anything acidic which contacts your teeth will wear out the enamel, the protective coating, and that will cause cavities," Boghosian adds. "So, this is totally, completely wrong, unless you want to be paying more visits to your dentist."\u000a\u000aSkin, hair and nails\u000a\u000aCommonly suggested uses for apple cider vinegar across the internet include it's use as a treatment for skin infections and acne, fighting lice and dandruff, as a natural wart remover and as an anti-aging treatment.\u000a\u000a"It will dry out a pimple, but it's not an anti-aging method," says dermatologist Dr. Marie Jhin, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Dermatology. "It might fade dark spots, or maybe you could use it as a skin toner, if you dilute it a great deal. But I wouldn't recommend it. We have much more effective and safe methods today than this."\u000a\u000aOne use she can agree with: "I do love it for bites, especially mosquito bites. It's a very underutilized home remedy. If you have a lot of bites, put two cups in a full tub of water and soak. It will help with itching," she says.\u000a\u000a"It can also help with sunburn, although there are so many other good remedies," Jhin adds. "We don't usually suggest that to patients."\u000a\u000aApple cider vinegar might help with dandruff, says Jihn, because the acidity could increase the sloughing of the skin on the scalp, and it does have some antifungal properties.\u000a\u000aBut don't turn to it to get rid of head lice. One study found the use of vinegar to be the least effective method among several natural solutions; only petroleum jelly killed adult louse, but it did next to nothing to fight the eggs.\u000a\u000a"I love vinegar for Another use Jhin recommends:"I love vinegar for paronychia , an infection under the cuticle that a lot of people get," Jhin says. She suggests mixing one-fourth cup of vinegar with three-fourths cup of water and soaking nails.\u000a\u000aBut what about warts and other home uses?\u000a\u000a"Warts are caused by a virus, so there's no cure," Jihn explains. "You can dab a diluted version of apple cider vinegar on a wart with a Q-tip, and it's going to help remove dead skin, which is what we do in the office by paring it down, cutting it out or burning it with liquid nitrogen. But it's not going to be as fast or effective as what we do in the office."\u000a\u000aAmerican Academy of Dermatology spokesman Dr. Michael Lin, director of the Advanced Dermatology and Skin Cancer Institute in Beverly Hills, has a more negative perspective on home use.\u000a\u000a"I've had quite a few patients harmed by apple cider vinegar," Lin explains. "One terrible example was a man trying to treat genital warts. When he came into the office, the entire area was raw, burned by the vinegar.\u000a\u000a"I don't know if he was using it full-strength, but whatever he was doing it was too strong," he continues. "He probably has permanent scarring from that natural home treatment."\u000a\u000aLin says he feels more comfortable recommending distilled white vinegar, as it is created to a standardized formulation of 5% acidity.\u000a\u000a"With apple cider vinegar, you don't know what strength you're getting," Lin says. "It's depends on the brand, and even among batches within a brand, you could get different concentrations of acidity."\u000a\u000a"If you do choose to use apple cider vinegar, try to buy a name brand that clearly labels the acidity level. And whatever you do, don't use it full-strength."\u000a\u000aHe suggests a 1:10 ratio.\u000a\u000aAll-purpose cleaner\u000a\u000aBecause of apple cider vinegar's antimicrobial properties, it is often suggested as a natural cleanser for the home.\u000a\u000aThe acid is effective against mold, but according to the Pesticide Research Institute , an environmental consulting firm, so are salt, lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide, tea tree oil and baking soda.\u000a\u000aMany of those also smell better.\u000a\u000aApple cider vinegar is biodegradable, and because of its low pH, it's great against alkaline grime such as hard water and mineral deposits, as well as soap scum.\u000a\u000aBut it won't cut grease. Why not? Just think of a simple oil and vinegar salad dressing. After mixing, the oil and vinegar quickly separate because oil is nonpolar, while vinegar and water are polar, meaning they are not attracted to each other.\u000a\u000aWill apple cider or other vinegars sanitize or disinfect your home? Probably not enough to make you feel germ-free.\u000a\u000a2000 study also showed vinegars to be quite effective against the waterborne bacteria That2000 study also showed vinegars to be quite effective against the waterborne bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa , mostly found in hospitals and untreated hot tubs. It was also effective against Salmonella choleraesuis, a rare pig-borne version of salmonella.\u000a\u000aIf you do choose to use a vinegar to clean your home, never mix it with bleach or ammonia, because it will create toxic chlorine or chloramine gases.\u000a\u000aFood preservatives\u000a\u000aUsed for centuries to preserve everything from pickles to pig's feet, vinegar is now becoming popular as a natural preservative in processed meat and poultry items as well.\u000a\u000aMost home pickling uses 5% distilled white vinegar because it doesn't affect the color of the vegetables or fruits, but apple cider vinegar is a popular choice due to its mellow, fruity flavor. Do know, however, that it will turn most fruits and veggies dark.\u000a\u000aAnother popular use for apple cider, and other vinegars, is as a food wash to reduce bacteria or viruses on the surface of fruits and vegetables. Studies have had varying results, often depending on the type of fruit or vegetable and the amount of time spent in the vinegar solution.\u000a\u000aApple cider and other vinegars is used by some as a food wash to reduce the number of bacteria or virus on fruits or vegetables.\u000a\u000aAfter listing a number of studies and results, the US Food and Drug Administration sums it up: "Vinegar and lemon juice have potential as inexpensive, simple household sanitizers; however, possible negative sensory effects [color, odor] when used on produce would be a disadvantage."\u000a\u000aCough and sore throat\u000a\u000aThe use of vinegar medicinally starts with the father of modern medicine, Hippocrates. He would mix it with honey and use it for chronic coughs and sore throats, and the suggestion continues today across the internet.\u000a\u000aMany parents might think this is a natural and safe option for their children. The American Academy of Pediatrics doesn't have an official stance on the use of apple cider or other vinegars as a health aid, but spokeswoman Dr. Jennifer Shu urges caution.\u000a\u000a"I would just think that the vinegar would irritate the throat even more," says Shu, an Atlanta pediatrician and author of "Food Fights". "But diluting it and mixing it with other ingredients such as salt or honey might decrease any pain that the vinegar might cause."\u000a\u000aThe University of Arizona's Johnston cautions against trying any vinegar straight, due to the risk of inhaling the liquid and damaging the lungs.\u000a\u000a"Vinegar has that strong smell and puckering taste, so if you take a breath, you could inhale it into your lungs as you swallow," she says. "It can burn the lungs a little, because it is an acid."\u000a\u000a"It can also burn your esophagus," says Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado. "And if you're predisposed to reflux, ulcers or stomach problems, it could certainly make those worse."\u000a\u000aHeart disease and cancer\u000a\u000aIf you're a rat worried about heart disease, put apple cider and other vinegars on your shopping list.\u000a\u000aStudies show the vinegar can reduce blood pressure triglycerides and total cholesterol in rodents fed a high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet. But similar studies have not been conducted in humans.\u000a\u000aFreeman, who serves on the American College of Cardiology's prevention board, says there could be some benefit due to its antioxidant properties, like other heart-healthy fruits and vegetables, such as broccoli and blueberries.\u000a\u000a"The data is not particularly strong or overwhelming, but vascular health may be enhanced," Freeman says. "What's best to avoid heart disease is to exercise and eat a low-fat, plant-based diet."\u000a\u000aFreeman further recommends using apple cider or other vinegars on salads, to maximize the benefits and reduce any reactions to the acidity.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aStudies in humans are nonexistent.\u000a\u000aSo, does apple cider vinegar measure up to its positive internet reputation? If you consider that almost any other vinegar will produce the same benefits, not so much.\u000a\u000aThere are also some serious downsides, if used full strength and inappropriately. As the experts suggest, make sure you check with your doctor before giving it a try.\u000a\u000a"When do you a search for apple cider vinegar you see so many claims, and people will try it, searching for that natural cure-all," says Drayer.\u000a\u000a"Whether any of those claims are based on science is another matter."

She is also a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit organization that gathers research on American families. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) -- Some revolutions happen in a single day; others over decades. The rise of the voluntarily single woman has been happening in Western societies slowly, over time, concomitant with well-paying jobs, legal protection from economic or physical abuse, reliable birth control and the possibility of fulfilling careers and adventures.\u000a\u000aWomen are marrying at a later age these days, cohabiting with their partners or going in and out of short-term relationships without ever walking down the aisle.\u000a\u000aCurrently, 53% of women over 18 are in the singles column. Put another way, women now have choices that allow them to customize the arc of their lives and some of them find that it is best for them to put marriage aside.\u000a\u000aIs this natural? Is this bad? Is this cause for alarm?\u000a\u000aWe have long counted on women's sacrifices and the compromises they've made to lift societies all over the world. We are worried that if women delay or forgo marriage, the all-important family unit will suffer.\u000a\u000aAs much as I admire happy couples and families, I think this may be one of the few times in history when so many women could choose from such a full range of life choices without penalty or stigma. Since few people "have it all," why not choose being single if that's the best option?\u000a\u000aWhat it comes down to is people get married when it's a good deal. The question is why isn't marriage a good deal anymore? Here are some considerations.\u000a\u000a1. A useless husband\u000a\u000aIf a woman is poor and only meets equally poor or poorer men, she's in a tough spot. It is no secret that many women do not choose to marry if the available partners will make their economic situation worse.\u000a\u000aIn some of these cases, even if a woman has a child, she may be better off with government help than a nonworking, noninvolved husband.\u000a\u000a2. Success changes everything\u000a\u000aWhen a woman is very privileged or highly successful, marriage could come very easily -- or not. Think of the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times. Or Oprah Winfrey, who for personal or professional reasons, is not married.\u000a\u000aMoreover, a woman doesn't need a husband who is a high-powered corporate attorney if she is a high-powered corporate attorney. Taking advantage of economic and professional opportunities could be undermined by committing to a partner with an equally ambitious, or different, life agenda. This kind of woman may wake up every day to new and exciting challenges and think, "best to wait."\u000a\u000a3. Unwilling to make traditional compromises\u000a\u000aA woman who doesn't want to settle for cooking and cleaning and being the primary parent that society prefers. She is not meeting guys who want the kind of woman she is.\u000a\u000a4. The marriage penalty tax\u000a\u000aSome women are in an income bracket where marriage inflicts economic costs. She would have to pay more taxes if she marries someone who earns approximately what she makes or more.\u000a\u000a5. Avoiding cheating men\u000a\u000aA few years ago when I was in China, I had a conversation with some very beautiful female Chinese TV personalities about their personal life. I asked them why they were single and if they wanted to get married.\u000a\u000aThe three women all said they didn't want to marry because "the men of our class will all expect to have mistresses, and it is better not to marry than have to put up with that." I have no idea if this was an exaggeration or not -- but they believed it.\u000a\u000a6. Waiting for the "one"\u000a\u000aThese women wait for the perfect guy, or the guy who they would fall in love with and love them back just as much. If that man doesn't come along, they prefer to go alone. As women get pickier, more factors enter into the marriage equation.\u000a\u000aThey may find someone who doesn't quite go the distance even after years of dating. They cohabit with someone and it doesn't work out. Singlehood, never intentional, becomes a fact. But they will not marry just to marry as their mothers or grandmothers might have.\u000a\u000aIn social psychology, there is a classic theory called "exchange theory." It is a bit cold-blooded, but it predicts that a person's actions will be based on trying to find a balance of give and get. Each person's resources -- of all kinds, including money, looks, background -- are traded back and forth for a "good deal." For example, a "good deal" scenario could be a woman who makes an excellent living pairing up with a man who is a writer and is willing to work at home and be the primary child care person.\u000a\u000aWhen women's life choices were highly constrained, they had little negotiating power. They had to marry or were seen as damaged. A few got away with being "free spirits" but usually they were exceptional in wealth or lineage -- and even so, it wasn't easy.\u000a\u000aIt's different now. While most women still want marriage, they don't want it at just any price. They don't want it if it scuttles their dreams. Marriage is not dead -- not by a long shot. It is still, to most of us, the house we wish to build for our love, our lover and our children.\u000a\u000aBut women want to craft a life instead of having it pressed upon them. And that means some of us will be single for a long time, and some of us will be single for life.\u000a\u000aRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine\u000a\u000aFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\u000a\u000aJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion

aVAir Berlin has gone bust, but passengers needn't panic just yet.\u000a\u000aGermany's second biggest airline filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday after Abu Dhabi's Etihad -- its leading shareholder -- refused to finance another bailout.\u000a\u000aAir Berlin will continue flying for the time being thanks to a loan of \u20ac150 million ($176 million) from the German government. That should also allow all 7,200 employees to keep their jobs while executives try to restructure or sell the company.\u000a\u000a"Air Berlin's business has deteriorated at an unprecedented pace, preventing it from overcoming its significant challenges and from implementing alternative strategic solutions," Etihad said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"Under these circumstances, as a minority shareholder, Etihad cannot offer funding that would further increase our financial exposure."\u000a\u000aAir Berlin has struggled for years to turn a profit despite serving more than 2 million passengers a month.\u000a\u000aIt has been squeezed by bigger European low cost carriers such as Ryanair (RYAAY) and EasyJet (ESYJY), and competition from the no-frills divisions of national carriers.\u000a\u000aOne such rival, Germany's Lufthansa (DLAKY), said Tuesday it was in talks to buy parts of Air Berlin.\u000a\u000aRelated: Etihad CEO steps down amid strategic rethink\u000a\u000aThe failure of Air Berlin is a major setback for Etihad, which has invested just over \u20ac1.8 billion ($2.2 billion) in the carrier since 2011, according to an Etihad source who asked to remain anonymous.\u000a\u000aEtihad's once novel strategy of investing in other airlines has weighed heavily on the company's bottom line. Last year, it reported a hefty loss after booking an $808 million charge for its exposure to Alitalia, Air Berlin and other "equity partners."\u000a\u000aIt pulled the plug on Alitalia earlier this year, prompting the Italian national carrier to enter administration.

aV(CNN) It was on their first ever world tour in 1964 that the Beatles were catapulted from England's national sweethearts to global superstars.

aV(CNN) There have been times even Roger Federer has thought of walking away from it all.\u000a\u000aA stage before his name was immortalized and the records fell; a period in his glittering career when defeat was more common than victory.\u000a\u000a"It was tough," Federer tells CNN Sport, reflecting on his early years on the ATP Tour.\u000a\u000a"When I traveled internationally I would get beat up very often in the first round 6-2, 6-3. You go home and realize: 'Okay, you're good in Basel but you're not very good in the world.'"\u000a\u000aFederer knew he had a bright future \u2014 a junior Wimbledon title at the age of 16 proved that \u2014 but it took him three years to win his first ATP final.\u000a\u000aAs a boy he would often cry if he lost a match, hiding behind the umpire's chair. As he entered his adolescence, that sensitivity occasionally took the form of petulance.\u000a\u000a"When I was 12 years old, I was just horrible," Federer admitted in a 2003 interview with the Telegraph.\u000a\u000aOnlooking parents were banished and told to "go and have a drink." Rackets, on more than one occasion, were smashed.\u000a\u000aFederer, urbane idol to millions around the world, even walked away from one professional tournament on the Swiss circuit having made a financial loss, after the referee deemed he had violated the "best effort" ruling.\u000a\u000aIt took time to master his emotions and reach the state of tranquility he emanates on court today. It also required sacrifice, with Federer having to decide between football and tennis as a teen.\u000a\u000aAsked by CNN Sport earlier this year what separates the great from the good, he takes a second to consider.\u000a\u000a"His aura, his longevity," Federer replies. "What did he bring to his sport? Did he change the sport forever? What was his impact?\u000a\u000a"Popularity, style ... Was he a good role model?

The king vs. the young pretender. The first and only time the boy from Basel would ever play against his idol. A changing of the guard.\u000a\u000aComing into the fourth round clash, Sampras had more grand slam singles titles than any man in history, and hadn't lost a single match at the All England Club for five years -- only failing to win the prestigious tournament once between 1993 and 2000.\u000a\u000aHe left quietly, dethroned by a teenager.\u000a\u000a"There are a lot of young guys coming up," Sampras reflected , "but Roger is a bit extra special."\u000a\u000aFederer himself puts his success down to "drive" as much as transcendental talent.\u000a\u000aFor while the young Swiss was knocked out by home favorite Tim Henman in the 2001 quarterfinal, and stung by Croatian grand slam debutant Mario Ancic in the Wimbledon first round a year later, he's been returning to Centre Court ever since like he owned the place.\u000a\u000a"When you're young, it's very important to have that drive \u2014 even when you're defeated \u2014 to go back and hit up against a wall or a cupboard like I did," Federer says.\u000a\u000a"You do maybe take the hammer and the nail and put the racket up against a wall and say I'm going to walk away from it all ... but five minutes later you're going to pick it up again and you're going to play again. Hard work is key. Probably more than 50% of success at that point."\u000a\u000aAfter that shock defeat to Ancic, ranked No. 158 at the time, Federer didn't lose again on grass for six years.\u000a\u000aFrom July 2003 to September 2007, the game's undisputed star won 12 of the 18 Grand Slam titles on offer, sweeping aside all before him in Melbourne, London and New York.\u000a\u000aAn Olympic gold medal followed in Beijing, but one final frontier still eluded him: Roland Garros.\u000a\u000aThe career grand slam\u000a\u000aClay was the domain of another man, Rafa Nadal, and between 2006 and 2008 Federer had fallen to the Spaniard in three consecutive finals.\u000a\u000aJune 7, 2009: The day Federer finally lifted La Coupe des Mousquetaires, beating Sweden's Robin Soderling to equal Sampras's major record (14) and complete the coveted career grand slam.\u000a\u000aFederer called it his "greatest victory," breaking down in tears before a packed crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, telling them "now I can play in peace for the rest of my career."\u000a\u000aRoger Federer kisses the French Open trophy, having beaten Sweden's Robin Söderling (6-1, 7-6, 6-4) to complete the career grand slam.\u000a\u000aDetractors had questioned his desire, asking whether this elegant artisan was really up for the long slog on clay.\u000a\u000aBut Federer sat down with CNN Sport that day with the proof in his hands.\u000a\u000a"I always believed that I was good enough to get it," he said, "but actually holding this trophy after all that I've been through is an unbelievable feeling."\u000a\u000a"This victory comes at the right time because I've proved many people wrong."\u000a\u000aAsked what was left to motivate him after reaching the pinnacle of his sport, Federer alluded to his first ever Wimbledon victory.\u000a\u000a"It was all I ever wanted," he smiled.

aVSandakan, Sabah, Malaysia (CNN) With his wire-rimmed glasses and mild manner, Siew Te Wong could be described as a Malaysian Clark Kent.\u000a\u000aThis wildlife biologist is a Superman of sorts -- a tireless defender of the world's smallest bear species: the sun bear.\u000a\u000a"I often call the sun bear a forgotten species," Wong said. "When I first started, 20 years ago, no one has ever studied sun bears. Most people do not know that they even exist."\u000a\u000aAs he studied the animal and realized the threats it faced from deforestation and hunting/poaching, he knew the bears were in serious trouble.\u000a\u000a"The more I learn about them, the more I care. The more I care, the more I worry," he said. "I have to help them."\u000a\u000aToday, Wong's nonprofit, the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, is the only sun bear sanctuary in the world.\u000a\u000aWong -- known as "Papa Bear" -- and his team have rehabilitated and cared for 55 rescued sun bears since 2008. The group now also educates the public about these animals.\u000a\u000aSun bears are found in the rainforests of south Asia, and the small bears play a big role in keeping these woodlands healthy. Many plants and animals depend on them to spread seeds, create nesting sites and control the termite population -- functions that keep the ecosystems in balance. Healthy rainforests provide clean air and water to the entire world.\u000a\u000aBut the sun bear population has decreased by 30% during the last three decades. In 2007, the bear was officially classified as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u000a\u000aCurrently, 44 sun bears live at Wong's center -- all of them were orphaned by poachers or rescued from captivity. The center has also become one of the leading tourist destinations in the area, helping to raise awareness about the sun bear's plight.\u000a\u000aA sun bear explores the forest at the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre.\u000a\u000a"They can see how special the sun bear is and learn about how their survival (is) important to ours," Wong said, "so they can take some action when they go back to home."\u000a\u000aFor Wong, this work is simply his responsibility.\u000a\u000a"Sun bears became part of my family. When they're endangered, I care for them. When they are in trouble, I speak for them," he said. "I want to be the voice for the sun bear, to fight for the sun bear, to ensure the survival of the sun bear."\u000a\u000a"But my ultimate goal is to save the entire forest ecosystem ... that is so important to the survival of mankind."\u000a\u000aCNN spoke with Wong about his work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did you get involved with the sun bear?\u000a\u000aSiew Te Wong: I grew up keeping different pets and rescuing birds that fell from nests. I always wanted to be an animal expert or a veterinarian. After high school, I went to Taiwan to study veterinary science, and that's where I got involved with studying wildlife. In 1994, I came to the University of Montana to study wildlife biology and I met a professor, Christopher Servheen. He was looking for a Malaysian student to do a study on sun bears. I said, "I'm your man!"\u000a\u000aCNN: Tell me more about the threats these animals face.\u000a\u000aWong: Over the last 50 years, many of the tropical forests in this region have been cleared, and with deforestation, sun bears have lost their habitat. And even though sun bears are a protected species, they are hunted for their meat and their body parts, which are used in traditional Asian medicines. This is literally wiping out local populations.\u000a\u000aTheir babies are also kept as illegal pets. Their cubs are really cute, but people don't realize that this baby bear will turn into a destructive beast. In the end, they will either kill the bears or lock (them) in small cages. We are doing lots of educational awareness to make sure that people don't keep bears anymore.\u000a\u000aCNN: How do the animals spend their time at the center?\u000a\u000aWong: Every day after breakfast, we release the bears into the forest enclosure. This is where they learn to forage, climb trees, build nests and socialize. All of those activities help them get ready to be released and survive in the forest.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Siew Te Wong: Sun bears are not pets Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Siew Te Wong: Sun bears are not pets 02:43\u000a\u000aAt 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., we give the bears different fruits, and at 4pm, the bears come back and have dinner in the bear house. We keep them inside at night because this level of bear density in the forest is not natural. We also want to monitor their well-being. However, there are a few bears left out for the night, which is good. One day, they will live there all the time.\u000a\u000aCNN: How many bears have you been able to release?\u000a\u000aWong: We have released two bears so far, and this year we plan to release four more. There are many bears that we cannot release because they were in captivity for a long time. They lost their instinct to find food, they're habituated to people, and many that were rescued as adults cannot climb trees. There are also bears who (were) malnourished or who had their claws chopped off. They don't have the skills to survive in the forest, so they have to stay here for the rest of their lives.\u000a\u000aHopefully in the future, there'll be more bears ready to be released. I want bears to live in the forest and not in captivity. (That) is where they belong. It is their home.\u000a\u000aWant to get involved?

aVWashington (CNN) Shortly before Sen. John McCain entered the Senate chamber in the wee hours of Friday morning, reporters wanted to know how he'd vote.\u000a\u000aHe instructed them to "watch the show."\u000a\u000aMcCain killed his party's narrowly-crafted Obamacare repeal bill Friday not because he was opposed to dismantling the Affordable Care Act, but because he fundamentally believed the process -- the lack of hearings, the one-party, closed-door negotiations, the fact that in the end all that Republican senators could agree upon was a shell of the plan they'd promised -- was flawed.\u000a\u000aIt was a result that may have been hinted at earlier in the week.\u000a\u000aLess than two weeks after surgery to remove a blood clot revealed McCain had brain cancer, the Arizona Republican -- still with a visible scar above his eye -- traveled 2,000 miles from Phoenix and returned to a hero's welcome Tuesday in the Senate, where he delivered an epic 15-minute speech that rattled the conscience of the body.\u000a\u000a"We're getting nothing done, my friends," McCain told his colleagues. "We're getting nothing done."\u000a\u000aIt was a fiery and intense lecture on the shortcomings of bypassing "regular order" and turning your back on compromise. But moments earlier, McCain had delivered a decisive vote to advance a health care bill that was still an uncertain product at that point, a kind of blessing for the type of secretive negotiations he'd just decried.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The life and career of Sen.

Instead, McCain took a vote that very well may re-chart the course of Trump's own legislative agenda.\u000a\u000aTrump, of course, had insulted McCain back in 2015.

The clinically validated test, called PHQ-9, asks about energy, appetite and concentration levels, among other things.\u000a\u000aThe tech firm said it recognized that the information was "sensitive and private," and that it would not store the responses.\u000a\u000aGoogle (GOOGL, Tech30) said the initiative was developed in partnership with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).\u000a\u000a"The results of the PHQ-9 can help you have a more informed conversation with your doctor," wrote Mary Giliberti, CEO of NAMI.\u000a\u000aRelated: Women's voices are often missing in the health care debate\u000a\u000aClinical depression affects roughly one in five Americans at some point in their lives.

aV(CNN) There was a time when Barcelona fans did not expect success. To wallow in pessimism was the accepted norm. Trophies? Titles? They were for others, usually the reserve of the grandiose club of the capital, Real Madrid.\u000a\u000aThe European Cup was as elusive as the unicorn: talked about, looked at with wonder, pictured with others but never seen in this Catalonian city by the Mediterranean sea.\u000a\u000aA club like Barcelona, the nihilistic fans would say, would never reach the zenith of European club football. There was no bombast, no peacocking, just fatalism.\u000a\u000aThe ironhanded years of General Francisco Franco, whose dictatorial regime had crushed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy, had ruined the spirit.\u000a\u000aTrue, Barcelona had been able to sign football greats such as Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona, but two European Cup finals -- in 1961 and 1986 -- had ended in defeat and between 1961 and 1990, the club won just two league titles in Spain's top flight, finishing runners up 13 times.\u000a\u000aBut all changed on May 20, 1992.\u000a\u000aThat was the day Barcelona won its first European Cup. That was the day the club, its city, and football was transformed.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Xavi hails Barca's 1992 Dream Team Replay More Videos ...

Cruyff, the football revolutionary, now Barcelona's visionary coach, and his assembled team of artists, known as the "Dream Team," are at Wembley for the first European Cup final of the Dutchman's managerial reign.\u000a\u000aOpponents Sampdoria have poachers supreme in Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Mancini, but Barcelona can offset the Italians with Michael Laudrup, Pep Guardiola, Hirsto Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman.\u000a\u000aBarcelona Team Group. (Back Row L-R) Andoni Zubizarreta, Nando, Julio Salinas, Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov, Eusebio Sacristan, (Front Row L-R) Jose Mari Bakero, Albert Ferrer, Josep Guardiola, Juan Carlos\u000a\u000aIf it's a title-winning team of regal talent, Barcelona's fans, however, are preparing for the worst.\u000a\u000aMemories of the club's European Cup final defeat on penalties to Steaua Bucharest in 1986 are still fresh so supporters ask Cruyff to record a few soothing words for the return journey to Spain, a precaution should the worst happen.\u000a\u000aBut Cruyff, in his fourth year as Barca manager, wants his players to forget about the club's past. His battle cry as he sends his men out onto the Wembley turf? "Go out there and enjoy it."\u000a\u000a"It was more than a thorn in their side. It was something that was almost mythical, to get to that final and win it."\u000a\u000aFull-time turns into extra-time and the score remains goalless. Knees are knocking, in the stands and in the dugout. Penalties are looming. Fear.\u000a\u000aBut with less than 10 minutes remaining Barcelona is awarded a free-kick. Koeman, the sweeper with a sniper's eye for long-range goals, steps forward.\u000a\u000aWatching on television in Barcelona is a teenaged Xavi, an academy player who would go on to become one of the club's greats.\u000a\u000a"It was truly an extraordinary experience," the former Spain and Barcelona midfielder tells CNN as he remembers the match unfolding.\u000a\u000aTwenty-five yards from goal, Koeman shoots. He aims low towards the bottom corner. Defenders rush forwards, breaking from the defensive wall. The goalkeeper stretches and dives to his right. But they're all too late. They are beaten.\u000a\u000aKoeman scored 102 goals in 354 games during his career\u000a\u000aThe goalscorer sprints towards the sidelines and his teammates follow, swallowing him up in a jubilant wave of orange shirts when he is caught.\u000a\u000aWhen the blond Dutchman emerges from the celebratory mass, he is hiding his face in his hands, using his fingertips to hold back tears.\u000a\u000aHis is the winning goal, a strike which unshackles his club from the heavy weight of history. "It was the beginning of big changes," Koeman, who pulled on Barca's blue and garnet shirt over his orange top before lifting the European Cup, would later say.\u000a\u000aCruyff's Dream Team won four successive league titles between 1990 and 1994\u000a\u000aThe genius from Amsterdam\u000a\u000aCruyff had made an impact at the Camp Nou as a player, winning the title in his first season following a world-record move in 1973, but it was the Dutchman's appointment as coach in 1988 that changed the club's DNA.\u000a\u000aOn May 4, when Cruyff is announced as Barcelona's coach, the team is experiencing its worst season since 1941-42. The club is in debt and in crisis. They go on to finish sixth in the league, two points off 10th place, while Real Madrid celebrate a fifth straight La Liga title. Ignominy.\u000a\u000aHe had, Cruyff said, inherited players who "wanted to have fights about the past."\u000a\u000aCruyff died, aged 68, in 2016\u000a\u000aIn planning for the future a manic period of departures and arrivals follows -- 15 players are sold and 12 are bought. Cruyff, one of the greatest players of all time, took risks but rewards followed.\u000a\u000aAmong the newcomers are the young and eager Txiki Begiristain, Jose Mari Bakero, Julio Salinas and Eusebio Sacristan, a quartet which would become crucial cogs in the manager's Dream Team.\u000a\u000a"They were conditioned to coming second," says Hunter of the Barcelona squad Cruyff inherited.\u000a\u000a"He felt there was a losing mentality around Catalonia itself and that this was a product of years of oppression under the Franco dictatorship. Commenting on another tragic day had become a habit."\u000a\u000aTo accompany the change of personnel, came a shift in style. Naturally, Cruyff -- a three-time European Cup winner with Ajax -- wanted to win, but there was a way of winning. A philosophy, an identity.\u000a\u000aIn the era of 4-4-2, the young manager introduced the 3-4-3 formation -- an adaptation of the 4-3-3 system Cruyff had played under the coaching pioneer Rinus Michels for the Netherlands and Ajax in the 1970s.\u000a\u000aCruyff reached the 1974 World Cup final with the Netherlands, who were lauded for their 'Total Football' style, but were beaten 2-1 by West Germany\u000a\u000a"We couldn't believe how many attackers were in the team," Eusebio, who made more than 250 appearances under Cruyff, said of the day the boss first drew three defenders, four midfielders, two out-and-out wingers and a center-forward on the blackboard.\u000a\u000aThis radical change would require players to be comfortable interchanging positions. They would have to press, they would have to pass swiftly. Possession would reign supreme, which was not an easy task in a club where defenders were usually jeered for passing the ball back to the goalkeeper.\u000a\u000aFor Cruyff to implement this cerebral approach, he needed a production line to supply him with possession-hungry players. Cue the overhauling of La Masia, the club's academy. Barcelona would never be the same again.\u000a\u000aDifferentiating Barcelona from the rest\u000a\u000aEvery team, from the under-eights to Barcelona's B team, were ordered to play the revolutionary 3-4-3, with an emphasis on technique rather than physique, another volte-face for a club which, as recently as 1986, selected young players based on whether they would be taller than 1.80m.\u000a\u000aFirst off the conveyor belt were Albert Ferrer, Guillermo Amor and Guardiola, the 1992 history-makers.\u000a\u000aFor Carlos Hugo Garcia Bayon, a former assistant coach at Barcelona B, winning the European Cup with academy graduates in the side was confirmation that Cruyff's methods worked.\u000a\u000aBayon tells CNN: "It was that victory which changed the culture and mentality of the club. They won the European Cup, but won it playing a specific style and with a lot of players from La Masia.\u000a\u000a"It was something unique, something that differentiated us from others.\u000a\u000a"Without a doubt, if you have a methodology and that methodology doesn't win, you are going to lose confidence to play players from the academy."\u000a\u000aCesc Fabregas, one of La Masia's graduates, holds aloft the World Cup trophy after Spain won the 2010 final\u000a\u000aFrom that famous Wembley win, other world class seedlings blossomed at the La Masia hothouse: Xavi, Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas, to name but a few.\u000a\u000aAll of them, bar Messi, integral to not only Barcelona's success but that of the Spain team which won the World Cup in 2010 and two consecutive European Championships in 2008 and 2012.\u000a\u000a"They were the generation who paved the way for us," says Xavi of the European Cup-winning Dream Team. "They gave Barcelona a winning mentality. It was an example for all of us."\u000a\u000aHunter says academy players grew up "thinking anything was possible" after seeing the likes of Guardiola succeed on the biggest stage of all.\u000a\u000a"The brand of football we saw from 2003-12, the unbroken stretch of success, those types of players, the promotion from the youth system, the attitude, the winning mentality, all of these have geneses in the Wembley victory over Sampdoria," he says.\u000a\u000a'Now you have it here'\u000a\u000aFrom Wembley to Barcelona and a dizzying week of celebrations for the club's European pioneers.\u000a\u000aOn the balcony of Placa de Sant Jaume, stood Cruyff's men, soaking up the adulation of their fans, holding aloft the European Cup. Fantasy had become reality.\u000a\u000aA 21-year-old Guardiola, the Catalan symbol, shouted: "Citizens of Catalonia -- now you have it here."\u000a\u000aThe midfielder, says Hunter, had prepared in advance, modifying a phrase used by Josep Tarradellas, named "President in absentia" by his people in 1954 during the Franco dictatorship, when on the same balcony in the city's gothic quarter 15 years earlier.\u000a\u000aThe Dream Team's European success, combined with the Olympic Games which was held in the city later that summer, transformed Barcelona and its people.\u000a\u000aHunter describes the summer of 92 as the "one of the most important summers in the history of Barcelona and Catalonia."\u000a\u000aThe football club, whose slogan is 'more than a club' for its defense of the Catalan culture and language, became Catalonia's most important institution. The radical shift was not solely on the pitch.\u000a\u000aSpreading the Cruyff gospel\u000a\u000aNovember 25, 2012, the day the teachings of Cruyff, his vision for a team full of La Masia pass masters becomes reality.\u000a\u000aBarcelona is playing Levante in a league game. In the 14th minute Martin Montoya replaces Brazilian full-back Dani Alves. It is the first time in Barcelona's history that the entire first team comprises of players who graduated through the club's now famed academy. It is the legacy of Cruyff and the 1992 European Cup win.\u000a\u000a"La Masia is a football school but also a school of values, a school of life," explains Xavi.\u000a\u000a"It is something to feel proud about. We now have 20 to 25 years of harvesting titles for Barcelona and playing an attractive style of football for the fans."\u000a\u000aGuardiola won 14 trophies from a possible 19 in his four years as Barcelona coach\u000a\u000aGuardiola, the great player who became the club's most successful coach, has often said that he and other Barcelona managers have simply been restoring, or improving, the chapel that Cruyff painted.\u000a\u000aThe Catalan himself created a football masterpiece, winning 14 trophies in four golden seasons between 2008 and 2012 with one of the greatest teams in history, the heart of which were other wordly academy talents.\u000a\u000aFor Bayon, currently academy director at Celta Vigo, the transformation of the Dream Team from playing greats to high-class managers is another lasting legacy of that 1992 win, with Cruyff's former players spreading his gospel in various leagues around the world.\u000a\u000aIn England there is Guardiola at Manchester City and Koeman at Everton, while Eusebio is in La Liga. The latter two are being linked with succeeding Luis Enrique as Barca boss when he leaves at the end of this season.\u000a\u000aThere are others too: Michael Laudrup managing in Qatar, Txiki Begiristain, an unused substitute at Wembley, as sporting director at Manchester City and Andoni Zubizarreta in Marseille as the French club's sporting director.\u000a\u000a"They have become great managers, that's one of the most important thing from that victory. It generated a culture of coaching. It is not only to generate great players, but great coaches," says Bayon.\u000a\u000aAn identity changed\u000a\u000aAnd so, to the future. What about the Barcelona of today?\u000a\u000aUnder Enrique, who will depart at the end of the season having won the Champions League and two Spanish titles, does the legacy of Wembley 1992 still run through the side like letters in a stick of rock?\u000a\u000aOf the title-chasing Barcelona team which started in the 4-1 victory over Las Palmas on May 14, only four players -- Sergio Busquets, Messi, Iniesta and Jordi Alba -- had played for the academy. Alba, released by the club in 2005, was repatriated seven years later at a cost of 14 million euros ($15.49m) from Valencia.\u000a\u000aPossession has not always been king for Enrique's Barcelona, although there have been significant departures during the Spaniard's reign.\u000a\u000aAged 35, Xavi left in 2015 to play in Qatar, following another academy great, Carles Puyol, who retired in 2014, out of the Camp Nou.\u000a\u000aSuarez, Messi and Neymar have been lethal goalscorers for Luis Garcia's Barcelona\u000a\u000a"No youth system will be able to produce that generation repeatedly on demand," says Hunter. "It's just not feasible, but the tail-off has been pretty dramatic and has inevitably changed the football Barcelona play.\u000a\u000a"When you sign from outside they don't have the same aptitude, they don't speak the same football language.\u000a\u000a"There are fewer youth products available to Enrique than there were to (Frank) Riijkard and Guardiola and it's also been a strategic idea that the front three -- Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez -- need to be given the ball more quickly and with less elaboration because they're different strikers to any in the club's history.\u000a\u000a"They need less work, they're able to score on their own so the midfield is sometimes bypassed.\u000a\u000a"The identity of the first-team football in the last two-and-a-half years has significantly changed, but the actual existence of the youth system in unchallenged, it's part of their identity."\u000a\u000aIfs, buts, maybes\u000a\u000aGuardiola has already said he would vote for Pique should his former run for president at Barcelona.\u000a\u000aIs this the closing chapter of a glorious Cruyff-inspired quarter of a century of success? Not quite.\u000a\u000aIn Xavi, Pique, Busquets and Puyol, Barcelona could have former pupils as zealous off the pitch for their brilliance on it.\u000a\u000aXavi has already said he dreams of one day managing his former club and has divulged a plan which would have the club run exclusively by former La Masia graduates, with Pique as president, Puyol as sporting director and Busquets as his assistant.\u000a\u000a"If we talk in 10 years' time, I imagine some president will have attempted, and succeed, in appointing Xavi as first-team coach, with Busquets as his assistant," says Hunter.\u000a\u000a"It's Pique's declared intent to run for presidency at one stage of his life. That would be the most dramatic induction of Cruyff and Guardiola values into the club."\u000a\u000aAcademy graduate Messi is Barcelona's all-time leading goalscorer, netting over 500 times for the club\u000a\u000aHow different would Barcelona's history be had they not won in 1992?\u000a\u000aThe trophy cabinet tells a story: Three league titles in the 25 years leading up to the Dream Team's European Cup success, 13 thereafter and four nights of Champions League glory -- a total of 44 trophies in 25 years and their status as one of the sport's dominant forces fixed.\u000a\u000aPessimism replaced with confidence, fatalism defeated, and the club's global status only reinforced by the style -- dubbed tiki-taka -- that accompanied that success.\u000a\u000aHad Barcelona not won in 1992, they may have had greater motivation, Hunter argues, in the 1994 Champions League final against AC Milan, which they lost 4-0.\u000a\u000a"They were complacent, they believed they would win for sure," he says.\u000a\u000aBut without European success under Cruyff there is less glue to hold his system in place.\u000a\u000a"You can't say whether they would have won other Champions Leagues because each of the Champions Leagues subsequently won after 1992 have direct lineage to Cruyff and his beliefs," says Hunter.\u000a\u000a"With no trophy under Cruyff then Barcelona's history is subsequently going to be much poorer and the trophy cabinet is going to be more barren.\u000a\u000a"No European Cup win under Cruyff and the subsequent history, which we've become so used to -- the signing of Messi, the recruitment of Iniesta -- probably wouldn't have happened."

aVSenator Mushahid Hussain is Chairman of the Pakistan Senate Defence Committee. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) President Donald Trump's much touted Afghan strategy -- which is a U-turn on his original views -- is essentially a facelift of a tried, tested and failed formula.\u000a\u000aIt is a surge, of sorts, backed by a rap on the knuckles for Pakistan (which remains an abiding and favorite scapegoat for US failures in Afghanistan). It is a sop to India, more symbolic than substantive. And it gives carte blanche to the military to pursue what is now an unwinnable war without end against a faceless and stateless enemy.\u000a\u000aPakistanis would critique the Afghan strategy of President Trump on three counts.\u000a\u000aFirst, 16 years and $1 trillion later, what can 4000 more American troops do which over 100,000 American troops could not achieve?\u000a\u000aSecond, injecting India into Afghanistan -- whom Pakistan accuses of using Afghan territory to foment violence in Pakistan's border regions -- is a sure recipe for a Pakistan-India proxy war on Afghanistan soil.\u000a\u000aThird, with no military solution in sight for Afghanistan , regional diplomacy, involving Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia, is more in need than anything listed above.\u000a\u000aAlthough President Trump has said that he recognizes the "contributions and sacrifices" of the Pakistani people who have "suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism," he has also accused Pakistan of "continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists."\u000a\u000aSuch talk is counter-productive, given the Pakistani people's sacrifices ( over 60,000 soldiers and civilians dead ) and the fact that Pakistan today is probably the only Muslim country to have waged a successful anti-terror fight.\u000a\u000aAs a pivotal regional player, Pakistan today has greater room for maneuver in foreign policy. Pakistan has a close rapport with China and Russia as well as the Central Asian republics, serving as the hub of a growing regional economic connectivity. And US clout and leverage is much diminished today.\u000a\u000aWith Modi's India divided and polarized -- and bogged down in problems with neighbors like China, Nepal and Myanmar -- Pakistan has strategic space in which it can operate.\u000a\u000aDespite all the above, Pakistan can see a small glimmer of hope. President Trump has clearly spelled out his definition of victory in Afghanistan, which he reduces to "preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan." So when President Trump talks of an "honorable and enduring outcome," it is similar to President Nixon's "peace with honor" mantra just before exiting Vietnam.\u000a\u000aMoreover, Trump, for the first time, has put the onus on the Afghan government , stating "our commitment is not unlimited and our support is not a blank check," and the "government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden" adding, he is looking for "real reforms, real progress, and real results," plus warning Kabul that America's "patience is not unlimited."\u000a\u000aThere is also a new emphasis on the economic dimension as part of the overall diplomatic and military strategy towards Afghanistan. This was made clear when Trump talked about India. He said that it "makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan especially in the area of economic assistance and development."\u000a\u000aHaving taken this long to formulate what is essentially new wine in an old bottle, the politician in President Trump probably saw an opportunity to score some points with his domestic audience while announcing a foreign policy -- something he has struggled to do in the past.\u000a\u000aUnlike Russia, where he has refused to be critical of Putin, on Afghanistan, he has conveniently conformed to the traditional position of the American security establishment.\u000a\u000aApart from sharing the American Establishment worldview on Afghanistan, he has also outsourced the war to his generals and commanders in the field where he has made it clear that there will be no "micro-management from Washington DC" and that he has already "lifted restrictions placed by the previous administration on action to be taken in the battlefield".\u000a\u000aBy handing over responsibility to the military, should the outcome be negative, Trump feels he will escape the blame or the consequences of defeat.\u000a\u000aWith little over 40% of Afghanistan already under the influence or control of the Taliban , according to the most recent quarterly report to the United States Congress from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), Trump's war rhetoric is a throwback to the last days of the Vietnam War, when President Nixon resorted to the Christmas Bombing of Hanoi in December 1972 with the intention to bring the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong to the conference table.\u000a\u000aVery soon, the realization will dawn on President Trump that the road to peace in Kabul lies through Islamabad, and Islamabad will be ready for the call that will come from Washington seeking a helping hand to extricate the United States from the Afghan quagmire.

aVGayle Tzemach Lemmon is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations . She is the author of "Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield." The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) America is trying to learn the lessons of its post-9/11 wars. And in his speech to the nation Monday evening, Donald Trump, the third US President to grapple with the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, promised not nation-building, but terror-pursuing.\u000a\u000aMost importantly to those in Afghanistan and those in Washington who long argued for America's sustained involvement in the country, he also announced a longer-term commitment to the war-scarred nation, shaped not by timelines in Washington but facts on the ground in Afghanistan\u000a\u000aThis was the kind of speech that Afghan officials I have spoken with over the last decade have long hoped for -- and one that Afghan hands at the State Department had long hoped their president would give. Now, the challenge comes in the form of the execution -- the what's next -- and whether the details will be the bolstering or the undoing of this next iteration of policy in America's longest war.\u000a\u000aThe Afghanistan War, which began after terrorists struck the United States on September 11, 2001 -- way back when many now entering the US military and potentially heading to Afghanistan were barely toddlers -- long ago became background noise: military wallpaper for a nation that had largely forgotten it was still underway.\u000a\u000aBut for less than 1% of this nation, which has fought 100% of its wars, the Afghanistan battlefield became the land of multiple deployments, a place where their lives changed while their nation barely noticed.\u000a\u000aThe politics of the conflict have long been driven by facts on the ground in Washington: the pendulum swung from a full engagement in the Afghanistan War at the outset, just after 9/11, to an Iraq-driven diversion in which assets and attention headed to Baghdad and beyond.\u000a\u000aThen came the Obama administration, its months-long policy review riddled with media leaks and a timeline-focused mission in which the United States and NATO hustled to score as many victories as they could in search of meeting an ill-defined goal. In 2011, President Barack Obama said the "tide of war" was receding when it came to Afghanistan, but those words came even as American forces landed in Kandahar and Kabul and Jalalabad.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Ryan: US can't telegraph Afghanistan plan Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ryan: US can't telegraph Afghanistan plan 01:13\u000a\u000aThe idea was to withdraw all US forces come 2014. But 2014 became 2015 -- as ISIS rose in the Middle East and different groups in Afghanistan began carrying the black flag -- and then 2016 and now more than 8,000 forces remain in the nation, split between advising and assisting Afghan forces and a special operations-focused counterterror mission. This last one, battling terror groups, has morphed into an ISIS fight of late. And it is claiming US lives.\u000a\u000aThe Trump review included those with years of Afghanistan experience -- national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford -- and a Pentagon-led group filled with those who had spent time in Afghanistan and, in some ways, been shaped by it.\u000a\u000aThey faced a cast of policy players filled with deep skepticism concerning further Afghanistan involvement, including the now-departed Steve Bannon and even, to some extent, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the President himself. As national security team members told me in July, we don't feel we have good options here.\u000a\u000aBut having few good options does not change the facts. And the reality is that Afghan forces have been defending their changing nation -- a country whose young generation is increasingly congregating in cities, increasingly connected to the outside world and increasingly hungry for education and a better, more peaceful future for their country -- and losing soldiers at an alarmingly high rate in the process. In one year Afghan security forces lost nearly as many soldiers as the United States military has lost in both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars since 9/11. This is not to minimize those losses for even a moment, but to show that far from being a force that is unwilling to die for its nation, many already have.\u000a\u000aAfghanistan is far from a perfect nation: Women and girls face unspeakable violence. Child marriage is a reality. Tradition trumps the nation's laws. Corruption is widespread. And the national unity government is rickety at best. But this is the same nation that has two women governors. That has produced an all-girls robotics team. That is home to a thriving media. That has millions of children in school. And is on the front lines of the fight against extremism in an incredibly tough geopolitical neighborhood.\u000a\u000aIt is both too easy and too simple to dismiss the entire effort in Afghanistan as a waste from which America should walk away when there is a local military in place that is shedding blood in the fight against extremism. Sending the "few thousand" US troops to bolster Afghan forces that Gen. John Nicholson said in February he wanted is an investment in the stability of a nation that wants to be more and needs more security to do so. And it is a far less costly option than sending US ground forces back in the tens of thousands -- something no one on any side wants to see in his or her lifetime.\u000a\u000aA third American president is now battling with his Afghan War legacy. And while the options have gotten little better in the intervening 17 years, the chances of making a difference in helping a struggling nation fight its own wars has.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Thirty-five years ago, alert physicians in the United States spotted a new disease, caused by a virus that had been in circulation, unnoticed, for decades in people, and millennia in monkeys.\u000a\u000aThe virus had hit pay dirt, racing through the gay sexual revolution where one man might have sex with 30 other men a year, giving the virus exponential rates of infection\u000a\u000aOver time, the virus' transmission shifted, especially in Africa, from rare cases of monkey-to-human transmission to general heterosexual spread, with women today five times more likely to be newly infected compared to men, thanks to sexual cultures that favor male promiscuity.\u000a\u000aThat was HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which currently infects more than 37 million people living all over the world.\u000a\u000aA key lesson of AIDS is that a virus\u2014in HIV's case, infecting African monkeys\u2014might pass rarely, but repeatedly, to human beings for decades before arriving in a context of epidemic potential.\u000a\u000aAdapting to new modes of transmission and targeting novel species, the microbe can exist for thousands of years before beginning to achieve previously unimaginable feats, with devastating impact.\u000a\u000aNow the world is facing a virus that seems poised to make a similar leap: the Zika virus.\u000a\u000aLike HIV, Zika originated in central Africa, very rarely infecting human beings, and circulating among rainforest primates. Unlike HIV, Zika had the ability to fly, carried by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from one monkey or human, to another.\u000a\u000aSince reaching Brazil in 2013, where it has spread explosively over the last 12 months, Zika has demonstrated capabilities not seen, or extremely rarely noted, with any other insect-carried microbes.\u000a\u000aMost worrying, Zika has shed its mosquito transport dependency, becoming an efficient resident of human semen , and spread from male-to-female (and male-to-male) via sexual intercourse.\u000a\u000aThis week researchers reported finding Zika in a woman's vagina, noting that, "the very presence in the female genital tract [implies] that sexual transmission from women to men could occur." And barely had the ink dried on that report when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced today that a woman who traveled in a Zika-hit country, who got infected through a mosquito bite, has passed the virus onto her male sexual partner in New York City, marking the first documented case of female to male sexual transmission in the U.S. (and the 14th documented sexual transmission in the U.S. overall).\u000a\u000aIf Zika finds its way into an especially sexually active community, it could well become a threat not only in America's southern, mosquito-infested states, but anywhere in the world.\u000a\u000aLike HIV, the Zika virus would likely find its way into populations that feel discriminated against by the general population, and take its toll disproportionately among teenage girls and young women.\u000a\u000aAnd while politicians play partisan games with funding on Capitol Hill, government and philanthropic donors ignore the World Health Organization's pleas for a measly $122 million to fight it, and state health agencies scramble to find anti-mosquito resources, the virus is spreading in new ways , causing an ever-widening range of dangerous birth defects and human illnesses.\u000a\u000a"I am concerned that the goose is cooked. This funding is done. It's not coming to us," Dr. Umair Shah, a public health official in Harris Country, Texas told NBC News . "We cannot spray our way out of this situation," Shah added, saying pesticides won't be enough to stop Zika at this late date in the American South.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What twins can tell us about Zika Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What twins can tell us about Zika 03:14\u000a\u000aThe lingering Ebola epidemic in West Africa offers lessons on the difficulty of stopping a virus that takes on sexual transmission and can abide in semen for weeks after a man has recovered from the disease. Several times in 2015 and 2016, Ebola seemed to have been eradicated from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia, only to reemerge via sexual transmission\u000a\u000aThe statistics on Zika as a sexually transmitted disease are sobering. According to the World Health Organization , the Zika virus has emerged in 48 countries since Brazil sounded the alarm in October 2015.\u000a\u000aFour of those countries have active mosquito-borne spread of the virus underway now, and eleven of them\u2014including the United States\u2014have documented sexual transmission of the virus. Two Americans have died of Zika , one in Puerto Rico and the other in Utah. They were among the 1,132 travel-related Zika cases documented in the United States. Among the 50 states, Florida has been hardest hit to date, with 263 confirmed cases, 43 of them pregnant women, followed by Texas.\u000a\u000aPolitics should not trump biology\u000a\u000a"No pregnant women should have to worry that her baby will develop brain damage because she was bitten once by a mosquito," a petition to Congress from the March of Dimes states. "It's an outrage that Congress has failed to give states and localities the resources they need to protect pregnant women and babies from Zika virus."\u000a\u000aThe Zika funding stalemate on Capitol Hill might well result in an increase in the numbers of abortions in the United States this year\u2014an ironic and tragic outcome of a political squabble that features, among other disputes, Democrats' objection to House Republicans' inclusion of anti-Planned Parenthood language in the GOP's Zika bill\u000a\u000aIn Latin American countries hard hit by the virus, abortion rates have soared this year by as much as 108%, which research suggests is due largely to women who feared carrying a "Zika baby" but had no access to tests that could confirm the healthy viability of their fetus. Such tests don't exist: American women have no special advantage in the Zika fight, despite the greater wealth of the United States.\u000a\u000aIn a few days, the Republican Party will gather for its national convention in Cleveland, Ohio\u2014a metropolis that last year ranked in the top twenty most mosquito-infested cities in the United States. At the end of this week, Congress will shut down for the summer, and the politicians will not return to hammer out new agreements until September 6.\u000a\u000aBarring a remarkable compromise, the politicians will exit Washington on Friday, leaving funding for Zika prevention and research in the lurch , with the White House, Senate, and House each offering radically different funding proposals, none of which will materialize as money for research.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in all tiers of public health across America, scientists and officials are scrambling to rob other budgets in order to finance research and mosquito control measures. At local levels, this ironically means things like sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) programs are losing money, so that counties can hire mosquito abatement experts.\u000a\u000aAt the federal level, the remaining Ebola programs are seeing their budgets pilfered to provide temporary Zika funds, and a range of basic science research initiatives at the National Institutes of Health are on hold , their funds diverted to efforts to understand, diagnose, treat and vaccinate against Zika.\u000a\u000aVital questions about Zika, especially as a sexually transmitted disease linked to birth defects, are going unanswered, thanks to the research funding gap.\u000a\u000aCan the world's blood supply be cleansed of Zika risk with transfusion?\u000a\u000aHow likely is it that sexual transmission could dominate spread of Zika in the United States?\u000a\u000aHow long can Zika survive in semen and cause infections?\u000a\u000aHow does the virus get through the placenta to infect the developing fetus?\u000a\u000aIs it possible to create a 100% reliable fetal test for Zika infection and brain damage that can be used to guide decisions regarding pregnancy termination?\u000a\u000aAre the risks greater in a particular stage of pregnancy?\u000a\u000aWhy aren't sonograms reliably identifying microcephaly babies in utero?\u000a\u000aCan a mother give birth to Zika-damaged babies if she never had symptoms of the disease?\u000a\u000aAre there ways that women can protect themselves and carry babies to term, short of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to delay pregnancies altogether?\u000a\u000aHow can a potential Zika vaccine be safely tested on pregnant women and their babies\u000a\u000aIn the absence of answers to these and other Zika questions, women are compelled to make dire decisions, including opting for abortions\u000a\u000aIs Zika becoming a sexually transmitted disease?\u000a\u000aWhile HIV and Ebola offer potential roadmaps for how this might happen, it's still an open question. Researchers in Brazil took a deep dive into the country's data for dengue, a virus spread by the same Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as carry Zika, analyzing of the disease's diagnoses in 2013, 2015, and early 2016.\u000a\u000aThey paid special attention to the distribution of dengue by age and gender. And they did the same for Zika cases in the country over 2015 and 2016. If all Zika cases were due to mosquito bites, the demographic distribution of dengue and Zika should match. But that's not what they found\u000a\u000aInstead, 90% more Zika cases were registered among women, compared to the female rates for dengue.\u000a\u000aNeighboring Colombia has also seen far more Zika in females, with young women accounting for two-thirds of the 65,726 cases diagnosed by mid-April 2016.\u000a\u000aResearchers note that though the infection rate was similar in very young children of both genders, "the incidence was significantly higher among female patients than among male patients in all other age groups."\u000a\u000aCritics charge that both the Brazilian and Colombian studies may simply reflect the greater fear women have about exposure to Zika during pregnancy, prompting more of them to seek medical care. The researchers disagree, insisting that the higher rates of diagnosed Zika are seen in young women, whether or not they are pregnant or are trying to conceive.\u000a\u000aOne reason young women may be at higher risk is that they are having more sex with male partners whose semen may remain Zika-contaminated and infectious for months\u000a\u000aSuch a pronounced gender difference wasn't seen in the Zika outbreaks in Pacific Island nations between 1990 and 2013, but there have been subtle genetic changes in the virus since its arrival in the Americas. Are these mutations relevant to sexual transmission? That is another research question scientists would like to answer, if Congress ever provides funding.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Mothers of Zika babies shunned by society Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mothers of Zika babies shunned by society 02:13\u000a\u000aAt the end of June, frustrated scientists at the NIH decided to charge ahead with pregnancy and sexual research, despite congressional gridlock, by putting numerous other disease studies on temporary hold.\u000a\u000aA large study, tracking women over time in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, has begun enrolling volunteers. "We are going out on a limb, but we have to," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters . "We can't say we're going to wait until we get all the money."\u000a\u000aWhen microbes gain capacity to be sexually transmitted, they rarely disappear from the human population group in which they emerged.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, for instance, physicians in San Francisco noticed that drug-resistant Staphylococcus, MRSA, was far more prevalent among gay men compared to any other demographic group; the bacterial disease had become a STD , soon surfacing among gay men in Boston and New York.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, European researchers discovered that a virulent form of the bacterium that causes meningitis was spreading sexually among gay men. By 2015, gay men were dying from the new STD, and this year, public health officials all over the United States are begging gay men to get vaccinated as meningitis outbreaks surface nationwide.\u000a\u000aHow to prevent a sexually transmitted Zika catastrophe?\u000a\u000aSo what can we do to stave off a similarly catastrophic turn of events with the Zika virus? According to the CDC , 287 pregnant women living in the United States were diagnosed as Zika-infected by June 23, and another 250 in U.S. territories. There is no reliable test that can tell these 537 women whether or not the virus has passed to their fetus, gnawing away at their tiny, developing brains. In the United States and beyond, women especially are in desperate need of such a test.\u000a\u000aA recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans have heard of Zika, which means an alarming third of the population knows nothing about the disease, and is unlikely to take precautions against infection.\u000a\u000aFewer still\u2014less than half\u2014were aware that Zika could be passed sexually. In the absence of such knowledge, sexually active Americans are unlikely to use condoms.\u000a\u000aAround the world, intriguing puzzles abound. Jacqueline Silva de Oliveira lives in Santos, Brazil, where she contracted Zika during her pregnancy\u2014either via a mosquito or sexually, it is not known\u2014and gave birth to twins in February.\u000a\u000aToday, Lucas is a healthy, happy infant, but his twin sister, Laura, suffers in agonizing pain thanks to Zika microcephaly -- which slaughters brain cells and results in complete remodeling of the brain in development.\u000a\u000aThe Brazilian government is monitoring six such sets of twins , discordant for Zika microcephaly, in hopes of learning how the virus infects (or doesn't infect) fetuses.\u000a\u000aIn France , a healthy couple trying to have children sought in vitro fertilization. The clinic assisting them tested their blood and his semen for various infections, including Zika: they were fine.\u000a\u000aThe couple took a holiday in the Caribbean nation of Martinique, returned to France, and underwent more tests. The man's blood was free of Zika, but about a month after they were back in France, the woman became infected. Examination of her partner's semen revealed Zika. Neither of them ever had symptoms of illness, nor felt any reason to avoid sex or use condoms, as they were a married couple trying to have a baby.\u000a\u000aHere at home, time is running out. Researchers desperately need funding to provide the tools required to forestall a sexually transmitted Zika epidemic in the United States.\u000a\u000aIn the absence of those tools, women will make difficult choices, deferring pregnancies for months, perhaps years, and seeking abortions.\u000a\u000aThe stalemate on Capitol Hill may actually increase the likelihood that more American babies will be born with terrible malformations and neurological deficits. And, equally horribly, that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of couples will seek abortions based on suspicion of Zika infection, possibly terminating some healthy pregnancies.

aV(CNN) The idea that you can be overweight or obese yet healthy -- if factors such as your blood sugar, blood pressure or cholesterol levels are normal -- is a myth, according to a new study, and messaging around this should be changed.\u000a\u000aCarrying those extra pounds can increase risk of coronary heart disease by up to 28% even if your other results appear normal, further disproving the notion that people can be "fat but fit."\u000a\u000a"We conclude that there is no such thing as being healthy obese," said Camille Lassale, an epidemiologist from Imperial College London's School of Public Health, now based at University College London, who led the research. "You are at an increased risk of heart disease."\u000a\u000aBut more recent studies have gone against this belief, showing that people with excess weight still have a greater chance of developing heart disease than those with a normal weight.\u000a\u000aThe latest study, published Monday in the European Heart Journal , confirms that stance.\u000a\u000aProving that risk increases with excess body mass\u000a\u000aLassale's team conducted the largest study to date investigating the impact on heart health when people are overweight or obese, as well as when they are "metabolically unhealthy," such as having elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, triglycerides (which store fat in your body) and waist size or having reduced levels of HDL cholesterol, the "good" form, which the body needs.\u000a\u000aThese factors combine to cause metabolic syndrome, which increases risk of various heart-related conditions, including heart disease and stroke.\u000a\u000aThe team used data from more than 7,600 adults who experienced coronary heart disease -- when coronary arteries are blocked and can cause a heart attack -- and categorized them by their body mass index as well as by their metabolic health, such as high blood sugar levels. They also used data from 10,000 healthy controls to represent the general health of the population being sampled.\u000a\u000aPeople were sampled from the larger European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which contains data from more than half a million people across 10 European countries. People within the samples were first separated into two groups, healthy and unhealthy, based on whether they had three or more of the markers for being "metabolically unhealthy," followed by separation by BMI to class them as normal weight, overweight or obese.\u000a\u000aBMI is the ratio between weight and height, with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 considered overweight and over 30 being obese.\u000a\u000aThose in the metabolically unhealthy group were at greater risk for coronary heart disease, with unhealthy obese people having the highest risk.\u000a\u000aBut the researchers then looked within the group classified as "metabolically healthy" -- without risk factors such as high blood sugar. They found that within this seemingly healthy group, people who were overweight or obese had a greater risk of heart disease than normal weight people: 26% increased risk in those who were overweight and 28% increased risk in those who were obese.\u000a\u000a"Even if you are classified as metabolically healthy, (excess weight) was associated with an increased risk of heart disease," Lassale said. "It's another brick in the wall of evidence that being healthy overweight is not true."\u000a\u000aThe risk is much higher in the unhealthy group, Lassale added, but she highlighted the need for those without signs such as high blood pressure not to rest on their laurels. "(They) seem to be at an intermediate risk," she said. "We saw that they went on to develop (more) heart attacks."\u000a\u000aBut the team members acknowledge that they cannot say with certainty why those carrying extra weight went on to have more heart disease.\u000a\u000aHealthy now, unhealthy later\u000a\u000aThe larger European study from which these data were obtained collected only information such as BMI, blood pressure and blood sugar at the start of the study. For the 12 years after those data were collected, people were followed up only to identify whether they had experienced aspects of coronary heart disease, such as a heart attack.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We couldn't monitor the evolution of their metabolic health," Lassale said. "They probably went on to be metabolically unhealthy."\u000a\u000aWhat she does know, however, is that this further emphasizes the need to prevent the burgeoning obesity epidemic.\u000a\u000a"This reinforces the fact that obesity in itself is a risk factor," Lassale said. "Every effort should be made by health professionals to advise on lifestyle changes regardless of these metabolic factors." These factors are likely to become abnormal if weight is not controlled, she added.\u000a\u000a"This study provides robust evidence that there is no such thing as 'healthy obesity,' " said Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, who was not involved in the study. "The take-home message here is that maintaining a healthy body weight is a key step towards maintaining a healthy heart."\u000a\u000aNick Finer, honorary clinical professor at the National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes at University College London who also was not involved in the study, added that it "supports the ever-pressing need for governments, local authorities, public health bodies and individuals to seriously address the issues leading to our current levels of overweight and obesity."

I had just begun a personal project of challenging my lifelong assumption that God exists.\u000a\u000aYou see, I had been a Seventh-day Adventist pastor for 19 years. I resigned from my pastoral position the year before , but now I stepped away from my faith altogether. It was a gut-wrenching decision but I couldn't see any other way to find peace and clarity. I encountered major theological differences with my denomination and evangelical Christianity in general, including the way it marginalizes women and LGBT people.\u000a\u000aRyan Bell\u000a\u000aI questioned the problem of evils and God's general silence and inactivity. I sought out more liberal theologies and found them to be the slow death of God.

aV(CNN) As Republicans hash out the details of their health plans, dental associations around the country are looking nervously at the future. It has been little talked about, but the dental coverage that children receive and the coverage some adults get through their state's Medicaid plans and those offered on exchanges could soon disappear.\u000a\u000aThat's because the bills in the House eliminate the requirement that all plans, including Medicaid, carry the 10 essential health benefits that were written into law in Obamacare. One of those benefits is pediatric dental care. Instead, Congress would leave it up to states to decide which benefits policies must contain.\u000a\u000aThe bills also make Medicaid a block grant . Block-granting the health care coverage program for low-income Americans would cap spending and give states direct control over the program. It's a policy change conservatives have long had on their wish list and the White House has said it supports that change. If the bills go through, it could also mean that states will have less money to spend on coverage and may force them to make tough choices on what plans would cover.\u000a\u000aReimbursement rates to dentists would also likely drop, meaning the list of providers would likely shrink. With a smaller budget and without a requirement that states cover dental, experts in the dental community worry the coverage may be some of the first to go.\u000a\u000a"We have seen a lot of innovation in states in terms of coverage of oral health as of late, we don't want to see that progress rolled back," said Libby Mullin , a consultant on government affairs issues for the Children's Dental Health Project, who was instrumental in negotiating pediatric dental as a benefit under the Affordable Care Act. "Oral disease really starts with the pregnant mother who can transmit the disease to her child; so, by age 2, children can have progressive and chronic problems. The longer we wait, because of the progressive nature of oral disease, the more expensive the problems become."\u000a\u000aThe policies aren't extensive, but the Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment benefit does, at minimum, cover the costs of maintenance of a child's dental health, restoration of teeth and relief from dental pain.\u000a\u000aFor adults, the states that choose to offer coverage typically give limited coverage, mostly restricted to extractions and emergency services. Typically, there is a cap on how much can be spent on an adult's care and the benefits vary by state.\u000a\u000aHistorically, when budgets get tight, adult dental is one of the first benefits to go, although the benefits will change from year to year. For example, Illinois eliminated coverage for non-emergency services for adults in 2012, but in 2014 expanded services again to include basic procedures such as root canals, fillings, dentures and oral surgery.\u000a\u000a"Coverage translates into care," said Mike Graham, senior vice president of government and public affairs with the American Dental Association A study in February showed that a growing number of children have been covered since 1997, and the unmet dental needs in this group decreased as well. That means parents have been using this benefit to help keep their kids' teeth healthy.\u000a\u000aThe ADA has been lobbying Congress to keep coverage. It is also lobbying to encourage more transparency about plans offered through the exchanges. That way, when people purchase insurance, they can clearly see if dental is one of the options and also make sure there is an adequate number of in-network providers.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHealthy teeth are vital to overall health. Oral health problems are linked to heart and lung disease, stroke, diabetes and poor birth outcomes. Americans also miss more than 164 million hours a year of work due to oral health problems or dental visits, one study showed . Damaged teeth can keep people from getting a job or from having healthy social relationships. And when dental coverage declines, studies show this costs everyone. Emergency room visits for tooth problems go up, for instance, when there is no coverage.\u000a\u000a"We don't want anyone to lose their coverage," Graham said. "Coverage for this group truly benefits everyone."

aV(CNN) Away from the cameras, President Donald Trump quietly signed a bill Thursday that allows states to withhold federal funds from organizations that provide abortion services.\u000a\u000aThis is not the end to federal funds for Planned Parenthood, as many Republicans have been calling for, but it is what experts characterize as a first step.\u000a\u000aThe move may embolden states to make additional moves to restrict women's access to abortion, they say, and caught in the middle may be millions of Americans who use Planned Parenthood or other health clinics for other family planning services such as contraceptives, for breast cancer screenings and for sexually transmitted disease screenings.\u000a\u000aMore than 20 million American women rely on publicly funded family planning care, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive policy group. It provides infrastructure support to a network of about 4,000 clinics (PDF) across the country.\u000a\u000a"We are talking about restricting access to care for the most underserved and vulnerable populations who rely on these family planning safety net services," said Kinsey Hasstedt , senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute.\u000a\u000aThe new law rolls back a rule that went into effect two days before Trump's inauguration in January.\u000a\u000ahave tried, to pass laws that stopped federal funds from going to any clinic that provides abortions. The rule clarified that this was illegal. The Obama administration rule essentially said that the only way states and local governments could withhold federal funds from providers is if the facility was unable to provide family planning services. Over the past several years, more than a dozen Republican-controlled legislatureshave tried,to pass laws that stopped federal funds from going to any clinic that provides abortions. The rule clarified that this was illegal.\u000a\u000aThose federal funds, called Title X, are competitive grants that go to affordable family planning providers. The initiative started in 1970 and is the only federal grant program dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services. Federal law does not allow the money to pay for abortions, although it is not legal for a state to withhold funds from a provider applying for a grant solely because abortion is one of the services it offers.\u000a\u000aNot all Planned Parenthood facilities or health clinics take Title X money, but some agencies use it to offset the cost of providing free or low-cost services to patients who would not otherwise be able to afford such care. about 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from Title X funds, according to the group.\u000a\u000aRepublicans tried to defund all of Planned Parenthood with the health care bill that failed to pass last month. The new law passed only after Vice President Mike Pence stepped in to break a tie vote.\u000a\u000aAlthough the law does not go as far as some conservatives would like, Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health , said it is far from trivial.\u000a\u000a"Those who will be possibly impacted by this are often the sole providers of health care for these patients. They provide Pap smears and breast cancer screening and many other preventative services, and it is not so easy to find other providers to take up the slack if these providers don't receive the funding," he said. Training staffers to offer the kind of services and counseling these centers offer may be a real challenge in some areas of the country that rely on the clinics, he said.\u000a\u000aWomen can often obtain quicker and more convenient care from Planned Parenthood facilities than from other clinics. The majority offer same-day appointments, while only 42% of health departments do, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute . The average wait time for initial contraceptive care at Planned Parenthood is 1.2 days, but it is 4.1 days for health departments and 2.5 days at federally qualified health centers. And 78% of Planned Parenthood centers offer extended hours in which women could get care after work or on the weekend, whereas only 57% federally qualified health centers and just 18% of health departments do .\u000a\u000a"I'm concerned without these preventative health services for women, it could increase unintended pregnancy and possibly increase the number of abortions women may need If they won't be able to access contraceptive methods that they want to use," Grossman said.\u000a\u000aPlanned Parenthood condemned the new law.\u000a\u000a"People are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access health care, and this bill is just the latest example. Planned Parenthood strongly opposes President Trump's willingness to undermine millions of women's access to birth control through the Title X family planning program," the organization said in a statement.\u000a\u000aMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List , who attended Trump's closed-door signing ceremony, was pleased with the "victory" in giving states options.\u000a\u000a"We expect to see Congress continue its efforts to redirect additional taxpayer funding away from Planned Parenthood through pro-life health care reform after the spring recess," she said in a statement.\u000a\u000aStates that have found ways to restrict funding to these facilities, like Texas, have seen an impact on access to care overall, studies show.\u000a\u000aIn 2011, Texas cut its family planning budget from $111 million to $38 million. Afterward, one in every four clinics in the state closed or stopped providing family planning help altogether. The clinics that remained didn't often provide all forms of contraceptives such as IUDs, and many organizations that had provided free or low-cost care had to start charging, a study showed. Surveys found that women had less access to preventive care, and the childbirth rate for women covered by Medicaid went up.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe new law does not take the country to that point, the experts said. But some who study family planning services think it is a hint at the future, at least in states that have tried to impose restrictions.

aVStory highlights A judge recently ruled in favor of Maine truckers because of a missing Oxford comma\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter: Oxford commas ward off ambiguity, but need not be used all the time\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "Words on the Move." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) A recent court case seems like a victory for fans of the grand old Oxford comma. To many, it feels natural to write "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cleveland." But just as one may feel lazy saying "My brother and me went home" rather than "My brother and I," there is a sense that it is more proper to write "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland," inserting a comma after the item before the last one.\u000a\u000aAnd people advocating for the Oxford comma have a point now and then. If you were a trucker reading that union rules deny you overtime pay for "the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of agricultural produce," would you consider yourself due overtime payment nevertheless for distribution? That is, as opposed to packing things for shipping and distribution?\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter\u000a\u000aTruckers for Oakhurst Dairy in Maine have been granted back overtime pay for having distributed product as opposed to packing it, because though the writers of the contract meant that overtime would not be granted for distribution either, this is not clear when there is no comma after shipment. The drivers' lawyer has successfully argued that the contract appears to stipulate that overtime won't be granted for, only, the packing of things for future shipping and distribution.\u000a\u000aBut it's premature to read this as demonstrating that everybody should always use the Oxford comma. What happened here shows, just as defensibly, that the Oxford comma should be used in cases of potential ambiguity. The people who wrote the union contract made a mistake, but not in way that means all of us should feel bad about writing "hamburgers, hot dogs and French fries."\u000a\u000aWe might feel slovenly, however, for writing "I had toast, bacon and eggs and coffee" where one could argue that it's unclear whether the bacon and eggs went together or eggs and coffee did, or "My parents, Mother Teresa and the Pope," which implies a rather stunning parental history in casting those two people as your parents, as opposed to persons in sequence with your parents.\u000a\u000aRead More

"I really tried my best to give my best every single day because I knew every day would be a new challenge ... I really feel the championship was a success."\u000a\u000a"I always knew it was going to be a very difficult competition. I knew it was going to take a lot out of my body.

These are Republicans saying they will never vote for you. Marco Rubio himself even used that hashtag. What do you think of that?"[TRUMP] "Well, he can do whatever he wants. You know, I signed a pledge. And the pledge is a two-way street. And if it's not that way, you're going to have a big problem. They're going to have a big problem with me. We have tremendous amounts of people. We have - as you know, you know, I'm going to Alabama today. We're going to have 25,000 people and probably more than that. We had to go to a football stadium because no building held it. And we're going to have an amazing crowd. And yesterday in Tennessee, I had 15,000 people in a hangar. In Arkansas, you probably saw that one in the morning. In Arkansas, we had about 15,000 people in a hangar. And, you know, we have a lot of people. I'm representing people. I'm not representing myself. I'm representing a lot of anger out there, and there's - we're not angry people, but we're angry at the way this country's being run. And a lot of them are angry - angry at the way the Republican Party is being run, Jake\u2026.. [TAPPER] I want to ask you about that, because Republicans in Washington, D.C., are starting to tell Republican senators that they don't have to go to the convention if you're the nominee, that they should think about running against you if you're the nominee. That, combined with Marco Rubio doing the #neverTrump hashtag, do you think Republicans are violating the pledge? [TRUMP] Totally. Totally. I mean, if they want to play that game, I can play it much better than they can. And I have a lot more people than they do - and, you know, totally. If they're doing that, that's a total violation of the pledge, yes.\u000a\u000aTrump on his tax returns: "Well, number one, I fully disclosed my financials. And I put them in actually right on time. And nobody else did, by the way, but I put them in on time. And it's almost 100 pages of financials. And it shows over $10 billion. If you figure it out, it's over $10 billion in net worth. And it's an amazing company with great cash flow, very little debt, all of that. You can't tell anything from tax returns, because you take deductions, massive deductions and lots of other things. And you can't tell very much from a tax return. You really can't tell anything as to that. As far as gifts, I give a lot of money. I could probably release a lot of the gifts that I have given over the years. And I probably will do that some time next week. We will just make a listing of the various monies that I have paid for two charities. And I think that's a good idea, actually. But I can't release tax returns when there's an audit. Now, it's very unfair. I have been treated very unfairly by the IRS, because I have been audited almost every year for 10 or 12 years. And I have friends that are very rich people. They never get audited. And so I think I have been really singled out. I don't know why I'm singled out, maybe because I'm a - very conservative, maybe because I'm Tea Party. I feel Tea Party. I have always been sort of that feeling of Tea Party. I have always had great Tea Party support. I don't know what it is, but I have been singled out."\u000a\u000aTrump on the Anti-Defamation League's call to condemn David Duke: "\u000a\u000a[TRUMP] "Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. " [TAPPER] "But I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is, even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing you. Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support? " [TRUMP] "Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I would have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong. " [TAPPER] "The Ku Klux Klan? " [TRUMP] "But you may groups in there that are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So, give me a list of the groups, and I will let you know." [TAPPER] "OK. I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but..."[TRUMP] I" don't know any - honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him."\u000a\u000aTrump on who he would choose as his Vice President: "Well, I have a great business ability. I have always had a great business ability. And I built a great company. And I don't need that, really, I don't believe, for what I'm doing. I would want somebody that can - you know, that does have a little bit of an insider track, so we can get things through Congress. He can work - he or she can work with me on getting, you know, papers filed, papers approved, so we don't have to use executive orders, like President Obama is always using his executive orders because he can't get - he just can't get anything approved. He can't get anything through. So, I would like the idea - I mean, just conceptually - it doesn't mean I'm going to do that, but, conceptually, I like the idea of a political person to go along with my abilities. Now, I'm a very political person also, which people are just about starting to find out. But I would rather have, I think, somebody that's political that can help. But the most important position - now, look, for vice president, you have got to pick somebody who's going to be a great president, because, if something should happen - hopefully not - but if something should happen, the single most important quality would be a person that can be a great president."\u000a\u000aFULL POST

Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.\u000a\u000aPandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living.\u000a\u000aDiverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing. For Pandya, these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the Huaorani.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) In the nutritional world, conventional wisdom suggests that the more often you eat, the more likely you are to burn off those calories and control hunger pangs. And so the notion of eating six or more "mini-meals" each day, just enough to fuel your body and tide you over until your next bites, has often been recommended as a more waistline-friendly dieting approach than eating three larger meals. But science evolves, and the answer to whether you should eat many mini-meals or three bigger meals is no longer a straightforward one.\u000a\u000a"Years ago, we all believed that you needed to eat multiple times a day to keep your metabolism stoked. ... You had to keep feeding the fire and keep the furnace burning. But that theory goes back and forth, and newer research is showing that it really doesn't slow metabolism if you're not eating multiple times a day," said Martha McKittrick, a registered dietitian in New York City who has provided weight-loss counseling for over 20 years.\u000a\u000aSmall frequent meals vs. fewer big meals\u000a\u000aBut while eating small frequent meals can discourage large swings in blood sugar, decrease hunger and prevent impulsive snacking throughout the day, other studies suggest that eating more often may not be optimal.\u000a\u000aAnd despite the notion that eating more often means more opportunities to burn calories, thanks to the energy involved in digesting, absorbing and metabolizing food's nutrients, research suggests that doing so does not appear to significantly enhance metabolism or total calories burned.\u000a\u000a"In the '80s, grazing was thought to be an optimal way of losing weight ... but human studies did not support this at all," said David Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has researched the topic of meal frequency and its effects on calorie intake. "It was thought that if you ate more frequently, the amount of calories you retain would go down, and more calories would be burned. But controlled experiments in humans show that there is no metabolic advantage to eating 12 smaller meals versus eating three or four meals per day, with the same total number of calories."\u000a\u000aOther experts agree. "Meal frequency does not affect metabolic rate and thus has no direct effect on weight loss," said Carla Wolper, a registered dietitian and nutrition consultant at the ColumbiaDoctors Executive Health assessment program who spent 25 years on the nutrition faculty at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center.\u000a\u000aIn fact, some research suggests that eating even fewer than three meals may be best in terms of controlling calories: In one study , when individuals skipped breakfast, they consumed about 400 fewer calories for the entire day compared to when they ate breakfast.\u000a\u000a"If you decrease the number of occasions to eat, your total calorie intake goes down," said Levitsky, who authored the study. "People think if you skip breakfast, you will overeat later ... and that doesn't happen. Your intake goes up, but not nearly as much as the amount that you skipped."\u000a\u000aAn eating pattern for every body\u000a\u000aSo should you give up on a diet plan of six or more mini-meals, spaced a few hours apart? Not necessarily. The optimal timing of eating may depend on various factors unique to each individual.\u000a\u000a"Some folks are grazers by nature, so six small meals might be more in line with their natural inclinations. Other folks eat by the clock, at 7 a.m., 12 p.m. and 6 p.m., for example. The real issue regarding temptation at mealtime is planning. If people have a great food plan, they will probably do well," Wolper said.\u000a\u000aMcKittrick agrees. "Some are grazers; some are meal-eaters. ... It's fine if they graze, but make sure calories are controlled so it's not an ongoing graze-fest."\u000a\u000aThe case for small, frequent meals\u000a\u000aWhile some may enjoy sitting down to three meals each day, others may find that it's just too much food at once.\u000a\u000a"Some people don't have huge appetites. ... If they have a 600-calorie sandwich, they may have half at noon and eat the other half at 3 p.m.," McKittrick said. "Eating large meals may also make them tired ... so they're better off with small frequent feedings because it promotes more stable blood sugar and they get more energized."\u000a\u000aOne's daily routine may not allow for the opportunity to take a big lunch break -- and so a grazing style of eating is a better fit.\u000a\u000aFor a new mom, eating three meals a day can be particularly challenging. "Lots of mothers spend so much time with their kids that they can't sit down and have a full lunch ... so eating more frequently better suits their lifestyle," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aHealth issues may also dictate which style of eating is best. For example, people who have diabetes or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can feel shaky, tired and weak if they go too long without eating, so six small meals may be best. Those who have other health conditions including gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome and acid reflux may feel better by eating small meals spaced three or four hours apart. The same may be true for seniors.\u000a\u000a"A lot of seniors can only have a piece of toast and an egg, and then they get full. As you get older, you just don't have as much of an appetite, and you feel full more quickly," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aThe case for three bigger meals\u000a\u000aExperts say that eating more frequently may be problematic for those who have trouble with portion control or something known as stimulus-bound eating, when the sight of a specific food prompts you to eat it, which can lead to weight gain.\u000a\u000a"The bulk of the evidence suggests that humans are opportunistic eaters ... and if we are given more chances to eat, the more we will eat," Levitsky said. "If people did nothing other than eliminate snacks, their total calorie intake will go down."\u000a\u000aA 500-calorie smoothie, for example, will defeat the strategy's purpose. "If you want to eat small frequent meals, take a look at your calories and really divide them up. If you're on 1,500-calorie diet, are you really having five 300-calorie mini-meals?" McKittrick asked.\u000a\u000aAn "all or nothing person" may be better off with three meals per day if a small snack quickly turns into a bigger one, as in the case of nuts. "Nuts are super healthy, but some people can't stop once they start eating nuts, and that can be a problem," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aThe environment plays a role, too. If your office has a kitchen full of free snacks, it's a lot easier to go in and grab something like chips or cookies instead of planning your own healthy meals and bringing them in.

"Some just want to eat and get it done with, so they don't do well with small snacks. ...

aVRepublicans are trying to diminish the Congressional Budget Office's importance even before it issues its review of their Obamacare repeal bill.\u000a\u000aLawmakers are calling out that the agency repeatedly overestimated how many people would gain coverage on the Obamacare exchanges. Republicans want to downplay the score of their bill, which is expected to show that millions could wind up uninsured.\u000a\u000aThe CBO's report is expected Monday.\u000a\u000aRelated: GOP tries to discredit agency reviewing its health care bill\u000a\u000aIt's true that CBO thought more people would flock to the Obamacare exchanges.\u000a\u000aWhen the law originally passed in 2010, it estimated 21 million would gain coverage through them in 2016. Three years later, just before the exchanges opened, the agency upped the figure to 22 million.\u000a\u000aThat didn't happen. About 10.4 million were actually enrolled last year, according to the Department of Health & Human Services data.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, the exchanges did not turn out to be as vibrant as expected. But their enrollment was also dampened because fewer employers stopped offering coverage than the CBO originally thought, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. This would have sent more people looking for policies on the exchanges.\u000a\u000aAnd, more Americans turned out to be eligible for Medicaid, further reducing the number of folks buying policies on the exchanges.\u000a\u000aHowever, the agency was much closer to the mark on Obamacare's overall impact on coverage. In its original 2010 estimate, CBO thought the insured rate for non-elderly adults would rise to 92% in 2016. It tempered that view somewhat in 2013, after the Supreme Court ruled that expanding Medicaid was optional for states. The revised forecast was that 89% would have coverage in 2016.\u000a\u000aIt turns out that 89.7% of Americans under age 65 had insurance last year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. That's up from 83.4% in 2013, before the exchanges opened and Medicaid expansion officially began. (A few states launched the program earlier.)\u000a\u000aRelated: Millions could lose insurance under GOP Obamacare repeal bill, S&P reports\u000a\u000a"Where people get coverage matters, but what's most important is that they are covered at all," said Matt Fiedler, a Brookings Institution fellow who served as chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration.\u000a\u000aBecause there are fewer people on the exchanges, CBO overestimated how much the law's coverage provisions would cost overall. Originally, it expected the net cost would be $132 billion in 2016. However, it lowered that estimate to $110 billion in the estimate it released last year.\u000a\u000aThe agency's review of the Republican bill's impact on coverage is expected to be ugly. But it's impossible to expect the CBO to hit the number exactly, Goldwein said. Its projection is in the center of a range of potential outcomes.\u000a\u000aMostly importantly, the agency has a long history of credibility and neutrality, he said.\u000a\u000a"It's not novel to beat up on the refs," Goldwein said. "We can feel confident that whatever they put forward will represent their best, unbiased estimate."

aVThere is no Olympics and no US presidential election in 2017, so we\u2019ve added some new questions this year. Where will Donald Trump visit first as president? Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize? Check out the predictions for these questions and more:\u000a\u000aHow did they do? CNN legal analyst Paul Callan deserves a special shout out for being the only person to predict both a Donald Trump election victory and that the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series, although the strong performance of the Dow Jones Index in 2016 took all our contributors by surprise.\u000a\u000aAbout this time last year, we asked a group of CNN commentators for their predictions for some of the big political and cultural events of the year.\u000a\u000aPaul Callan CNN Legal Analyst @PaulCallan Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Trump will travel to the one country on Earth that will warmly welcome the new US President while Americans cheer as well: Israel. He is respected there for his pro-Israel and anti-Iranian foreign policy positions. Daughter Ivanka\u2019s conversion to the Jewish faith won\u2019t hurt, either. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Patriots will win again, this time using fully inflated footballs. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Martin Scorsese\u2019s 28-year \u201cpassion project\u201d Silence, a film about the Japanese Roman Catholic rebellion against the Tokugawa shogunate in 17th Century Japan will win the Oscar for Best Picture. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Great Britain\u2019s Andy Murray will once again win the men\u2019s final while Germany\u2019s Angelique Kerber will win the woman\u2019s title. Who will win the World Series? Chicago Cubs do it again with their strong, young team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for her humanitarian efforts regarding Europe\u2019s growing Muslim refugee crisis. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The Dow will hit 22,000 as lower taxes and fewer government regulations stimulate a growing and vibrant US economy. Sadly, air quality diminishes as fossil fuel use skyrockets with the acquiescence of the EPA. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? While Presidential approval ratings are generally high during the first \u201choneymoon year,\u201d constant controversies will prevent Trump from ever getting a traditional honeymoon. He will, nevertheless, achieve a high 55% approval rating as the US economy improves in 2017 because in the words of James Carville: It\u2019s \u201cthe economy, stupid.\u201d\u000a\u000aDanny Cevallos CNN Legal Analyst @CevallosLaw Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Traditionally, the first state visit is to Canada\u2026but how likely is Donald Trump to feel bound to tradition? He\u2019s already been to Mexico and met with President Enrique Peña Nieto -- a country everyone believed he\u2019d long ago alienated. So, although it sounds unbelievable, maybe\u2026the Philippines? Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots -- because America loves a dynasty. Doesn\u2019t it? America? Hello? Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? "Manchester by the Sea"! Everyone\u2019s already said it\u2019s going to win the Oscar and I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea what it is even about yet. The majority is clearly behind this film and the majority vote is always right, right? Hello? Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Wimbledon? Ummm. I\u2019ll say that guy Murray. And a Williams? A Williams will win the women\u2019s final. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Based on the buzz right now..."Manchester by the Sea". Who will win the World Series? As insufferable as all my Chicago friends have been, the Cubbies will win the Series again. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? My \u201clockzilla\u201d prediction is 19,500. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? I\u2019m going to say 35%, but then again, predicting the predictability of polls is\u2026unpredictable.\u000a\u000aLanhee Chen CNN Commentator @lanheechen Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Israel. It's our staunchest ally and friend in the Middle East, a region that Trump will likely place significant focus on as he begins his presidency. Which team will win the Super Bowl? Even with their starting quarterback injured, I'm going with the Oakland Raiders. It's my team and the closest they've been to the playoffs in a long time, so I'm sticking with them. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? "Moonlight." I don't follow these things closely but Google says it's an incredible film. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray and Madison Keys. Who will win the World Series? Los Angeles Dodgers. Here again, picking my team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis. He's overdue. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 22,100. Think it will be another strong year for markets, as the Fed acts predictably and investors look forward to Trump's pro-growth policies. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 50%. It remains a divided country, but a productive first 100 days should carry him to a decent showing at year-end.\u000a\u000aSE Cupp CNN Commentator @secupp Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? The layup is, of course, to say Russia, right? But I'm betting it's Israel or the UK. Which team will win the Super Bowl? I'm required to say the Green Bay Packers. But the Patriots will greedily win it again. Because it's been nearly a year. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Most early Oscar buzz is for movies that are just about to come out, so it's hard to say. But I will lose my ISH if it's a Star Wars product. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? My New York Metropolitans! Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? If there is any good left in the world, it should be the White Helmets, who have done more to stem the Syrian genocide than any other group or body, voluntarily and at great sacrifice. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 20,000, baby! What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 60%+\u000a\u000aFrida Ghitis CNN Opinion Contributor @FridaGhitis Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Donald Trump likes to make brazen, unpredictable moves. A visit to China would fit the bill. He has been needling Beijing, with provocative statements that undercut decades of US policy. In Beijing he could present his demands to the Chinese and discuss what he expects them to do about the growing threat from China\u2019s friend, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots. Still, don\u2019t bet on politics staying out of the game, or out of Lady Gaga\u2019s halftime show, a reminder that political tensions will be hard to escape in 2017. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? The winner will be \u201cLion,\u201d an astonishing story of survival, with elements that can provide a sense of pride and optimism to people of different ethnicities and economic conditions. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Serena Williams will win the women\u2019s final, and instead of debating whether she is the best female athlete of all time, the sports world will ask if she is the best athlete of all time. The men\u2019s title will go to Novak Djokovic. Who will win the World Series? The experts said Trump had as much of a chance of becoming president as the Chicago Cubs had of winning the World Series. They both won. I say the Cubs win again. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Syria\u2019s White Helmets. It will be a gesture from an international community rightly ashamed over its failure to stop the carnage. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The markets will climb during Trump\u2019s first year in office, as he launches a massive government spending infrastructure plan. The Dow Jones will close 21,800. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 34%. Backers will support him passionately, but most Americans will feel revulsion watching blatant conflicts of interest and mounting scandals plaguing the Trump administration, openly calling for the President\u2019s impeachment.\u000a\u000aRoxanne Jones CNN Opinion Contributor @iamroxannejones Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Israel. Trump will visit and stage photo ops with like-minded hardliners against a Palestinian state in effort to rally the right and legitimize his pick of far-right David Friedman as Israeli ambassador. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Pittsburgh Steelers. I\u2019m a Philly girl. My Eagles fell off, but I\u2019ll stick with the home state. I\u2019m rolling with Le'Veon Bell, the best running back in the game. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? \u201cFences.\u201d Only the mega talented Denzel Washington could take August Wilson\u2019s theater masterpiece and turn it into a big screen blockbuster. Washington, along with co-star Viola Davis, make this a winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Going with the two classics here, and the best man and woman to ever play the game of tennis: Roger Federer and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? The Cubs. It would be preposterous to predict Chicago will win another MLB-best 103 games again, but the 2017 team is as strong as last year\u2019s club. Cubs will repeat. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Angela Merkel. If the Nobel is more than a popularity contest, the German Chancellor wins. After Brexit, anyone who could simultaneously stop the European Union from collapse, seek humane immigration policies, and, keep Vladimir Putin\u2019s power at bay is worthy of the Nobel. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 20,001. Today, Wall Street loves Trump and is eagerly awaiting his pro-business, no regulation policies. The Dow will break the 20,000 mark before it starts to tumble. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 40%. Trump will see high approval ratings early in the year but by the end of 2017, his approval rating will begin to drop.\u000a\u000aPeniel Joseph CNN Opinion Contributor @PenielJoseph Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? President Trump\u2019s first visit abroad will be to Russia, where he will meet with Vladimir Putin, a leader he repeatedly expressed admiration for during the election, as the first step toward easing economic sanctions. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New York Giants go on another magical run, defeating the New England Patriots 27-24 \u2013 and beating them for the third time in nine years -- to win the big game. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? The Oscar will go to "Moonlight", a searing examination of a young gay black boy\u2019s coming of age under extraordinarily challenging circumstances in Florida. A film that humanizes experiences often reduced to stereotypes or flat out ignored. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? The New York Yankees shock the world with a talented young roster to win their 28th championship. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Institute, which has emerged as the conscience of America\u2019s broken criminal justice system. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The Dow will close above 20,000 on the last day of the year. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? President Trump\u2019s approval ratings will hover around 50% buoyed by Wall St. friendly policies, but hurt by rhetorical gaffes, lack of press access, and endless controversies.\u000a\u000aDean Obeidallah CNN Opinion Contributor @TheDeansreport Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Russia, to thank Vladimir Putin for his help winning the election. Which team will win the Super Bowl? Being a diehard New York Giants fan I\u2019m predicting the Giants win it all. But if they don\u2019t I will be rooting for any time playing against the dreaded New England Patriots. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Sure, it\u2019s a longshot but then again so was Trump. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m too busy rooting for the Giants and rooting against the New England Patriots to watch tennis. Who will win the World Series? New York Mets. That was easy. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Not sure, but I\u2019m pretty confident that the winner will not be named Donald Trump. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 21,220.12 or 21,220.13. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? What is the all-time lowest? Whatever that is I predict Trump will be below that. In fact by end of 2017 I predict the only ones approving of Trump\u2019s job as president will be named Trump.\u000a\u000aRaul Reyes CNN Opinion Contributor @RaulAReyes Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? The Philippines, to see the controversial Rodrigo Duterte. This would bolster American influence in the Pacific -- and the Philippines is home to Manila\u2019s Trump Tower. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Dallas Cowboys. Their defense is on an upswing, their offense is consistently great, and Dak Prescott is unstoppable. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Best Picture will go to La La Land: a romantic tribute to movie musicals, visually stunning, with a strong ending. Oscar voters love movies about the movies. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Novak Djokovic will make a comeback and win at Wimbledon in 2017. The Queen, Serena Williams, will too, with her amazing combination of physical and mental strength. Who will win the World Series? The Chicago Cubs will win the World Series. Yes, lightning will strike twice in our lifetime for this young, talented team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis will win the Nobel Peace Prize. Although no pope has won the honor, he deserves it for his peace efforts and work on behalf of refugees. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictability will keep growth in check despite his pro-business policies. Look for the Dow to stay static around 19,000. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? Trump\u2019s approval will be 40% by the end of 2017. Half of the country will be exhausted by his erratic behavior, and the other half will be angry at his broken promises.\u000a\u000aMel Robbins CNN Commentator @melrobbins Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Russia is likely the first stop, particularly with Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Which team will win the Super Bowl? New England Patriots. Deflategate is in the rearview mirror and Brady is in his prime. The only question is whether their defense can win it. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? La La Land. It\u2019s the classic insider plot movie that the Academy loves to make a winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the men's. It\u2019s time for an upset. And Serena Williams will win the women's. It's her time. Who will win the World Series? The Chicago Cubs. How epic would that be? I mean really. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis. I would have loved for the Syria White Helmets to win, but I am deeply afraid that with the current decimation of Aleppo, by the time the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded it will be last year's news. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 15,231. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 43%. Check out Trump's Twitter account and you\u2019ll see a guy who\u2019s primary focus is his ego -- not the 300 million people he\u2019s been elected to serve. Tweeting insults at people won\u2019t change lives in the Rust Belt -- or elsewhere in the country. SNL\u2019s satirical skits about Trump will remain a hit, but Trump\u2019s approval rating will be on the decline.\u000a\u000aTara Setmayer CNN Political Commentator @TaraSetmayer Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Mexico or Israel. Which team will win the Super Bowl? Kansas City Chiefs. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? La La Land. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? New York Yankees. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Not Donald Trump. LOL. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 15,000. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 35%.\u000a\u000aTimothy Stanley Historian @timothy_stanley Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Great Britain. Trump is half British, he has businesses in the UK and he loves Brexit. It\u2019s one country that wouldn\u2019t riot if he showed up. Which team will win the Super Bowl? No idea. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? La La Land. We need a feel-good winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray is still at the top of his game. Someone called Williams for the women\u2019s. Who will win the World Series? No idea. My knowledge of sport is limited to tennis and beer pong. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? I hope that it\u2019s won by a group responsible for bringing peace and transition to Syria. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? High. If Republicans proceed swiftly with their tax cut plan, we should see a surge in confidence. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 55%. He will defy critics and pleasantly surprise many in his first year.

aVStory highlights Pig organs are similar in size and function to human organs\u000a\u000aYet they can carry porcine endogenous retroviruses (or PERVs) so they can't be transplanted\u000a\u000aScientists say they used CRISPR to edit out these retroviruses in cells\u000a\u000a(CNN) Pigs may someday provide organs for human transplant surgeries, yet more than a few obstacles must be overcome first.\u000a\u000aUsing the genome-editing technology CRISPR, scientists deactivated a family of retroviruses within the pig genome overcoming a large hurdle in the path to the transplant of pig organs into humans.\u000a\u000aTransplantation from one species to another -- xenotransplantation -- holds "great promise," the American and Chinese research team believes.\u000a\u000a"Porcine organs are considered favorable resources for xenotransplantation since they are similar to human organs in size and function, and can be bred in large numbers," they wrote in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.\u000a\u000aRetroviruses carry their genetic blueprint in the form of ribonucleic acid (or RNA) and transcribe this into deoxyribonucleic acid, commonly known as DNA. This is a reverse of the usual transcription process, which flows from DNA to RNA. This reversal makes it possible for retrovirus genes not only to infect cells but to become permanently incorporated into a cell's genome.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVWhite nationalists chant at counterprotesters after marching through the University of Virginia's Charlottesville campus on Friday, August 11. Chanting "blood and soil" and "you will not replace us," the group rallied around a statue of Thomas Jefferson before clashing with the counterprotesters, CNN affiliate WWBT reported. Charlottesville has become the latest Southern battleground over the contested removal of Confederate monuments. In February, the city council voted to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, but that is on hold pending litigation. The council also voted to rename two city parks that had been named for Confederate generals.

aVMaggie Hiufu Wong, CNN \u2022 Updated 28th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 If you've emerged from a gleaming modern metro station only to find yourself in a vast wasteland, it's probably down to one of two scenarios.\u000a\u000aEither you've time warped to a post-apocalyptic future, or you're at Caojiawan Station near the city of Chongqing in China.\u000a\u000aOpened in October 2015 to connect the rural suburb of Caijiagang with the city center, Caojiawan Station has become legendary throughout China because of its bizarre appearance in the middle of nowhere.\u000a\u000aThe station's three exits -- only one of them is in use now -- are all hidden among overgrown weeds on barren land.\u000a\u000aAs photos taken earlier this year show, there are no residential buildings, paved roads, shops or other public transportation in sight. And very few commuters.\u000a\u000aThat's still the case today.\u000a\u000aA station worker recently told Chongqing Morning Post : "Very few passengers get off at this station. Most of the time, there will be no passenger boarding or alighting here."\u000a\u000aDespite its seemingly outlandish location, Caojiawan Station's location is part of an insightful plan that anticipates growth in rapidly modernizing China -- so say Chongqing Rail Transit employees.\u000a\u000a"Caojiawan Station may not be in the most popular area for now," one worker told Chinese media company Manner Video , a Chinese digital video production company. "But with the development of the rail route, it's possible that it'll attract more people to the area and help hasten urban development along the line."\u000a\u000aChongqing's other transportation wonders\u000a\u000aThe complexity of the Huangjuewan Flyover amazed netizens when it first opened in early 2017.\u000a\u000aIt's not the first time Chongqing's mass transit system has set the internet ablaze.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, a video showing a light rail passenger train passing through a 19-story apartment building -- where there is a transit stop on the sixth and seventh floor of the building -- went viral.\u000a\u000aThe city's newly built Huangjuewan Flyover also caught netizens' attention thanks to its crazily dense tangle of roadways.\u000a\u000aConnecting roads in eight directions on five levels with more than 20 ramps, Huangjuewan Flyover is the largest and most complicated hub interchange in country's southwest area.

aV(CNN) One of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather's shoulders, waving a flag as our astronauts returned to Hawaii. This was years before we'd set foot on the moon. Decades before we'd land a rover on Mars. A generation before photos from the International Space Station would show up in our social media feeds.\u000a\u000aI still have the same sense of wonder about our space program that I did as a child. It represents an essential part of our character -- curiosity and exploration, innovation and ingenuity, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and doing it before anybody else. The space race we won not only contributed immeasurably important technological and medical advances, but it also inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers with the right stuff to keep America on the cutting edge.\u000a\u000aThat's one of the reasons why, in my first address as President to the American people, I vowed to return science to its rightful place. In our first few months, my administration made the largest single investment in basic research in our history, and I went to the Kennedy Space Center to call for reimagining and reinvigorating our space program to explore more of our solar system and look deeper into the universe than ever.\u000a\u000aIn the years since, we've revitalized technology innovation at NASA, extended the life of the International Space Station, and helped American companies create private-sector jobs by capitalizing on the untapped potential of the space industry.\u000a\u000aLast year alone, NASA discovered flowing water on Mars and evidence of ice on one of Jupiter's moons, and we mapped Pluto -- more than 3 billion miles away -- in high-resolution. Our space telescopes revealed additional Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, and we're pursuing new missions to interact with asteroids, which will help us learn how to protect the Earth from the threat of colliding with one while also teaching us about the origins of life on Earth. We've flown by every planet in the solar system -- something no other nation can say. And we continue to drive down the cost of space exploration for taxpayers.\u000a\u000aThis week, we'll convene some of America's leading scientists, engineers, innovators and students in Pittsburgh to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers. Just five years ago, US companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it. More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aWe have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we're already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aThe next step is to reach beyond the bounds of Earth's orbit. I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth -- something we'll need for the long journey to Mars.\u000a\u000aThe reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times, John Noble Wilford, later wrote that Mars tugs at our imagination "with a force mightier than gravity." Getting there will take a giant leap. But the first, small steps happen when our students -- the Mars generation -- walk into their classrooms each day. Scientific discovery doesn't happen with the flip of a switch; it takes years of testing, patience and a national commitment to education.\u000a\u000aPresident Eisenhower knew this: In 1958, he devoted great resources to science and math education around the same time he created NASA. And it's why I'm proud that we've passed important milestones in STEM education. For the first time, more than 100,000 engineers are graduating from American schools every year, and we're on track to accomplish my goal of training 100,000 excellent new STEM teachers in a decade.\u000a\u000aWhen our Apollo astronauts looked back from space, they realized that while their mission was to explore the moon, they had "in fact discovered the Earth." If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last, we won't just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we'll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves.\u000a\u000aSomeday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We'll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we'll know that because of the choices we make now, they've gone to space not just to visit, but to stay -- and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.

aVTokyo, Japan (CNN) There's something distinctly punk about Katsuya Kamo's aesthetic.

At 556 meters (1,824 feet) tall, the building was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates Hide Caption 31 of 31\u000a\u000aFrom the beginning, urban planners decided that it would be a city of skyscrapers. Shenzhen's growing skyline is simply part of its DNA, according to University of Hong Kong architecture professor Juan Du, whose book, "The Making of Shenzhen: A Thousand Years in China's Instant City," will be published next year.\u000a\u000a"In Shenzhen, (skyscrapers are) really linked to the image of the city," she said over the phone. "Between the early 1980s and the early 90s, it had more tall buildings than any Chinese city.\u000a\u000a"The term 'Shenzhen speed' was coined from the (time of) the construction of the city's earliest skyscrapers. When Deng Xiaoping made his first visit to Shenzhen, he was really excited by the speed at which tall buildings were being built."\u000a\u000aToday, Shenzhen has evolved beyond its manufacturing roots to become a hub for service industries -- especially technology and design. Often described as "China's Silicon Valley," the city is home to huge companies like Tencent (which itself built two skyscrapers) and a network of thousands of smaller firms.\u000a\u000aBut Shenzhen's geography plays a part, too: the city center is located in a narrow strip between mountains and the Hong Kong border. A growing network of subway lines and a new high-speed rail connection to Hong Kong have made this strip even more desirable, pushing development up rather than out.\u000a\u000aCities in slowdown\u000a\u000aShenzhen appears to be showing no signs of slowing. In addition to a current crop of 49 buildings taller than 200 meters, a further 48 skyscrapers are under construction, according to CTBUH data.\u000a\u000aBut as Shenzhen grows skywards, empty office space in other big cities has led market analysts to speculate that China is caught in a spiral of overbuilding. The office vacancy rate in Beijing, which stood at 8% at the end of 2016, is forecast to rise to 13% by the end of 2019, according to a report by property firm Colliers International. The report noted that "the growing office supply will still outstrip the growth in demand."\u000a\u000aIn Shanghai, the country's tallest building, the 632-meter Shanghai Tower, has sat largely empty since opening in 2015, with one of the project's lead developers, Gu Jianping, admitting at an awards ceremony last year that "the biggest challenge facing China is how to build fewer skyscrapers."\u000a\u000aAcross China, the race upwards has produced outsized landmarks (like Nanjing's Zifeng Tower which is nearly twice the height of the city's next-tallest building) in areas where there was not enough demand to justify construction. Entire new cities were built in places like Ordos, a dusty outpost in the Gobi Desert, which then sat empty for years. Tianjin built no fewer than three central business districts filled with skyscrapers -- including one unashamedly modeled on Manhattan.\u000a\u000aSome media reports have pointed to the so-called "Skyscraper Index," an idea first proposed by economist Andrew Lawrence in 1999, which suggests that a surge of investment in skyscrapers is a harbinger of recession.\u000a\u000aBucking the trend\u000a\u000aBut rather than signaling a downturn, Shenzhen's spate of new skyscrapers may simply reflect its booming economy. With the highest per capita GDP of any major city in China, Shenzhen is also experiencing soaring land prices.\u000a\u000aLast year, the city's property market was named the mainland's most expensive, with homes selling for an average of $6,500 per square meter, according to SouFun , which tracks house prices in 100 Chinese cities. There has been a similar trend in the office market, according to David Ji, the head of research for Greater China at property consultancy Knight Frank.\u000a\u000a"Shenzhen has a lot of demand for Grade A office space, unlike some other mainland cities that just go for height to compete with each other," he said over the phone.\u000a\u000aAnd aside from the 600-meter Ping An Financial Centre, which became the world's fourth tallest building when it opened last year, Ji said that "buildings built in Shenzhen tend not to be that tall relative to Shanghai or other cities."\u000a\u000aIn other words, Shenzhen may be building plenty of skyscrapers, but most of them aren't showstoppers.\u000a\u000aRather than tolerating vanity projects, urban planners encourage projects that fit in with the surrounding city, according to Hong Kong-based architect Stefan Krummeck. His firm, TFP Farrells, designed KK100, a 442-meter tower that is currently the second tallest in Shenzhen. Rather than an isolated landmark, the skyscraper is part of a former village that was redeveloped in conjunction with KK100.\u000a\u000a"There's always a bit of an ego trip involved in super high-rises, but in Shenzhen it's more sustainable -- the towers are reasonably modest," he said over the phone. "There are only a few super-high-rise towers and they're pretty well integrated into the urban fabric.\u000a\u000a"To the best of my knowledge, the towers are full and the streets are lively. It works quite well."

He referred to the pressing political question of the moment: Will Joe Biden challenge Hillary Clinton and others in the ongoing Democratic primary?\u000a\u000aA lot hung on his answer, and the whole nation leaned forward to listen.\u000a\u000aBiden was shockingly frank for a man under the klieg lights. His face was extremely mobile, with a range of emotion flickering as he dipped his eyes to the floor and seemed to wince. A vast audience saw the obvious truth: Here is father grieving for beloved son, Beau, who died of brain cancer only a few months ago. The rawness of his feelings were vividly on display.\u000a\u000aBiden was frank, saying: "I don't think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, number two, they can look at folks out there and say, 'I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this." One could hear a pin drop in the audience, which held its breath.

He's a compassionate human being, and he's real.\u000a\u000aBorn in 1942, he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- the lunch-pail capital of the western world, in my view. I grew up only a mile or so from Biden, whose father scraped to find work during some hard economic times in this era, when anthracite mining had died out and left many in northeastern Pennsylvania without other options for making a living. My mother, who died at 97 only last year, was a friend of Biden's aunt and mother, and she recalled that they moved to Delaware in search of better work.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Biden unsure if he's 'there' for a run Replay More Videos ...

He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth -- like Jeb Bush or Donald Trump. He made his way -- slowly but surely -- in the often clamorous world of American politics. And he has risen to a height his family could scarcely have imagined in those hardscrabble years after the war in Scranton.\u000a\u000aJoe is the real deal. He would have made a great president, perhaps: a man of the people, who understands their needs, their fondest wishes, their fears. But that probably isn't going to happen.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, Joe Biden has -- unexpectedly -- wakened a nation to what it craves: a vulnerable but fully committed person who can say what he or she means, without bombast or equivocation, and lead us forward.

aVJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and Nairobi, Kenya, and the author of the book " The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness ." Follow her on Twitter . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It's tough out there for a socialite. Especially when money can't buy you good sense.\u000a\u000aLouise Linton, an actress recently married to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is facing criticism for an ill-conceived social media encounter that first involved her bragging about her designer wardrobe, and quickly devolved into her mocking and berating an Oregon mom. She posted a photo to Instagram of herself having just exited an official government plane, and included a series of hashtags to specify exactly which pricey designer brands she was wearing. When Jennifer Miller, an Oregon mother of three, criticized her ("Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable"), Linton struck back. "Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?" she asked. "I'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day 'trip' than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours." She later apologized in a statement\u000a\u000aLiberals were aghast. Some conservatives shrugged, or said nothing. Breitbart gave the story a cursory writeup , and the Twitter chatter about it has been dominated by liberal pundits while conservatives have stayed largely silent.\u000a\u000aThe right passed up the opportunity to side with someone who represents the working and middle class that Donald Trump's campaign supposedly championed against the arrogance of the entitled rich. Instead this encounter is another piece of evidence that we can now put a bullet in the idea that most people who voted for Donald Trump did so because of economic insecurity; for many, it's clearly about a more complex, ugly form of political and racial tribalism.\u000a\u000aThe response from the right (or lack thereof) to Linton's outburst is more evidence that the 2016 election wasn't just about white working-class voters feeling unrepresented by out-of-touch elites. It was also about a group of Americans who don't care one iota about character or honesty or even reality, but do care about sticking it to liberals and creating chaos for fun -- because liberals, and the people increasingly benefiting from the changing political order, are women and people of color.\u000a\u000aTo be clear, Linton is not an elected official, and how she spends her money is her own business, whether it's on Birkin bags and Valentino heels or perhaps copies of her own bizarrely self-aggrandizing book , which peddles racist clichés about Africa and has been thoroughly discredited.\u000a\u000aThere is also something particularly sexist about the vitriol aimed at women who wear pricey clothing, since that outrage is rarely leveled at men who have closets full of $10,000 suits.\u000a\u000aBut Linton's actions are only the latest example of ever-coarsening behavior online from the nation's most privileged and entitled, coupled with stunning conservative hypocrisy. The combination of Linton's Africa memoir, her tacky name-dropping hashtags, and her condescending and classist response to Miller paints a portrait of a self-involved and narcissistic woman with a loose relationship to the truth and very little self-awareness.\u000a\u000aThere seems to be no hypocrisy a startling number of GOP voters won't tolerate, and no point at which an individual's cronyism, lies and ill character matter if there's an R next to their name on the ballot.\u000a\u000aTrump promised to "drain the swamp" in Washington and advocate for the average working man; instead, he's appointed bankers like Mnuchin, a 17-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, to the richest Cabinet in history , and along with those millionaires and billionaires is pushing policies that would devastate the poor\u000a\u000aTrump tarred his opponent as hopelessly corrupt, and Clinton's emails got top media billing at his rallies and in media coverage; many of Trump's supporters cited "Crooked Hillary" as a reason they were voting for him.\u000a\u000aAnd yet as president, Trump has taken nepotism to new extremes and demonstrated a shocking and unprecedented willingness to abuse his position in order to enrich himself and his family. He put his daughter and her husband in plum positions, ignored the fact that his son met with a Russian operative to get dirt on Clinton, and profits handsomely from the hotels and clubs he owns -- and that others pay to stay at so they can get access to the president. If Republican voters and their elected officials in Congress are bothered, they aren't saying so.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThe bad behavior of the Republican at the top of the ticket seems to be trickling down not just to the rest of his administration, but to Americans more generally. It's poisoning out politics, it's making us dumber, and it seems to be feeding many of our worst impulses.\u000a\u000aLinton is just one incarnation of this disturbing trend: A woman who seems better suited to star on a reality TV show than to be a public political figure who is tied (even if only by marriage) to public service; a narcissistic fabulist with bad social media manners who lashes out at the less powerful who dare criticize her.\u000a\u000aSound familiar?

aVBill Nye the Science Guy has turned his attention to accounting.\u000a\u000aThe famed science enthusiast filed suit against Disney (DIS) on Thursday, claiming the media giant hoodwinked him out of more than $9 million in earnings from "Bill Nye the Science Guy."\u000a\u000aThe beloved television series originally aired between 1992 and 1997, gaining a loyal following among children while winning multiple broadcasting awards for its fun, science-focused programming. It's still streamed on services like Netflix (NFLX, Tech30).\u000a\u000aTwo decades after production wrapped up, Nye has accused Disney of fraud and breach of contract in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Disney subsidiaries including Buena Vista Television and ABC are also named as defendants.\u000a\u000aDisney and the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aRelated: It's been a tough year in the courtroom for media companies\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit claims that Nye, who was owed 16.5% of the show's profits, became suspicious after Disney-owned Buena Vista demanded he repay a large portion of his 2007 "Science Guy" earnings, citing an "accounting error."\u000a\u000aNye doubted the company's bookkeeping. But his efforts to engage the firm in negotiations to resolve the matter were "futile," according to the lawsuit. Nye claims that Buena Vista stopped making royalty payments in 2008 because of the dispute.\u000a\u000aThe suit says that Nye eventually hired an auditor to review the company's records, but the inquiry was delayed for years and the defendants allegedly did not provide all the requested documentation.\u000a\u000aThe "defendants failed to engage in the process in good faith," says the suit, which accuses the companies of engaging in "an ongoing, deliberate conspiracy to deceive Mr. Nye."\u000a\u000aAccording to the complaint, the limited documentation provided to auditors showed revenues were skewed and royalties went unreported.\u000a\u000aNye claims that he has suffered damages of at least $9.4 million, while the defendants enriched themselves with "ill-gotten" profits of over $28 million.

aV(CNN) One in three Americans doesn't get enough sleep, and 45% of the world's population doesn't either.\u000a\u000aThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls that a "public health problem," because disrupted sleep is associated with a higher risk of conditions including diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular disease.\u000a\u000aWhat about Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia?\u000a\u000aIt's well known that people with Alzheimer's suffer sleep issues. Insomnia, nighttime wandering and daytime sleepiness are common for them, as well as other cognitive disorders such as Lewy body dementia and frontal lobe dementia.\u000a\u000aBut could poor sleep earlier in life actually cause dementia?\u000a\u000aREM sleep and dementia\u000a\u000anew study in the journal Neurology , the journal for the American Academy of Neurology, finds that people who get less REM, or dream-stage sleep, may be at higher risk for developing dementia. REM is the fifth stage of sleep, when the eyes move, the body heats up, breathing and pulse quicken and the mind dreams.\u000a\u000aResearchers followed 321 people with an average age of 61 for a dozen years, as part of the famous Framingham Heart Study. Sleep cycles were measured for each person, and their cognitive skills were assessed in person at regular intervals. Over the duration of the study, 32 people developed dementia. Of those, 24 were determined to be Alzheimer's disease.\u000a\u000aThe study found that people who took longer than the typical 90 minutes to enter REM were more likely to get dementia. They also spent only about 17% of their sleep dreaming, compared to 20% in those who did not develop dementia.\u000a\u000aNo association with dementia was found for any of the other four stages of sleep.\u000a\u000a"Our findings point to REM sleep as a predictor of dementia," study author Matthew P. Pase, of Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, said in a news release. "The next step will be to determine why lower REM sleep predicts a greater risk of dementia. By clarifying the role of sleep in the onset of dementia, the hope is to eventually identify possible ways to intervene so that dementia can be delayed or even prevented."\u000a\u000aSleep and Alzheimer's plaques\u000a\u000aA growing body of research in both mice and humans shows that disturbed sleep leads to higher levels of soluble beta amyloid, the protein that folds and forms the sticky plaques that kill brain cells and bog down information processing.\u000a\u000aDepositing amyloid in brain tissue is the first known preclinical stage of Alzheimer's and happens well before any obvious symptoms of dementia begin.\u000a\u000aA few studies in cognitively normal people and one in mice have shown a connection between chronic sleep disruption and the development of amyloid plaques. The research in mice was particularly interesting because it showed that mice who slept well reduced their levels of beta amyloid, effectively clearing the toxin from their brains.\u000a\u000astudy in Neurology looked at the relationship between sleep quality and levels of various proteins and inflammatory markers in the cerebrospinal fluid of 101 cognitively healthy adults with an average age of 63.\u000a\u000aAll participants had known risk factors for Alzheimer's, such as family history or evidence of the APOE gene , which is associated with a greater chance of developing the disease. Their sleep quality was rated on a standard scale that measured amount, quality and trouble sleeping, along with daytime drowsiness and naps.\u000a\u000a"Participants in our study were willing to undergo a lumbar puncture to move research on Alzheimer's disease forward," said co-author Barbara Bendlin of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. "Analyzing this fluid allowed us to look at markers related to Alzheimer's disease such as plaques and tangles, as well as markers of inflammation and nerve cell damage."\u000a\u000aTangles and cell damage\u000a\u000aTangles are created by damaged tau, a protein responsible for cell stability and structure. Recent research points to tau-tangle accumulation as a possible step beyond amyloid plaques in the development of actual signs of Alzheimer's disease.\u000a\u000aBy comparing the spinal fluid against self-reported sleep problems, Bendlin and her colleagues found that the subjects who had sleep issues were more likely to show evidence of tau pathology, brain cell damage and inflammation, even when other factors like depression, body mass, cardiovascular disease and sleep medications were taken into account.\u000a\u000a"Our findings align with the idea that worse sleep may contribute to the accumulation of Alzheimer's-related proteins in the brain," Bendlin said. "The fact that we can find these effects in people who are cognitively healthy and close to middle age suggest that these relationships appear early, perhaps providing a window of opportunity for intervention."\u000a\u000aThat's important, Bendlin added, because delaying the onset of Alzheimer's in those at risk by a mere five years "could reduce the number of cases we see in the next 30 years by 5.7 million and save $367 billion in health care spending."\u000a\u000a"Another new finding in this study is that daytime sleepiness, and not just disrupted nighttime sleep, is associated with early changes of Alzheimer's disease," said Dr. Yo-El Ju, an assistant professor of neurology at Washington University's Sleep Medicine Center.\u000a\u000aJu co-wrote an accompanying editorial for the study and just published research of her own in the journal Brain in which she found that healthy middle-age adults who slept badly for just one night produced an abundance of beta amyloid. A week of disrupted sleep increased the amount of tau, another protein responsible for the tangles associated with Alzheimer's, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease.\u000a\u000a"Overall, these studies confirms the relationship between early Alzheimer's disease and sleep disturbance," Ju said, "and expand -- in terms of both time and symptoms -- the window in which sleep-wake problems can be assessed for and treated, with the hope of reducing the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease."\u000a\u000aOne of the limitations of Bendlin's study was that the sleep problems were self-reported. Bendlin and her colleagues are recruiting people at risk for Alzheimer's to be studied in a sleep lab, where objective measurements can be taken.\u000a\u000a"If it turns out to be the case that an intervention which improves sleep also results in less amyloid being deposited in the brain, that would provide strong support for implementing interventions before people start to show cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease," she said.\u000a\u000aDr. Rudolph Tanzi, who directs the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed.\u000a\u000a"Increasing amounts of evidence indicate that getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep is essential for brain health and function," Tanzi said. "In the deepest stage of sleep, the brain cleans itself out of plaque and other toxic materials that trigger Alzheimer's disease. This reduces brain inflammation and is entirely consistent with this exciting new study."\u000a\u000aWhich problem came first?\u000a\u000aNot everyone with sleep problems in Bendlin's study had abnormalities in their spinal fluid. For example, those with obstructive sleep apnea showed no association. With over 18 millions Americans diagnosed with the condition, obstructive sleep apnea is one of the most common sleep disorders. It's characterized by loud snoring and waking by gasping or choking, which occurs when throat muscles relax and constrict the airway during sleep.\u000a\u000aBut research presented in July at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in London found a connection between obstructive sleep apnea and buildup of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain.\u000a\u000aResearchers looked at 1,639 adults in their mid-70s who either were normal cognitively or had mild cognitive decline. The research found an association between obstructive sleep apnea and an accelerated increase of amyloid and tau deposits in both normal and cognitively impaired adults.\u000a\u000aBendlin stresses that much remains to be discovered about the link between sleep and dementia.\u000a\u000a"Not everyone who experiences sleep problems should now worry about developing dementia due to Alzheimer's disease," she said, adding that therecnn & is not yet a clear cause and effect relationship.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Animal studies suggest sleep affects development of brain changes, but brain changes in turn also affect sleep," Bendlin said. "In terms of figuring out which comes first, brain changes or sleep problems, that will be difficult to tease apart, because the effects really do appear to be going in both directions."\u000a\u000a"In experimental studies, there does seems to be evidence of both chicken and egg," said neuroscientist Jeffrey Iliff of Oregon Health and Sciences University. "You can drive it either direction. So there may be a bio-directional interaction."\u000a\u000aThat's good news if true, he said, because it means we have may have some control over whether we develop dementia.\u000a\u000a"No, the public can't remove amyloid plaque," Iliff said. "But if sleep disruption is promoting this process, then improving sleep is half of the solution to slowing the process of dementia as it develops over one's life."\u000a\u000aKeith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed: "There may be an opportunity to improve cognition and possibly reduce dementia risk through early diagnosis and effective treatment of sleep disorders."

aV(CNN) CNN Opinion asked members of the clergy to weigh in on last weekend's events in Charlottesville. The views expressed below are those of the authors.\u000a\u000aRabbi Shai Held: When human dignity is on the line, there are no innocent bystanders\u000a\u000aIf we truly took the Bible seriously, we might never get past the first chapter. Push far enough down our respective family trees, the Bible teaches, and we will all end up with the same starting point, Adam. The Bible begins this way, the Talmudic Sages teach, "so that no person might say to another, 'My father was greater than yours.'"\u000a\u000aOne of the most fundamental claims Judaism makes about the world is that every human being on the face of the earth -- black and white, male and female -- is created in the image of God and is therefore infinitely valuable.\u000a\u000aAnd yet day after day, century after century, human dignity is trodden and trampled upon in countless ways -- by poverty and oppression, by hunger, illness, loneliness and abandonment. And by racism -- the insidious and utterly sinful belief that some people are somehow born worth more than others. Such bigotry is a direct affront to biblical thinking. Racism is an attack on humanity, but it is also an assault on God. (An attack on other people's humanity is by definition an assault on God. It is unconscionable that many participants in religion forget that.)\u000a\u000aTo be a religious person is to be forced to live with the gap between what the Bible insists is a core truth about the universe, and what we encounter (and often help to perpetuate) each day. Our theology says that people matter; the morning newspaper suggests that maybe we don't.\u000a\u000aLiving inside the gap is excruciating, but it is what religion -- real religion, not the religion of complacency and self-satisfaction -- requires of us. Living inside the gap also means committing to help close it by living in a way that affirms the dignity of all and working especially for the dignity of those who are exploited, abused and degraded. Jewish theology teaches that human beings cannot perfect the world, but we can and must improve it. God expects and demands no less of us.\u000a\u000aHuman dignity is (once again) under assault in America -- a gruesome reality we saw on display in Charlottesville last weekend. We have a president who without shame (tragically, he appears incapable of shame) has emboldened the forces of hate in ways that are frankly terrifying.\u000a\u000aWe must commit to fighting him and them. African-Americans, Jews, immigrants and people of conscience everywhere -- we are all in this fight together.\u000a\u000aWhen human dignity is on the line, there are no innocent bystanders. Now is the time to stand up and be counted.\u000a\u000aRabbi Shai Held, a Jewish thinker and educator, is the author, most recently, of " The Heart of Torah ."\u000a\u000aFranklin Graham: Hatred must be met with love\u000a\u000aIf there was any doubt our nation -- indeed our world -- is in need of God's healing touch, we need look no further than the streets of Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aBut as long as we continue to turn our backs on God, healing will be far from us.\u000a\u000aThe church should be the first place this healing begins.\u000a\u000aGod says in the Old Testament, "If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."\u000a\u000aFranklin Graham\u000a\u000aMay our churches be the first place prayer and repentance occur. May we be the first to call evil what it is.\u000a\u000aWhite supremacism is a wicked and evil worldview that has no place in a civil society and should be renounced and rejected by people of all backgrounds and faiths.\u000a\u000aAs my father Billy Graham said after the Oklahoma City bombing, "Evil is real, and the human heart is capable of almost limitless evil when it is cut off from God and from the moral law."\u000a\u000aHatred must be met with love and a bold declaration that God created mankind in His image and His love extends to everyone.\u000a\u000aThis is not a new problem -- people have been living in denial of these truths for centuries -- nor has the answer to this problem changed.\u000a\u000aThe power to turn from such evil is found in Jesus Christ, who modeled perfect love during His 33 years on earth.\u000a\u000aJesus alone can forgive, heal and change hearts. I pray our nation looks to Him for strength and boldness in the face of injustice and oppression. And I pray we follow the greatest commandments, which are to "love the Lord your God" and "love your neighbor as yourself."\u000a\u000aFranklin Graham is president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan's Purse, the international Christian relief and evangelism organization.\u000a\u000aFather James Martin: 'Christian white supremacist' is an oxymoron\u000a\u000aHow many white supremacists consider themselves Christians? Probably the majority of them. But "supremacy" is the precise opposite of Jesus's message.\u000a\u000aIn the Gospels, Jesus asks us to love one another, to place others' needs before our own, even to die for one another. The idea of "supremacy" is absurd to Jesus.\u000a\u000aIndeed, Jesus tells us explicitly that we are never to "lord" power over others, and that we are to be one another's "servants" (Mark 10: 42-43) The idea that anyone is "less than" because of his or her race is likewise antithetical to Jesus's message.\u000a\u000aJames Martin\u000a\u000aFor example, in Jesus's time, the Samaritans (people from the region of Samaria) were despised and even shunned by the majority of the Jewish people (John 4:9). Yet Jesus not only speaks to a Samaritan woman and reveals his divinity to her, he also makes a Samaritan man the hero of perhaps his most famous parable -- that's the person we know as the "Good Samaritan" (John 4; Luke 10). Jesus even encounters a Roman centurion, someone completely outside of his religion, speaks with him, heals his servant and praises his faith (Matthew 8:5-13).\u000a\u000aFor Jesus, then, there is no "us" and "them." No one should be made by the community into an "other," as white supremacists do to non-whites. Racism goes against everything that Jesus taught. It promotes hatred, not love; anger, not compassion; vengeance, not mercy. It is a sin.\u000a\u000aIn the end, "Christian white supremacist" is an oxymoron. Every time you shout, "White Power!" you might as well be shouting, "Crucify him!" And every time you lift your hand in a Nazi salute, you might as well be lifting your hand to nail Jesus to the cross.\u000a\u000aAnd lest you miss the point, your Savior is Jewish.\u000a\u000aFather James Martin is a Jesuit priest, editor at large of America, consultor to the Vatican's Secretariat for Communication, and author of several books, most recently, " Building a Bridge ," about LGBT Catholics.\u000a\u000aReverend William J. Barber II: First, drain your own swamp\u000a\u000aAfter white nationalists staged a violent confrontation, assaulted nonviolent citizens and murdered Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia, President Donald Trump condemned violence "on many sides" and insisted that "there are good people on both sides." Many elected officials across the political spectrum have rightly challenged the false equivalency of the President's both-sides-ism.\u000a\u000aBut the test of any politician is the policy they pursue. Will these same political leaders renounce the mean-spirited, race-driven and socially violent policy agenda of white supremacy that precipitated and emboldened the actions and attitude of white supremacists and nationalists? Will they commit to fully restore the Voting Rights Act?\u000a\u000aWilliam Barber\u000a\u000aJesus made clear that at moments like this, anyone who would stand on the side of truth and goodness must engage in self-examination.\u000a\u000aAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,\u000a\u000aBut considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\u000a\u000aHow wilt thou say to thy brother,\u000a\u000aLet me pull the mote out of thine eye;\u000a\u000aAnd, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\u000a\u000aAnd then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote from thy\u000a\u000abrother's eye. (Matthew 7:3-5, KJV)\u000a\u000aTo say you are against white supremacy without standing against the rhetoric that emboldens them reeks either of terrible ignorance or deliberate hypocrisy. First, remove the beam from your own eye, Jesus taught. First, drain your own swamp.\u000a\u000aAfter Charlottesville, our nation faces a clear fork in the road. We must make a moral choice. We can take the righteous road of repair, as we were urged to do by the Kerner Commission following several major riots in our largest cities half a century ago -- a call that went unheeded in the face of denial.\u000a\u000aI pray that now we may find the moral courage to reject leaders who pander to white nationalism and embrace the difficult work of reconstructing democracy in America.\u000a\u000aThe Rev. William J. Barber II is a Protestant minister, co-chair of the Poor Peoples Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, president of Repairers of the Breach, a progressive ecumenical organization, and founder of Moral Mondays, a grass-roots movement for racial and economic justice. He is the author of " The Third Reconstruction: Moral Mondays, Fusion Politics, and the Rise of a New Justice Movement ."\u000a\u000aReverend Nelson Price: Choose the Charleston model to heal\u000a\u000aThe Gospel of Mark says, "Out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts...." Indeed, every Confederate statue could be taken down and it would not address the evil thoughts that led to the heartbreak in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aRacism, bigotry and oppression at any time by anyone is wrong. There are too many groups embodying that trinity, and none should be condoned.\u000a\u000aThe Rev. Nelson Price\u000a\u000aSane voices must be heard; reason must prevail. The faith community was engaged in Charleston at the time of that city's racist massacre in 2015, and ultimately peace prevailed. Religious leaders took the initiative and became proactive in advocating for calm. They cut across racial lines and held prayer vigils. They spoke openly about healing and accord.\u000a\u000aWill America choose Charleston as its model to begin the healing process?\u000a\u000aWe are a long way today from the biblical admonition in the Gospel of John to "love one another." But the agencies, institutions and individuals of America must now become proponents of that love Jesus taught. It is not enough to stop the evil; we must cultivate the good.\u000a\u000aWe must stop shouting at each other across troubled seas of misunderstanding. Members of houses of faith must speak of forgiveness and acceptance.\u000a\u000aA charge God gave ancient Israel from the book of Deuteronomy is appropriate for today: " I call heaven and earth as witness today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live...."\u000a\u000aThe Reverend Nelson Price is the retired pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church in Marietta, Georgia.\u000a\u000aImam Khalid Latif: We still remain slaves to our own minds\u000a\u000aIn the Islamic tradition, we find a narration in which the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is delivering a final sermon to his companions. Among the important things that he reminds them of in these parting advices is, "O people, your Lord is one and your father (Adam) is one. There is no virtue of an Arab over a foreigner nor a foreigner over an Arab, and neither white over black nor black over skin, except by righteousness."\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the reminder is something we are in great need of today.\u000a\u000aA failure to acknowledge and deal with illness doesn't mean that it's not there. I can pretend like I'm not sick, but my body will let me know otherwise. We can pretend like our society is not in pain and in need of healing, but atrocities like Charlottesville will let us know otherwise. Our indifference to the experiences of those "not like us," coupled with our own egocentric priorities, places us in the reality that we find ourselves in.\u000a\u000aKhalid Latif\u000a\u000aThis is reality: A self-identified white supremacist literally drove a car into a crowd of people. Another group of them beat a black man in a parking garage with sticks while others stood and watched. Many of them have been identified, yet most have not been apprehended. They knew what they were doing, but will not be labeled as thugs or terrorists or any other term reserved only for the black and brown people of the world.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, former KKK leaders are thanking President Donald Trump for his remarks and support.\u000a\u000aThe racism that we are dealing with is not someone calling someone else a bad name, but a racism that is structural and systemic. It is overwhelming in its unfiltered injustice and its institutional efforts to maintain white supremacy. The only way to combat the ignorance upon which such racism is founded it to acknowledge its existence, to educate ourselves about its roots, and then move to obliterate our own passivity and indifference toward the experiences of men and women of color in this country.\u000a\u000aWhat is the solution? First, we must recognize that anti-blackness is the heart of all of this. People of good conscience of all races need to stand and speak in defense of those who are subjected to racism. Denying that racism exists, including on a systemic and structural level, perpetuates blind privilege and rank division.\u000a\u000aWe have abolished slavery in our nation but still remain slaves to our own minds. This modern-day bondage prevents our hearts from reaching their full potential of understanding, empathy and compassion simply because we cannot look beyond our own experiences and acknowledge the experiences of others.\u000a\u000aTake the time to interact, build relationships and learn from those who are different from you. When you see any type of injustice, take steps to remedy it. And at the very least, take a moment every day to reflect on your own biases and stereotypes. We all have them and need to start breaking them down so that we can in turn break down the barriers that separate us as nation on a whole.

aV(CNN) MTV has reached out to the military in an effort to bring active duty transgender military service members to Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards , a US defense official told CNN.\u000a\u000aIt's an invitation that is likely to draw attention to transgender service members, an issue that has become politically charged in the wake of President Donald Trump's July tweets that appeared to call for the reinstatement of a ban on transgender persons serving in the military.\u000a\u000aPentagon Spokesman Lt. Col. Paul Haverstick told CNN Wednesday that "MTV has requested service member participation for this year's VMAs."\u000a\u000a"At this time the Department of Defense is reviewing the parameters of the request," Haverstick said.\u000a\u000aActive duty military members face restrictions in participating in high-profile national public events, particularly those with a political bent.\u000a\u000a"MTV has invited transgender members of the US armed forces to the 2017 Video Music Awards and we would be honored if they could attend," said Chris McCarthy, president of MTV. "Any patriot who is putting their own life at risk to fight for our freedom and stands for equality is a hero at MTV, and to young people everywhere."\u000a\u000aThe VMAs are all about moments -- from Kanye West famously interrupting Taylor Swift's acceptance speech in 2009 to Miley Cyrus twerking in 2013.\u000a\u000aBut they're also a chance for artists to make political statements.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Protesting Trump's transgender military ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Protesting Trump's transgender military ban 08:07\u000a\u000aIn 2010, Lady Gaga sought to bring attention to the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy when she walked the red carpet with four servicemen and a servicewoman who had been discharged or opted to leave the military because they were openly gay or bisexual.\u000a\u000aAnd last year during the presidential election season 'NSync alum Lance Bass donned a jacket that read "Love Trumps Hate" while Beyonce referenced the Black Lives Matter movement during her performance.\u000a\u000aTrump announced his plan to reinstate a ban on transgender service members on Twitter last month , a move that took the Joint Chiefs of Staff by surprise.\u000a\u000aDespite the tweets, the Pentagon continues to await formal policy guidance from the White House before making any changes, emphasizing that transgender military members will be allowed to continue to serve openly in the interim.\u000a\u000aSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis said earlier this month that the White House had still not provided policy guidance on transgender persons serving in the military, adding that they were still studying the issue, raising the prospect that transgender service members may be allowed to continue to serve despite Trump's July announcement.\u000a\u000a"We are going to study the issue," Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. "The policy is going to address whether or not transgenders can serve under what conditions, what medical support they require, how much time would they be perhaps non-deployable, leaving others to pick up their share of everything."\u000a\u000a"There's a host of issues and I'm learning more about this than I ever thought I would, and it's obviously very complex to include the privacy issues, which we respect," Mattis said. "I am waiting right now to get the President's guidance in, and that, I expect, (will) be very soon."\u000a\u000aBut Trump again reiterated his desire to reinstate the ban while addressing reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, earlier this month.\u000a\u000a"It's been a very confusing issue for the military, and I think I'm doing the military a great favor," Trump told reporters.

aVAmerica again owes more money to China than any other nation.\u000a\u000aChina's vast holdings of U.S. government debt jumped $44 billion to $1.15 trillion in June, according to U.S. Treasury Department data. That took China above Japan, which offloaded $21 billion in U.S. bonds in the month.\u000a\u000aJapan had held the position of Uncle Sam's biggest creditor for the previous eight months, but Beijing's renewed appetite for U.S. debt has brought it back to the top.\u000a\u000aChina was dumping U.S. Treasuries in 2016 so that it could buy its own currency -- the yuan -- to counter downward pressure caused by a huge outflow of cash from its economy.\u000a\u000aSince early this year, however, its holdings of U.S. debt have steadily ticked up.\u000a\u000aRelated: Russia is buying up U.S. debt\u000a\u000aThe shift coincides with new government controls on money leaving China that have helped ease the pressure on the yuan. The Chinese currency has gained almost 4% against the dollar so far this year.\u000a\u000aThe Treasury Department has ranked China as the biggest foreign creditor to the U.S. for the overwhelming majority of the past nine years.\u000a\u000aThe willingness of China to lend massive amounts of money to the U.S. government has raised concerns about Beijing's potential leverage over America. President Trump claimed the opposite during his campaign, suggesting it gives the U.S. "a lot of power" over China.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump moves to crack down on China trade practices\u000a\u000aExperts say the reality is more complicated, arguing that the debt relationship binds the world's two largest economies closely together.\u000a\u000aTrump talked tough on China on the campaign trail, promising to slash the $310 billion trade deficit between the two countries, and threatening heavy tariffs on Chinese imports.\u000a\u000aHe has been more cautious since taking office. This week, he asked his top trade official to look into Chinese trade practices, but stopped short of ordering a formal investigation.\u000a\u000aChina's holdings of U.S. Treasuries have risen about $95 billion since the end of January, but are still nearly $100 billion lower than they were last summer.\u000a\u000aJapan's holdings have fluctuated in recent months.

aV(CNN) As he sits aboard superyacht Amore Mio in glamorous Monaco, Tripp Hock's mind wanders back to the moment his life flashed before him.\u000a\u000aIn 1992, then only a teenager, Hock was taking part in the annual "Running of the Bulls" festival in Pamplona, Spain.\u000a\u000aBacked into a corner on one of the course's notoriously dangerous turns, Hock frantically tried to escape as a 600-kilogram beast hurtled towards him down the narrow street.\u000a\u000aWith both horns -- each a foot long and sharp enough to sink several inches deep into human flesh -- pointed in his direction, the college student and Wall Street intern closed his eyes and feared the worst.\u000a\u000a"As the bull hits me, it sees the wall coming and slips. The thing that saved my life was the wall behind me," Hock tells CNN of his first -- and only -- attempt of running at the festival.\u000a\u000a"The bull's snout hits the wall and he can't get the horn all the way into me, but then he stands up and the horn pinches my sweatshirt. He picks me up and drags me -- I literally go down the street riding his horn."\u000a\u000aThe dust had barely settled on the tiled street when Hock finally unhooked his university sweatshirt from the bull's horn, the tip of which was now decorated with his blood.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The 'Running of the Bulls' in 1954 Bulls enter a bullring in Pamplona, Spain, during the San Fermin festival in 1954.

"Too young, everyone wants to work on a boat in the south of France.

We've seen him on CNN. What happened?' And my parents said: 'We don't know, we've heard nothing!'"\u000a\u000aHock meekly made a call home three days later, leaving an answer phone message to say he'd had a "little incident."\u000a\u000a'You're the guy'\u000a\u000aAs the bull gored Hock, its horn tore off the travel wallet which was tied around his torso.

aV(CNN) By all estimates, Hurricane Harvey is poised to do significant damage to the Texas coast in the coming days. While we don't know what the extent of its fury will be, we can look at how its predicted impact stacks up against other historic hurricanes and storms.\u000a\u000aDate\u000a\u000aHarvey was officially upgraded from a tropical storm to hurricane on Thursday. Since we are in the thick of hurricane season, that alone is no surprise. However, it shares an incredibly close overlap -- down to the week -- with several other devastating storms, including Hurricane Andrew, which ripped apart South Florida in 1992, and Hurricane Katrina, which plunged New Orleans and surrounding areas into crisis in 2005 and remains one of the most destructive US hurricanes in recorded history.\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey: August 24 --\u000a\u000aHurricane Katrina: August 23 to August 31, 2005\u000a\u000aHurricane Andrew: August 16 to August 28, 1992\u000a\u000aSize\u000a\u000aWhen considering the damage a storm might inflict, size is only one of several factors. For instance, Harvey is relatively small when looking at the diameter of the tropical force winds it produces. It is also important to note that a large storm out in the ocean obviously is likely to produce much less damage than a smaller storm that travels inland.\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey: 280 miles\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey in the Gulf of Mexico on August 25.\u000a\u000aHurricane Igor (2010): 920 miles\u000a\u000aHurricane Igor churns east of the northern Leeward Islands in September 2010.\u000a\u000aIgor was the largest recorded Atlantic storm. It threatened the Canadian coast near Newfoundland, but its largest point was when it was still over the ocean.\u000a\u000aSandy (2012): 482 miles\u000a\u000aSandy, most commonly classified as a superstorm, was the second-largest hurricane on record by this definition. It caused significant damage to New York, New Jersey and other areas in the northern United States.\u000a\u000aSandy churning off the US East Coast on October 28, 2012.\u000a\u000aDescription\u000a\u000aThe description of Hurricane Harvey is what is getting a lot of meteorologists and experts worried. Look at some of the language from some of the latest National Weather Service bulletins, compared with the weather service's Hurricane Katrina descriptions in 2005.\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey:\u000a\u000aProtect against life-threatening wind having possible devastating impacts across Matagorda Bay (Texas) from Port O'Connor to Sargent. Potential impacts in this area include:\u000a\u000aStructural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof and wall failures . Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\u000a\u000a. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted\u000a\u000aalong with fences and roadway signs blown over. Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access routes impassable.\u000a\u000aWidespread power and communications outages .\u000a\u000aHurricane Katrina:\u000a\u000aDevastating damage expected\u000a\u000aMost of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks ... perhaps longer. At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gable roofs will fall ... leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed. ...\u000a\u000aPower outages will last for weeks ... as most power poles will be down and transformers destroyed. Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of native trees will be snapped or uprooted. Only the heartiest will remain standing. ... Livestock left exposed to the winds will be killed.\u000a\u000aStrength\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey was set to make landfall Friday night as a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale. This scale measures wind speed, and at a Category 4, winds reach between 130 and 156 mph. This is described as a storm creating "catastrophic damage." Here are how other storms were categorized when they made landfall:\u000a\u000aHurricane Irene (2011): Category 1, landfall in North Carolina\u000a\u000aHurricane Ike (2008): Category 4, landfall in the Bahamas. Later, Category 2, landfall in Texas.\u000a\u000aHurricane Katrina (2005): Category 1, landfall in Florida. Category 3, second landfall in Louisiana.\u000a\u000aHurricane Charley (2004): Category 4 upon second landfall in Florida.\u000a\u000aHurricane Andrew (1992): Category 5, landfall in South Florida. Was reclassified from Category 4 in 2002.\u000a\u000aHurricane Fast Facts READ MORE:\u000a\u000aPath and speed\u000a\u000aAnother big point of concern for forecasters has been Harvey's expected path. Bill Read, former director of the National Hurricane Center, told CNN's John Berman that instead of hitting the Texas coast, moving inland and either moving back out to sea or dissipating quickly, Harvey could just sit in one place for a while, wreaking havoc.\u000a\u000a"(This) is something I haven't seen in a long, long time," he said. "(Harvey may) stall and almost completely stop moving just after coming inland, and the incredible amount of rain we should get out of that is going to lead to record flooding."\u000a\u000a"We could see this storm park for almost five days in some places," he said.\u000a\u000aIn comparison, even Katrina moved quickly, making three landfalls and strengthening and weakening over the course of four days.\u000a\u000aFlooding potential\u000a\u000aObviously, because the storm may be parked over one spot for a while, flooding is a huge concern for areas affected by Harvey. According to Read, some areas may see as much as 40 inches of rainfall in a short period. Also, the storm surge -- the rise of the sea as the storm moves inland -- could seriously threaten the coast.\u000a\u000aThis flood threat is where Harvey and Katrina are similar, but Katrina's floods weren't just because of rainfall. Katrina's landfall in low-lying Louisiana demolished levees, which is what led to the devastating flooding.\u000a\u000aLevels of flooding in New Orleans four days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast.\u000a\u000aFollow the latest updates on Hurricane Harvey here.

I experienced a race day from an entirely different perspective -- on board a galloping horse as I took part in the Magnolia Cup at the Qatar Goodwood Festival.\u000a\u000aThe Magnolia Cup is a charity race between 12 women across sport, business and media and it offers a glimpse into life in the saddle.\u000a\u000aTraining\u000a\u000aI stepped up my preparations after been given a serious reality check at the British Racing School in Newmarket five weeks prior to race day.\u000a\u000aI was there to be assessed for the race, to make sure I was fit enough for it to be safe for me to compete.\u000a\u000aSport has always been a huge part of my life and, since retiring from the British Modern Pentathlon team, I still try to find the time to train every day.\u000a\u000aHowever, "running fitness" is very different to a jockey's fitness!\u000a\u000aWe went through various strength and endurance tests designed specifically for race riding. We're talking weighted wall squats, a wobble board squat, static push-ups and planking!\u000a\u000aFitness gurus will understand that last sentence and anyone who wants to test themselves can find the exercises through this link: www.brs.org.uk/courses-and-training/fitness-test\u000a\u000aI managed to scrape a pass. I realized that perhaps I wouldn't have a fitness advantage over my competitors and there was serious work to be done!\u000a\u000aAbsolutely no idea!! #jockeytraining #plastichorse #gameface #tiredlegs \U0001f3c7\U0001f3c7\U0001f3c7 I am taking part in the Magnolia Cup at Glorious Goodwood this year and have about a month to learn how to ride a racehorse! I know this is a fake one but I've got to start somewhere! #cnnwinningpost #horseracing A post shared by Aly Vance (@alyvance) on Jul 3, 2017 at 10:31am PDT\u000a\u000aThe Horse\u000a\u000aNext, I needed to find a horse. With my competitive juices flowing, I was keen to find a trainer who could provide me with one fast enough to win!\u000a\u000aSo, at 4:30 in the morning, I arrived at the yard of ex-jumps jockey and now winning trainer Jamie Osborne.\u000a\u000aI quickly realised my riding experience counted for little. On day one I found myself totally out of control -- not once, but twice -- on horses that were meant to be "safe and sensible."\u000a\u000aOut of control meant zero brakes on a horse travelling at 30mph -- not a situation I was very comfortable with.\u000a\u000aIt was a frustrating day, although I realized I was adopting the completely wrong position on the horse.\u000a\u000aMy position was telling them to go faster, when all I wanted to do was slow them down.\u000a\u000aAfter some time on the yard's static wooden horse, I had a better idea of how to control a racehorse.\u000a\u000aSurvived my last morning riding out at Jamie Osborne's yard. \U0001f3c7\U0001f4a8 No more training to be done ahead of Thursday's Magnolia Cup at #goodwood! \U0001f3c6\U0001f633\U0001f40e #notready #toolate #horseracing #cnnwinningpost #cnnsport #goodwood #qgf #gloriousgoodwood A post shared by Aly Vance (@alyvance) on Aug 1, 2017 at 1:25am PDT\u000a\u000aAnd so began a month of heading down to Osborne's yard as much as possible while working on my fitness in the gym.\u000a\u000aMy CNN work schedule at this time of year is pretty manic, with not just the European racing season to cover, but also show jumping. So my training on a horse was limited but I worked hard to build legs of steel in the gym.\u000a\u000aRace day\u000a\u000aExcept that I felt completely underprepared.\u000a\u000aRacehorses rarely train at top speed so I didn't have the opportunity to learn what 45mph felt like.\u000a\u000aI also hadn't ridden the horse I was due to ride for the race. He was called Outer Space.\u000a\u000aOsborne said I wouldn't have been able to stop him during my training on the gallops. But I wasn't to worry, as I "didn't need to have any brakes during the race."\u000a\u000aI just had to hope he would stop before we got to the imposing wall beyond the finish line at the end of the track at Goodwood.\u000a\u000aI was pretty nervous when I was in the parade ring for the first time before the race. There was a huge crowd at the racecourse and I had images of being thrown off before I had even got to the start.\u000a\u000aBeing back in the saddle was strangely comforting though. It felt like familiar territory and, when I got to the start, I was focused on riding the best race I could.\u000a\u000aWe had a reasonable start and I was tucked in nicely behind two horses up until the halfway point.\u000a\u000aWith 400m to race I pulled out to pass them and Outer Space gave me that incredible rush of speed. No other breed of horse can lower, stretch and gallop like a racehorse and it's some feeling, believe me!\u000a\u000aWe tried to catch the winner but alas the line came too soon. Probably not a bad thing as I was certainly exhausted and given how easily Outer Space pulled up, I think he was running on empty as well.\u000a\u000aWhat a great experience! I loved riding in the #MagnoliaCup @goodwood_races yesterday. \U0001f3c7\U0001f3c7\U0001f3c7Very different riding to what I've ever done before so I was happy to come home in 2nd. Thank you to everyone who helped me get ready for the race. Mostly the guys & girls back at Jamie Osborne's yard & the poor horses who's had to put up with me on the gallops! #goodwood #gloriousgoodwood #magnoliacup #swarovski #jockeytraining #inthesaddle #cnnwinningpost A post shared by Aly Vance (@alyvance) on Aug 4, 2017 at 2:22am PDT\u000a\u000aReal Heroes\u000a\u000aAfter my small insight into a jockey's life, I'm sure you'd expect me be in awe of them and their profession.\u000a\u000aYes, they have to be incredibly strong, fit and brave. But they get to enjoy the buzz of race day. Riding down the track at full speed in front of a full grandstand was a real thrill. That would make up for all the traveling, early mornings and light weights that they have to endure.\u000a\u000aFor me, the real heroes are the work riders who risk life and limb to exercise and keep the racehorses fit every day. They don't get the glory that the jockeys enjoy.\u000a\u000aAfter getting up early in the morning, they ride six to eight horses a day. Not your sensible gentle old hacks but racehorses that are unpredictable young thoroughbreds, bred for speed and fed high-energy rocket fuel.\u000a\u000aIt's not easy, it's certainly not safe and I admire their bravery. I enjoyed the month that I was part of their team. It really was a once-in-a-lifetime experience but now I'll leave it to the professionals!

aVBELLA VISTA (KFSM) \u2014 A Bella Vista man is accused of using and sharing illicit drugs \u2014 including methamphetamine \u2014 with his daughters and girlfriend, according to a probable cause affidavit.\u000a\u000aScott Dostie, 41, was arrested Tuesday (Aug. 22) in connection with two counts of possession of a controlled substance, two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, endangering the welfare of a minor, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, simultaneous possession of drugs and firearms and unauthorized use of property to facility crime \u2014 all felonies.\u000a\u000aScott Dostie\u2019s daughter, Elexa, and girlfriend, Suzanne \u201cShellie\u201d North , also were arrested on multiple felony drug charges. Scott Dostie\u2019s other daughter, a 17-year-old, was released to a parent and charges are pending, according to Bella Vista police.\u000a\u000aScott Dostie told police he\u2019s shared marijuana, meth, mushrooms, LSD and Kratom with his daughters. The trio also had personalized lock boxes filled with drugs and smoking pipes he\u2019d bought them.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will not tolerate this type of activity in our city,\u201d said James Graves, Bella Vista Police Chief, \u201cand will continue to work at chipping away at this problem affecting the lives of especially those who are still so young and have their whole lives in front of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aElexa Dostie,19, told her mother at first it was weird getting high with her dad, but now it was pretty casual. She said he even babysat her when she tried acid.\u000a\u000aElexa Dostie was concerned with her dad\u2019s meth use, telling police he once got high and went four straight days without sleep. He eventually injured his head and knee after he passed out in the bathroom, according to the affidavit.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, police searched Dostie\u2019s house on Wroxham Lane. Among the drugs seized during the search was nearly 8 pounds of suspected Kratom, which was being sold in area schools, according to police. A handgun also was seized.\u000a\u000aKratom has only been illegal in Arkansas since 2016, said Sgt. Scott Vanatta, the department\u2019s certified drug recognition expert. It is illegal in only 14 states, but becoming a bigger problem.\u000a\u000aTwo Kratom capsules are a typical \u201cdose,\u201d Vanatta said, which acts as a depressant. Higher doses turn the drug into a stimulant, with an opioid-type effect. Large doses of Kratom can hospitalize the user, Vanatta said.\u000a\u000aScott Dostie was sharing the house with his parents, who lived upstairs, according to the affidavit. His parents told police they were shocked at what was found in the home.\u000a\u000aScott Dostie, Elexa Dostie and North were all being held Thursday (Aug. 24) at the Benton County Jail on bonds of $12,000, $5,000 and $10,000, respectively. Each has a hearing Oct. 2 in Benton County Circuit Court.

aVPhotos: Iconic British design From stunning skyscrapers to flamboyant fashion, perfectly formed household products to streamlined sports cars, British designers have built a reputation for innovation, imagination and style. We take a look at the British designs that have become icons in their own right. Hide Caption 1 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Rolls Royce \u2013 Engineer Henry Royce and car dealer Charles Rolls were the joint force behind the celebrated Rolls-Royce brand at the turn of the 20th century. The 1907 Silver Ghost, pictured, was among the most glamorous models produced by a name that became synonymous with luxury and quality. Hide Caption 2 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Jaguar E-Type \u2013 Aerodynamicist Malcolm Sayer was one of the first to apply the principles of aerodynamics to motor car design, used in Jaguar's elegant 1961 E-Type. Hide Caption 3 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Mini \u2013 Less glamorous than the E-type, but no less important, the Mini was born in 1959, when engineer and designer Sir Alec Issigonis designed a small, accessible car by pushing the wheels out to the corners and placing the engine sideways to make more space for passengers. Hide Caption 4 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Royal Enfield \u2013 Beloved of bikers the world over, the first Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle hit the road in the UK in the 1930s, with the tagline "Made like a gun, goes like a bullet." Made by one of the oldest motorcycle companies in the world, the Bullet has even been used by the Indian armed forces.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 5 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Spitfire \u2013 First used by the Royal Air Force in 1938, the Spitfire, a World War II fighter plane, was used in the Battle of Britain in 1940. More than 20,000 Spitfires were built in 22 different variants, with British aeronautical engineer Reginald Mitchell leading the team behind the first design. Hide Caption 6 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Concorde \u2013 The supersonic passenger jet Concorde was operated by British Airways and manufactured as a collaboration between British Aerospace and French firm Aérospatiale. Despite short flight times -- it could fly from New York to London in just under three hours -- it was not commercially viable, and the fleet of seven aircraft was retired in 2003 after some 50,000 flights since the 1973 maiden journey. But its long, drooping nose and slender wings its appearance as remarkable as its velocity. Hide Caption 7 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Gherkin \u2013 Nestled between more recent additions to the London skyline is Norman Foster's 30 St Mary Axe. Completed in 2003, it's popularly called the Gherkin (a British term for a pickled cucumber), due to its unconventional shape, designed to reduce wind deflection.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 8 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The original Wembley Stadium, with its distinctive Twin Towers, hosted the London 1948 Olympics and England's only football World Cup win, in 1966. Its replacement was designed by Foster and Partners, and features a distinctive 133-meter-high arch. It has a capacity of 90,000 and opened in West London in 2007. Hide Caption 9 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Penny Black \u2013 Based on Royal Mint engraver William Wyon's portrait of Queen Victoria on the so-called City Medal, the Royal Mail's 1840 Penny Black was the world's first adhesive postage stamp. A small stamp with pitch-black ink etchings, its radical design became the model for making stamps around the world. Hide Caption 10 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Sex Pistols poster \u2013 This provocative image was originally featured on promotional posters for the British punk rock band Sex Pistols' "God Save the Queen" single, released to coincide with the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977. Like the song's lyrics, the poster, design by British artist and anarchist Jamie Reid, was controversial at the time, but has since been reproduced on everything from mugs to jackets and shirts.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 11 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design McQueen's Union Jack frock \u2013 Designed for David Bowie for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, the now iconic "Union Jack" frock with its frilly black-lace cuffs is one of Alexander McQueen's earliest designs.

British troops wore the coat in the World War I trenches, where the weather-proof material kept off the rain and mud.

aV(CNN) Cindy Martinez joined the Marines when she was 17 years old.\u000a\u000a"When you go through Marine Corps boot camp or any type of training in the military, you're trained to be prepared for something big," she said.\u000a\u000aWhat Martinez didn't realize was how much she would need to rely on her mental toughness, not on the battlefield but in civilian life.\u000a\u000aMartinez served four years and met her husband, David, while on active duty. In May 2015, she was working full-time and raising two small children when her strength was put to the test.\u000a\u000aCindy Martinez with her husband, David, and two kids, David and Bianca, before she got sick.\u000a\u000a"One day, I woke up, and it just felt like a little ache on my left side, in my back shoulderblade area," she said.\u000a\u000aMartinez thought she must have slept on it awkwardly. But by the weekend, she was in intense pain.\u000a\u000a"David took me to the emergency room, and from there, I don't remember much," she said.\u000a\u000aFight of her life\u000a\u000aMartinez was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, a type of flesh-eating bacteria. She doesn't know how she contracted, it because she didn't have any visible cuts or wounds.\u000a\u000aDoctors removed the bacteria from her back, but her body was in septic shock.\u000a\u000a"Her life was now in danger," said her husband, David Martinez. "I tried to be as strong as possible for her and for the kids."\u000a\u000aThe medications that saved her life also ravaged her arms and legs.\u000a\u000a"My vessels were constricted, which didn't allow blood flow to my extremities because the doctors wanted all the blood to go to my heart," she said. "They told my husband, it was life over limb."\u000a\u000aMartinez fought for her life after being diagnosed with flesh-eating bacteria.\u000a\u000aMartinez underwent multiple amputations: both legs below the knee, her right arm above the elbow and portions of all the fingers on her left hand.\u000a\u000a"When I woke up and the amputations were done, it's a hard thing," she said. "They're gone, and they're not coming back."\u000a\u000aMartinez spent almost three months in the hospital and seven weeks in rehab. She learned to walk again with prosthetics.\u000a\u000aBut coming home wasn't easy.\u000a\u000a"It's almost like you're a different person," she said. "When your husband is at work, your kids are at school and you're home by yourself, that can take a toll on you."\u000a\u000aFinding new strength\u000a\u000aMartinez found support in an unlikely place. She reached out to CrossFit GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) gym in Dacula, Georgia, to see about becoming a member.\u000a\u000a"I still needed to work on myself and build my endurance to walk on my prosthetics," she said. "So I thought, 'Let me see if CrossFit could be something I could do.' "\u000a\u000aAmanda Greaver, founder of the gym, had never coached someone with multiple amputations. But she was up for the challenge. "It was a lot of trial and error, but Cindy has such a positive spirit," she said. "She's always up for anything I throw at her."\u000a\u000aWhen Martinez arrived at the gym, she could barely lift 5 pounds. But with modifications and adaptive devices, she can now squat 72 pounds and dead-lift up to 95 pounds.\u000a\u000a"Working out has really changed my outlook on life. It's my form of therapy," she said. "Now I can pick up my daughter, and I can pick up my son if I want to and hug them. ... I just can't put it into words."\u000a\u000aAfter regaining her strength, Martinez sought out a new challenge. She signed up for the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington in October.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I did the first 25 miles on my (modified) bike, and then I changed into my running prosthetics for the last 1.2 miles. My husband was there to finish it off with me," she said.\u000a\u000a"I was extremely proud," her husband said. "I could just see that determination on her face. ... No matter how tired she was, she just couldn't stop."\u000a\u000aMartinez completed the Marine Corps Marathon in October.\u000a\u000aMartinez was overcome with emotion when she crossed the finish line.\u000a\u000a"Just a year prior, I was in a hospital bed," she said.

aVWashington (CNN) As the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the US in more than a decade took aim at Texas , President Donald Trump's White House engaged in an age-old Washington tradition: the Friday news dump.\u000a\u000aAll three headlines popped after 6 p.m. Friday as TV news broadcasts and websites turned their attention to Texas, where Hurricane Harvey was preparing to make landfall as a Category 4 hurricane -- the most powerful to hit the US since 2004\u000a\u000aThe hurricane provided cover, ensuring that the controversial storylines wouldn't dominate TV news broadcasts, websites or front pages of the next morning's newspapers. The storylines even got overshadowed in Twitter feeds dominated by the cataclysmic predictions about damage the storm is expected to wreak.\u000a\u000aThe coordinated effort drew quick notice from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who slammed the news dump as "so sad, so weak."\u000a\u000a"As millions of people in TX and LA are prepping for the hurricane, the President is using the cover of the storm to pardon a man who violated a court's order to stop discriminating against Latinos and ban courageous transgender men and women from serving our nation's Armed Forces," Schumer wrote in a series of tweets. "The only reason to do these right now is to use the cover of Hurricane Harvey to avoid scrutiny."\u000a\u000aAs millions of people in TX and LA are prepping for the hurricane, the President is using the cover of the storm to 1/ \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) August 26, 2017\u000a\u000aThe President signed a memorandum issuing his directives on reinstating the ban on transgender troops during the day on Friday, but the White House waited until 6 p.m. to release the news\u000a\u000aTrump's memorandum bars the military from moving forward on an Obama-era directive that would have soon allowed the military to accept transgender individuals, orders the military to stop funding transgender-related medical treatments and allows the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to decide whether transgender individuals already serving could remain in the armed forces.\u000a\u000aAt 8 p.m., the White House announced in a news release that Trump had officially pardoned Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff who had been found guilty of criminal contempt in July for disregarding a court order in a racial-profiling case.\u000a\u000aTrump signaled at a rally Tuesday night in Arizona that he had decided to pardon Arpaio but said he would delay the announcement to avoid stirring controversy.\u000a\u000a"You know what, I'll make a prediction: I think he's going to be just fine," Trump said on Tuesday. "OK? But I won't do it tonight, because I don't want to cause any controversy."\u000a\u000aWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the next day Trump would announce his decision on the pardon "at the appropriate time."\u000a\u000aThen came news that Gorka was leaving the White House. Gorka, a controversial figure who earned publicity for his combative interviews and expressed anti-Muslim views, was a close associate of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.\u000a\u000aGorka's ouster or resignation was expected since Bannon was pushed out last Friday.\u000a\u000aThe story broke after 8 p.m. And disputes between the White House and Gorka over whether he resigned or was pushed out played out under the cover of 130 mph winds gusting toward the Texas coast.\u000a\u000aThe oversized Friday night news dump raised questions about whether the White House coordinated the release of the controversial news stories to coincide with the hurricane, or if the news dump was already planned -- and not scrapped.\u000a\u000aThe White House did not respond to a request for comment Friday evening about the matter.

aVJohn D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000aAtlanta (CNN) Before I launch into the argument for making all restrooms in the United States gender neutral -- that is, removing "men's" and "women's" labels -- I want to show you a photo.\u000a\u000aThis is James Parker Sheffield.\u000a\u000aNow a truly ridiculous question: Which restroom do you think he should use?\u000a\u000aMen's or women's?\u000a\u000aIn the United States at the moment, the legal answer depends on location. If Sheffield is in North Carolina, it's illegal for him to use a public men's restroom. Since he's a transgender man -- his birth certificate has an "F" on it -- he has to use the women's.\u000a\u000aIf he's at home in Atlanta, he can use the men's.\u000a\u000a"It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife," Sheffield wrote on Twitter along with his selfie. He posted that message in March, only hours after North Carolina passed a law making it illegal for transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond with their true gender identities.\u000a\u000aAs it's written, Sheffield would have to use the lady's room or break the law.\u000a\u000aThat's absurd, as the selfie and tweet make clear. Sheffield is a 36-year-old man who lives in Decatur, Georgia. He has a scruffy beard and a receding hairline, which he jokingly calls a "reverse fade." If he walked into a lady's restroom he'd likely be met with stares or screams or worse.\u000a\u000aBut you know what else is absurd? The idea that Sheffield -- or anyone else -- should have to choose a male or female restroom at all. And, beyond that, that any of us would feel entitled to decide someone else's gender for them -- and, consequently, where they can and can't pee.\u000a\u000aThis isn't a binary gender world. People don't fit neatly into the "M" and "F" boxes. It's time our public restrooms reflected that. The fairest way to do so is to desegregate restrooms by sex, and that means eliminating the men's and women's rooms in favor of "all gender" restrooms.\u000a\u000aThink that's an overreaction? Take a quick look at the history of bathroom politics in the United States. We've tried time and again to control who we sit and stand next to at the toilet.\u000a\u000aIn the 1960s, black civil rights activists were killed for trying to use "whites only" bathrooms. In the 1980s, gay men were harassed because the public wrongly assumed they could catch HIV-AIDS from a toilet. (AIDS was viewed then as a gay man's disease). Restrooms weren't required to be accessible to people with wheelchairs until the Americans with Disabilities act of 1990. And now, some cities and states are trying to keep transgender people out.\u000a\u000aThe only justification is bigotry and ignorance.\u000a\u000aYou might think that allowing a transgender person to use the restroom of their choice is a workable solution. It's a first step. But Sheffield and others who don't conform to gender norms face discrimination even when they're legally allowed to choose which restroom to use.\u000a\u000aSeventy percent of transgender people surveyed in Washington, for example, a city with progressive laws allowing people to use either restroom, reported "verbal harassment, assault and being denied access to public restrooms" because of their identities, according to a report from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles . Further, 54% reported medical problems "like dehydration, urinary tract infections, kidney infections and other kidney problems" because they avoided using restrooms entirely.\u000a\u000a@PatMcCroryNC It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife. #HB2 #trans #NorthCarolina #shameonNC pic.twitter.com/4b4OdmfmeN \u2014 James P Sheffield (@JayShef) March 24, 2016\u000a\u000aSheffield told me he plans his days around where he can and can't pee.\u000a\u000a"I almost never go to the restroom in a place I haven't been at least once before," he told me. He cuts appointments short and avoids going out simply to avoid peeing in public. Sometimes he'll find the one stall in a men's room is occupied, or out of order. Other times he sits on the toilet for longer than necessary because he worries it's suspicious a man would sit down to urinate.\u000a\u000a"It's not a good feeling to be a grown-up and wondering, 'Am I going to make it to a restroom on time -- and how do you explain it if you don't,'" he said.\u000a\u000aSuch fears apply not only to transgender people but also those who don't meet our rigid gender norms. In 2013, I met a female middle school student in Mississippi , for example, who told me her teachers wouldn't let her use the girl's restroom because she had short hair and wore hoodies. She looked too boyish.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Young and out in Mississippi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Young and out in Mississippi 03:15\u000a\u000aGendered restrooms support these biases.\u000a\u000a"We need a restroom revolution in this country," said Kathryn Anthony, an architecture professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\u000a\u000aI agree. And there are simple places to start. Restaurants and small businesses with two single-unit restrooms simply can paint over the "M" and "W" on their doors and -- ba-da-bing! -- they're gender inclusive. No one's harmed as long as we men stop peeing on the toilet seat.\u000a\u000aPhiladelphia recently made that concept law for single-stall bathrooms. Other governments and businesses should follow. (And if you're a business that is considering this sort of move, please send me a tweet ).\u000a\u000aThen, bigger leaps: The International Building Code should suggest all-gender restrooms become the norm, or at least be included, in larger businesses and public establishments. (That idea comes from Terry Kogan, a law professor at the University of Utah.)\u000a\u000aCity, state and federal governments also could legislate these restrooms into existence, too.\u000a\u000aIt won't happen immediately, but new construction and renovations could be subject to our updated understanding of which types of bathrooms are safest for everyone. That's the precedent set by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Kogan said.\u000a\u000aHarvey Molotch, a professor of sociology at New York University and co-editor of the book "Toilet: public restrooms and the politics of sharing," outlined for me what he considers to be the Holy Grail of restrooms. Walk in and you'd see a long line of private toilet stalls, with floor-to-ceiling doors. On the other side would be a row of communal sinks. Anyone is free to use any stall -- and there might be a row of urinals tucked away somewhere to the side.\u000a\u000aThe urinals could be left out of some restrooms, but they should be kept when possible, Molotch said, because they're much more water-efficient than sit-down toilets.\u000a\u000aAll this sounds wildly inoffensive to me.\u000a\u000aAnd it's already happening.\u000a\u000aThe Cooper Union, a college in New York, announced on March 18 that it is removing gender identification from restrooms on campus and opening single-occupancy toilets up for anyone's use. "We have always been ahead of our time and we must continue being leaders on issues of social justice," Bill Mea, acting president, wrote in an email to the campus\u000a\u000aThe Urban Justice Center, also in New York, made a similar move a decade ago.\u000a\u000a"I'm delighted to be able to share that our experiences have been wholly positive," the center's executive director, Doug Lasdon, and a development associate, Hugh Ryan, wrote in a recent op-ed in the Washington Post . "To this day, we have not received a single complaint. Not one in a decade. Nor have any incidents of violence or harassment been reported."\u000a\u000aThere's little counterargument other that bias and squeamishness.\u000a\u000aSheffield, the transgender man in Georgia, doesn't expect the all-gender restroom revolution to occur anytime soon. "If we could go to sleep tonight and wake up and all the bathrooms were gender neutral -- great! But it's not practical," he said. "It's not going to happen that way."\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, he said, a little courteousness would help.\u000a\u000a"We can't hold it," he said. "Trans people have to pee multiple times a day, just like everyone else."\u000a\u000aCurrently, there are only two places Sheffield feels comfortable peeing.\u000a\u000aOne's at home.\u000a\u000aThe other's at work.\u000a\u000aAnd that's because it's labeled "all gender restroom."

The spin-off of the glitzy New York restaurant was just as star-studded in Miami, drawing crowds for 17 years before closing in 2012.\u000a\u000aThe next wave came in 2001, with the openings of Nobu and Sushisamba in Miami Beach.\u000a\u000aSushisamba has been a popular venue in Miami Beach since 2001.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, this trend has exploded, with the number of Miami outposts of New York restaurants easily surpassing a baker's dozen, and showing no signs of slowing down.\u000a\u000aMiami's Design District will soon welcome an ABC Kitchen from Jean-Georges Vongerichten, as well as L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon.\u000a\u000a"I have to pause when giving restaurant recommendations to friends visiting from New York," says Evan Benn, editor in chief of the Miami Herald's Indulge magazine.\u000a\u000a"Because some of the places I'd suggest to them -- Lure Fishbar, Upland, Lucali, Bagatelle, Il Mulino -- they can go to at home."\u000a\u000aTravel hot spot\u000a\u000aThe Dutch at W South Beach is a Miami-infused take on the New York version.\u000a\u000aBut why exactly is Miami such popular territory for these transplants?\u000a\u000aCulinary publicist Larry Carrino, president of Brustman Carrino Public Relations, has had a pivotal role in the local food scene, working with chefs and restaurants for the past 23 years. He says there are a few contributing factors for the NYC-Miami restaurant connection.\u000a\u000a"Number one, there's that long-running joke of Miami being the sixth borough," he says.\u000a\u000a"It's true in the sense of former New Yorkers calling this home, whether it's full time or if they bounce back and forth. There is definitely a pipeline between the two cities."\u000a\u000aThe second factor, he says, is "Miami's well-earned reputation as an international travel hotspot. We are at the crossroads of the Americas, so you have an amazing opportunity to do business here."\u000a\u000aIt also helps that this tourism is less seasonal than it used to be. "We're not six months on, six months off anymore," says Carrino.\u000a\u000aLocal fan base\u000a\u000aBut it's his third point, about Miami locals, that seems to be one of the most crucial ingredients in a successful south Florida expansion.\u000a\u000a"We have a very interesting, eclectic, and now year-round local support base," he says.\u000a\u000aEvan Benn agrees: "I don't think the intent of these Miami outposts is to target New York tourists and snowbirds. I think it's more of a nod to the international appeal of both cities, and the recognition that Miami, like New York, is really hungry for great restaurants."\u000a\u000a"Once upon a time," Carrino recalls, "we had clients whose outlook was, 'We don't need the locals.' We were mystified by that. "Locals are the ones who are walking into a restaurant on a Tuesday night, sitting at the bar having a bottle of wine and some appetizers.\u000a\u000a"They're not coming in because the [big-name] chef is cool -- they like the food and, if anything, they have a relationship with the general manager or the chef de cuisine, the guy who's in the kitchen every day."\u000a\u000a'NYC at the beach'\u000a\u000aFamous chefs and familiar restaurant names may help attract some visitors, especially in Miami hotels where many of these restaurants can be found. But they don't automatically guarantee long-term success.\u000a\u000a"Even the best restaurants fail if their owners are asleep at the wheel," says Benn.\u000a\u000a"It's no coincidence that Lure's chef/partner Josh Capon is down here from New York all the time, and that Upland chef Justin Smillie and owner Stephen Starr are constant presences in Miami. Or that both restaurants are always packed with happy eaters."\u000a\u000a"We love Miami for the same reasons a lot of other New Yorkers love it," says David Massoni, one of chef Dale Talde's business partners in Talde, which first opened in Brooklyn and now has outposts in Jersey City and Miami Beach.\u000a\u000a"It's a very diverse city, culturally and food-wise as well. While it totally has its own vibe and energy, it also has a feeling of New York City at the beach. When we turned to our staff to see who wanted to possibly move to Miami and open our new restaurant, everyone's hands shot up."\u000a\u000aScarpetta is one of a number of successful New York spin-offs in Miami.\u000a\u000aA number of Carrino's current clients are successful spin-offs of New York restaurants, including Scarpetta, Lure Fishbar and The Dutch.\u000a\u000a"Take Andrew Carmellini," he says, of the chef behind New York's Locanda Verde, Little Park and Bar Primi, in addition to The Dutch. "He had knowledge of Miami. He had been down here many times as a child. He said, 'I want to do The Dutch in Miami but I don't want to replicate it, I want to do a Miami take on it.'\u000a\u000a"It looks different, it feels different. There's a sweet spot that needs to be struck between innovation and embracing the uniqueness of your location, whether you're opening in Miami or Tuscaloosa or Madison, Wisconsin. If restauranteurs wanted to do the same thing over and over again, they'd roll out a chain."\u000a\u000aWhy these NYC restaurants came to Miami\u000a\u000aIn their own words:\u000a\u000aTalde\u000a\u000a"We fell in love with Miami when we did the South Beach Wine & Food Festival for the first time in 2013. But the opportunity to open Talde in what was then the Thompson Hotel Miami Beach [now The Confidante] came to us. And if it was going to be in a 'foreign' city that none of us lived in, we wanted to do a concept that was something we had done before, something we felt comfortable doing. But we wanted to make the best version of it that we possibly could. For the first time, we were able to work with a design team and create a space that was new and fresh and about us." -- partner David Massoni.\u000a\u000aTalde at The Confidante Miami Beach by Hyatt, 4041 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aEmployees Only\u000a\u000a"We saw how Miami was developing an appreciation of the cocktail culture and the food scene was becoming more substantial and appreciated. There are so many people in Miami who get us. Either because they have lived or spent time in New York and have been to Employees Only, or they just welcome an alternative New York vibe while still being in the sunshine and beauty of Art Deco South Beach." -- founder Billy Gilroy.\u000a\u000aEmployees Only , 1030 Washington Avenue, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aLure Fishbar\u000a\u000aLure Fishbar is popular with visitors, locals and NYC transplants.\u000a\u000a"We decided to bring Lure Fishbar to Miami Beach since a large majority of our guests in New York spend a large portion of the year in Miami. Our menu of fresh seafood and sushi was embraced by visitors and locals right away." -- partner John McDonald, CEO of Mercer Street Hospitality.\u000a\u000aLure at Loews Miami Beach Hotel, 1601 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aUpland\u000a\u000a"Miami is always a great destination but now more than ever it's emerging as a truly competitive culinary destination. Upland opening in Miami brings the concept back to its palm tree roots and I think it's a great fit for the South of Fifth community that's very neighborhood-minded but also full of jet-setters that go between Miami, New York and other great global cities." -- chef/partner Justin Smillie.\u000a\u000aUpland , 49 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aBlue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill\u000a\u000a"Long-time customers of Blue Ribbon, who happened to be hoteliers, presented us with a vision for their new hotel and it all clicked from there. We found the Miami dining scene didn't really have a ton of traditional Japanese restaurants, so it was a natural fit. We think that our combination of traditional sushi and a great kitchen menu, with dishes like oxtail fried rice, and our famous fried chicken with wasabi honey, is unique to Miami and complementary to the diversity of the city" -- partner Ken Bromberg.\u000a\u000aBlue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill at The Plymouth Hotel, 336 21st Street, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aSushisamba\u000a\u000a"After the success of the two original locations in New York City, we knew we had to expand and we felt like Miami was the perfect choice. It was a natural, due to its South American roots, international appeal, its energy and of course the influx of New Yorkers who flock to the city and make Miami their playground during the colder months. Another important aspect was the arrival of Art Basel Miami Beach, which debuted around the same time" -- CEO Shimon Bokovza.\u000a\u000aSushisamba , 600 Lincoln Road, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aSushisamba fits right into the Miami ecosystem, says chief executive Shimon Bokovza.\u000a\u000aComing back soon: Serafina\u000a\u000a"Serafina opened a pop-up at Dream South Beach in 2012. We opened in time for Art Basel and tested the waters to see if our brand would resonate with Miami residents, not just our established New York customers who flock down south. Restaurants in Miami need a local following and cannot rely only on snowbirds and tourists. As we expected, the restaurant did attract Miami families and local celebs. We anticipate making an announcement soon about a new, bigger location in Miami." -- spokesperson Caroline McBride\u000a\u000aEven more NYC flavors in Miami\u000a\u000aThe Shops at Mary Brickell Village, 900 S Miami Ave; and Lincoln Road Mall, 1111 Lincoln Road, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aAt W South Beach, 2201 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aAt Fontainebleau, 4441 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach\u000a\u000a1930 Bay Road, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aAt the Nobu Eden Roc Hotel, 4525 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach\u000a\u000a1501 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach\u000a\u000a840 1st Street, Miami Beach; and at Acqualina, 17875 Collins Avenue, Sunny Isles Beach\u000a\u000a220 21st Street, Miami Beach\u000a\u000aLincoln Road Mall, 1111 Lincoln Road, Miami Beach; and 1450 South Dixie Highway (US1), Coral Gables\u000a\u000a432 Española Way, Miami Beach

aVEditor's Note: On April 23, Jacob Zurl completed his Cuba challenge, cycling 1450km in 58 hours and 48 minutes -- nearly two hours slower than his initial estimated time. The article below was first published on April 18, the day before the Austrian began cycling across the Caribbean island.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Sleep deprived, the mind begins to play tricks. Exhausted, the body begs for no more. But Jacob Zurl carries on. He must. Records can only be broken when the spirit refuses to bow.\u000a\u000aEnduring when the majority would quit is this Austrian's specialty.\u000a\u000aThe extreme cyclist lives to achieve the unthinkable: cycling across the Himalayas in a record 39 hours, setting world firsts in high altitude.\u000a\u000aThis month he is to cycle non-stop the length of Cuba, from east to west, on gravel and dirt tracks, in extreme heat, perhaps tropical rain. It will be humid. It could be 1450 kilometers (900 miles) of hell.\u000a\u000aNo one has attempted this round-the-clock feat. The 28-year-old hopes to complete his mission -- the equivalent of cycling from New York to St Louis in the Midwest -- in 57 hours. Experienced cyclists would normally take two weeks.\u000a\u000aHe will, he says, nap for a few minutes, weather permitting, and when nature calls he will hop off his bike. But essential functions will be brief. Time moves forward without rest and so must he.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Extreme Cuba: 1450km, 57 hours, 1 song Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Extreme Cuba: 1450km, 57 hours, 1 song 01:34\u000a\u000aFor a little over two days, Zurl will mainly be pedaling, relentlessly so, fighting the aches in the body, the manipulative voices in his mind and whatever the elements throw at him.\u000a\u000aIt is his inquisitiveness, as well as a love for adrenaline, which drives him.\u000a\u000a"When I look at the world map, for me, as an ultra cyclist, I see so many interesting projects," he tells CNN Sport.\u000a\u000a"Why hasn't someone done this challenge before? Cuba is such an interesting country.\u000a\u000a"I want to get in contact with the people, to know the country. I have endurance in cycling and the Cuban people have endurance in life."\u000a\u000aYoung men wait by the side of the road for the remains of former Cuban President Fidel Castro to pass by on their four-day journey across the country.\u000a\u000aThe Caribbean's largest island is experiencing an uncertain era following the death of Fidel Castro in November 2016.\u000a\u000aCastro, regarded as a revolutionary hero to his supporters and a ruthless autocrat to his enemies, was the man who created a communist state in America's backyard.\u000a\u000aBut earlier last year, Barack Obama became the first US President to visit the country in 88 years as relations between the Cold War-era adversaries thawed. It is yet unclear what policy US President Donald Trump will pursue, but it is possible he will harden America's stance towards the island.\u000a\u000aCuba, a country 90 miles off the Florida coast, is renowned for its color and spirit, but its vivacity will not shield Zurl from the agony he will undoubtedly experience as he forces his body to cover a daunting distance at rapid pace.\u000a\u000aRiding along, and up and down, rickety roads, his body will rattle as if riding on a pneumatic drill. Crouched for hours, his back will eventually feel as tight as old rubber and his muscles will be as hard as week-old bread.\u000a\u000aWhile the lights on his bike will guide him through dark nights, it is music -- and an iron will -- that will drive this son of a bank manager on when he is sucked into a black hole of physical suffering.\u000a\u000aCuriously, he will only listen to one song, a familiar beat, lyrics he can easily repeat. Sometimes, he may even sing along. Quietly, of course, for it is long-distance cycling, not singing, which is his forte.\u000a\u000a"I haven't decided what song it will be yet in Cuba," he laughs, revealing that his tune of choice during a recent training stint in Spain was Mumford and Sons' "Believe" before adding that he rode up the Himalayas listening to "Free" by Natalia Kills.\u000a\u000a"For the long distance projects, the music makes it easier," he says. "Once my support car drove over one of my MP3 players. That was s***."\u000a\u000aZurl is the sort of man who would feel lost riding without music.\u000a\u000aHe will take three portable music players to Cuba, a precaution against a repeat of the previous disaster.\u000a\u000aFor many, listening to the same song for hours, for days, seemingly forever on loop, would be as torturous as pedaling from one end of a country to another at 25 kph.\u000a\u000aBut when life on the saddle feels effortless, Zurl's mind drifts. He will contemplate about his yesterdays and make plans for his tomorrows. "I'm thinking about everything," he admits.\u000a\u000aHe hears the music, but doesn't listen. The music, he says, goes "under my mind."\u000a\u000aIt is when the adventure becomes a chore that Zurl refocuses on the beat of his favorite tune which will push him to achieve a feat no man or woman has done before.\u000a\u000a"It's always just one song. It's kind of spiritual. When it's getting hard and I want to listen to music and there is no music, it's a problem for me," says Zurl, who has been cycling an average of 20 hours a week in preparation for this ride, focusing on speed rather than endurance.\u000a\u000a"The worst thing to happen in this race would be if I lost my MP3 players."\u000a\u000aBut Zurl has experienced deeper misery than the crushing of his portable music player.\u000a\u000aIt was while in Cuba, before his first attempt to cycle across the island in 2015, that Zurl contracted dengue fever.\u000a\u000a"I felt suddenly not good," is his understated description of the day he was hastily taken to hospital, his temperature rising to 40 degrees.\u000a\u000aZurl says he fears catching dengue fever again during his ride along the country.\u000a\u000aIn nine days, he lost seven kilos. He says he caught the tropical disease, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, when cycling in heavy rain during a training session on the island.\u000a\u000aHe is better prepared for this his second attempt, though that does not mean he has forgotten easily about the fright of two years ago.\u000a\u000aAsked what he feared the most about the journey ahead, he gravely replies: "Catching dengue again."\u000a\u000a"There was a heavy shower and I didn't have the (mosquito) spray and, I think, that was the problem," says Zurl, regret still in his voice.\u000a\u000a"I did not think it was going to be so dangerous.\u000a\u000a"I took the plane back to Austria and for the next two months sport was forbidden and, after that, I started to cycling again, but in 2016 I fell ill so many times."\u000a\u000aIt is Zurl's experience with dengue which partly explains why his family will be close behind in a support car this time around.\u000a\u000aHis parents, Paul and Brigitte, a medical physicist, and girlfriend, Nina Almer, are the ones who will drive behind with food supplies, isotonic drinks, spare wheels and, of course, his MP3 players.\u000a\u000aThe mum who once told her then-18-year-old son he was "completely stupid" for spending a vast sum on shoes for his new two-wheeled hobby is now fully supportive of his long-distance expeditions.\u000a\u000a"First my parents were skeptical," admits Zurl, once a promising sailor of international class before cycling took hold.\u000a\u000a"It needed a lot of energy for me to convince them, but in the last two years or so it's easier and they know, for me, it's important.\u000a\u000a"If it's not too dangerous they will let me do it. In the past it was difficult because my father loved to sail and I'd sail in regattas.\u000a\u000a"That's all changed. Not only do my parents now cycle, but my uncle and aunt do too. Sometimes we cycle together and we have our own jersey. I made it for them with the family name on it."\u000a\u000aIt is perhaps fitting that Zurl's mum will be on hand to make sure her son eats properly, though he does not need his mother to remind him of the dangers of not consuming the right calories at the right time. Every engine needs fuel.\u000a\u000aEating for endurance, says Zurl, is a skill. "I really have to eat a lot," he says, sighing.\u000a\u000aExperience has taught him he will have to eat or drink 500 calories an hour to compensate for the minerals he will lose through sweating.\u000a\u000aEven food lovers would balk at the thought of consuming 30,000 calories in two-and-a-half days -- especially when presented with a diet of rice and potatoes, essential for this race against the clock.\u000a\u000aWill Zurl find fresh vegetables along Cuba's dirt tracks?\u000a\u000aHe says he would love to, but is unsure what will be available en route. Protein bars and drinks, he says, will suffice if fresh food cannot be found.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Ultra cyclist to cross Cuba in 57 hours Austrian ultra cyclist Jacob Zurl is planning to see Cuba like no person has ever seen before ...

aVOn tonight\u2019s AC360°, Anderson spoke with Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY, following Friday\u2019s vote to keep interest rates on government-backed student loans from doubling. Most Democrats, including Maloney, opposed the move, blasting Republicans for raiding a preventative care fund in President Obama\u2019s health care law, in order to pay for their bill, accusing those across the aisle of going after women, yet again.\u000a\u000aBut when Anderson pointed out Democrats, including Maloney, dipped into that very same fund to pay for an extension of the payroll tax cut earlier this year, things got a little heated. Additionally, the prevention fund does not appear to specifically target women\u2019s health, rather, it paints in much broader brushstrokes. As Maloney points out, the preventative measures funded in the health care bill do benefit women and their families.\u000a\u000aBut if Democrats have raided this fund before, and if the fund does not specifically target women\u2019s health programs, can you really call what Republicans did Friday a \u201cwar on women\u201d?

aVStory highlights Tracy Stokol: Upon graduating, many vets face enormous amounts of educational debt\u000a\u000aShift in gender makeup of vet students indicates burden will likely increase, she says\u000a\u000aTracy Stokol is a veterinarian and professor at Cornell University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) That cute puppy! That fluffy kitten! Your adorable companion gives you devotion, loyalty and endless fodder for your social media feeds. It can also, however, give you major sticker shock when you receive the vet bill.\u000a\u000aEven basic tests and checkups can leave you grumbling about the debt that little Fido or Felix owes you. But as you wonder how your little friend can be so expensive, you probably don't consider the heavy cloud of debt that hangs over your vet.\u000a\u000aTracy Stokol\u000a\u000aImagine starting your working life with a debt of about $150,000 -- equivalent to the mortgage on a decent-size house. This is the situation facing most vet school graduates across the United States today, with future students expected to take on even more debt. Educational debt is common among many industries and has become a major political issue in the last few years. But vet debt is a special case.\u000a\u000aLet's start with its sheer magnitude. The level of debt accrued from medical and health science degrees is higher than that of any other graduate degrees due to the high costs of teaching these intensive professions. For vets, the debt burden is compounded by one of the lowest starting salaries among medical professionals. Salaries are even lower for those who have finished four years of veterinary school in addition to their bachelor's degrees but are continuing their training to pursue a doctorate or specialize in a field -- orthopedic surgery, for example.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that veterinarians had the highest debt-to-income ratio of all medical-based professions. And with these debt levels ever increasing, the reality facing many new vet school graduates, barring a substantial financial windfall, is decades of debt repayment. Want a mortgage? Want a car? Think again.

aV(CNN) As Hurricane Harvey barrels toward the Texas coast, the Houston metropolitan area, prone to flooding and home to more than 5 million people, is bracing for the potentially devastating storm.\u000a\u000aHouston's school system has already canceled classes on Monday, the first day of classes. The city's parks and main zoo are closed.\u000a\u000aThe Houston Dynamo, the city's Major League Soccer team, canceled this weekend's games and Coldplay nixed its Friday night concert, all in preparation for Harvey, which was expected to make landfall by early Saturday.\u000a\u000aHouston's main concern is the risk of flooding. In May, the city was hit by heavy flooding when 240 billion gallons of rain fell on the city. That claimed eight lives, flooded more than 1,000 homes and caused more than $5 billion in damage, according to officials.\u000a\u000aNow the city is staring down Harvey, which Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, called "the first major hurricane the nation has dealt with since 2005."\u000a\u000aHouston is one of the most populated metropolitan areas in the country and one of the fastest growing, according to the US Census Bureau.\u000a\u000aThe National Weather Service office in Houston warned flooding and winds could render parts of South Texas "uninhabitable for weeks or months."\u000a\u000aAnd CoreLogic, an analytics firm, said Harvey, which developed into a Category 4 storm on Friday, could bring $20 billion worth of damage to metropolitan Houston alone.\u000a\u000aHarris County, home to Houston, has issued voluntary evacuation orders for several communities near Trinity Bay. But Houston itself has not been put under an evacuation order.\u000a\u000a"Right now, it appears that the Houston area will be spared the brunt of the hurricane force and the surge that goes along with it," said Gov. Greg Abbott at a press conference. "So that will minimize some of the danger."\u000a\u000aStill, the governor encouraged people to consider evacuating.\u000a\u000aCity at risk of flooding\u000a\u000aHouston floods easily because of how flat it is, according to CNN meteorologist Jennifer Varian.\u000a\u000a"They start flooding between two and three inches," Varian said, and the amount of rain anticipated to drop on Houston throughout the course of Harvey is "going to be far exceeding that."\u000a\u000a"In the next seven days," Varian said, "Houston is looking at 22-and-a-half inches."\u000a\u000aHarvey has drawn a lot of comparisons to 2001's Tropical Storm Allison, which killed dozens and caused billions of dollars in damage in Texas. Allison eventually stalled over land, and dumped more than 30 inches of rain over Houston, causing catastrophic flooding.\u000a\u000aLike Allison, Harvey is expected to stall when it makes landfall and drench Houston for days. But compared to Harvey, Varian said, "Allison was a measly little storm."\u000a\u000aOfficial: Use 'common sense'\u000a\u000aMayor Sylvester Turner told CNN Friday the city has been preparing for the storm over the last four or five days and is aware of which areas are susceptible to flooding.\u000a\u000aIf we want to stay safe, stay calm. We will get through this together. All city employees are expected at their post tomorrow. \u2014 Sylvester Turner (@SylvesterTurner) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000a"It's all hands on deck," Turner said. "The fire department is ready, the police department is ready. The emergency management is 24 hours. We will stay with this thing all the way through."\u000a\u000aHe asked Houston residents to "exercise common sense," and stay off the streets through the weekend.\u000a\u000a"People need to know this is not a one, two-day event and done," he said. "Even though it may seem like it will get better, this is a four or five-day event starting tomorrow evening, going through Monday or Tuesday."

aVThomas Page, CNN \u2022 Updated 18th May 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Dubai is growing again, and again it's building into the sea.\u000a\u000aGlobal investment company Dubai Holding unveiled this week plans for Marsa Al Arab, a four million square feet pair of man-made islands either side of the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah, the city's iconic sail-shaped hotel.\u000a\u000aThe project, estimated to cost $1.72 billion, will add 1.4 miles of beach to Dubai's coastline. With ground breaking scheduled for June, Dubai Holding say the islands will be completed late 2020.\u000a\u000aGeared towards tourists, one island will include family-friendly resorts, a 2.5 million square-foot marine park and a custom built 1,700-seat theater, home to the Middle East's first Cirque du Soleil show. It will also house 300 seafront apartments.\u000a\u000aThe second, private island is set to host 14- luxury villas and marina for residents, along with a boutique hotel.\u000a\u000aMarsa Al Arab will add 2,400 hotel rooms to the Jumeirah Group's portfolio. The group is part of Dubai Holding, which is majority-owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai.\u000a\u000aJumeriah Group have experience when it comes to man-made islands. They manage the Burj Al Arab, located 280 meters off Jumeirah Beach on artificial land first constructed in 1994.\u000a\u000aOther artificial islands of grander scale and logistical complexity have followed the Burj, with varying levels of success.\u000a\u000aSea dredgers are used to create Dubai's artificial islands.\u000a\u000aPalm Jumeirah, 9.6-square miles and constructed between 2001 and 2006, is now home to hundreds of family residences and at least two dozen hotels.\u000a\u000aPalm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira are both set to eclipse the Jumeirah, but have suffered setbacks stemming from the global financial crisis of 2008. Construction of the former began in 2002 but it remains incomplete, while the latter, still in construction, has been scaled down and rebranded Deira Islands.\u000a\u000aLuxury 300-island system The World was constructed 2.5 miles off the Dubai coast between 2003 and 2008. Most islands were sold off to contractors to build private residences in 2008, but thus far the archipelago remains largely unoccupied.

aVMichael Weiss is a national security analyst for CNN and author of "ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror." The opinions in this article are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It was in the course of falsely arguing that in his denigration of women as creatures best suited to the barnyard and kennel he was only referring to Rosie O'Donnell that then-candidate Donald Trump explained the central cultural plank of his campaign. "I've been challenged by so many people, and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either."\u000a\u000aPerhaps sensing this response did not entirely satisfy debate moderator Megyn Kelly, whose menstrual cycle he would later invoke as a reason for her aggressive line of questioning, Trump added that his criticisms were all in good fun, a form of release in the face of so many mean-spirited enemies.\u000a\u000a"Take him seriously, not literally," was the most seriously taken justification for Trump's broad appeal and his campaign's infinite supply of lifeboats from Titanic scandals of mocking the disabled, prisoners of war, Gold Star parents and Mexicans. Two variations on this theme of rationalization were: "Relax, he doesn't really mean it." Or: "Well, maybe he means it a little, but at least this is straight talk, not the verbose gobbledygook of the professional Washington swamp-dweller."\u000a\u000aNo doubt the President does not always mean what he says or even understand what he says. But his loyalists, who share in his mistrust and hatred of the US press corps, have got a point when they argue that a too easily mortified and euphemistic class of pundit failed to appreciate just how well the language of the bar stool and the barracks went down with the American electorate in 2016.\u000a\u000aTrumpian PC\u000a\u000aA curious thing has happened, however, in the course of making America great again, or possibly as a result of it. Total political correctness has returned as a priority, only now the hanky-clutching arbiters of what is kosher to pronounce in public inhabit the right and earnestly turn up whenever they believe someone has gone too far in criticizing or belittling their anti-PC president. A populist movement born of tolerating no controversial subject -- from illegal immigration to Islamist terror to Hillary Clinton's medical history -- has suddenly discovered its safe space: protecting a fragile and easily offended commander in chief.\u000a\u000aThis is no more apparent than in discussion of the urgent matter of Trump's mental and emotional well-being, currently an anxious pastime of many Americans, according to a new Quinnipiac poll , which found that nearly 70% of those canvassed do not find Trump "levelheaded." (Antonyms of that evocative term include "excitable" and "unstable" \u2014 "nuts," you might say.)\u000a\u000aSurely then his mental health is a newsworthy subject?\u000a\u000aNo, say Trump loyalists, who have transformed themselves into Berkeley college speech police when it comes to any mention of the topic, or even a discussion that it is indeed a topic. On Sunday, CNN's Brian Stelter pointed out the simple fact that journalists often sound like human beings when their microphones are turned off or their copy has gone to bed. They ask themselves: "Is the President of the United States a racist? Is he suffering from some kind of illness? Is he fit for office? And if he's unfit, then what?"\u000a\u000aAll of which are sober and necessary questions at a time when the President professes to believe that white supremacist and neo-Nazi rallies contain "some very fine people" but that the US intelligence community, in interrogating Russian interference in the last US election, behave as actual Nazis and that journalists who report critically on government are "sick" and "don't like our country."\u000a\u000aFox News wasted no time in declaring Stelter's disclosure a venial sin for a media critic. One former talk show host, who surely knows about asking questions that most journalists are too intelligent or career-minded to ask, suddenly likened those wondering if Trump hadn't quite taken leave of his senses to would-be John Wilkes Booths.\u000a\u000a"As disgusting as the @realDonaldTrump Must-be-Crazy crowd," Geraldo Rivera tweeted , rushing for his safe space, "are their fellow travelers rooting for his assassination. See where this is going?"\u000a\u000aStraight into Al Capone's vault.\u000a\u000aQuestioning a president's sanity is by no means in league with giving license to murder him. If this were the case, then James Clapper, a veteran spy and patriot who has served in several US administrations, would be guilty of high treason for asserting on "CNN Tonight" with Don Lemon in the early hours of Wednesday morning, after Trump's fugal speech in Phoenix, "I really question his ability to \u2014 his fitness to be in this office ... [T]his behavior and this divisiveness and the complete intellectual, moral and ethical void that the President of the United States exhibits ... how much longer does the country have to, to borrow a phrase, endure this nightmare?"\u000a\u000aClapper then added that having such a person in charge of America's atomic arsenal caused him some concern. Put into appropriate context, the former director of national intelligence was comparing the President of the United States to an irrational dictator of a nuclear rogue state, about whom a former director of national intelligence might nervously be briefing the president of the United States under normal circumstances.\u000a\u000aOn the same late-night program CNN Contributor Mike Shields tried his very best to bring our troubled national discourse back to a level of civility it has absolutely no right to enjoy.\u000a\u000aObjecting to Lemon's characterization of Trump as an "unhinged" liar, Shields argued, somewhat cleverly, that such chatter was only a gift to Trump and his backers. "He's not fit for office takes us, veers us, into a place where it allows people that want to criticize media, when you want to push back on them and say the President shouldn't criticize us and that's crazy for him to do that, when we turn and say he's actually insane, you're doing the work of the President and the people that want to criticize the media."\u000a\u000aSomehow I think the media will be doing the work of the President and the people who want to criticize the media no matter what. He will also selectively praise it when it suits him. See, for instance, Sean Hannity's cultivation of the conspiracy theory about the death of DNC employee Seth Rich, the seed of which was planted by Julian Assange, a man who often sounds as if he is ready at any moment to declare himself a poached egg.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Lemon: Trump speech 'total eclipse of the facts' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lemon: Trump speech 'total eclipse of the facts' 01:43\u000a\u000aThis noxious myth, possibly even encouraged by the White House, has outlasted the Rich family's imploring Hannity to cease and desist. The Fox presenter's punishment for spreading fake news? Trump's approbation in Phoenix as a " great guy ," an "honest guy."\u000a\u000aNot that pro-Trump conservatives are arguing the media has got to fall in behind a disturbed and unpopular leader. The President's miserable handling of the Charlottesville atrocity was, according to Shields, a "legitimate conversation."\u000a\u000a'Culture of Complaint'\u000a\u000aTwenty-five years ago, a remarkable book was published entitled "Culture of Complaint: A Passionate Look into the Ailing Heart of America," by the celebrated art critic Robert Hughes. Hughes was, in no order of priority, a recovering Catholic, recovering Marxist, and recovering Australian and he had an abiding and by no means condescending fascination with this country.\u000a\u000aHis thesis was that the extremes of the left and the right had come to rely upon each other for their reasons for being and in so doing had come to resemble each other not only in style but sometimes also in substance. (Feminists seeking to ban pornography were thus welcomed as strange bedfellows, as it were, on the evangelical circuit.)\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThe dressed-up and easily lampooned terminology of the hard left had, under certain conditions, been taken up by the free-market and militarist right. Hence, as against "vertically challenged" or "differently abled" people, conservatives had what Hughes called "Patriotic Correctness," which masked unpleasant realities as corporate management-speak. "Equity retreat" was how to sugar-coat the 1987 stock market implosion; "corporate rightsiding" was a pretty phrase for the mass sacking of employees.\u000a\u000aRe-reading Hughes today is like reading a postcard from the present. "Radical academic and cultural conservatives are now locked in a full-blown, mutually sustaining folie a deux," he wrote about the age of Reagan, "and the only person each dislikes more than the other is the one who tells both to lighten up."

aV(CNN) The dead submarine crew hadn't moved from their stations for nearly 150 years when the vessel was raised from the ocean in 2000. Whatever killed them happened so suddenly that they never made a run for the escape hatch. What's more, they had no obvious physical injuries.\u000a\u000aThere was no major damage to the hull that could be definitively traced back to the day the H.L. Hunley, a 40-foot-long Confederate submarine, sank to the ocean floor off Charleston, South Carolina, on February 17, 1864.\u000a\u000aResearchers had unsealed the crew compartment of the submarine, but they have yet to find conclusive evidence of how the eight men aboard died.\u000a\u000aBut in research published Wednesday in the journal Plos One one group of scientists thinks they've finally cracked the case of what killed the crew so swiftly.\u000a\u000aShrinking down, blowing up\u000a\u000aThe Hunley became the first sub to sink an enemy ship in battle: the USS Housatonic. But sometime after, it went down, too.\u000a\u000aIt sank the enemy ship with a 135-pound torpedo, which was filled with black powder and attached to a pole 16 feet from the ship's hull. The study authors say the torpedo is the key -- but many have wondered how an explosion could've killed the entire crew without leaving a trace.\u000a\u000aRachel Lance set off explosions near a miniature replica of a Civil War submarine.\u000a\u000aTo answer this question, biomechanist Rachel Lance designed a model of the Hunley, one-sixth the length of the 40-foot-long submarine. The model, built by Durham-based sculptor Tripp Jarvis, was christened the CSS Tiny.\u000a\u000aLance, then a graduate student at Duke University and an engineer with the Naval Surface Warfare Center , decided she would set off test explosions next to the model submarine. So she found an eight-acre pond on a family-run farm in St. Louis, North Carolina. Bert Pitt of Pitt Family Farms agreed to let Lance use the pond to conduct her experiments.\u000a\u000a"Initially, when she was talking about blasting, I was a little concerned," said Pitt, 65, a sixth-generation family farmer, whose grandchildren now make eight generations.\u000a\u000aPitt recalled the wires snaking into the lake and the charges that detonated beneath the surface, splashing water into the air like a large firecracker, he said. One of his grandkids got to press the button.\u000a\u000a"It had a little geyser to it," he said. "It was neat to see."\u000a\u000aPitt, a self-proclaimed history buff, had always been interested in the Civil War. He has ancestors who were in the North Carolina Regiments, and at least one of them is buried in their own family graveyard. The house he lives in was built in 1830, before the Hunley sank.\u000a\u000aHe keenly eyed reports about the Hunley on the History Channel and the National Geographic Channel.\u000a\u000a"They were sitting perfectly still in that submarine," Pitt said. "I think people would like to know what did happen to the crew. Everything about the story is intriguing."\u000a\u000aWithout a trace\u000a\u000aSuspended inside the CSS Tiny was a small pressure gauge, which revealed how the sub's own torpedo blast could have killed the Hunley crew without leaving a lasting mark: the shock wave created by the blast.\u000a\u000aThe shock wave hit the Hunley's hull, which was less than an inch thick, said Lance, lead author of the new study. The metal bent ever so slightly but fast enough to transfer the blast wave to the inside of the cabin.\u000a\u000aThat wave then traveled through the cabin, hitting each of the eight crewmembers, traveling through their bodies. But the real damage, Lance said, probably occurred when the pressure wave reached their lungs.\u000a\u000a"The issue is when it's passing through (the tissues) and it suddenly hits air," she said.\u000a\u000aShock waves, like sound waves, travel quickly in water and solids but not air. The wave slows as it hits the lung, Lance said, and "that energy has to transmit somewhere."\u000a\u000aThe end result: The blood vessels in the lungs can rupture, known as a pulmonary hemorrhage.\u000a\u000a"It was ... noted that men could be killed or disabled at considerable distance" from an explosive, Dr. Thomas Chiffelle, a pathologist from Albuquerque, New Mexico, wrote in a 1966 report for the US Department of Defense. "The man or animal may be killed outright, without external signs of injury, but often with blood-tinged froth or frank blood appearing in the nose and mouth."\u000a\u000aIt is possible to survive a blast wave from far enough, according to Chiffelle's accounts. Witness accounts from the night of the Hunley's sinking claimed that there was a blue light coming from the ocean. Some speculated that it was the Hunley crew signaling that they'd accomplished their mission.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Delving into mysteries of submarine H.L. Hunley Confederate submarine H. L.

The blast can also change with how tightly the powder is packed and how fine the grains are, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Replicating the black powder explosion, Lance said, was the trickiest part of the experiment.\u000a\u000aSo Lance lowballed it, testing several blasts in the process. She concluded that the shock wave would have instantly killed those aboard the Hunley, based on her calculations and a wealth of prior air blast experiments on large animals.\u000a\u000a"Any explosive we've seen in the field ... would definitely create a lethal wave," Lance said.\u000a\u000a"These types of injuries are not subtle," she added. "The damage is immediate."\u000a\u000aTick tock\u000a\u000aThere was another piece of evidence that stood in her favor: a gold pocket watch that belonged to the Hunley's captain, Lt. George Dixon.\u000a\u000aThe watch had stopped at 8:23, about the time of the Hunley's attack, historians believe.\u000a\u000a"Most importantly, it appears it didn't wind down naturally," according to a 2007 update by a research partnership known as the Hunley Project. "Something traumatic -- perhaps water, a shock wave, or some other intervening force -- caused it to stop at that precise time."\u000a\u000aFriends of the Hunley -- part of the Hunley Project, which was not involved in the new research -- declined to comment on the research.

Without it, Thanksgiving and Christmas meals might well become tasteless and definitely less fragrant.\u000a\u000aHarvested from the inner bark of a tropical evergreen plant, cinnamon has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat respiratory and digestive problems for centuries. Ancient Egyptians used cinnamon as a perfume during the embalming process, while Romans used it in funeral pyres to mask the stench of burning flesh.\u000a\u000aThe Bible mentions cinnamon several times, most commonly as a way to perfume bedding, clothes and anointing oil.

"So it almost comes full circle, as we're now going back and proving what some of these plant substances may do for health."\u000a\u000aNot all cinnamon is created equal\u000a\u000aThere are two basic types of cinnamon. Ceylon, or Cinnamomum verum, is grown in Sri Lanka. C. cassia, C. loureiroi and C. burmannii, communally known as cassia, are widely produced in China and Indonesia. Cassia has the stronger flavor and odor of the two and, due to its much lower cost, is what we buy in the store to sprinkle on our food.\u000a\u000aBut it's the more expensive Ceylon version, with a milder, sweeter flavor, that might be the best for your health.\u000a\u000aCassia can contain relatively high concentrations of coumarin, a plant compound that can damage the liver. A study of 91 cinnamon samples from various stores in Germany found 63 times more coumarin in cassia cinnamon powder than Ceylon powder. Cassia sticks, which look like a thick layer of rolled bark, also contained 18 times more coumarin than Ceylon sticks, which have thin layers.\u000a\u000a"A challenge with some of these herbal solutions, because they are not a regulated drug, is that you don't know exactly what you are getting," said registered dietitian Melinda Maryniuk, who serves on the professional practice committee for the American Diabetes Association. "A lot of things affect the makeup of the product: where it's grown, the soil, growing conditions, even how the spice was stored and dried."\u000a\u000aThat problem also plagues research on cinnamon. Scientists have used different doses, species and compounds of the spice for their research.\u000a\u000a"The doses have varied greatly among the studies, from less than 1 gram to levels that would be toxic in humans," Wright said. "The duration of taking the capsules has also varied greatly. That's the problem with translation of all of this work. Even when we find positive results, how do we come up with the correct compounding and dosage for maximum safety?"\u000a\u000aKeep that in mind as you read on about where science stands on cinnamon.\u000a\u000aDiabetes and cholesterol\u000a\u000a"I think the strongest evidence lies so far with diabetes and the promise of cinnamon and blood sugar control," Wright said, pointing to studies in test tubes and mice and even small studies in people showing that cinnamon helps with insulin sensitivity and glucose transport while decreasing inflammation.\u000a\u000a"A lot of the studies have been in postmenopausal women and men of that age," said biochemist Amy Stockert, who studies cinnamon at Raabe College of Pharmacy at Ohio Northern University. "Some have found positive effects; other studies have not."\u000a\u000aStockert co-authored a small study of 18 people with type 2 diabetes that showed the cassia species of cinnamon was more effective than diet alone in lowering blood glucose levels. In fact, her study found that it was comparable to oral diabetes medications.\u000a\u000aAnother study of 60 people with type 2 diabetes found that small doses of cinnamon reduced blood sugar levels and improved LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol.\u000a\u000a"I like the fact that the amount that showed benefits for blood sugar and cholesterol in that study was 1 to 6 grams, which is the range of half-teaspoon to three teaspoons, or one tablespoon, so it's easy to sprinkle on cereal or in yogurt or use in recipes," said registered dietitian Lisa Drayer, who writes about nutrition for CNN. The Food and Drug Administration's recommended limit is 6 grams a day.\u000a\u000aBut while the future looks promising, the American Diabetes Association urges caution.\u000a\u000a"The ADA believes there's not enough evidence," Maryniuk said. "A 2013 meta-analysis, which is one of the most rigorous of reviews, found that cinnamon had no impact on hemoglobin A1c levels, which is what we look at to measure how well blood sugar is being controlled over time. If that had gone down, I'd be more impressed."\u000a\u000aStill, if you want to see whether cinnamon works for you, Maryniuk suggests that people with type 2 diabetes do a self-test.\u000a\u000a"Do some paired blood glucose testing," she said. "Use a half a teaspoon in the morning, on fruit or oatmeal or in coffee, and see what happens to your blood sugar levels before and after you eat. Check again two to three hours later and see if there's a difference.\u000a\u000a"But keep taking your medicine," she warned. "You don't want to try something to the exclusion of the medicine you're taking."\u000a\u000a"We still need a bit more work before we roll this out," Wright agreed. "And you must be careful to work with your doctor when using cinnamon with diabetes medications, as it might drop your blood sugars too low."\u000a\u000aDementia, HIV, cancer and more\u000a\u000aThe antioxidant properties of cinnamon are also being studied for their impact on the formation of the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Cinnamaldehyde, a compound responsible for the spice's sweet smell, and epicatechin, a powerful antioxidant that's also in blueberries, red wine and chocolate, seem to offer some protection against the oxidative stress that damages tau, a key player in the development of dementia.\u000a\u000aAnother study found a component of Ceylon cinnamon to have the same effect. However, research has occurred only in mice, rats and laboratory Petri dishes.\u000a\u000a"It appears to work as an anti-inflammatory or antioxidant, protecting the body on a cellular level from bad things that happen," Wright said, "by getting rid of waste products and keeping the cells healthy."\u000a\u000aCinnamon and other traditional Indian medicinal plants are also being tested in the fight against HIV. One study found that green tea, elderberry and some extracts of cinnamon rich in flavonoids blocked the virus from entering and infecting certain cells.\u000a\u000a"That's how AZT works, which is one of the early HIV drugs," said Wright, who specializes in nutrition for infectious disease at the University of South Florida. "And while that's interesting, what I would hate is that patients will use cinnamon and other supplements instead of their HIV medications.\u000a\u000a"Having worked with many HIV clients over the years, I know there's definitely a big interest in supplements," she said. "But I would always caution them to always use the meds that we know work, that have been tested and dosed, and then look carefully to make sure there are no conflicts with any additional supplements."\u000a\u000aThe research on cinnamon doesn't stop there. Ceylon cinnamon has also been associated with cancer-fighting properties in rodents, anti-parasitic effects, improved diabetic neuropathy, lower blood pressure and wound healing, including liver damage. Studies have shown that solutions of cinnamon oil can kill a number of common bacteria, such as streptococcus and E. coli. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health is investigating cinnamon's impact on multiple sclerosis.\u000a\u000aUsing a computer model, biochemist Stockert found that cinnamon was as effective as resveratrol, an antioxidant in red wine known for anti-aging and disease-fighting properties, in activating SIRT-1 -- also known as the longevity gene because of its role in repairing DNA.\u000a\u000a"In some cases, it did better than resveratrol," Stockert said. "We're talking anti-cancer, anti-aging, a very, very big deal if that is what is going on."\u000a\u000aCinnamon as health aid\u000a\u000aBased on all this preliminary research, the potential of cinnamon seems enormous. But experts caution that it's still too early in the scientific process to suggest cinnamon as a daily supplement.\u000a\u000a"I don't recommend capsules. There's not enough science to tell us to take capsules," Wright said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"You are affecting your body's signaling," Stockert said, "and that's significant. We're at an early stage in research where we don't know how cinnamon will affect most people. Is it healthy to cook with spices and use them liberally? I'm sure that's fine. But I would be cautious about taking any supplements on their own."\u000a\u000a"I think the bottom line is that cinnamon is a perfect pantry staple, a pleasant spice that can add flavor to foods for minimal calories, with antioxidant properties that may give an edge to those looking to better control their blood sugar," Drayer agreed. "But we need to see more research before we can make any solid health claims linking cinnamon to reduce risk of disease or improved health."

aVJamie Metzl, a senior fellow of the Atlantic Council, has served as a director on the US National Security Council, at the State Department and on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff. He also served with the United Nations in Cambodia and is author of "Eternal Sonata" and three other books. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The world long ago grew accustomed to the belligerent behavior of North Korea's Kim family, so more of their same aggression is hardly a shock. But in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's recent statements threatening North Korea with "fire and fury like the world has never seen," and his string of World Wrestling Federation-style taunts, we are all starting to come to terms with the implications of America being led by its own Kim.\u000a\u000aOf course, there are limits to the comparison: The American Kim is not committing " crimes against humanity ," enslaving more than 120,000 of his own people in brutal prison camps , and executing his perceived enemies.\u000a\u000aAnd certainly, even though both nation's leaders are threatening the other with nuclear annihilation, nuclear weapons in the hands of a heinous and ruthless regime like North Korea's pose a far greater threat to the world. These weapons could be used to blackmail other countries at best and extract revenge during a time of regime collapse at worst.\u000a\u000aBut the in many ways mirror image leaders of the United States and North Korea are together making a terrible situation even worse.\u000a\u000aTrump is correct to recognize that North Korea's nuclear weapons pose a real threat to the United States and its allies and that it would be ideal if Pyongyang could be somehow convinced to denuclearize. But as I wrote in my CNN Opinion piece last week , the only ways that North Korea will give up its weapons is if its leaders come to believe the cost of maintaining nuclear weapons is greater than the cost of giving them up -- or if those leaders are overthrown.\u000a\u000aBecause nuclear weapons provide North Korea's regime with far more international leverage, prestige, and security than most any other investment they could make, arriving at this conclusion would require the North Koreans to believe either (1) that the United States would be willing and able to engage in a full-scale preemptive war with North Korea designed to topple the North Korean government and is willing to risk massive US and allied casualties, the destruction of the US-South Korea alliance, and a potential military conflict with China in doing so, or (2) that China would be willing to completely cut off its food, energy, and trade lifeline to North Korea in the absence of denuclearization.\u000a\u000aDespite Donald Trump's absurd, dangerous, and extremely unhelpful huffing and puffing (and tweeting), there is no preemptive military option for the United States other than all out war. That's why US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has called this possibility "catastrophic" and "tragic on an unbelievable scale." That's also why the North Koreans feel so comfortable calling President Trump's bluff only minutes after he has drawn his red lines. Because preemptive military action is not a credible option, getting China to pressure North Korea to change its behavior is the only logical strategy for the United States and its allies.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, through its strategic incoherence, general incompetence, poor decisions and dangerous bombast, the Trump administration has weakened most of America's alliances, undermined US credibility, and significantly empowered its adversaries. In spite of the recent UN sanctions, the Trump administration's overall weakness and perceived untrustworthiness make pressuring China all the more difficult.\u000a\u000aIt's not too late for the US to invest in a strategy of pressuring China to do more by raising the costs to China of continuing its tacit support for North Korea, but doing so would require a massive shift in the functioning and behavior of the Trump administration that seems a long way from the current chaos.\u000a\u000aSuch a policy would require working far more closely and respectfully with allies South Korea and Japan and strengthening missile defense capabilities in both countries that would secondarily undermine China's own nuclear deterrent, encouraging a Japanese military buildup, building greater leverage with China by resuscitating the strategically critical Trans Pacific Partnership, and a host of other painstaking steps the Trump administration has so far failed to take. This policy would also require meaningful dialogue with Beijing about what might come after a North Korean regime collapse and how Chinese strategic interests could be respected under such a scenario. And America's President would need to behave less like his North Korean counterpart and more like a responsible leader.\u000a\u000aEven with all of this, it would still be tough to convince China to risk the collapse of its North Korean ally unless China comes to believe for its own reasons that it would be better off with a Korea reunified under South Korean law than it would be with the current situation. If logic is a guide, China may someday arrive at this conclusion, but it will probably not be soon.\u000a\u000aRegime change could also potentially lead to denuclearization. As I've written elsewhere , it's a fair bet the North Korean regime will eventually collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. But the regime has survived over seven decades and totalitarian governments can be remarkably stable, at least until they are not.\u000a\u000aBecause there are no good options, the most likely outcome of this crisis will be an eventual US policy drift toward a de facto recognition of North Korean nukes and a policy of containment similar in some ways to that once used on the USSR. This will likely lead to a nuclear arms race in Asia and lots of other very bad outcomes, but it may wind up being the only choice for now.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aBut there's also the possibility that the hazardous combination of two nuclear powers, the US and North Korea, each led by a bombastic, aggressive leader spouting fighting words to compensate for domestic weakness, could increase the chances of dangerous miscalculations and unpredictable outcomes.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's Kim is less constrained by his government institutions than is Trump, but we do not yet fully know how effectively America's governance culture and institutions can moderate the dangerous, destabilizing, and mercurial impulses of the US President. If those institutions fail and America's foreign policy comes to match its leader's unconstrained compulsions, North Korea could be the least of our problems.\u000a\u000aCorrection: This piece initially referred to the World Wrestling Federation as Foundation.

aVYou're going to read this, and you're going to say, how is this about tech? I'm gonna head you off at that pass: This is a message from Internet, the generation that became the voice that set the tone for everything you love about the Net. And it's pissed. -Editor\u000a\u000aEarlier generations have weathered recessions, of course; this stall we're in has the look of something nastier. Social Security and Medicare are going to be diminished, at best. Hours worked are up even as hiring staggers along: Blood from a stone looks to be the normal order of things "going forward," to borrow the business-speak. Economists are warning that even when the economy recuperates, full employment will be lower and growth will be slower-a sad little rhyme that adds up to something decidedly ­unpoetic. A majority of Americans say, for the first time ever, that this generation will not be better off than its parents. \u2014New York Magazine\u000a\u000aGeneration X is sick of your bullshit.\u000a\u000aThe first generation to do worse than its parents? Please. Been there. Generation X was told that so many times that it can't even read those words without hearing Winona Ryder's voice in its heads. Or maybe it's Ethan Hawke's. Possibly Bridget Fonda's. Generation X is getting older, and can't remember those movies so well anymore. In retrospect, maybe they weren't very good to begin with.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000aBut Generation X is tired of your sense of entitlement. Generation X also graduated during a recession. It had even shittier jobs, and actually had to pay for its own music. (At least, when music mattered most to it.) Generation X is used to being fucked over. It lost its meager savings in the dot-com bust. Then came George Bush, and 9/11, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Generation X bore the brunt of all that. And then came the housing crisis.\u000a\u000aGeneration X wasn't surprised. Generation X kind of expected it.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is a journeyman. It didn't invent hip hop, or punk rock, or even electronica (it's pretty sure those dudes in Kraftwerk are boomers) but it perfected all of them, and made them its own. It didn't invent the Web, but it largely built the damn thing. Generation X gave you Google and Twitter and blogging; Run DMC and Radiohead and Nirvana and Notorious B.I.G. Not that it gets any credit.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000aBut that's okay. Generation X is used to being ignored, stuffed between two much larger, much more vocal, demographics. But whatever! Generation X is self-sufficient. It was a latchkey child. Its parents were too busy fulfilling their own personal ambitions to notice any of its trophies-which were admittedly few and far between because they were only awarded for victories, not participation.\u000a\u000aIn fairness, Generation X could use a better spokesperson. Barack Obama is just a little too senior to count among its own, and it has debts older than Mark Zuckerberg. Generation X hasn't had a real voice since Kurt Cobain blew his brains out, Tupac was murdered, Jeff Mangum went crazy, David Foster Wallace hung himself, Jeff Buckley drowned, River Phoenix overdosed, Elliott Smith stabbed himself (twice) in the heart, Axl got fat.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is beyond all that bullshit now. It quit smoking and doing coke a long time ago. It has blood pressure issues and is heavier than it would like to be. It might still take some ecstasy, if it knew where to get some. But probably not. Generation X has to be up really early tomorrow morning.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is tired.\u000a\u000aIt's a parent now, and there's always so damn much to do. Generation X wishes it had better health insurance and a deeper savings account. It wonders where its 30s went. It wonders if it still has time to catch up.\u000a\u000aRight now, Generation X just wants a beer and to be left alone. It just wants to sit here quietly and think for a minute. Can you just do that, okay? It knows that you are so very special and so very numerous, but can you just leave it alone? Just for a little bit? Just long enough to sneak one last fucking cigarette? No?\u000a\u000aWhatever. It's cool.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is used to disappointments. Generation X knows you didn't even read the whole thing. It doesn't want or expect your reblogs; it picked the wrong platform.\u000a\u000aGeneration X should have posted this to LiveJournal.\u000a\u000aRepublished from Mat Honan's tumblr.

The award includes $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages.\u000a\u000aEva Echeverria, a 63-year-old from Los Angeles, said she had been using the powder as a regular part of her feminine hygiene routine since she was 11 years old. She stopped using it in 2016, after she read a news story about another woman who used it and had ovarian cancer.\u000a\u000aEcheverria's is the first of hundreds of similar cases in California to be decided. Juries elsewhere have returned four other verdicts against Johnson & Johnson, and another case in New Jersey was dismissed. There are thousands of similar cases going through state and federal courts right now.\u000a\u000aEcheverria testified that had there been a warning label on the product, she would have stopped using it.\u000a\u000aThe company has no legal obligation to put such a label on its product. Because talcum powder is legally considered a cosmetic, it does not have to undergo a review by the US Food and Drug Administration like a drug would. But it would have to be properly labeled with ingredients and other information, and the product "must be safe for use by consumers under labeled or customary conditions of use," according to the agency.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV"Throughout his time as sheriff, Arpaio continued his life's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration," read a statement released by the White House. "Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now 85 years old, and after more than 50 years of admirable service to our nation, he is (a) worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon."\u000a\u000aThe pardon of Sheriff Joe checked so many boxes for what we know about how Trump views the world and operates that, in retrospect, it was utterly predictable.\u000a\u000aTo wit:\u000a\u000a* Trump likes people who like him: Arpaio had been a fierce advocate of Trump since the billionaire began running for president back in June 2015. Their relationship, in fact, extended back before Trump's presidential campaign; Arpaio has said Trump sent him "thank you" notes earlier this decade for his aggressive pursuit of false claims that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States.\u000a\u000aArpaio formally endorsed Trump's presidential campaign just before the Iowa caucuses in 2016, saying "I have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration. I know Donald Trump will stand with me and countless Americans to secure our border." From that point on, Sheriff Joe became a fixture at campaign rallies for Trump. He was given a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention. He was floated as a possible head for the Department of Homeland Security.\u000a\u000aThe point: Trump rewards loyalty. And Arpaio has been unflinchingly loyal.\u000a\u000a* Trump likes "tough" people: Arpaio came to national prominence in the early 1990s for his "Tent City" -- an open-air prison in a state where temperatures in the summer often rise well above 100 degrees. He dyed the prisoners' underwear pink. He cut three meals a day to two to save money. He eliminated salt and pepper from the prison diet. He proudly touted his nickname as "America's toughest Sheriff."\u000a\u000aTrump is drawn to all of that. He views the country and its politicians as having softened -- as not being tough enough to deal with the challenges the world now presents. Remember that Trump said on the campaign trail that he "would bring back waterboarding " and "bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding."\u000a\u000a* Trump likes people who aren't politically correct: This ties closely to Trump's desire for more "tough" people. Arpaio, to Trump's mind, was willing to do whatever it took to lower crime and stop illegal immigration. "He kept Arizona safe!" : This ties closely to Trump's desire for more "tough" people. Arpaio, to Trump's mind, was willing to do whatever it took to lower crime and stop illegal immigration. "He kept Arizona safe!" Trump tweeted about Sheriff Joe following the pardon.\u000a\u000aTo Trump, the vilification of Arpaio as an overly aggressive bully who targeted Hispanics even after the courts had warned him not to is a perfect example of the liberal left enforcing its ridiculous standards of political correctness on a populace that doesn't see things the way the coastal elites do.\u000a\u000aIn pardoning Arpaio, Trump reaffirms his war on political correctness -- one of the central tenets of his 2016 campaign and, he believes, his appeal.\u000a\u000a* Trump is a provocateur: At root, Trump likes to provoke. He knows he does best when he has an opponent, an enemy to compare and contrast himself to. It's why he prospered as a candidate -- with an unpopular opponent -- and has struggled mightily as President without any obvious foil.\u000a\u000aAny chance Trump gets to needle the left, the elites, the media or anyone else who is not his political base, he takes. Because controversy means attention. And controversy means opposition. And Trump desperately needs attention and opposition in order to thrive.\u000a\u000a* Trump plays to his base: Trump has never seemed to understand -- or care -- about the conventional wisdom that the way elections are won is securing your base and then reaching out to independents and other voters who aren't hard partisans.\u000a\u000aEvery policy proposal during the campaign was in the service of his base. Since he has been President, the same has held true. From the so-called "travel ban" to his ban on transgendered people serving in the military to the Arpaio pardon, it's all been a base play.\u000a\u000aTrump appears to believe that the path to political success runs entirely through his base. And that he simply does not need to move to the middle or moderate in any meaningful way.\u000a\u000aAdd it all up and the pardoning of Sheriff Joe feels inevitable. Because, well, it was.

aV(CNN) Big, colorful and goofy, "The Tick" returns at a more hospitable place and time -- on a streaming service (Amazon) that doesn't mention ratings, at a moment when pop culture is already crawling with superheroes. That could make the third time the charm for Ben Edlund's comic-book spoof, which is fun, even if it doesn't quite get under your skin.\u000a\u000aPreviously turned into a short-lived 2001 Fox series starring Patrick Warburton (who gets a producer credit here), "The Tick" probably fared best TV-wise in animation, with a 1990s Fox kids show that drew its share of grown-up fanboys amused by an oblivious hero whose battle cry ("Spoon!") was delightfully nonsensical.\u000a\u000aThe latest version adopts a slightly darker tone and employs a serialized format, with cliffhanger endings for most of the half-hour episodes.\u000a\u000aStill, the result is largely the same, with the Tick (Peter Serafinowicz) -- a hero with more brawn than brains -- splashing into the life of neurotic accountant Arthur (Griffin Newman), a young Woody Allen-type who the nigh-invincible blue guy is determined to turn into his sidekick. "When destiny speaks, she speaks to me," the Tick proclaims, with Dudley Do-Right-type earnestness.\u000a\u000a" allowfullscreen>\u000a\u000aLiberated by the format, Edlund weaves more backstory into this incarnation. Arthur is obsessed with the Terror (Jackie Earle Haley), a master villain, long presumed dead, who was responsible for his father's death. Other heroes, meanwhile -- bearing a more-than-passing resemblance to various DC staples -- keep popping up, like the murderous vigilante Overkill (Scott Speiser) and the strange caped visitor Superian (Brendan Hines), who soars around righting wrongs.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) This time last year, CNN Opinion asked a group of commentators from around the world for their take on the US presidential election. One year later, Donald Trump is preparing to be sworn in as President of the United States. So, what is the world expecting -- and hoping for -- from a Trump presidency? Guest commentators from around the world weigh in. The views expressed are their own.\u000a\u000aRussia: A domestic win for Putin\u000a\u000aWhen Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, he received a round of applause in the Russian parliament. It was a pure, almost childish expression of joy.\u000a\u000aSince then, the "Russian factor" has loomed ominously over Trump's impending presidency. The Russian term " kompromat " -- compromising material -- is entering the English language, much like "sputnik" did more than 50 years ago. The American press debates -- in total seriousness -- whether the Kremlin is literally keeping the President of the most powerful country on Earth on its leash and shaping his policies. More importantly, the notorious hacking story is far from over. For many in Washington, Vladimir Putin has become the main trickster of the election.\u000a\u000aHowever, Russian officialdom was hardly expecting a Trump victory. Viewing the American election as a zero-sum game with the West, Putin planned for a likely defeat. Before Election Day, Russia's propaganda machine was warming up to announce that a flawed American political system would never let the anti-establishment candidate win. That was supposed to be Russia's consolation prize.\u000a\u000aThen, defeat suddenly turned into victory. Russia is beyond satisfied with this serendipitous turn of events. A happy and astounded Kremlin will now try to get the most from Trump -- from easing sanctions to making a deal on Syria and settling the Ukraine issue.\u000a\u000aIt is difficult, of course, to predict how Trump's administration will address these issues and what the result will be. But this uncertainty hardly undermines the feeling that Russian officialdom has been experiencing: a sense they have achieved a moral victory over the West and its values.\u000a\u000aSince the annexation of Crimea, the West has labeled Putin a pariah and a global threat. Yet now, Trump's win has made something clear: It is not Putin who is a weak outlier before the world's liberal order. Rather, it is the West that is divided and full of resentment. An outcast yesterday, Putin may now see himself as a major power broker in the emerging global Trumpworld.\u000a\u000aThe least that the Kremlin will now expect from the White House is a display of respect and equality. After what has been presented by Russian propaganda as years of unprecedented humiliation and offense from the West, Putin will easily sell his country's newfound parity with the United States to the Russian public for his own personal gain.\u000a\u000aTransforming Putin's moral triumph into a dramatic expansion of Russian influence on the global stage will be trickier. But from the Kremlin's point of view, it is probably doable.\u000a\u000aMikhail Fishman is editor-in-chief of The Moscow Times.\u000a\u000aMexico: Will Trump really pursue his 'Mexican agenda'?\u000a\u000aAna Maria Salazar\u000a\u000aThroughout his campaign, we all hoped he would tone down such rhetoric so as not to alienate the Hispanic vote (too much, at least). However, his rhetoric simply became more vitriolic -- and more threatening.\u000a\u000aSo President Enrique Peña Nieto invited him to Mexico , perhaps in hopes that the hospitality and reality of bilateral relations would change Donald Trump´s opinion about the southern border (and awkward facts such as there being potentially millions of jobs at stake -- on both sides of the border -- if he decided to scrap NAFTA).\u000a\u000aBut mere hours after returning from Mexico, not only did Trump NOT change his mind, but he engaged ( in Arizona of all places ) in some of his most anti-immigration rhetoric yet. Meanwhile, in Mexico there was a backlash against Peña Nieto's decision to invite Trump, forcing Finance Minister Luis Videgaray -- seen as instrumental in arranging the visit -- out of the Cabinet.\u000a\u000aAs the votes were tallied on election night, there was hope that Trump's rhetoric was campaign garbage and not genuine policy. But in the two months since the election, Trump has reiterated his calls for a wall, insisted that Mexico will reimburse the US for the cost and called for the renegotiation of NAFTA and a border tax for companies that invest in Mexico and wish to send their products to the United States.\u000a\u000aOn the back of all this, the Mexican peso has plunged, and there is concern that on January 20, the least popular person in decades to be sworn in as US President will deliver a speech that could be catastrophic for the Mexican economy.\u000a\u000aSince losing his role at the finance ministry, Luis Videgaray has been appointed foreign minister, and will head negotiations with the United States. Perhaps the President is hoping that Trump will now play and negotiate in an appropriate way. He likely is wrong.\u000a\u000aThrough his threats, tweets, and speeches, Trump may have left the President and his negotiators with no political wiggle room to sign any kind of agreement that requires ratification by the Mexican Senate. And the chances for a candidate from Peña Nieto's party will likely be scuppered in the 2018 presidential elections unless the President can convince Trump not to initiate massive deportations and to stop insisting on building the wall.\u000a\u000aBut if Trump believes his "Mexican agenda" helped get him elected, it is hard to imagine he will do anything but continue to insist on his beautiful wall, deportations and a new and "improved" NAFTA agreement.\u000a\u000aAna Maria Salazar worked at the White House as policy adviser for President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the Americas and was deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug enforcement. She writes, teaches and has anchored radio and TV news programs in Mexico since 2001.\u000a\u000aIsrael: Netanyahu breathes a sigh of relief\u000a\u000aYaakov Katz\u000a\u000aAfter eight years of hostility and tension with President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will let out a huge sigh of relief Friday when Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.\u000a\u000aFor Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition government, Trump's presidency is viewed as a new beginning when it comes to Israeli-US relations. One government minister went so far as to say that Trump's victory in November signals that "the days of the Messiah" have come.\u000a\u000aThat might be a stretch, but for Israel, Trump seems like the antithesis of the outgoing president.\u000a\u000aWhile Obama regularly pressured Israel to stop construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Trump's advisers have said they will not. While Obama refused to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, Trump has said that he will . And while Obama championed the Iran deal that Israel aggressively tried to prevent, Trump has raised the possibility that he will scrap it.\u000a\u000aWhile this all bodes well for the current government in Jerusalem, it remains to be seen what Trump will do when it comes to Israel's ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. Will he follow the longstanding US policy of pushing for a two-state solution or will he offer new options for a resolution?\u000a\u000aWill he stand strong against settlement expansion or will he allow Israeli annexation of settlements as some government ministers are advocating?\u000a\u000aSo far, Trump hasn't said much, although the announcement that his son-in-law Jared Kushner will serve as the president's Middle East envoy seems to indicate that he plans to take on the thorny issue.\u000a\u000aLike other countries in the Middle East, Israel is hoping to see a more engaged America playing an active role in the region. The presence of Russian military forces in Syria, for example, is believed to be directly linked to Obama's decision not to enforce his "red line" on the use of chemical weapons in that ongoing civil war and humanitarian disaster. Leaving a vacuum allowed Russia to enter the country.\u000a\u000aWill Trump re-engage the Middle East or will he prefer to remain on the sidelines and stay away from a region that has for decades frustrated consecutive American presidents?\u000a\u000aStarting on January 20, the world will begin to get some answers.\u000a\u000aYaakov Katz is the editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post and co-author of " Weapon Wizards: How Israel Became a High-Tech Military Superpower ."\u000a\u000aIndia: Did America get its Modi?\u000a\u000aSanjay Kumar\u000a\u000aOn the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, India is experiencing some of the same kind of anxiety it felt when Narendra Modi was about to become the country's prime minister, back in May 2014\u000a\u000aA right-wing Hindu leader with a controversial political past who cultivated an image as an outsider, Modi's rise to power disturbed the existing political equilibrium in the country, and his election brought with it a heightened sense of unpredictability and uncertainty among not just Indians, but overseas as well. Indeed, for many -- particularly the country's liberals -- it took quite some time for the reality of a Modi premiership to sink in.\u000a\u000aA sense of disbelief and uncertainty has gripped many people here again.\u000a\u000aWill the improvement in India-US relations continue with a Trump administration? How will Indians settled and working in the United States be treated? Will the protectionist measures that Trump is talking about impact Indians living abroad? Will such policies affect the outsourcing that keeps so many Indians in India working?\u000a\u000aThese are just some of the questions Indians have. But the questions also extend to international affairs -- how is India going to adjust if Washington decides to revise Obama's policy towards the Middle East and western Asia? Policymakers in New Delhi are already worried, for example, that reimposing sanctions on Iran would impact India's crude oil supply and delay the completion of Chabahar port that will create a new trade route for Afghanistan and drastically alter the trade dynamics in South Asia.\u000a\u000aIn addition, New Delhi is also keenly waiting to see how Trump goes about dealing with Pakistan. Will he continue the old policy of transactional engagement with the Muslim state or take a firm line over its support for terror groups?\u000a\u000aBut there is a more philosophical concern among liberals in India: The potential impact of a close political entente between Modi and Trump. The fear is that the political proximity between the two leaders, who have strong anti-Muslim, anti-minority images, will unleash and strengthen forces inimical to liberal and secular values. Such sentiment is already simmering in India since Modi assumed office in 2014 -- and his presence has contributed to keeping the Indo-Pakistan relationship on tenterhooks.\u000a\u000aMany on the Indian subcontinent see Trump as Modi's alter ego. Closer ties between them might prove to be a double-edged sword for our country.\u000a\u000aSanjay Kumar is a New Delhi-based journalist who writes on national and international issues with particular emphasis on South Asia.\u000a\u000aBritain: Trump creates a stir\u000a\u000aOn Monday, the British people learned that Donald Trump's late mother was an admirer of the British monarchy. "She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, 'cause nobody does that like the English," he told an interviewer\u000a\u000aA family weakness for the British nostalgia industry is unlikely to have much impact on his approval rating among a population deeply concerned about the President-elect's ethics, prejudices and mental stability.\u000a\u000aWhat did get the UK talking was the identity of the interviewer. Michael Gove, who recently left the British Cabinet after losing a leadership election, has returned to his role as a columnist for The Times of London. He remains a prominent figure in Westminster politics and has retained his seat in the House of Commons.\u000a\u000aMeeting with Trump in his capacity as a journalist, Gove is only the latest right-wing figure to irk the British government by flaunting a relationship with the President-elect outside official channels. Prime Minister Theresa May, who clashed frequently with Gove when they were Cabinet colleagues under David Cameron, has made clear that such freelance diplomacy will not hasten his political rehabilitation.\u000a\u000aEven Gove, however, failed to match the stir created when the President-elect was pictured with Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, before he had met representatives of the governing Conservative Party.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump then suggested on Twitter that Farage should be appointed ambassador to Washington, May was furious. In Britain, where ambassadorships are traditionally held by long-serving career diplomats, this was seen as unprecedented interference in the affairs of Her Majesty's Government. The Queen nominally appoints each ambassador and takes a close interest due to her contacts with other heads of state. If Trump shares his mother's fondness for the Queen's ceremonial role in British life, he would be well advised to respect her protocol.\u000a\u000aAs well as securing a scoop for The Times, Gove's main aim in meeting the President-elect will likely have been to impress on him the existence of prominent Brexiteers other than Nigel Farage. Farage has enjoyed high visibility on British TV, his divisive rhetoric delivering strong ratings. Unlike Trump, he has not succeeded in translating that into electoral success, having failed at seven attempts to win a seat in Parliament . He was excluded by the official "Vote Leave" campaign in the UK referendum, run by more mainstream members of the Conservative Party, and campaigned instead with a smaller, unregistered "Leave EU" team dominated by UKIP. The anti-European movement in Britain is riddled with personal divisions; Gove, who played a major role in "Vote Leave", will have bridled at Farage taking credit for the referendum.\u000a\u000aNone of these subtleties are likely to deter the British government from maintaining a formal alliance with the United States as long as it remains a world power. But the President-elect would be wise to avoid playing favorites with squabbling British politicians. Serious concerns remain about the future of the relationship with Britain; elements in the security services are concerned about the legal implications for the " Five-Eyes " intelligence sharing system should Trump authorize the use of torture by their American partners. In Scotland, he has long been an unpopular landlord, indulging in an ongoing feud with the ruling Scottish National Party over environmental and planning issues.\u000a\u000aDiplomacy by Twitter is not the British way. The Queen would not approve.\u000a\u000aKate Maltby is a theater critic for The Times of London and regular broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics. Her website is www.katemaltby.com\u000a\u000aGermany: Will Merkel confront Trump?\u000a\u000aAlmut Möller\u000a\u000aFrom a Berlin perspective, there is a particular irony in the inauguration of Donald Trump as the next US president. Today's Germany in many ways is a product of the post-World War II era in Europe on which the United States has spent so much time and resources over the past decades.\u000a\u000aLocking Germany into a collective European order has been key to pacifying the European continent, and has served Germany particularly well. Indeed, the principles that are so strongly rooted in this country are largely tied to the pacifist attitudes of the German public and a preference for an economic rather than a security role in foreign affairs. There is also a strong reflexive support among Germans for multilateral approaches aimed at building global institutions and international law, as well as for the need for Germany to have a predictable foreign policy.\u000a\u000aBut what Berlin has understood from the President-elect so far is that Donald Trump is not really very interested in any of these principles. Instead, his rhetoric runs counter to some of the most formative instincts of the political elite in Germany -- and of the public at large. The question Germans have now is how Berlin will react once President Trump actually starts to shape politics rather than talking about it?\u000a\u000aAnd there has been plenty in the talk so far to cause concern. For example, just last weekend, Trump gave a major interview with widely read German newspaper BILD Zeitung in which he called into question the role of NATO and the future cohesion of the European Union. Both institutions are fundamental pillars of German foreign policy.\u000a\u000aAngela Merkel gave a first glimpse of her mindset in a news conference with the prime minister of New Zealand in Berlin that same day. "I think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands," she said when asked about Trump's comments. By her usually cautious standards this was another remarkable statement following her initial reaction to Trump's election back in November.\u000a\u000aWhen President Barack Obama gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in the summer of 2013 , he called for an end to German complacency in international affairs. Developments in and around Europe over recent years have already seen a much more active Germany on the European and international stage. Berlin has understood that some of its vital interests -- both in economic and security terms -- have come to be challenged.\u000a\u000aTrump is going to ensure Germany accelerates along this path, a reality that will have major implications for Germany and Europe. Berlin has a realistic understanding of its power, and where the German government has the resources to punch its weight it will attempt to do so.\u000a\u000aBut how willing will Germany be to confront President Trump on fundamental questions over the future of the European and global order? Germany currently holds the G20 presidency. That might give us a sign about how much Merkel is willing to say.\u000a\u000aAlmut Möller is a senior policy fellow and director of the European Council on Foreign Relations' Berlin office.\u000a\u000aChina: Trump should avoid the Taiwan card\u000a\u000aShen Dingli\u000a\u000aWhile the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's incoming administration doesn't bode well for anyone, the instability ahead could begin to recede if the new executive branch is willing to learn and acts sensibly.\u000a\u000aFor instance, Trump has repeatedly demanded "fair trade". No one rejects the idea of fair trade, but if the focus is on "fair" rather than "unfair" trade, then the key issue is who decides what type of trade is fair or otherwise.\u000a\u000aAs long as the United States does not exit the World Trade Organization, America, like any other member of the WTO, is subject to the body's arbitration mechanism to settle trade disputes.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration may renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement or quit the Trans Pacific Partnership, but if it does, it will still be opting for negotiation and bilateral trade agreements with Asia-Pacific nations and other trade partners. In other words, Trump may not be a fan of globalism, but he still subscribes to bilateralism and even internationalism.\u000a\u000aChina, for its part, could well live with a China-US bilateral trade and investment framework, along with a WTO cap. The ongoing negotiation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty is an example. Trump wants "smart" negotiation, to which China has no objection. But if Trump refuses to settle disputes through negotiation, then China won't be happy.\u000a\u000aStill, China is wary of the possibility that the Trump team might try to play the Taiwan card as part of any bargaining. This would be unacceptable -- China may be willing to negotiate or renegotiate over trade, investment and currency levels, but it will in no way be willing to renegotiate the "One China" principle . This is one thing that China will never put up for sale.\u000a\u000aIf the Trump administration can understand this key point quickly, and if it acts in a diplomatic way, then Trump does indeed have a chance to make America truly great again.\u000a\u000aShen Dingli is professor and associate dean at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa: Trump brings a new style\u000a\u000aTinashe Chuchu\u000a\u000aSouth Africans in general were more inclined to support Hillary Clinton for president, but that did not happen. Why the support for Clinton? Because South Africans valued the longstanding relationship that their nation had developed with the Clintons, especially during the Mandela years.\u000a\u000aNow that the election is over and Donald Trump has won, South Africa -- like many other nations -- hopes that it will be able to secure favorable trade relations with the Trump administration. Of course, the signs from the Trump camp suggest that the incoming administration will take a tough stance on trade. And though Trump did not single out South Africa specifically for criticism, he did warn more broadly that deals would need to be rethought because the United States is always losing out on trade agreements.\u000a\u000aAnother issue that might be of interest to South Africans is US immigration policy toward South Africa. Again, Trump warned over the threat posed by certain kinds of immigration, which became a feature of his campaign. If he cracks down it could make it tougher for South Africans wishing to secure a US visa.\u000a\u000aBut it's not all trepidation. Some South Africans admire Trump's apparent success with his own businesses. They hope that he will enjoy similar success running the United States. Indeed, if Trump is successful and the US economy performs well under his presidency, countries like South Africa will likely benefit, too.\u000a\u000aAs John Stremlau, former vice president of the Carter Center, told Africa's News24 , it is still unclear what shape the Trump administration's foreign policy will take. However, as a businessman, it seems that Trump is determined to try his hand at making deals. It will be interesting to see what this new style means for business with Africa.\u000a\u000aTinashe Chuchu is a lecturer in the School of Economic and Business Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.\u000a\u000aEgypt: A lesson for Americans\u000a\u000aAdel Abdel Ghafar\u000a\u000aThe election of Donald Trump was welcome news in Cairo. The US President-elect and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met each other on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting last September. After that meeting, both expressed a mutual admiration for one another. Sisi remarked that Trump would make a strong leader, which Trump reciprocated by praising Sisi as a "fantastic guy." Sisi was reportedly the first Arab leader to congratulate Trump, and recently reportedly stated to the Egyptian press that he knew Trump would win as "his honesty touched the hearts of the American people."\u000a\u000aIt's not hard to imagine why these two men would get along. Both are not particularly fond of protecting human rights, and have demonstrated a deep disdain for the press. They abhor Islamists of all shapes and forms. Neither man handles criticism well, as demonstrated by their emotional outbursts. Both admire Vladimir Putin, who has spent time cultivating them both.\u000a\u000aOverall, they share an identical black and white world view, reminiscent of George W. Bush's "you are either with us or against us." There is no middle way in Trump and Sisi's world; only enemies to be annihilated or friends based on mutual interests.\u000a\u000aWith regards to Egypt and the Middle East, discourse on human rights and democratization will become background noise, as the Trump administration's foreign policy will likely focus on advancing US economic and security interests. Trump and Sisi began collaborating even before the President-elect assumed office: Trump reportedly called on Sisi to withdraw the U.N. resolution against Israeli settlements , which ultimately passed.\u000a\u000aConveniently, the Egyptian media has dropped the commentary from Trump about Muslim bans and registries from its coverage, while equating the President-elect with Sisi; a strongman who will bring stability in an age of turbulence. However, almost three years since Sisi's election, many segments of the Egyptian population feel disappointed in his leadership, as he has failed to bring stability or usher in the era of economic prosperity that he promised.\u000a\u000aGiven time, the American people, like their Egyptian counterparts, are also likely to find themselves profoundly unhappy with their new president.\u000a\u000aAdel Abdel Ghafar is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and the author of " Egyptians in Revolt: The Political Economy of Labor and Student Mobilizations 1919 -2011 ."\u000a\u000aPhilippines: Will Trump challenge Duterte?\u000a\u000aMong Palatino\u000a\u000aConsidering that there are, by some estimates , around 300,000 Filipinos living as undocumented migrants in the United States, the question for many here is whether President Donald Trump will be true to his campaign promise of being tough on illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aAs for the about 3.5 million Filipinos living in the United States , they join other Americans in hoping that the Trump presidency will deliver stable jobs, better health care, and safer communities.\u000a\u000aLike other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines wants to know whether Trump will continue to endorse the rebalancing of American forces toward the Asia-Pacific region. More specifically, Filipinos have two other questions on defense: What will Trump's policy be regarding the maritime dispute in the South China Sea involving China and its smaller neighbors? Will he uphold the mutual defense pact between the Philippines and the United States?\u000a\u000aIt is not only on defense that a Trump presidency raises questions for Filipinos. In terms of his economic program, for example, many wonder whether his vow to protect American businesses will mean less investment in the Philippines and the rest of Asia? They also wonder whether his call for the return of manufacturing and outsourced jobs to the United States will disrupt Asian economies.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, Trump is often compared to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Both are non-traditional politicians who achieved surprising electoral victories despite their controversial, divisive -- sometimes politically incorrect -- views.\u000a\u000aDuterte has frequently criticized the United States for its colonial crimes and political meddling, even making an unprecedented declaration of a "separation" of the Philippines and the United States. President Obama chose to ignore Duterte's rants. Will Trump do the same thing? Will he comment on the alleged American plot to destabilize Duterte's government\u000a\u000aBoth are interesting questions. But perhaps the biggest question mark is over whether Donald Trump will raise the issue of human rights with Duterte, whose war on drugs has, by many accounts, left thousands of civilians dead.\u000a\u000aFilipinos are extremely curious to find out what happens next.\u000a\u000aMong Palatino is a Filipino activist, blogger, and former legislator.

Laundry hung from balconies, fishermen perched on the cliffside and dim lights illuminating rust-stained shacks.\u000a\u000aThese images left a deep impression on the artist. So, years later, Lai decided to recreate the scene in minute detail. His miniature artwork forms part of a project that hopes to preserve memories of the former British colony's disappearing past.\u000a\u000a"I took a lot of time researching, finding old photos, interviewing, sourcing materials and talking to people who used to live [on Lamma Island] to make sure we got everything right," Lai says in his new Hong Kong workshop, which he shares with fellow miniature artist Maggie Chan.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year the two artists opened TOMA Miniatures , a small studio where they offer classes and collaborate on new artworks. Miniatures of a barbershop, an old village and an herbal tea shop are on display alongside workstations littered with cutting boards, rulers and knives.\u000a\u000aThis scene depicts life on Lamma Island, with people going about their daily chores in the once dilapidated village.\u000a\u000aAs the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China nears, many Hong Kong residents have been recalling their homeland's past with a sense of nostalgia. But others fear that the city's heritage is disappearing, with historic sites being destroyed to make way for shopping malls and commercial high-rises.\u000a\u000aRead More

You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000aHumans never have lived on a planet that's 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels, in the late 1800s, and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2-degree mark.\u000a\u000a"This is gambling with the planet," said Gernot Wagner , the lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of the book "Climate Shock."\u000a\u000aThink super droughts, rising seas and mass extinctions.\u000a\u000aYet for all of its importance, I don't think the 2-degree threshold is as famous as it should be. I've heard it referred to as the "north star" for climate negotiations. Meaning: This one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world's attention.\u000a\u000aIt's so significant that it's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year.

And feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below. They'll shape the way I spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number.\u000a\u000a1. Where did the idea for 2 degrees come from?\u000a\u000aOne guy, it turns out. William Nordhaus , an economist at Yale.\u000a\u000aNordhaus, 73, proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 (1977!) paper titled " Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem ."\u000a\u000aThe estimate was "crude, but it was a reasonable first start," he told me.\u000a\u000a"If there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years," he wrote in "The Climate Casino."\u000a\u000aA growing body of research now supports the idea.\u000a\u000a2. How did 2 degrees become the international standard?\u000a\u000aScience has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming. And that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want.\u000a\u000a"You need a judgment call for these things," said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, who has written on the history of 2 degrees Celsius. "And this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy."\u000a\u000aGermany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal, Jaeger told me. That happened in the 1990s. Later came the European Commission , the G8 , the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most significantly, the Copenhagen Accord , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much.\u000a\u000aThe United States was among the signatories\u000a\u000a3. What would the world look like at 2 degrees?\u000a\u000aI'm going to spend the month of May exploring this question, so look for more on this. But here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like. These are pulled from reports by the National Research Council , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Bank\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.\u000a\u000a\u2022 A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates\u000a\u000a\u2022 The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.\u000a\u000a\u2022 The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%. \u2022 Wildfires in the United States are expected to increase 400% to 800% in size.\u2022 Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.\u2022 A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates 20% to 30% of animals and plants species will be at "increasingly high risk of extinction" at or near the 2-degree mark.\u2022 The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.\u2022 Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.\u2022 The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%.\u000a\u000aSo ... not good.\u000a\u000aAnd numbers don't convey the emotional toll.\u000a\u000a"I'm from New Mexico," said Nordhaus, the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold. "I love it there, and I know it's going to be a completely different climate. The trout fishing probably won't be as good. The hiking won't be as good. These forests may look completely different, or burn down. I love to ski. It's one of my things I love most. And that's obviously affected by warming. I love the ocean, and the New England coastline, and it's in peril. That's just for starters."\u000a\u000a4. What happens at 2.1 degrees?\u000a\u000aNo one knows, exactly. Think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking. How many cigarettes give you cancer? No one knows, exactly. But the more you smoke, the more you up your risk. And 2 degrees, policy experts agree, is certainly risky territory.\u000a\u000aPlus, everyone hates a fraction.\u000a\u000aTargeting 1 degree of warming is "ridiculous because you can't do it," said Nordhaus, the economist. "Three sounds too high. And you can't have a fraction because it's too complicated.\u000a\u000a"So two is kind of an obvious number."\u000a\u000a5. How much has the climate warmed already?\u000a\u000aThe climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the Industrial Revolution . And we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we're already putting into the atmosphere, even with "very ambitious mitigation action" to reduce carbon emissions, according to a 2014 report from the World Bank. Some of that warming is "locked-in to the Earth's atmospheric system," that organization says. The impacts of climate change already are being felt.\u000a\u000a6. Is it possible to stay below 2 degrees?\u000a\u000aYes, but it won't be easy.\u000a\u000a"If you want to stay below 2 degrees, you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree," said Jaeger from the Global Climate Forum.\u000a\u000aHere's the best guess for what that "amazing speed" might need to look like: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80% to 90% by 2050, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. "It depends on how much risk you want to accept," she said. Some activists, including those from 350.org and Avaaz, which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in New York , want to accept less risk than that.\u000a\u000a"Our position is 100% clean energy," said David Sievers, a senior campaigner for Avaaz.\u000a\u000a7. What happens if we don't take action?\u000a\u000aSome writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target, saying it's too ambitious, or even naive. But we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that "north star" to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem.\u000a\u000aIf you think 2 degrees sounds bad, 5 degrees is far, far worse.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by "major extinctions around the globe" and a "reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide." Just beyond that, at 6 degrees, we're looking a "catastro-f***" that would be almost "infinitely costly," said Wagner, the Environmental Defense Fund economist. "It's akin to killing the planet, basically. Or society on the planet."\u000a\u000aThis much should be clear: Something has to change.\u000a\u000aIf we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3, that's still better (or less awful) than 5 or 6. What's important is that we maintain a sense of urgency, and keep sight of the goal.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Melting polar ice caps \u2013 The consequences of climate change go far beyond warming temperatures, which scientists say are melting the polar ice caps and raising sea levels. Click through the gallery for a look at 10 other key effects of climate change, some of which may surprise you. Hide Caption 1 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Drought \u2013 In the coming decades climate change will unleash megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, according to a new report by scholars at Cornell University, the University of Arizona and the U.S. Geological Survey. We're seeing hints of this already in many arid parts of the world and even in California, which has been rationing water amid record drought. In this 2012 photo, a man places his hand on parched soil in the Greater Upper Nile region of northeastern South Sudan. Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Wildfires \u2013 There's not a direct link between climate change and wildfires, exactly. But many scientists believe the increase in wildfires in the Western United States is partly the result of tinder-dry forests parched by warming temperatures. This photo shows a wildfire as it approaches the shore of Bass Lake, California, in mid-September. Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Coral reefs \u2013 Scientists say the oceans' temperatures have risen by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last century. It doesn't sound like much, but it's been enough to affect the fragile ecosystems of coral reefs, which have been bleaching and dying off in recent decades. This photo shows dead coral off the coast of St. Martin's Island in Bangladesh. Hide Caption 4 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Food prices \u2013 food prices. Here, in 2010, workers on combines harvest soybeans in northern Brazil. Global food experts have warned that climate change could double grain prices by 2050. A U.N. panel found in March that climate change -- mostly drought -- is already affecting the global agricultural supply and will likely drive upfood prices. Here, in 2010, workers on combines harvest soybeans in northern Brazil. Global food experts have warned that climate change could double grain prices by 2050. Hide Caption 5 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Pollen allergies \u2013 Are you sneezing more often these days? Climate change may be to blame for that, too. Recent studies show that rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels promote the growth of weedy plant species that produce allergenic pollen. The worst place in the United States for spring allergies in 2014, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America? Louisville, Kentucky Hide Caption 6 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Deforestation \u2013 forests. Invasive species such as the bark beetle, which thrive in warmer temperatures, have attacked trees across the North American west, from Mexico to the Yukon. Climate change has not been kind to the world'sforests. Invasive species such as the bark beetle, which thrive in warmer temperatures, have attacked trees across the North American west, from Mexico to the Yukon. University of Colorado researchers have found that some populations of mountain pine beetles now produce two generations per year, dramatically boosting the bugs' threat to lodgepole and ponderosa pines. In this 2009 photo, dead spruces of the Yukon's Alsek River valley attest to the devastation wrought by the beetles. Hide Caption 7 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Mountain glaciers \u2013 The snows capping majestic Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, once inspired Ernest Hemingway. Now they're in danger of melting away altogether. Studies suggest that if the mountain's snowcap continues to evaporate at its current rate, it could be gone in 15 years. Here, a Kilimanjaro glacier is viewed from Uhuru Peak in December 2010. Hide Caption 8 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Endangered species \u2013 Polar bears may be the poster child for climate change's effect on animals. But scientists say climate change is wreaking havoc on many other species -- including birds and reptiles -- that are sensitive to fluctuations in temperatures. One, this golden toad of Costa Rica and other Central American countries, has already gone extinct. Hide Caption 9 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Animal migration \u2013 It's not your imagination: Some animals -- mostly birds -- are migrating earlier and earlier every year because of warming global temperatures. Scholars from the University of East Anglia found that Icelandic black-tailed godwits have advanced their migration by two weeks over the past two decades. Researchers also have found that many species are migrating to higher elevations as temperatures climb. Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Extreme weather \u2013 The planet could see as many as 20 more hurricanes and tropical storms each year by the end of the century because of climate change, according to a 2013 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

aVStory highlights Robby Mook says we have to work together to ensure 2016-style attack never happens again\u000a\u000aHe is teaming up with ex-Romney campaign manager on a center to share info on hacking\u000a\u000aCNN political commentator Robby Mook ran the 2015-16 presidential campaign for Hillary Clinton and is now a senior fellow at Harvard University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Spoiler alert: Foreign intervention in American politics is as old as our republic. John Adams warned about it in his inaugural address in 1797.\u000a\u000aAs far back as 2008 , foreign hackers were infiltrating the campaigns, but you didn't hear much about it.\u000a\u000aRobby Mook\u000a\u000aThat all changed last year when the Russians stole information from Democrats and pushed it out to the media in an especially dramatic fashion. It didn't just inflict damage on Hillary Clinton; it further divided our political parties and got Americans angry ... at each other. This is exactly what the Russians (and other foreign adversaries) wanted.\u000a\u000aAs Clinton's campaign manager, I'm as angry and frustrated as anyone about what the Russians did. I'm equally frustrated by the Trump administration's response. Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is vital, and I trust he will get to the bottom of what happened, but he can only illuminate the past. The rest of us will determine what happens in the future, and we have to work together now to make sure a 2016-style attack never happens again.\u000a\u000aUnchecked, foreign meddling in our elections will get much worse since cyberspace provides an array of ways to undermine the integrity of elections. Most attention has gone to how foreign agents could break into voting machines and alter the outcome of an election, but it's even easier to corrupt voting lists, leak embarrassing emails from election officials or generate fake ballot requests. Any one of these crimes could call the election into question and bring the democratic process to a standstill.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVBija Knowles, CNN \u2022 Updated 17th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Water, fire and ice have combined to make some of the most spectacular scenery in the world -- from giant crystal caves to mud volcanoes and rock formations that look like works of art.\u000a\u000aIf your office and daily commute aren't a fitting reminder of the extraordinary natural diversity of planet earth, get some inspiration from these incredible scenes.\u000a\u000a1. Pulpit Rock, Preikestolen, Norway\u000a\u000aIf there are any preachers here, they'll be telling you to get back.\u000a\u000aWith a 604-meter drop from a flat plateau down to Lysefjord with no safety railings, this is not a place for vertigo sufferers.\u000a\u000aKeep well back from the edge and you can still enjoy the fantastic scenery over Kjerag peak, which itself drops 984 meters.\u000a\u000aPreikestolen is south of Jorpeland. From the designated car park it's a 90-minute hike to the viewpoint.\u000a\u000a2. Gran Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia\u000a\u000aThe Gran Salar de Uyuni in southern Bolivia takes in more than 10 square kilometers of salt. It feels more like a desert than a lake.\u000a\u000aThe flat, white landscape causes optical illusions and reflects colors. There's even a hotel made almost entirely of salt and an island where giant cacti grow in the middle of the salt lake.\u000a\u000aGran Salar de Uyuni is 533 kilometers south of La Paz and 200 kilometers southwest of Potosi.\u000a\u000a3. Ngorogoro Crater, Tanzania\u000a\u000aMore than enough room to swing a very big cat.\u000a\u000aThe Ngorogoro Crater is Africa's Eden. Created when a huge volcano exploded 2-3 million years ago, the 300 square kilometer caldera now offers the best chances of seeing Africa's wild animals.\u000a\u000aLions, rhino, leopards, elephant and buffalo are the "big five" present among around 25,000 animals, and nearly every species present in East Africa, which call the area home.\u000a\u000aBesides that, the crater itself offers dramatic vistas, especially at sunrise.\u000a\u000aFrom Kilimanjaro International Airport you can fly or drive the 55 kilometers to Arusha, from where you can organize tours and accommodation inside and outside the crater.\u000a\u000a4. Paria Canyon, Arizona, United States\u000a\u000aNot all great waves can be surfed.\u000a\u000aThe Paria River in northern Arizona carved its own smaller version of the Grand Canyon. Some of the rock formations, including The Wave, are just as spectacular.\u000a\u000aVisitors need a permit from the Bureau of Land Management -- the permit for an overnight trek comes with a "human waste bag," so if you want to visit this natural wonder, you'll have to prepare to pack your waste.\u000a\u000aThe Paria Contact Station is 69 kilometers east of Kanab. You can hire a guide through the Bureau of Land Management\u000a\u000a5. Volcanic eruptions at Stromboli, Italy\u000a\u000aA fireworks show millions of years in the making.\u000a\u000aPart of the Aeolian Islands off the coast of Sicily, Stromboli is a small volcanic island with several hundred brave inhabitants.\u000a\u000aUnlike most volcanoes, Stromboli's is constantly spewing lava fountains, gas and ash. Fascinating for volcanologists, but also great for day-trippers who fancy seeing live lava action.\u000a\u000aFor natural fireworks, take a boat trip around the island at night.\u000a\u000aArrange boat tours from harbors on the north coast of Sicily (Messina, Cefalu, Palermo).\u000a\u000a6. Mud volcanoes of Gobustan, Azerbaijan\u000a\u000aOne of the few places you can bathe in a volcanic eruption.\u000a\u000aMud lovers trek to Gobustan's strangely Martian landscape, 65 kilometers south of Azerbaijan's capital Baku, where thick gray mud regularly spews from small volcanoes.\u000a\u000aThe mud is thought to have medicinal qualities, so don't be surprised if you see people stripping down and lathering themselves in the goo. Look out for the area's Roman inscriptions and the petroglyphic rock art.\u000a\u000aAbout 70 kilometers west of Baku.\u000a\u000a7. Jeita Grotto, Nahr al-Kalb Valley, Lebanon\u000a\u000aEighteen kilometers northeast of Beirut, Jeita Grotto is comprised of underground limestone caves were inhabited in prehistoric times and continue to attract human visitors with their vivid colors and stalactite formations. The biggest stalactite in the world is here.\u000a\u000aThe caves consist of a network of chambers -- with an upper and a lower gallery -- stretching out for nine kilometers and accessible by an underground river.\u000a\u000aThe nearest town is Juniyah, just a few kilometers away. Cave tours last two hours.\u000a\u000a8. Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail, Wales\u000a\u000aYou can almost hear the male choirs in the distance.\u000a\u000aThis path twists 300 kilometers from St. Dogmaels to Amroth in southwest Wales.\u000a\u000aIt's often wet and windy, but if you strike lucky on a sunny day this is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Scented gorse and crimson heather brighten the way.\u000a\u000aLook for seals in the waters below.\u000a\u000aPaths are signposted -- join the path on the coast between St. Dogmaels and Amroth. Details on guided walks and activities can be found on the National Trails website -- including self-guided walks with baggage transfer.\u000a\u000a9. Pangong Tso Lake, India-China\u000a\u000aBeautiful to look at. But swimming here is only for masochists.\u000a\u000aThis saltwater lake deep in the Himalayas at an altitude of 4,350 meters lies astride a disputed border area between India and China-governed Tibet.\u000a\u000aDon't let that put you off -- the rarefied air make the colors and clarity of the lake intense.\u000a\u000aPangong Tso is reached by a mountain road from the Indian town of Leh, but you'll need to get a permit via a registered tour guide.\u000a\u000aGet to Leh by road from Jammu, or by plane from Delhi. At Leh arrange a permit and travel by road 4-5 hours to the lake. Permits and tour guides can be arranged through reputable travel agents such as Kuoni\u000a\u000a10. Geirangerfjord and Naeroyfjord, Norway\u000a\u000aNot a Norwegian motor car.\u000a\u000aIf you only have time to visit two fjords in your lifetime, make it the Geirangerfjord and Naeroyfjord in southwest Norway.\u000a\u000aThese are among the world's longest and deepest fjords, with high vertical cliffs, deep waters and giddy waterfalls. Both are on the UNESCO World Heritage list\u000a\u000aTrips can be arranged from Bergen and Alesund.\u000a\u000a11. South Kaibab Trail, Grand Canyon, Arizona, United States\u000a\u000a"Ooh Ah Point" awaits the adventurous.\u000a\u000aMost visitors view the canyon from South Rim viewing stations. Considering that it has taken the Colorado River the past 17 million years to carve this wonder out of rock, it seems only fair to take a closer look.\u000a\u000aBuilt by the National Park Service in 1924, the South Kaibab Trail takes you to the wonderfully named "Ooh Ah Point" and, for the adventurous, further into the canyon's depths. Plan carefully, heat stroke is no fun.\u000a\u000aIn the northwest corner of Arizona, visitors usually head to South Rim Village (120 kilometers northwest of Flagstaff on route 180) or the North Rim Village. Free shuttle buses service the South Rim in summer months. Ranger-led day hikes and walks take place throughout the year.\u000a\u000a12. Mount Roraima, Guyana/Brazil/Venezuela\u000a\u000a1. Climb. 2. Catch breath. 3. Stand in awe.\u000a\u000aSouth America's answer to Uluru, this impressive sandstone plateau is surrounded on all sides by 400-meter cliffs, creating an isolated and unique ecosystem.\u000a\u000aIf you want to follow in David Attenborough's footsteps (he's filmed several times here), organize a trek from the Venezuelan side.\u000a\u000aHiking up Mount Roraima is best done from Venezuela. The Paratepui Route is the easiest for non-technical climbers and trips can be arranged from San Francisco de Yurani.\u000a\u000a13. Verdon Gorge, Provence, France\u000a\u000aUp a creek without a paddle? Not so bad.\u000a\u000aThe gorgeous turquoise waters of the Verdon River flow through one of Europe's most beautiful gorges for 25 kilometers.\u000a\u000aSwim in the translucent waters of Lac de St. Croix and stare in awe at the 700-meter walls of the Verdon Gorge. If you've got a head for heights, it's a popular destination for rock-climbing.\u000a\u000aThe Verdon Gorge is on the border of the departements of Var and the Alpes de Hautes Provence.\u000a\u000a14. Jiuzhaigou National Park, Sichuan Province, China\u000a\u000aAll the colors of nature in one park.\u000a\u000aThe three valleys that form this biosphere reserve contain a network of connected lakes, waterfalls and rivers -- the most spectacular of which are the Pearl Waterfalls.\u000a\u000aSpot the ancient tree trunks under the clear waters of Five Flower Lake. Wooden paths and shuttle buses help visitors get around.\u000a\u000aIn the north of Sichuan, the nearest town to Jiuzhaigou National Park is Songpan.\u000a\u000a15. Lake Nakuru, Kenya\u000a\u000aAnd you thought your city was crowded.\u000a\u000aA streak of blue (and pink) in Kenya's Great Rift Valley, Lake Nakuru is home to thousands of pink flamingoes that flock here to feed on the lake's algae.\u000a\u000aA UNESCO Heritage Site, Lake Nakuru National Park is also home to hippos, white and black rhino, giraffe and buffalo.\u000a\u000aTake a matatu 156 kilometers northwest of Nairobi, or a plane to the Naishi airstrip.\u000a\u000a16. Uluru/Ayers Rock, Australia\u000a\u000aBetter from afar.\u000a\u000aAustralia's favorite giant sandstone mass is 350 meters high and more than nine kilometers in circumference.\u000a\u000aIt's a sacred and spiritual site for its custodians, the aboriginal Anangu, so climbing the rock is considered disrespectful to them. It can also be dangerous.\u000a\u000aUluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is about 440 kilometers southwest of Alice Springs. Flights are available from most major cities to Ayers Rock airport.\u000a\u000a17. Siwa Oasis, Egypt\u000a\u000aYes, you can swim in the Sahara.\u000a\u000aThis isolated oasis has natural springs and fertile land, providing access to spectacular stretches of Sahara desert. It's a great spot for star gazing from your tent in the sand, but bring your bathing suit for a dip in its hot and cold natural pools.\u000a\u000aA 10-hour drive west of Cairo. Public buses take much longer. Desert safaris can be arranged in Siwa\u000a\u000a18. Seljalandsfoss Waterfall, Iceland\u000a\u000aA waterfall you can stand beneath without getting wet.\u000a\u000aWaterfall connoisseurs agree it's not size that counts. The biggest and the highest may be impressive, but when it comes to cascading water, Iceland's Seljalandsfoss has style.\u000a\u000aThe sight of the Seljalandsa River dropping 62 meters down the sheer cliff face has made it a must-see Iceland attraction. There's a path that goes behind the cascade, so bring your waterproof camera.\u000a\u000aOn Road 1, it's 125 kilometers southeast of Reykjavik.\u000a\u000a19. Perito Moreno Glacier, Patagonia, Argentina\u000a\u000aWe got ice, who brought the drinks?\u000a\u000aThis 30-kilometer glacier in Patagonia's Los Glaciares National Park (not to be confused with the Perito Moreno National Park) grows and contracts, often forming a natural ice dam on the "elbow" of Lago Argentino.\u000a\u000aThe force of the trapped water causes a spectacular rupture every four to five years. Even when the ice isn't exploding, the sight of the glacier's blue peaks is a lifetime attraction.\u000a\u000aFly from Buenos Aires to El Calafate in Patagonia. The alternative is a very long bus journey.\u000a\u000a20. Moraine Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada\u000a\u000aHow many natural features can you fit into one picture?\u000a\u000aDeep in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Moraine Lake -- together with its sister Lake Louise -- is one of the most photographed landscapes in Banff National Park.\u000a\u000aIt's known as the jewel of the Rockies for its deep crystalline waters that mirror pine forests, soaring mountains and endless sky.\u000a\u000aDrive or take a direct bus 128 kilometers west from Calgary to Banff.\u000a\u000a21. Cascate del Mulino, Saturnia, Tuscany, Italy\u000a\u000aSteaming hot spring water comes out of the ground at 37.5 C and cascades over a series of small waterfalls into dozens of pools on consecutive levels.\u000a\u000aNiagara Falls it ain't, but the cascading thermal springs at Saturnia are a lot of fun. Soak in the natural sulfurous mineral water and just maybe cure ailments from rheumatism to muscle ache.\u000a\u000aAbout 10 kilometers north of the small Tuscan town of Manciano, northeast of Orbetello.\u000a\u000a22. William Bay, Western Australia\u000a\u000aYes, these rocks do look a little like elephants. But only a little.\u000a\u000aA five-hour drive south of Perth, William Bay in Denmark, Western Australia, has turquoise waters that lap around white sands and the Elephant Rocks, which shelter an area of rock pools and granite terraces called Green's Pool.\u000a\u000aThe calm waters are perfect for snorkeling, while the more adventurous have the Great Southern Ocean on the other side.\u000a\u000aFifteen kilometers west of the town of Denmark.\u000a\u000a23.

Wadden Sea, Germany and the Netherlands\u000a\u000aNot much to look at, but still spectacular.\u000a\u000aUNESCO describes the Wadden Sea as "the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world." In other words, it's a surreal hinterland along the coast of Germany and the Netherlands that combines wide-open stretches of sand and shallow seas.\u000a\u000aIt's also home to migratory birds. Go there and you'll feel a million miles from anywhere else on earth and about as small as one of the clams at your feet.\u000a\u000aThis 600-kilometer stretch of coast lies between the towns of Den Helder in the Netherlands and Niebull in Germany.\u000a\u000a30.

Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve, Madagascar\u000a\u000aNot easy to navigate, but worth it.\u000a\u000aSpiky limestone rock formations and mangrove forests are part of the tropical and otherworldly landscape of the Tsingy de Bemaraha nature reserve on the western side of Madagascar.\u000a\u000aThe reserve is home to chameleons, lemurs and endangered birds.\u000a\u000aAlso part of the landscape is the Manambolo River, which runs red with eroded sediment from the highlands of Madagascar.\u000a\u000aThe reserve is 400 kilometers west of Antananarivo.\u000a\u000a41. Cueva de los Cristales/Cave of Crystals, Mexico\u000a\u000aIn 2000, a group of miners tunneling in the Naica mine, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, found an underground cavern containing giant selenite crystals -- some as long as 11 meters.\u000a\u000aThe size and beauty of these gypsum crystals brought the Cave of Crystals instant fame.\u000a\u000aBut the future of the cave is uncertain. While access is currently possible for short periods, the cave may be closed and flooded in the future to stop the crystals from disintegrating.\u000a\u000aThe Naica mine is 135 kilometers southeast of the city of Chihuahua.\u000a\u000a42. The Bay of Fundy, Canada\u000a\u000aClimbs and falls more than the NYSE.\u000a\u000aOne of four places on earth with extreme tidal highs and lows, the Bay of Fundy sees a vertical rise in sea level of as much as 17 meters twice a day.\u000a\u000aMore than 100 billion tons of seawater rush in and out of the bay daily, sculpting unique basalt shapes out of the rocks along the coast.\u000a\u000aTravel between the bay's islands and coastal towns is possible by small car ferry.\u000a\u000a43. Halong Bay, Vietnam\u000a\u000aTurning every visitor into a photographer.\u000a\u000aThousands of small islands and standing stacks, or karsts, overgrown with green shrubbery, protrude from Halong Bay , a peaceful bay.\u000a\u000aThe popular way to explore is in a traditional Chinese trading ship -- the brown-paneled sails of the junks have become as much a part of the landscape as the towering rocks.\u000a\u000aMost visitors to Halong Bay come via Hanoi -- 170 kilometers away, or five to six hours on a public bus. Private cars can be hired. Even rented helicopters make the journey.\u000a\u000a44.

You expect a frog with a crown to hop off the nearest giant mushroom, or a mystical hand to reach out of the lake.\u000a\u000aTake a train from Helsinki to Punkaharju or drive the 350 kilometers northeast of Helsinki.\u000a\u000a45. Frozen Sea in Lulea, Sweden\u000a\u000aThis isn't the only place in the world where the sea freezes over, but the town's location -- jutting out into the sea -- makes the frozen water a welcome extension of the town's streets in the depths of winter.\u000a\u000aFrom December to February, locals skate, snow-trek and sled across the bay, while some roads -- across the sea -- are passable only in winter.\u000a\u000aSigns advise you to remove your seatbelt for a quicker exit should your car come across thin ice.\u000a\u000aThere are several daily flights to Lulea from Stockholm, which is easier than driving the 900 kilometers.\u000a\u000a46.

It's a sight that's just too tempting for intrepid climbers and base-jumpers.\u000a\u000aTake a local bus or taxi from Islamabad to Skardu.\u000a\u000a47. Fox Glacier, South Island, New Zealand\u000a\u000aA beautiful scene, but don't get too close.\u000a\u000aAlong with the 12-kilometer Franz Josef Glacier (a short distance up the coast), the 13-kilometer Fox Glacier on New Zealand's South Island is one of the most easily accessible ice masses in the world.\u000a\u000aFox Glacier reaches almost to the coast, just 250 meters above sea level. Large chucks of ice breaking off the face make it dangerous to get too close.\u000a\u000aFox Glacier is in Westland National Park, 200 kilometers west of Christchurch.

The Shilin Stone Forest, China\u000a\u000aThe historic Stone Forest.\u000a\u000aSpread over 350 square kilometers in Yunnan province, these stone needles look like an ancient petrified forest -- the rock formations stand tall and emerge vertically from the ground.\u000a\u000aThe karst rocks are more than 270 million years old. Local legend says the forest was created when a young woman was forbidden to marry her love -- she rebelled by turning herself into stone.\u000a\u000aShilin Stone Forest can be reached by road 96 kilometers southeast of Kunming in Yunnan province.\u000a\u000a49. Na Pali Coast, Kauai, Hawaii, United States\u000a\u000aThe best of a spectacular bunch.\u000a\u000aWhether sandy beaches, giant waves or volcanic craters, Hawaii has plenty of breathtaking landscapes.

aV"I don't think anybody can deny this guy is openly and brazenly racist and misogynistic," he told reporters during a shoot around before a game in Phoenix.\u000a\u000a"We have just thrown a good part of our population under the bus, and I have problems with thinking this is where we are as a country."\u000a\u000aVan Gundy's outspokenness, echoed by fellow NBA coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, is emblematic of a rise in political activism within American sports unseen since the Vietnam War.\u000a\u000aImages of Colin Kaepernick kneeling for the national anthem, Carmelo Anthony joining a civil rights march, and LeBron James stumping for Hillary Clinton hardly raise eyebrows anymore.\u000a\u000aCuriously, however, their cohorts in Europe have remained largely silent on political issues. This, despite the UK's highly-charged Brexit referendum in June, and a surge in far-right and xenophobic sentiment on the continent.\u000a\u000aThey don't get involved in politics. They think it's not their job. John Amaechi\u000a\u000a"They don't get involved in politics," former NBA player John Amaechi says of his fellow British athletes. "They think it's not their job. They think they will be instantly critiqued -- which they will be -- but it's not the job of athletes to avoid critique."\u000a\u000a"That is an anti-risk-taking behavior, which is anti-athletics," Amaechi, now an organizational psychologist in London, tells CNN. "I personally think abdicating your public voice is irresponsible."\u000a\u000aAmaechi was the first ex-NBA player to speak openly about his homosexuality when he came out in 2007.\u000a\u000aLeBron James is pictured with Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000a'There has to be solidarity'\u000a\u000aAlthough a few retired footballers like David Beckham and Gary Lineker , along with controversial veteran player Joey Barton , opined on the Brexit campaign on social media, it is difficult to find examples of European athletes willing to risk their careers by speaking out against social injustice in the manner of Muhammad Ali, Martina Navratilova , or today's firebrand Kaepernick.\u000a\u000aInstead, European activism has historically been rooted in nationalism, notes sports sociologist Joseph Maguire of the UK's Loughborough University, citing examples such as Andy Murray's backing of Scottish independence or the jailing of footballer Deniz Naki in Turkey for a pro-Kurdish Facebook post.\u000a\u000aMaguire also cites "passive and covert" symbols of protest including the fascist tattoos of former Lazio player Paulo Di Canio, and the silence of ethnically-Turkish footballer Mesut Ozil during the German national anthem.\u000a\u000aRetired English footballer Howard Gayle, who in 1977 became the first black player to play for Liverpool, says that unlike Kaepernick and James, black British athletes are reticent to attract controversy.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people don't want to rattle that cage of racism and draw that attention to them, because they feel that it may (prevent) them from earning certain amounts of money," says Gayle, who detailed the hurdles he faced in his autobiography "61 Minutes in Munich: The Story of Liverpool FC's First Black Footballer."\u000a\u000a"Black sportsmen traditionally come from poor communities," he explains, "so when (they) get the opportunity to get out of that community, they are reluctant to look at the principled approach of a stance against racism."\u000a\u000aGayle -- who did not sing "God Save the Queen" as an England youth player and says he "never really had that affinity playing for England" -- made his stance public this year when he declined a nomination for a Member of the Order of the British Empire.\u000a\u000aThe title, traditionally awarded at Buckingham Palace and known as an MBE, was to recognize his community work on social inclusion.\u000a\u000a"I am well aware of the history of Africa and my ancestry," he says, referring to Britain's role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade . "To have "A Member of the British Empire" after my name wouldn't sit well with me as a black man."\u000a\u000aPhotos: A timeline of social activism in sports In 2012 members of the Miami Heat -- led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh -- posed in hoodies in solidarity with slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In his first six months as President, Donald Trump has used his platforms to decry and cajole anything or anyone that stands in the way of his campaign promises -- or that he simply doesn't like. And he recognizes and praises the people and things he does. For better or worse, this has drawn attention to those who have been the subject of Trump's remarks.\u000a\u000aRichard Fontaine\u000a\u000aNow a worthy target is crying out for President Trump's extraordinary reach: The so-called "four famines" that currently afflict South Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. The United States has been generous in providing resources to confront the spread of starvation in these countries; it's other wealthy countries who have fallen down on the job. And it's here that the President could rack up a win for his administration and for humanity.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump's megaphone is perhaps the loudest of any world leader in memory. With near 24/7 coverage of his statements and actions and tens of millions of social media followers, the President possesses the unique ability to illuminate a humanitarian catastrophe that garners few headlines at home or abroad -- and help save millions of lives.\u000a\u000aThe numbers are staggering.

aVS.E. Cupp is the author of "Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity," co-author of "Why You're Wrong About the Right" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.\u000a\u000aBoston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.\u000a\u000aUntil I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.\u000a\u000aI'd always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn't decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I'd ever endured.\u000a\u000aThe pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally -- it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)\u000a\u000aThe pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It's why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It's why I didn't tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he'd spare my next effort.\u000a\u000aAs Marion Underwood and Robert Faris' excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.\u000a\u000a"Even before the dawn of social media," they write, "adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist."\u000a\u000aSo true. I can't imagine my 13-year-old self, naïve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today's unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.\u000a\u000aBut while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to "go viral") were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think 02:10\u000a\u000aNow that I'm a parent of a 10-month-old son, I'm clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents -- especially as parents were either bullies or bullied -- is what kind of kids do we want to raise?\u000a\u000aI could be honest and tell you I've had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a "socially-adept" child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn't the target of bullying. But we've had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.\u000a\u000aLooking back on my difficult year, I'm not sure I'd wish I could have been popular. I do wish I'd been a little more secure.\u000a\u000aI'm also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It's anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won't be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.\u000a\u000aI think I'm pretty tough. Mine wouldn't be the best job -- regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) -- if I had thin skin.\u000a\u000aThere's name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there's stuff you don't prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.\u000a\u000aWhen we talk about bullying, it's hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that's among the adults!).\u000a\u000aOf course, we're tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to "just ignore them" rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.\u000a\u000aAs difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it's also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.\u000a\u000aBeing 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn't necessarily be that it gets better -- adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It's that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you.

aVKelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When Avital Norman Nathman's son was about 3, she says, he freaked out after he walked in on her changing a sanitary pad. So she decided to have an age-appropriate conversation about menstruation with him right then and there.\u000a\u000aShe has taken an open approach ever since with her son, now 10, when it comes to talking about sex.\u000a\u000a"It's not just one conversation," said Norman Nathman , of Northhampton, Massachusetts, a blogger and editor of an anthology on motherhood titled "The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality." "We have this idea in our heads that there is 'the talk,' but it shouldn't be just one conversation. It should be multiple conversations, and starting from a pretty young age."\u000a\u000aNorman Nathman's approach is influenced by what she observed when she taught high school for about four years, beginning in 2002. With sex ed as part of the curriculum, she often led discussion groups based on what the students heard from experts on sex education.\u000a\u000aAnd she was surprised by "the amount of people that would come in from the overall talk with, 'Oh, my gosh. I didn't realize these things.' "\u000a\u000aFor instance, a lot of them thought they could get pregnant simply by being in a hot tub, she said.\u000a\u000a"Talk to your kids," she said when I asked her advice for other parents. "Be there to answer questions, because as uncomfortable as it may be for you, it might be more uncomfortable when your kid comes to you with (a sexually transmitted infection) or with an unplanned pregnancy."\u000a\u000aParents might dread talking to their kids about sex, but here's something really important for every parent to realize: They have tremendous power. Consistently, in surveys conducted by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, teens have said parents have the most influence over their decisions about sex.\u000a\u000aThe power of parents\u000a\u000aIn the most recent survey, released in October, 52% of children ages 12 to 15 said their parents have the most influence when it comes to sex, with friends far behind at 17%. For the 16 to 19 age group, 32% of teens say their parents carry the most weight, with 28% saying their friends have the most influence.\u000a\u000aHowever, when parents are asked who they think most influences their teens' decisions about sex, friends come out far on top. Nearly 60% of more than 2,000 adults over 18 surveyed nationally said friends carry the most weight, in findings released exclusively to CNN, while just 11% said that parents were the biggest influencers.\u000a\u000a"It's a natural rite of passage for teens to act like adults don't matter. It's just part of the developmental process in many, many cases, so I think it's fair for adults to believe what their teens are telling them, and the reality is that teens are clearly saying, especially younger teens and even 16- to 19-year-olds, their parents absolutely matter," said Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\u000a\u000aEven though Janeane Davis, a suburban Philadelphia mom of four, has been talking to her kids about sex since they were young, she still finds it surprising that teens say their parents have the most power when it comes to their decisions about sex.\u000a\u000a"I expected that in my house, but I didn't expect that to be true across the country, and so that's kind of encouraging to know that as parents, we can still influence our children," said Davis, whose kids are 9, 14 and 21 and who blogs at Janeane's World\u000a\u000aWe need to talk to our children, she said, and give them our opinions, "because they're going to listen to what we say, even if they don't do what we want. At least they're listening."\u000a\u000aBut parents seem skeptical about their own abilities to be a trusted source for their children or other young people when it comes to topics such as sex, birth control and relationships, according to the survey.\u000a\u000aWhile 68% said they consider themselves someone whom a younger person could approach to discuss these sensitive issues, 32% said they either couldn't be that person or didn't know whether they could play that role, according to the findings to be released this week.\u000a\u000a"We know that parents are key influencers ... and parents might not believe that, but what they should remember is that this is part of a process and that what parents instill in young people ... might not take hold and catch hold at the moment, but they're preparing their young people, their kids, for the future," Ehrlich said.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that young people who believe there is an adult they can talk with and trust are less likely to have a teen pregnancy, she said.\u000a\u000aSo how can parents start and have these important conversations with their kids? First, they should realize that the conversation is as hard for the teen as it is for the adult, Ehrlich said. "So many sitcoms have really covered that. As soon as the adult brings it up, the teen goes, 'Oh, no!' and vice versa: As soon as the teen brings it up, the adult is like, 'Oh, no!' "\u000a\u000aThe key is for both teen and parent to realize that it's uncomfortable and that's it's OK to feel uncomfortable, she added.\u000a\u000aHere are some tips to start the conversation and keep it going.\u000a\u000a1. Talking about sex in the digital age\u000a\u000aDiana Graber, who teaches "Cyber Civics" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California, remembers the first time she talked to her older daughter about sex. It was probably pre-middle school when she learned from another parent that she had had "the talk" with her son. Graber, a mom of two, then felt like she needed to have a conversation with her daughter because she didn't want her to be left behind.\u000a\u000a"And so I did, and she was looking at me: 'Why are you telling me this? I don't want to know any of this,' " recounted Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital media literacy platform for tweens and teens, teachers and parents. "For years after, even now today, she is 21 years old, she said, 'You told me that stuff way too young.' But as a parent, you just don't know. You don't want to be the one that their kid finds out from their friends because you were too lame to have that conversation."\u000a\u000aHer daughter grew up before kids had cellphones in their hands, she said. "I feel like it's so different for parents today because they don't have that opportunity to break the news to them."\u000a\u000aGraber says her sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders are often seeing a lot of sexual imagery that's sometimes confusing to them. A widely touted statistic is that 70% of children between 7 and 18 have stumbled upon pornography accidentally.\u000a\u000aShe advises parents who give young kids devices to make sure parental controls are in place to keep them from seeing inappropriate content and to spend time on the social media networks their kids are on.\u000a\u000aShe says social media can actually open a door to have discussions about sex that parents wouldn't know how to bring up before.\u000a\u000a"If something inappropriate happens and you know about it, well, that's a great door opener to talk about it and to be that wisdom and kind of guide them through what they're seeing," Graber said. "That's the thing about technology and social media. It does give you a window into your child's world that we never had before. When I was having conversations at the corner with friends, my parents weren't listening."\u000a\u000aEhrlich, of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, said parents should keep in mind how more and more conversations about sex are happening via text. Talking about sex with our kids through texts might be uncomfortable for those of us who didn't grow up in the digital age and prefer face-to-face chats, but texting might help break the ice and then make the face-to-face conversation easier, she said.\u000a\u000a"I think there may be something ... in being askable and making sure the door is open for conversation," Ehrlich said. "I think that for some young people, probably, the knowledge that the door is open is more important than the conversation itself."\u000a\u000a2. How pop culture can get the conversation going\u000a\u000aMore than half of young people ages 12 to 24 have had a helpful conversation with their parents about sex because of something they saw in popular media, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\u000a\u000a"I think watching things in media ... can be a great conversation starter," Ehrlich said. Parents can then use those moments as opportunities to talk about what happened, ask their child what they thought and talk about how it's similar or different to what they believe and do as a family.\u000a\u000aDavis, the mom of four, uses this approach quite a bit with her children. "If we see something on a television show, we'll do something along the lines of, 'Why is she making out with him? She just said she doesn't like him.' "\u000a\u000aHaving regular conversations and making them part of their everyday lives is a much better approach, she believes, than having one big talk.\u000a\u000a"We try to look for ways to make it part of life, because if it's part of life, they're more likely to listen when we talk than if it's 'Oh, my God, we got to have that conversation again,' " she said. "If we keep it along those lines, we think or we're hoping that we'll have better results than if it's just this major once a year conversation."\u000a\u000a3. Practice, practice, practice\u000a\u000aThe old adage "practice makes perfect" applies to talking about sex with your kids, Ehrlich said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Sex talk with mom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sex talk with mom 02:11\u000a\u000a"How do we practice for these conversations, knowing that developmentally, they're probably going to come, so how do we think about how we're going to prepare ourselves as adults not to react in a way that isn't going to keep the door open?" she asked.\u000a\u000aThat means thinking about what you might say and what resources you might want to offer to your child, because adults don't need to be experts in everything, she added. We have plenty of resources on the Internet, so that takes some of the pressure off. We just need to think beforehand about which trusted resources would be good for our kids to utilize on their own time.\u000a\u000a4. 'Stay early and stay late'\u000a\u000aEhrlich says "stay early and stay late" is an expression one of her colleagues likes to use. What it means is, there is no such thing as "the talk" -- but rather many talks that parents should be having with their children as they grow.\u000a\u000aAlso, the conversation doesn't need to be about technicalities and specifics, she said. It's more about making sure your children know that they have the power to decide when and if to have sex and what you as parents feel about that as a family.\u000a\u000a"Here's kind of what our teachings tell us about it. Here's what we want to think about," she said, sharing examples of what parents might say. "These are all kinds of guidance conversations that really parlay into the future and what (could happen) in the future."\u000a\u000a5. Be open\u000a\u000aDavis says her and her husband's philosophy has always been that kids are going to do what they want to do, and so they've been open with their children about sex and birth control.\u000a\u000a"They're not necessarily going to listen to us and just wait until you're married," Davis said. "And if they're not going to do that, we want them to be protected."\u000a\u000aHer husband has made the point with their 14-year-old son that just like a cellphone has a case, he needs to "keep it covered" if he's going to have sex.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We figure, if we talk to them and we're open and honest, then they're more likely to do the right thing and not be afraid to tell us what they've done and what they plan to do."\u000a\u000aNorman Nathman, the mom of one and editor of "The Good Mother Myth," says people might think that if you talk to kids about sex and teach them about it, they're more likely to have sex.\u000a\u000a"But they are going to have sex regardless. Why don't we give them the tools to do it safely for themselves and their partners?"

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000a(CNN) "Climate change is the canvas on which the history of the 21st century will be painted."\u000a\u000aThat's Mark Lynas, writing in "Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet."\u000a\u000aIt's a true if disturbing prediction.\u000a\u000aBy some accounts, we've already entered the Anthropocene , an epoch defined by human degradation of the natural world. We're causing extinctions, changing the climate. Mother Nature is still powerful, sure. But, as Lynas explains, we humans are so fundamental a force that we are changing the way she works.\u000a\u000aI recently asked readers of my "2 degrees" newsletter ( sign up here ) to suggest "must-read" books on climate change -- and Lynas' important work of nonfiction was among your top recommendations. I've been reading it, and I recently interviewed the author. The book takes a degree-by-degree look at the future of our planet as it continues to warm. Two degrees of warming, which the international community is trying to avoid, and which is the focus of my climate change initiative at CNN, sounds bad. But, as Lynas told me, a world that's 6 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution, which is possible if we keep burning alarming amounts of fossil fuels and chopping down forests, sounds downright hellish.\u000a\u000aYou'll find Lynas' "Six Degrees" on a list of 12 climate change must-reads below. It includes a Pulitzer Prize winner, Elizabeth Kolbert's "The Sixth Extinction," as well as an illustrated account of an artist's dive into climate science, titled "Climate Changed."\u000a\u000aYou readers suggested all these, and I've included some of your comments about them.\u000a\u000aWe'll tackle "Six Degrees" first, since it's a great primer. I'll post an interview with Lynas on Thursday, and then we'll read his book together over the course of the month.\u000a\u000aHe's graciously agreed to take your questions in a few weeks.\u000a\u000aThink we missed something? Feel free to leave suggestions in the comments section below.\u000a\u000a1. "Six Degrees," by Mark Lynas\u000a\u000aChapter by chapter, Lynas explores what the world would look like if it warms 1 degree, 2 degrees, 3, degrees Celsius, etc. He's great at distilling the science and maintaining a sense of optimism amid some very gloomy predictions about the future. Suggested by Lance Olsen.\u000a\u000a2. "This Changes Everything," by Naomi Klein\u000a\u000a"Well researched, compelling arguments, hits home for multiple audiences, and is a realistic call to action." -- Laura S. Lynes, from Canmore, Alberta\u000a\u000a3. "The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight," by Thom Hartmann\u000a\u000a"It's all-encompassing -- it delves into the various feedback systems in a climate change context, and also the underlying cultural philosophy or stories we tell ourselves that continue to create the situation we're in. Fascinating stuff!" -- Trevor, from Los Angeles\u000a\u000a4. "The Age of Sustainable Development," by Jeffrey D. Sachs\u000a\u000a"Comprehensive and positive summary of the steps required for sustainable development with good overviews of the problems causing climate change." -- Dan Fowler, from Austin, Texas\u000a\u000a5. "Comfortably Unaware," by Richard A. Oppenlander\u000a\u000a"People don't realize the devastating impact that our food choices have on the planet. This book explains how animal agriculture is the single biggest cause of global warming." -- Wendy Horowitz, from New Haven, Connecticut\u000a\u000a6. "The Sixth Extinction," by Elizabeth Kolbert\u000a\u000a"An amazingly well written narrative on the effect our species has had on the planet. As our population continues to grow and our demand on our very limited resources escalates, the negative impact we have had and continue to have is well explained." -- Sharon Lynch, from Benicia, California\u000a\u000a7. "The End of the Long Summer," by Dianne Dumanoski\u000a\u000a"A really thoughtful, wise and balanced appraisal of fact that, going on past changes to the climate, we are likely to reach a sudden tipping point and experience huge climate changes over just a few years, BUT that humans are incredibly resilient and adaptable and rather than go extinct, will likely rise to the challenge.\u000a\u000a"This book gave me hope while presenting the facts." -- Persephone Maywald, from Australia\u000a\u000a8. "Climate Wars," by Gwynne Dyer\u000a\u000a"Waves of climate refugees. Dozens of failed states. All-out war. From one of the world's great geopolitical analysts comes a terrifying glimpse of the strategic realities of the near future, when climate change drives the world's powers towards the cut-throat politics of survival," the publisher's description says.\u000a\u000a9. "Merchants of Doubt," by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway\u000a\u000aHere's an endorsement from John Horgan, of Scientific American : "The book, which packages rigorous research in fiery rhetoric, inspired a documentary, 'Merchants of Doubt' ... I highly recommend the book and documentary, which reveal how disturbingly easy it can be for unscrupulous spin-meisters to dupe journalists and the public." The book was suggested by Aaron Thierry, a reader from Edinburgh, Scotland\u000a\u000a10. "Don't Even Think About It," by George Marshall\u000a\u000aA Twitter user -- @timreckmeyer -- suggested this one as part of a discussion on whether we at CNN should be leading climate change stories with images of sad polar bears on ice sheets. (He thinks we shouldn't. You can see from the gallery below that we still are, from time to time.) George Marshall, the book's author, explores how our brains shape (and warp) perceptions about climate change. I'm hoping this book will help me understand how to better explain this subject -- and will settle the polar bear debate.\u000a\u000a11. "Climate Changed," by Philippe Squarzoni\u000a\u000a"It's an amazing book. It's an illustrated nonfiction book (graphic novel format) that is built on Squarzoni's interviews with IPCC scientists. The science is well explained, but the power comes from watching Squarzoni absorb the information and struggle to fit it into his life, just like a reader, over the six years it took him to put the book together. So the intangible social aspect of climate, which is probably more important to solutions than climate science itself, is explored with candor." -- Richard Reiss, from New York\u000a\u000a12. "The Great Transition," by Lester Brown\u000a\u000a"Right away, book club or no, this book must be read: 'The Great Transition,' by Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute," a reader, Elizabeth McCommon, wrote in an e-mail. A friend "put it in my hands this last weekend, saying it would help me regain optimism about the future," she said.\u000a\u000aSounds like it worked.\u000a\u000aEmail questions to: climate [at] cnn.com.\u000a\u000aFollow the project on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram

aV(CNN) Veteran war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte is quitting the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, the panel confirmed on Sunday .\u000a\u000aDel Ponte was one of three members on the UN-appointed panel tasked with probing human rights violations in Syria, including chemical weapons attacks, torture of prisoners, and the targeting of hospitals.\u000a\u000a"I am quitting this commission, which is not backed by any political will," she told a panel discussion at the Locarno Film Festival, Reuters reported\u000a\u000a"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing," she added. "We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria."\u000a\u000aDel Ponte has served on the commission since September 2012 -- one year after the Syrian conflict started. Since it began, the Syrian civil war has left some 400,000 people dead and millions displaced\u000a\u000aThe UN Commission of Inquiry said in a statement that its work would continue after del Ponte's departure.\u000a\u000a"It is our obligation to persist in its work on behalf of the countless number of Syrian victims of the worst human rights violations and international crimes known to humanity," the commission said, thanking del Ponte for her contributions. "Such efforts are needed now more than ever."\u000a\u000aDel Ponte informed her colleagues, Brazil's Paulo Pinheiro and Karen Koning AbuZayd from the United States, in mid-June of her decision to leave, according to the statement.\u000a\u000aThe commission, which was appointed by the Geneva-based United Nations Human Rights Council, has produced a number of reports chronicling evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity. In 2016, the panel found that ISIS had committed genocide against the Yazidi religious minority. In the same year, it documented how government forces unlawfully detained and tortured people in Syrian prisons\u000a\u000aIn order to prosecute such crimes, the Security Council must refer the conflict to the International Criminal Court, which is unlikely given Russia's power to veto such a move. Russia has supported Syria since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, providing military assistance to President Bashar al-Assad's government.\u000a\u000aDel Ponte, a former Swiss attorney general who made her name prosecuting war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, said the crimes she's seen in Syria are unparalleled -- hinting at her exasperation over a lack of accountability.\u000a\u000a"What we have seen here in Syria, I never saw that in Rwanda, or in former Yugoslavia, in the Balkans. It is really a big tragedy," she added. "Unfortunately we have no tribunal."

aV(CNN) While President Donald Trump insisted Congress repeal Obamacare within his first 100 days , the legislation was rushed, according to his Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price, and that's why the Republicans failed.\u000a\u000aBut the recent setback will not deter the Trump administration, he said during an interview at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday with CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\u000a\u000aPrice runs a department with a budget of more than $1 trillion dollars and more than 80,000 employees who do work that he said touches on "the lives of every single American." The orthopedic surgeon -- the third doctor to hold the secretary position -- said he was visiting Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday to meet leaders at the CDC. He also gave a speech Wednesday about the country's growing opioid epidemic at the National RX Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit.\u000a\u000a"Recovery is possible for every single individual," Price said in addressing the summit attendees. "America is not giving up on this fight. Surrender simply is not an option. The stakes are too high and the value of every life is too precious."\u000a\u000aPrice is part of the executive opioid commission announced by President Trump last month. When asked about what was at the root of the crisis, Price pointed to a sense of despair in individuals and lack of connection to community. "It's a struggle now that is being met with these powerful, powerful agents that are destroying lives, destroying communities, all over, all across the land," Price told Gupta in a follow up interview Wednesday.\u000a\u000aBefore becoming secretary, Price represented Georgia's 6th district in Congress and he happened to be visiting on the day his seat was up for grabs in what was seen as a litmus test on the Trump presidency. Tuesday's unexpectedly close election unfolded in a district that has elected a Republican since 1979, including Newt Gingrich.\u000a\u000aThis week, it gave the most votes to a Democrat, newcomer John Ossoff, whose lawn signs urge people to "Vote your Ossoff." He'll be in a runoff in June against Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, who got the second highest number of votes.\u000a\u000aAsked about the election, Price declined to weigh in saying that he was "told by the legal beagles at the Department of Health and Human Services" that he has to "take that political hat off and put it in the corner" so that's what he says he's done.\u000a\u000aWhomever gets elected to Price's old seat will be one of the many leaders Price will have to court if he is going to successfully transform the American health care system he has spent a political career railing against, one he has characterized as "failing."\u000a\u000aFrom doctor to politician\u000a\u000aPrice's first public complaints in the 1990s came long before he was elected. He served on the Georgia State Medical Association, a group that advocates for medical professionals. Representing the association, he visited Rotary clubs and church groups all around Georgia talking about how the Bill Clinton administration had "started down a path that I felt, along with many others, was not the right path to head."\u000a\u000aPrice turned that message into a political career. He served four terms in the Georgia state Senate. There, he became the first Republican Majority Leader in the state's history, bringing what his hometown paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , called a "Newt Gingrich-style sense of Republican partisanship" to the state House.\u000a\u000aHe brought in tort reform that placed new limits on medical malpractice complaints, voted consistently against access to abortion, and repeatedly demonstrated his conservative values beyond medicine. He voted for a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage in 2006 and sponsored a bill to create a Confederate history month that didn't mention slavery. He voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Georgia flag, then voted against eliminating the remaining Confederate symbol from the flag, which Democrats questioned him about in his contentious confirmation hearing in January. (At the hearing, Price said the move "addressed all the concerns of the state and was adopted and supported by the state.")\u000a\u000aWhen Rep. Johnny Isakson decided to run for the Senate, vacating his 6th district seat, Price took his conservative politics and passion for reforming health care to the national stage, getting elected in 2005. In Congress, he continued to get a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee and a 0% rating from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, voting against federal coverage for abortion and against expanding research on embryonic stem cell lines.\u000a\u000aHe also introduced a comprehensive health care bill of his own, the Empowering Patients First Act of 2015, that expanded health savings accounts. It gave states grants to create pools of high-risk patients, rather than have expensive patients deemed "high risk" by insurance companies in the general insurance population. The legislation never made it into law. Price said this week he still likes the idea of high-risk pools\u000a\u000aResearch shows, though, they are limited in their ability to help give "insurance for everybody," as Trump said he wanted to do. A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found prior to Obamacare, the states with high-risk pools offered coverage that was expensive, and only a small fraction of the people who needed the coverage actually got it.\u000a\u000aPrice told Gupta that while they did not work "terribly well" in the past, it's because they weren't funded to the "degree they should be" and the pools weren't big enough to be cost effective. Going forward, the administration's plan would need to address this issue, he said.\u000a\u000aA third-generation doctor, Price said he will work to transform the health care system to make it more "patient centered." The 62-year-old said he knows this kind of care is possible, since he witnessed those relationships first hand when he was a little boy, making housecalls with his grandfather.\u000a\u000a"The door flung open and they said, 'Dr. Price.' and gave him a big hug," Price remembered "And to me that's what the doctor-patient relationship was all about."\u000a\u000aIn contrast, at Resurgens Orthopaedics, which Price helped build into a nationwide practice, he said the system prevented those kinds of relationships.\u000a\u000a"I remember, almost to the day, the moment in my medical practice when I was back in my office working on some paperwork and I went out to see a patient, and I crossed, I went through that door, you know the door between the clinical side where you see patients and the back-office area, and it hit me that there were more people behind that door working on all the clerical stuff. Working, fighting with insurance companies, fighting with the government, fighting with this supplier, that supplier, to get the services and the apparatus needed to care for those people," Price said.\u000a\u000a"I said to myself then, at that very moment, 'There's something wrong with this picture.' When we have more people in the system who aren't providing clinical care, who aren't hands-on taking care of patients or having a responsibility to care for patients, then that's a system that again, may be working for other folks, but it's not working for the patients."\u000a\u000aMoving on after failure\u000a\u000aThe most recent Republican attempt to fix the healthcare system failed, Price said, because of the "compressed timeline for the sale of the bill." While his boss said, "nobody knew health care could be so complicated," Price seems to have understood and told Gupta that "the different systems that we have, don't make a whole lot of sense."\u000a\u000aHe vowed the administration will "keep our eye on the ball and make certain that we move in the direction of a system that is much more responsive to patients, again, those end users, the people and the patients across this land who need to be paid attention to," Price said.\u000a\u000aPrice suggested one way to fix the system will be to make sure the right resources go to the right initiatives.\u000a\u000aHe wants to cut redundancy and waste. And while he runs the federal agency that operates 11 divisions including the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, he thinks the states, rather than the federal government should get more power over your healthcare.\u000a\u000a"States are much more flexible, much more nimble to be able to create and modify a system that would work best for their constituents," he said.\u000a\u000aStates may have to pick up the slack since Trump's initial budget plan slashes billions from Price's departments, which have already seen shrinking budgets for years. For instance, a report from Trust for America's Health found that the CDC's core budget has decreased by more than $580 million since 2010. Still as the CDC budget fell, state public health spending remained relatively flat.\u000a\u000aMoney, though, is not the answer, Price repeatedly told Gupta. "For us to say,'OK, let's just throw more money at that system. Let's see if more money helps that out' is the wrong way," Price said.\u000a\u000aWhen pressed to give an example of a state that has improved healthcare with less money, Price did not give a direct answer.\u000a\u000aInstead he pointed to Indiana as a state that reformed its health care system under the guidance of the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services director Seema Verma.\u000a\u000aThe Healthy Indiana Plan did not do more with less; instead, it used the money it was given for Medicaid to create benefit packages for low-income adults that were modeled after high-deductible health plans. This created health savings accounts for the poor that required most to contribute some money toward their own health care, even if it was only a few dollars.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aPrice will continue to push for reform and is confident the Trump administration will leave Americans with a better health care system.\u000a\u000a"When we look back on this," Price said, "I believe, in 10 or 20 years, I think that we will say that we moved in the direction of a much more responsive, much more higher quality healthcare system for the American people, and I still believe that's what will occur."

With deafening silence.\u000a\u000aAfter pushing back against Chinese coercion for years, the Philippines has turned defeatist under the year-old government of President Rodrigo Duterte. Manila now appears eager to trade silence regarding its maritime claims for economic carrots from Beijing.\u000a\u000aMalaysia, whose government is embroiled in corruption allegations and is barreling toward political crisis in the next general election, has little appetite for confrontation with China, an important benefactor.\u000a\u000aAnd Indonesia is happy to occupy a middle ground, resisting at the margins when it comes to Chinese fishing encroachments in its waters, but uninterested in taking a more active role in the disputes.\u000a\u000aEven Singapore , which remains deeply skeptical of China's long-term intentions, is keeping its head down after being made a diplomatic punching bag by Beijing for its perceived support of the Philippines' international arbitration victory last July.\u000a\u000aDivisions on display\u000a\u000aThe divisions within Southeast Asia were on full display during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Minister's Meeting earlier this month.\u000a\u000aThe Philippines, which hosted the summit, and Cambodia wanted to strip out anything that could irritate China. But Vietnam, smarting from the Vanguard Bank incident and convinced that China's diplomatic softening over the previous year was just a delaying tactic, argued for stronger language\u000a\u000aIts tactics got it singled out in a China Daily editorial, which slammed Hanoi for "hypocritically trying to insert tough language criticizing China's island building."\u000a\u000aLate on Sunday, the group reached a compromise that reinserted several points from previous ASEAN statements, including concern over recent land reclamation and militarization.\u000a\u000aThe comprise language in the communique was weaker that some previous statements, particularly the Sunnylands Declaration signed by ASEAN leaders and President Barack Obama in 2016.\u000a\u000aModest victory\u000a\u000aStill, Vietnam had won a modest victory and received a measure of support, even if grudgingly, from its neighbors. But the victory was short-lived.\u000a\u000aThe next day, Philippine foreign secretary Alan Peter Cayetano sided with China , telling the press, "I didn't want to include it. It's not reflective of the present position. They (China) are not reclaiming land anymore.

aVThe former president on climate change, curiosity, and what it means to be a leader\u000a\u000aThe office where I met Clinton high in the UN headquarters building belongs to another era. It is an institution built for a world of the past -- one based on Cold War rivalries and the last century's balance of power. It was Clinton's first day in the cramped space, and his entourage of bodyguards and assistants were stumbling over one another in the confines. The Secret Service men dispatched a young press aide to inquire why so many UN staffers were loitering near the elevators, though it was clear that they were simply trying to catch a glimpse of the ex-president.\u000a\u000a"Is this the office?" an exhausted Clinton asked after shaking my hand. I nodded, as did most of the swarm that followed him. The entire place felt as if it hadn't been touched since the early fifties when the building was raised, a lone skyscraper above an otherwise flat block on the East Side of Manhattan. I heard him chuckle to a staffer as he stepped inside, "You know what," -- 'wahut,' the final word came out -- "It kinda reminds me of Mad Men. Have you seen that show yet?"\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliam Jefferson Blythe III never met his father, a traveling salesman who died in a car accident three months before Bill was born. He took the name Clinton from his hard-drinking and abusive stepfather, Roger, who Bill, at fourteen, demanded never hit his mother again. He hid the abuse from most people in his life. As a junior at Georgetown University, though, he shuttled back and forth to Durham, North Carolina on weekends to make peace with his dying stepfather as he underwent cancer treatments. Clinton almost never drinks; he sleeps little and speaks without reprieve. On the day that we met, the topics of his endless seminar ranged from the evolution of the light bulb to early twentieth-century American film to the beauty of Columbia's Aburrá Valley and Medellín.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most interesting dimension of his character is the pace with which he lives. "He had said to everybody over and over and over again," Chelsea Clinton has said, "that none of the men in his family live past sixty, or much past." As a result, he has always moved at a rather reckless pace, trying to accomplish as much as possible before a short clock -- either real, imagined, or prophetically self-fulfilling -- ticks to a stop.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs members of my generation look around the world today, we see climate change on the rise and nothing in the way of a successor for the Kyoto Protocol, the proliferation of nuclear weapons still un abated, Millennium Development Goals we're still well short of, a hugely imbalanced global economy that will continue to undermine itself, and I wonder if you worry that you and this post-Cold War generation of leaders will be judged harshly by history?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNo. I think that's a cheap trick. I mean, all of this "the greatest generation is World War II?" -- it just happens that they're the most horrible parents in human history, right?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf all of us baby boomers were so bad, then our parents were terrible; they failed. And if we were so bad, how come our kids are so great? We were hellaciously good parents.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI think it's phony as a $3 bill. I think they had a chance to win World War II and it was clear. These are much more complex things [now]. We have no idea if the World War II generation would have made the decisions they should make on climate change if they thought doing so would bring an end to their economic prosperity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe real problem in climate change is that we're paying for our past success. The established order has too many self-protecting economic entities, and not enough people who yet understand what it takes to change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe World War II generation was thrown into a war by a madman, Hitler, and an expansionist empire in Japan, and we did what we had to do. Look, I admire the World War II generation; I'm just trying to make a point here. I don't think there are defective generations. There are times and struggles and they present different challenges.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI believe the United States will pass reasonably good climate change legislation, I believe we will get a successor that will be better than Kyoto, and I think that we're in a race against time and circumstance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis will be calamitous if we don't do something about it, and the population of the earth will drop hugely over the next 1,000 years, maybe over the next 200 years, if we don't do something about it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe're really in a race against time. I think history is a relay race and you just got to keep handing off and making things happen. I'm basically pretty optimistic.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhere the intersection of science and politics is on climate change, I'd leave to others. We might lose. Our minds may not be able to expand enough collectively to avert the worst.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI think most people are more literal and they learn things in a serial fashion. Most people have all they can do to keep body and soul together -- even before this economic collapse -- raise their kids, pay their taxes, worry about how to pay for college, deal with their mother's health, and everything.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt just takes time to change the mindset, but we're a much more communitarian country and a much more communitarian world than we were 20 years ago. I basically think you've got to get people's attitudes right, and then they have to have a general analysis that's right, and you have to organize for action. And you just have to stumble in the right direction. I'm pretty upbeat about it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen you're my age, I hope you're dealing with a different set of problems. There'll always be problems, but that's what I hope will happen\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Leopolus, a childhood friend of yours, used to joke with friends that if they were bored, they could always go and watch you read.

I think it's also important in a complex time with a lot of dynamism to be able to relate to all different kinds of people, because, in the end, most political power depends more on persuasion rather than coercion.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd then I think you have to be able to reconcile the complexities and order them in a pattern. For a lot of people who just follow the evening news or read the morning paper, it's like the political equivalent of chaos theory in physics.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut your job, if you're a leader, is to take superficially random events and organize them into patterns that tell you what you should do to maximize an opportunity or head off the problem.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBeing decisive in the face of complexity and ambiguity is important. Being able to make a call, to decide to act, and then figuring out how to act to support that decision. Yes, be curious; yes, appreciate the complexity and ambiguity; but then organize into patterns and decide what you're going to do and execute. I think that's extremely important.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYou know, Machiavelli said in the 15th century that change was hard because the people who would benefit from it were uncertain of their gain and the people who would lose were positive of their loss; that's pretty much the way it still is.

The Democratic presidential primary of 2008 muddled the esteem that had ballooned during eight years of gaffes and incompetence by his successor in the Oval Office. During that span, Clinton largely redefined the post- presidential years; he circled the globe as a nimble, intrepid freelancer, leveraging charisma and a seemingly limitless Rolodex for both the broader good and personal gain."Clinton is a nonprofit conglomerate," says one former advisor and long-time friend. It's not an in- accurate characterization. His work fittingly mirrors the rise of social networking and the Internet, a two-point-zero version of previous post-presidential benevolence.Among his most important accomplishments is his success drastically reducing the cost of life-saving anti-retro viral treatment for AIDS victims around the world. The latest round of deals with pharmaceutical companies -- on the heels of others that have helped two million people access treatment -- drops the cost of second-line regiments, for those whose illnesses have overcome first line drugs, by 60 percent. Commitments to charitable work made each year by individuals and corporations attending the Clinton Global Initiative conference reach into the billions of dollars. He launched a ten-year $100 million campaign against extreme poverty in Rwanda and Malawi and, in 2005, raised over a $120 million following Hurricane Katrina with George H. W. Bush.As president, his achievements were matched by equally notable shortfalls. He presided over a massive expansion of economic growth, generating surpluses of $122 billion and $230 billion during his last two years in office; he waged a successful campaign to stem genocide in Kosovo, and greatly expanded free trade and global commerce. But his failure to intervene in Rwanda, where some 800,000 were massacred, or to move effectively to stop genocide in Bosnia, or to advance middle east peace, marked high-profile failures. Domestically, he was unable to pass comprehensive health care reform and ambitious campaign finance reforms. He signed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, which had raised a wall between the speculative trading and underwriting of investment banks and the more traditional lending of commercial, depository banks. The law had been in place since the 1930s. Its elimination helped inflate the massive bubble that burst in the 2007 financial collapse, and meant commercial institutions, like Bank of America and Citibank, were allowed to assume massive risk in the form of housing market credit derivatives. They, of course, had to be bailed out to protect the broader economy. "I think they were wrong," he told ABC in April 2010, referring to his economics advisors, "and I think I was wrong to take [their advice]." The Monica Lewinsky scandal and a myriad of other sex-related allegations forever scarred his legacy and remains the first thought for many when his name is invoked.But for most of those who've had the chance to interact with Clinton, his warmth and intelligence overpower the more lurid details that special prosecutor Ken Starr seared into the American conscience. Clinton is surprisingly tender in person, a gentle handshake matches the soft white hair and the unmistakable bulb nose.He has been called the Michael Jordan of politics, an apt comparison in terms of both talent and intensity. Stan Greenberg, who worked as a consultant for both of Clinton's bids for the White House, recalled Clinton's rage at a Ross Perot attack in the closing days of the 1992 campaign: "They are attacking my character and we must attack Perot's character." He went on, speaking over the phone with aides after a long day of campaigning, "We need to take a meat axe to his brain, cut his head open." He demanded a response that was "red meat and passion, no more pussy ads."

aVTo some people, the word "neurotic" can conjure images of a certain type of psychotherapy: Woody Allen types splayed out on long divans, with Freudian therapists sitting coolly behind them, asking vague questions about Oedipal complexes.\u000a\u000aPsychology's come a long way since Freud, though, and today, this scenario feels a bit like an anachronism -- and so, in some ways, does the term. In 1994, the condition of "neurosis" was dropped entirely from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, psychiatry's encyclopedia of mental disorders.\u000a\u000aSince then, it has been largely replaced by more specific terminologies, like social-anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic disorder.\u000a\u000aBut neuroticism does live on in personality research, where it is considered one of the "Big Five" traits, along with openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion. And these days, neuroticism -- which is tested by one's responses to statements like "I get irritated easily," "I worry about things," and "I get stressed out easily" -- is enjoying a little bit of rebranding: Studies have shown that it can be potentially beneficial, leading to greater creativity , quicker cognitive processing , and increased motivation (that last one is due especially to neurotic people's keener sense of negative outcomes).\u000a\u000aAnd in a study published earlier this year in Psychological Science, a team of researchers went even further, arguing that, if the circumstances are just right, neurosis may be the personality trait that helps extend your life.\u000a\u000aIt's still a fairly counterintuitive claim. Creativity and motivation aside, studies have also shown that on the whole, negative thinking -- the hallmark of a highly neurotic person -- negatively influences health, whereas happiness and upbeat thinking are positive influences\u000a\u000aSince neurotic people have, by definition, more psychological distress, and psychologically distressed people tend to have more life-shortening health issues like depression, it would seem logical that neurotic people would therefore live shorter lives than non-neurotic people.\u000a\u000aBut that argument didn't entirely convince Catharine Gale, a professor of cognitive epidemiology at the University of Southampton and the lead researcher of the Psychological Science study.\u000a\u000a"Previous studies have been inconsistent," Gale tells me. "Some of them have found that being high in neuroticism increases your risk of dying prematurely; others have found that it's been slightly protective."\u000a\u000aTo make sense of this inconsistency, Gale and her co-authors tapped into the United Kingdom Biobank, a massive set of health data collected between 2006 and 2010 from over a half million U.K. residents aged 37 to 73.\u000a\u000aIn addition to analyzing subjects' neuroticism (based on a personality questionnaire) and self-reported health, the researchers also looked at specific health behaviors (smoking, drinking, diet, exercise), physical attributes (BMI, blood pressure, grip strength), cognitive function (reaction time, mental processing speed), diagnosed diseases (self-reported), and socioeconomic status (education, assets, postal code).\u000a\u000aOn average, each person's data stretched over six years and three months; nearly 5,000 participants died during the data-collection period, which gave their information an especially strong statistical power.\u000a\u000aPooling all this information, the researchers noticed something odd: The people who rated their own health poorly also tended to have higher levels of neuroticism and a lower likelihood of premature death.\u000a\u000aAt first, Gale thought that these more-neurotic-longer-living people had perhaps been simply taking better care of themselves, thereby extending their lives.\u000a\u000a"Initially we looked at the obvious things for what might explain this decreased mortality, like health behaviors," she says. "Did people behave differently with things like smoking, drinking, exercise, and diet if they had poor self-rated health and high neuroticism?" But that wasn't the case.\u000a\u000aIn fact, it was the opposite: More-neurotic people were less likely to eat enough fruits and vegetables or exercise, and more likely to smoke and drink alcohol either every day or nearly every day.\u000a\u000aSo, on to the next possibility. Maybe, Gale reasoned, the link between higher neuroticism and a lower risk of death was due to an issue of timing. Perhaps people were already ill at the time their personalities were measured, affecting both their neuroticism scores and their likelihood of premature death during the data collection. But that didn't line up, either.\u000a\u000aEventually, she concluded that neurotic people may just be going to their health-care providers more often. "The only thing we could think of was whether people were more vigilant about their health," she says. "Perhaps they saw their doctor more regularly when they had symptoms they were worried about, and that might lead to earlier diagnoses of serious illnesses, particularly in the case of cancer."\u000a\u000aThere's no data in the Biobank to support or disprove this theory, but Gale believes that, for now, it's the most plausible hypothesis. "We don't know that that's the protective mechanism, but certainly we found that one aspect of neuroticism is that regardless of how you rated your health, it seemed to be protective of health," she says.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAnd other research backs up the link between neuroticism and increased attention to one's health. A study published in 2010 in the journal PLOS One, for instance, found that people with higher neuroticism tended to seek out health care more frequently. And a 2000 study in the Journal of Personality examined the concept of "healthy neuroticism," or the idea that more-neurotic people tended to be more vigilant about taking care of themselves.\u000a\u000aThe irony there, as Gale's research revealed, is that in most ways -- diet, exercise, drinking and smoking -- more-neurotic people tend to take worse care of themselves. But they do, perhaps, know when it's time to see a doctor, which could be the all-important difference. And while Freud's idea of neurosis may no longer apply to our modern understanding of psychology, he did seem to be ahead of his time when it came to certain aspects of the trait.\u000a\u000a"Neurotics complain of their illness," he once wrote. "But they make the most of it."

aVFrancesca Street, CNN \u2022 Updated 24th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 An abandoned castle always cuts an impressive figure -- a blast from the past submerged behind ruined walls.\u000a\u000aSays author Kieron Connolly, whose new book " Abandoned Castles " explores the world's most spectacular forgotten fortresses, they're also windows on long gone civilizations.\u000a\u000a"Societies are like a body: centuries go by and the body decays," he tells CNN Travel.\u000a\u000a"The castle's like the skull or like the teeth, in fact they even look a bit like teeth, sticking out, out of the ground. They give us some clues, some entries into the past."\u000a\u000aConnolly's book features castles from around the world and across the ages -- including 19th century military forts in the French Alps, 13th century castles in the Scottish Highlands and a medieval fortress in Syria.\u000a\u000aQuestions with no answers\u000a\u000aThe book includes fortresses such as Fort de Malamot, built in 1889 in the Cottian Alps.\u000a\u000aIt's been published by Amber Books to accompany earlier successful books, " Abandoned Places " and "Abandoned Wrecks ."\u000a\u000aThe pictures were sourced by Amber's Terry Forshaw.\u000a\u000aConnolly traces his own interest in abandoned places back to his childhood.\u000a\u000a"As a kid we would go on long walks and often it would be along a disused railway line," he recalls.\u000a\u000a"These places had an air of mystery: 'Why's it closed down, where does it go, what does it look like when it's closed down, how quickly do branches grow through the tracks, stations start to crumble?'"\u000a\u000aLayers of history\u000a\u000aSpis Castle is a stunning Gothic-Romanesque hybrid.\u000a\u000aMany of the castles in the book have histories spanning centuries.\u000a\u000aOver the years different owners and different conflicts put their stamp on the castles' architecture.\u000a\u000a"I love that you get this idea of layers of history," says Connolly. "You can see how a castle was built and then rebuilt and expanded, how the walls changed, how it passed back and forth and finally became obsolete."\u000a\u000aPeeling back the layers offers a captivating peek into the past.\u000a\u000aTake Spis Castle, in Slovakia. It started life as a Romanesque fort in the 12th century, before taking on a Gothic turn a century later.\u000a\u000aIn the 15th century, the castle was completely rebuilt.

The fact that the spelling is different is apparently, I understand, simply a misspelling by the British."\u000a\u000aArresting ruins\u000a\u000aIreland's Ballycarbery Castle is slowing being absorbed by the natural world.\u000a\u000aOther highlights in the book include Ballycarbery Castle in County Kerry, Ireland.\u000a\u000aSituated on a dramatic location on the edge of the North Atlantic Ocean, all that remains of this 16th century fort are the stone walls.\u000a\u000aThe castle was damaged by English Civil War militarian Oliver Cromwell's troops, during his infamous Irish conquest.\u000a\u000aNow this atmospheric fortress is being slowly absorbed into the natural landscape. The walls are clad in ivy and the first floor is covered in grass.\u000a\u000a"It's an interesting idea, how nature reclaims these things," remarks Connolly.\u000a\u000aAnother striking spot is Golconda, near Hyderabad in central India.\u000a\u000aGolconda Castle was the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty (from 1518-1687).\u000a\u000aBuilt in the 16th century by the Qutb Shahi dynasty, the fort formerly housed the infamous Koh-i-Noor diamond -- later owned by Queen Victoria and now on display in Britain's Tower of London.\u000a\u000aThe citadel once included four individual forts, mosques, temples, royal apartments and gardens, now it's an arresting ruin.\u000a\u000aWorlds gone by\u000a\u000aAbandoned forts including Minard Castle, in Ireland, are a gateway to the past.\u000a\u000aSo why are photographers around the world so fascinated by ruins?\u000a\u000aConnolly thinks it's because abandoned places are a meeting place for the past and the present.\u000a\u000a"Abandoned places touch a nerve with people," Connolly says. "We're interested in worlds gone by, forgotten worlds."

aVHong Kong (CNN) Terence Tam's dad fled to Hong Kong from China during the political chaos of the Cultural Revolution to make a better life for himself and his family.\u000a\u000aThen a British colony, the city became home to a huge number of refugees fleeing Communism in the 1960s and 1970s.\u000a\u000aNow 39, Tam says he's ready to make another escape, 20 years after the UK handed sovereignty over the city to China.\u000a\u000aWhile Hong Kong is one of the most affluent cities in the world, he says it's now in the throes of its own political upheaval.\u000a\u000a"I want to see if I can do the same for my family (as my father did for us)," he says. "I'm not satisfied with the situation in Hong Kong. The political situation, the government. We have so many complaints."\u000a\u000aHong Kong: How the city has changed since 1997\u000a\u000aHong Kong: How the city has changed since 1997 03:14\u000a\u000aHong Kong: How the city has changed since 1997\u000a\u000a'I feel like we are refugees'\u000a\u000aBy most yardsticks, Tam's done well for himself. He's an assistant IT manager at one of Hong Kong's universities and owns an apartment -- no mean feat in a city that has the world's most unaffordable property prices.\u000a\u000aBut Tam objects to China's growing grip on the city.\u000a\u000aUnder the principle of "one country, two systems," Hong Kong was supposed to have preserved the rule of law, freedom of speech and the right to protest as enjoyed under the British -- at least until 2047 -- but Tam, and others, feel that China hasn't held up its part of the bargain.\u000a\u000a"Some people say that we are emigrating but I feel like we are refugees escaping from Hong Kong," he says.\u000a\u000aIn two years, once his newborn daughter is ready for kindergarten, Tam plans to uproot his family and move to Taiwan.\u000a\u000aTerence Tam and his wife on vacation in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.\u000a\u000aHis wife has already secured citizenship there through an investment visa scheme and Tam plans to cash out his Hong Kong pension pot and start a business selling Hong Kong snacks.\u000a\u000aTam is one of a growing number of people in the city looking for an exit. According to an opinion poll conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong last year, two in five Hong Kongers want to live overseas -- up from one in five in 2014 -- although only 10% of those who said they wanted to leave had put such a plan into action.\u000a\u000aWhat's changed?\u000a\u000aIt's not the first time that political upheaval has had Hong Kongers scouting for boltholes.\u000a\u000aFrom 1989, in the wake of the Tiananmen massacre, almost 60,000 people left the city every year, primarily for Canada, the United States and Australia, according to one academic study.\u000a\u000aHowever, many came back as the nightmare scenarios some had imagined didn't emerge and Beijing largely left the city alone during the first 15 years of Chinese rule.\u000a\u000aBut in 2014, Beijing denied Hong Kongers the universal suffrage promised to the city under its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, triggering massive streets protests that paralyzed much of the city for more than two months.\u000a\u000aPolice fire tear gas upon pro-democracy demonstrators near the Hong Kong government headquarters on September 28, 2014.\u000a\u000aSince then, fears have grown that Beijing neither cares about, nor pays heed, to the city's supposed autonomy.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, five men involved in publishing gossipy books on China's ruling elite -- two of whom had European passports -- disappeared only to reappear in Chinese custody weeks later.\u000a\u000aChina has also moved to bar pro-democracy lawmakers from taking office, using a rarely invoked power.\u000a\u000aThis erosion of the city's autonomy has led to calls for Hong Kong's independence from a small but persistently vocal group.\u000a\u000aMany fear that Hong Kong's new leader Carrie Lam , who was selected by a 1,200-strong committee and takes office July 1, will now enact a controversial security law, known as Article 23 , that would "prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against China."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Next Hong Kong leader on missing bookseller Replay More Videos ...

It's also now much harder to emigrate to places like Australia and Canada than it was in the 1990s.\u000a\u000aTam says he chose Taiwan because it's a place he fell in love with on vacation and it has the same cultural roots as Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aHe knows that life won't be easy. Tam's native language is Cantonese and says he speaks Mandarin, the language most Taiwanese use, haltingly. Jobs are also lower paid on average in Taiwan than in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000a"I love the culture in Taiwan. I've been to the UK to study for one year. When I landed there, the first step, I felt like I didn't belong. But when I went to Taiwan I felt different," Tam says.\u000a\u000aSupporters shout during Tsai Ing-wen's speech on her presidential election victory on January 16, 2016 in Taipei, Taiwan.\u000a\u000aIt's also the world's only Chinese-speaking democracy -- an important drawcard.\u000a\u000aAccording to official figures, the number of Taiwan permanent residents hailing from Hong Kong has more than doubled since 2014 -- though the absolute number is still very small at 1,086.\u000a\u000aTaiwan, however, is not without its own political issues and complexities . Despite Taiwan governing its own affairs for more than six decades, China views the island as part of its territory , to be taken by force if necessary.\u000a\u000aThe two -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China -- split in 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a civil war.\u000a\u000a"I have a stable job, income and property, but I find the environment here very uncomfortable," Tam says. "We were born before 1997. Our birth certificates, our passports were issued by the UK. After 1997 we didn't immediately see any changes but we do now."\u000a\u000aOn July 1, thousands are expected to brave the city's sultry summer humidity to mark the 20th anniversary of the handover by marching through Hong Kong's streets to demand greater democracy. The annual event has taken on extra significance this year with Chinese President Xi Jinping visiting the city for the very first time.\u000a\u000aTam has joined the protest in the past but won't this year -- he sees it as a futile act: "I have a choice, I can leave. It's time to get out."

"The error appears to have originated with a third party vendor and the episode was removed as soon as it was recognized."\u000a\u000aEpisode six is due to air on Sunday. It has reportedly been copied and shared online on multiple sites.\u000a\u000aThe fantasy series is one of the most popular and acclaimed shows on television. Over 16 million viewers tuned in for the season premiere in July, according to HBO.\u000a\u000aIndian police said Tuesday they had arrested four men suspected of leaking a different episode of "Game of Thrones" before its scheduled release on August 7. The suspects were connected with Star India, which has the rights to air the series in the country.\u000a\u000aThe men all worked for Prime Focus Technologies, an independent firm that handles Star India's data, police said.\u000a\u000aAccording to Star India and HBO Europe, neither leak was connected with a cyberattack on HBO last month.\u000a\u000aHBO, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner (TWX), said in late July it was investigating a hack targeting its shows.\u000a\u000aHBO CEO Richard Plepler said at the time that the attack resulted in "some stolen proprietary information, including some of our programming."\u000a\u000aIt's unclear what information the hackers stole. According to Entertainment Weekly, which first reported the attack, hackers published the alleged script to a new "Game of Thrones" show and episodes of two other shows.\u000a\u000aSeason seven is not the first to be blighted by leaks.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.\u000a\u000aI remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.\u000a\u000aThat was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion. On its face, the order was "neutral," authorizing the military to designate whole swaths of land as military zones, and evacuate any persons from it as they saw fit.\u000a\u000aBut behind that facade lay a much darker purpose: to tear 120,000 innocent Japanese-Americans from their homes along the West Coast and relocate them to 10 prison camps scattered throughout the United States.\u000a\u000aIt didn't matter, back then , that most of us were US citizens and had never even been to Japan. We were presumed guilty, and held without charge for four years, simply because we happened to look like the people who had bombed Pearl Harbor. For that crime, we lost our homes, our livelihoods and our freedoms.\u000a\u000aEvery year, on February 19, we Japanese-Americans honor this day as Remembrance Day, and we renew our pledge to make sure what happened to us never happens again in America. I am always amazed, and saddened, that despite our decadeslong efforts, so many young people today are not even aware that such a tragedy and miscarriage of justice took place here.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Portraits from 'a great injustice' In 1943, legendary photographer Ansel Adams took portraits of Japanese-Americans interned at Manzanar Relocation Camp in California. "The purpose of my work was to show how these people, suffering under a great injustice, and loss of property, businesses and professions, had overcome the sense of defeat and despair by building for themselves a vital community in an arid (but magnificent) environment," Adams stated in a letter written when he offered the collection of images to the Library of Congress.

Instead, he suggested that it was a tough call, and that he "would have had to be there" in order to know whether it was the wrong one.\u000a\u000aI cannot help but hear in these words terrible echoes from the past. The internment happened because of three things: fear, prejudice and a failure of political leadership. When the administration targets groups today, whether for exclusion from travel here on the basis of religion and national origin, or for deportation based on their undocumented status, I know from personal experience that these are not done, as they claim, truly in the name of national security.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Reflecting on life in a WWII prison camp (2016) Replay More Videos ...

The most pernicious aspect of Trump's policies is thus the denial of those basic bonds and that humanity. I will not stand for it, and no people of good conscience should.\u000a\u000aThe question before us, then, on Remembrance Day is a simple one: Will America remember? The internment is not a "precedent," it is a stark and painful lesson. We will only learn from the past if we know, understand and remember it. For if we fail, we most assuredly are doomed to repeat it.

I'm just glad I don't have to race him," said the American, the owner of 23 Olympic gold medals.\u000a\u000aPeaty has some way to go to match Phelps' achievements, but the Englishman has made no secret of his desire to be the Phelps of the breaststroke.\u000a\u000aIn the final of the 100 meters in Rio, Peaty won by 1.56 seconds in a race often decided by a fingertip. A mere second separated the remaining seven swimmers in the final.\u000a\u000aFive-time Olympian Mark Foster believes his fellow Briton is so good, he will remain a dominant force in the pool until he decides to hang up his swimming goggles.\u000a\u000a"As long as he stays fit and injury free, I can't see anyone touching him until he retires," Foster told CNN ahead of the FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. "He's that good.\u000a\u000aPeaty set a new world record in a heat of the men's 50m breaststroke Tuesday.\u000a\u000a'A bit of a freak'\u000a\u000aIt was during London 2012 that Peaty and his coach Mel Marshall, who by then had been teaching the swimmer for three years, devised a plan to ensure he would be the best in the world in four years' time.\u000a\u000aFor Foster, he argues the talent was always there but the hard work was the missing ingredient.\u000a\u000a"He's obviously physiologically gifted," adds the former world champion. "He's not a coordinated athlete necessarily, but breaststroke was just what he was born to do and he works incredibly hard at it."\u000a\u000aAt 1.91 meters and with a monstrous wing span, Peaty is the perfect shape for elite breaststroke.\u000a\u000aBut he stands out because of what he does underneath the surface.\u000a\u000aAt major championships, he has grown accustomed to rival coaches following his every stroke from pool side. His body becomes an almost inverted bend from shin and knee, which he calls "a hyperextension of sorts."\u000a\u000aHe jokingly describes himself as "a bit of a freak," but his performances are other worldly and no one has even got within 1.3 seconds of his best 100m time. No small feat in an event which lasts 57 seconds.\u000a\u000aPeaty celebrates winning gold and setting a new world record in the men's 100m breaststroke at Rio 2016.\u000a\u000a'Who works hardest wins'\u000a\u000aPeaty might not have broken his 100m breakstroke world record in Monday's final at the ongoing World Aquatics Championships, but he easily retained his title.\u000a\u000aIn comparing Peaty with Ed Moses -- the 400m hurdler who won 107 consecutive finals between 1987 and 1997 -- Foster prophetically told CNN before the championships: "He'll win and he'll be quick, and he'll continue to make this his event. It's a bit like Ed Moses, really."\u000a\u000aOLYMPIC CHAMPION pic.twitter.com/l4Kjyj0UbE \u2014 Adam Peaty (@adam_peaty) 8 August 2016\u000a\u000aPeaty does not lack confidence but it stops short of arrogance.\u000a\u000a"My coach wouldn't let me get arrogant nor my family -- Mel shoots me down every day," he explains.\u000a\u000aHe likes to downplay his achievements in the pool by saying "I'm no good at anything else," but Britain's first medalist of the Rio Games can also talk for Britain.\u000a\u000aIn the immediate aftermath of Rio -- Team GB's most successful ever Olympics with a total of 67 medals -- people would congregate outside Peaty's family home, hoping to get a glimpse of the world record holder. He has since moved out, having bought a home of his own.\u000a\u000a"The hardest thing was adjusting to what I'd done," he says of the post-Rio haze, in which he took two months off and embraced his penchant for eating burgers.\u000a\u000aBut despite having achieved the long-burning ambition of Olympic gold, he insists he is as motivated as ever.\u000a\u000a"It's who works the hardest that wins," he says, downplaying his natural talent and freakish leg kicks. "You see people fall off after a Games, but that won't be the case for me. I think I can do it again."

aVFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The calamity that has befallen the people of Syria has put the entire world to shame. The image of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi lying facedown on a beach, dead, after his family sought to escape the horrors of their country's civil war , has touched the world. But compassion without action is pointless.\u000a\u000aThousands of refugees are battling European governments. Today, it's Hungary . Last month, it was Macedonia . Desperate people are paying thousands of dollars to traffickers to take them to safety; scores have died of asphyxia after being locked in trucks that failed to reach their destination; thousands have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.\u000a\u000aWe are living in the worst refugee crisis since World War II , and yet the truth is that world leaders have failed to manage the crisis. They will, of course, answer to history. But in the meantime, the situation will only become worse without drastic action: More will die, more refugees will arrive unwanted, more countries will become destabilized and, if this goes on much longer, we will have a generation of Syrians who have grown up in the kind of conditions that perpetuate conflict.\u000a\u000aIt is too late to prevent the current crisis, but there is plenty we can try to do moving forward to try to ease it.\u000a\u000aWhat exactly?\u000a\u000aFor a start, world leaders should convene a top-level emergency gathering to focus on the key aspects of this crisis. The conference should be called by a group of countries, including Germany with strong backing from the United States, and should include the European Union, the United Nations and other world powers, Syria's neighbors, and also Russia and China. The objective should be threefold: to stop the killing, to help the refugees and to bring an end to the war.\u000a\u000aArab nations must play a major role in addressing the Syrian crisis. We are all responsible. But the people of Syria are their neighbors, their brethren. The conflict is in their midst, its impact close to home. To be sure, the neighborhood has not completely failed Syrian refugees. The overwhelming majority of those who have fled Syria -- millions of them -- are now living in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and Arab states have helped finance those costs. But more is needed.\u000a\u000aOnce convened, this international conference should work to develop a comprehensive international plan to help refugees, one that involves a much greater role for Arab and other Muslim states. Indeed, wealthy Gulf states should be encouraged to not just make an outsize financial contribution, but countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia should be pressed to welcome refugees.\u000a\u000aOf course, Europe and the United States should also receive more from among the millions of desperate Syrian refugees fleeing conflict. But so should thriving Muslim states such as Malaysia, Indonesia and of course Iran, whose support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad means it has additional moral responsibility for what is happening. (And speaking of Asia, this could be an opportunity for a country like Japan, with its demographic crisis, to boost its population, or at least do its part to share the burden of this major humanitarian emergency.)\u000a\u000aBut giving refuge to those who are fleeing the horrors of conflict is not enough -- the crisis also needs to be tackled at its source. So, to at least try to slow the killing, it is time to give serious consideration to the establishment of safe zones inside Syria, a proposal that is actually more complicated than it might sound.\u000a\u000aFor example, when Turkey proposed such an approach , some feared that it secretly planned to expel Syrian refugees from Turkish territory and send them back inside Syria to any safe zones. If the system is to work, these zones must come with an ironclad vow from countries hosting refugees not to force anyone to return to Syria before the war is over.\u000a\u000aSafe zones will, of course, require a military commitment to be effective, perhaps from the United States, NATO and other allies, to guarantee the "safe" in "safe zones." They will therefore need to become no-fly zones, with air patrols and anti-aircraft support on the ground. The betrayal of so-called safe areas in Bosnia's Srebrenica must never be allowed to happen again.\u000a\u000aAbove all, though, it is imperative to bring an end to the war, to defeat ISIS and -- just as crucially, although this point now often gets overlooked -- to bring an end to the regime of al-Assad, whose rejection of peaceful demands for democratic reform laid the groundwork for this epic human displacement and for the upsurge in extremism.\u000a\u000aAnd epic this displacement has truly been -- more than 320,000 people have been killed in the war, according to one monitoring group , and there is no end in sight. Before the war started in 2011, about 23 million people lived in Syria. Fully half of them have been displaced. Some 7.5 million are internally displaced . More than 4 million are registered with the United Nations, and many of those fleeing have not been. It is estimated that there are almost 2 million Syrian refugees in Turkey , at least 600,000 in Jordan and perhaps 1.1 million in Lebanon, where they now make up nearly a quarter of the total population.\u000a\u000aSuch an enormous movement of people is further destabilizing an already unsettled region, and bringing with it a level of disruption that could very well sow the seeds for another generation of conflict and extremism.\u000a\u000aThe West's initial approach, which effectively viewed the Syrian civil war as "their problem," has merely underscored how in reality there is no way to contain such conflicts within national boundaries -- this war has spawned ISIS, its videotaped beheadings and sanctioned sexual slavery , scattering its poisonous extremist ideology far and wide. And while an international gathering cannot undo the devastation that has been wrought, it can still be a positive first step toward winding down this conflict.\u000a\u000aThis is the moral and strategic challenge of our time. So far, the world has failed. But if its leaders can begin to publicly and materially empower those who stand for a pluralistic, tolerant and democratic Syria -- one that will eventually welcome back the millions of citizens who have fled -- then we might be able to turn the compassion we have seen in recent days into a more hopeful legacy for the country and its people.

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 20th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Home to a cool 88 million people, the Yangtze River Delta is the most populated region on Earth. In the center of it all is Shanghai -- China's commercial capital and a must-visit destination\u000a\u000aShopping, ancient gardens, temples and dynamic architecture make it one of the most fascinating megacities. But that's not the only reason to go. Shanghai also happens to be an easy jump-off point for more rustic side trips.\u000a\u000aFrom the canals of Shaoxing to Hangzhou's famous West Lake, China's ancient "water towns" and lush tea plantations are just a 20- to 30-minute bullet train ride away. Here are five day trips you'll enjoy:\u000a\u000a1. Hangzhou\u000a\u000aBoating on West Lake in Hangzhou.\u000a\u000aA 45-minute bullet train ride from Shanghai (on a "D" or "G" train), Hangzhou has been praised by poets and explorers alike (including Marco Polo) as one of the most photogenic places in China.\u000a\u000aThe city revolves around West Lake, which is best explored by bike in the morning, when the byways are empty and willow tree-lined causeways are shrouded in ethereal mist. Around the lake, travelers will find dozens of ancient pagodas, gardens, carp ponds, half-moon bridges and temples -- not to mention easy treks through the hillsides.\u000a\u000aThe majority of hotels -- including a Four Seasons Hotel Hangzhou at West Lake and the historic Shangri-La Hotel, Hangzhou -- are along the western shores. Nearby, a cluster of gardens and islands were once part of Emperor Qianlong's holiday palace, back in the 19th century.\u000a\u000aBut the countryside is half the reason to go. Outside of town, travelers can explore the Dragon Well Tea Village for fresh air and Longjing green tea.\u000a\u000a2. Shaoxing\u000a\u000aA fan shop in Shaoxing.\u000a\u000aA 20-minute bullet train ride southeast of Hangzhou will drop travelers in Shaoxing, which -- perhaps optimistically -- has been dubbed the "Venice of Asia." A small city (by China's terms) of 5 million, Shaoxing is best known for its romantic canals and stone bridges.\u000a\u000aMore than 4,000 bridges connect the cityscape and a stroll along the cobbled pathways will take you past traditional white houses with slate-tiled roofs. Shaoxing is also famous for its literary history, once home to Chinese scholar Zhou Enlai and famous writer Lu Xun.\u000a\u000aMost of the action revolves around the eponymous Lu Xun Road pedestrian strip, where travelers can walk through Lu Xun's 19th-century residence.\u000a\u000aThe most charming hotel in Shaoxing is the Xianheng Hotel , which dates back to 1894 -- supposedly opened by the writer's uncle. Here you'll find beautiful lotus ponds, antique furniture and a restaurant serving traditional Shaoxing cuisine. And what exactly is that?\u000a\u000aTravelers will find stinky tofu, braised pork belly and Shaoxing wine (a Chinese rice wine) -- said to be made with special water from the nearby Jianhu-Mirror Lake and then buried underground to mature.\u000a\u000a3. Moganshan\u000a\u000aThe villa at Le Passage Moganshan.\u000a\u000aAbout a 30-minute drive northwest of Hangzhou, or 2.5 hours southwest of Shanghai, the small village of Moganshan is a refuge for nature lovers. Part of the beauty of Moganshan is there's not too much to do, aside from explore the bamboo forests and tea plantations.\u000a\u000aA typical day might include an easy bike ride through the hills, a tea tasting, a bit of lounging by the pool or a zip-line outing at Discovery Adventure Park . While it might feel completely untouched, Moganshan was actually a popular hill station during the 19th and 20th century.\u000a\u000aThis is where Shanghai's foreign expats and politicians (including Chairman Mao) came for cool mountain air during the city's steamy summers. The exclusive nature of Moganshan attracts elite jetsetters who gravitate towards eco-friendly retreats like Naked Stables and Le Passage Mohkan Shan\u000a\u000aOffering an ultra-posh experience, there's also La Residence -- a villa with 30-feet-tall ceilings and eclectic Scandinavian furniture that's been built into the tea hills above sister property Le Passage Mohkan Shan. Costing roughly $28,000 a night, the eight-bedroom villa might be part of the reason the area's been called "The Hamptons of China."\u000a\u000a4. Ningbo\u000a\u000aA view of Xuedou mountain, near Ningbo.\u000a\u000aAn easy drive from Shanghai across the Hangzhou Bay Bridge -- the world's longest trans-oceanic bridge -- Ningbo is a rapidly modernizing city with a long history. Not only is Ningbo home to one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, but it's also one of China's oldest cities.\u000a\u000aDating back to 4800 BCE, Ningbo was an important stop on the Silk Road. Beautifully preserved pagodas and towers can still be seen today, including the Tang Dynasty-era Tianfeng Tower.\u000a\u000aOne of the city's most scenic areas is the centrally located Moon Lake, where travelers will find the Tianyi Pavilion, an ancient library, temple and stunning Chinese pavilions.\u000a\u000aHistory is everywhere, from China's oldest wooden structure -- the Baoguo Temple in the north -- to the Tang Dynasty-era Qita Zen Buddhist Temple downtown.\u000a\u000aThe city has also drawn attention for its exciting architecture, such as the Ningbo History Museum . Designed by Pritzker Prize-winner Wang Shu -- of Amateur Architecture Studio -- the contemporary museum is made of concrete and bamboo, incorporating traditional tiling techniques and handmade bricks that pay homage to demolished houses in China.\u000a\u000a5. Suzhou\u000a\u000aA sightseeing boat sails on a canal in Suzhou.\u000a\u000aAbout a 20-minute train ride west of Shanghai, Suzhou is another beautiful canal city -- split north to south by the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal.\u000a\u000aNearly half of this 2,500-year-old town is covered in water, with rivers and canals dividing the streets into a checkerboard.\u000a\u000aThe romance continues in the cobbled streets and Chinese gardens, of which there are more than 60 scattered about the city. The main sights include the 12.85-acre Humble Administrator's Garden, a World Cultural Heritage site that dates back to 1509. A walk -- or bike ride -- here uncovers lotus pools, poetic temples, bamboo groves and elegant courtyards.\u000a\u000aCome evening, Pingjiang Lu is the best pedestrian street for a stroll past historic white houses and trendy new teahouses. Meanwhile, the Suzhou Silk Museum shows off the city's 4,000-year-old silk-weaving traditions. If you're looking for a souvenir -- this is the place.\u000a\u000aShould time allow, there are few other "water towns" nearby that are worth a visit, including

aVJames A. Gagliano is a CNN law enforcement analyst and a retired FBI supervisory special agent. He also serves as an adjunct assistant professor at St. John's University in Queens, New York. Follow him on Twitter @JamesAGagliano . The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) "Just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions," Chinese military strategist and philosopher Sun Tzu is alleged to have said in the fifth century. His words still resonate some 16 centuries later, as our leaders struggle to adapt to the newest terrorist tactics.\u000a\u000aIn the last two weeks alone, there have been two vehicular attacks: one in Charlottesville, Virginia, allegedly by a young neo-Nazi, and another in Barcelona, Spain, carried out by likely ISIS aspirants.\u000a\u000aAccording to New America, 14 such attacks have occurred in the last three years, resulting in 129 dead . Since the depravity of the July 2016 cargo van attack in Nice, France, which resulted in 86 dead , the frequency of these attacks has increased exponentially.\u000a\u000aModern terrorists, whether white nationalists or radical Islamists, have adapted. And thus, those of us who have been charged with interdicting and mitigating their murderous pursuits must adapt as well. We have heard the old adage --- In law enforcement, we must get it right every time. For the terrorists, they must be right but once.\u000a\u000aSo, what exactly should law enforcement be focused on?\u000a\u000aWell, as with most successful policy strategies, it should coalesce around middle ground ideas that avoid tacking too far left or right of center. Obama State Department spokesperson Marie Harf received criticism in February 2015 for her supposition that, in addition to military action, job creation might be part of the antidote to Islamic State beheadings. And while gainful employment can certainly be a pleasant diversion, it cannot dissuade or prevent those espousing radical ideologies from giving sermons or posting videos online.\u000a\u000aBut President Donald Trump has not helped matters. Just last week, Trump tweeted out a widely discredited urban legend about US Army Gen. John J. Pershing and the execution of extremists in the Philippines during the early 20th century. The implication of his words was clear: A little bit of violence could go a long way in taking care of our terrorist problem.\u000a\u000aNeither of these thoughts will have the desired effect on combating radical ideologies and keeping our nation safer.\u000a\u000aHere's a three-pronged strategy to confront this threat.\u000a\u000aFirst, we must better protect known pedestrian thoroughfares such as Las Ramblas in Barcelona and the Promenade de Anglais in Nice. The counterterrorism method for this would be the placement of concrete bollards to restrict vehicular access. These devices typically consist of steel poles encased in concrete and do not appear to have been in place in either Barcelona or Nice . They are anchored in the ground and spaced far enough apart to allow pedestrian foot traffic, while restricting even the most compact motorized vehicles.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Barcelona's attempt to heal its wounds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Barcelona's attempt to heal its wounds 03:15\u000a\u000aRecently, ISIS and al Qaeda leaders have called for vehicular attacks in the West. To Sun Tzu's point, we must acknowledge the shift in tactics and harden our defenses, a difficult choice in open societies, but a necessary one. 9/11 forever altered our experiences going through security checkpoints at airports. This new threat demands the erection of more physical barriers between pedestrians and motorized traffic.\u000a\u000aOf course, bollards alone are less than perfect means to prevent vehicle assaults unless part of a broader security plan that ensures pedestrian areas are inaccessible to vehicles from any route.\u000a\u000aSecond, the Five Eyes, the alliance of intelligence sharing among five countries bound by a multilateral agreement -- the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and Australia -- must be expanded to include other Western countries engaged in the same existential battle against extremists. The agreement covers human, signal and military intelligence. We must immediately welcome in countries like France and Belgium, which have contributed to military campaigns directed against ISIS, and consider other European nations like Germany and Spain, recent targets of extremist terror plots.\u000a\u000aIt would take nothing more to accomplish this than a high-level directive from the President -- possibly initiated by pressure from the directors of national intelligence and the National Security Agency and the President's national security adviser -- directing his administration to draft a memorandum of understanding between signatory nations that details the requirements for participation and inclusion in the alliance.\u000a\u000aAnd, lastly, we must do a better job of outreach. Any successful counterterrorism strategy must include an outreach to the good and decent members of any community that has extremists in its midst.\u000a\u000aWhether it is the parents of a fledgling neo-Nazi infatuated with Hitler or the family of a young Muslim smitten with the online speeches of Anwar al-Awlaki , the radicalized American imam whose fiery rhetoric called for jihad against the United States, law enforcement must create an environment that encourages folks to come forward and report someone enamored with hateful ideologies. Too often we see that these infatuations result in predictable future violence.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThe FBI I served for 25 years has worked earnestly to ensure a proper climate to inspire cooperation from Americans of every faith and political orthodoxy. Going back as far as the 1964 Mississippi Burning murders of three civil rights workers -- Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner -- the FBI was the law enforcement agency that first bridged the gap between communities of color and the government that was supposed to protect and defend them. Though the FBI did not always succeed, it initiated community engagement long before local police departments in rural areas had conceived of such programs.\u000a\u000aAnd, today, many FBI field offices include outreach programs to connect with local communities of every faith.\u000a\u000aUltimately, to protect our citizens, we will also need bipartisan legislative efforts and strong moral leadership from the White House. But for now we can settle for the development of strong relations between law enforcement and the communities they're sworn to protect and serve.

aV(CNN) An Olympic flag for refugees and a knitted hat worn in protest against Donald Trump have been named among the year's best designs.\u000a\u000aThey join 60 others nominees in a politically charged shortlist for the prestigious Beazley Designs of the Year 2017, announced today by the Design Museum in London.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of the UK's decision to withdraw of the European Union, these postcards were designed for those hoping to maintain connections between Britain to Europe.\u000a\u000aNow in its 10th year, the awards span six design categories: products, transport, graphics, fashion, digital and architecture. Previous winners include the iconic Barack Obama "Hope" poster and the torch used in the London 2012 Olympics.\u000a\u000aBut while the awards program often reflects current affairs, this year's shortlist tackles some unusually heavy topics, according to Glenn Adamson, curator of an accompanying exhibition at the Design Museum.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot of very tough stuff in there. It feels like there's a particular weight on this year's exhibition," Adamson said in a phone interview. "But it's great to show how design can make a difference."\u000a\u000aSign of the times\u000a\u000aDesigned in reaction to Trump presidency, the pussyhat became a regular fixture at women's rights marches last year.\u000a\u000aReflecting a turbulent year in world politics, the latest nominees include an anti-Brexit poster campaign, a lending library for protest banners and the "pussyhat," a pink knitted hat designed in response to Donald Trump's comments about women.\u000a\u000aAfter last year's top prize went to a flat-pack refugee shelter by Ikea , designs addressing the global migrant crisis again feature on the shortlist. Nominees include another temporary housing project, as well as a rescue drone and a flag used by the Refugee Olympic Team\u000a\u000a"The flag is a very powerful image because (its Syrian designer) Yara Said was herself displaced and had come to Europe on a boat," Adamson said, explaining how the orange life vest inspired the flag's coloring.\u000a\u000a"Now you have the flag being manufactured by refugees, which provides them with employment. So it's a topical design that is representative of the times."\u000a\u000aDesigned by Syrian refugee Yara Said.\u000a\u000aThe shortlist also features some less political -- though perhaps no less notable -- examples of groundbreaking design. Pokemon Go, Nike's sporting hijab and the world's first 3D-printed self-driving bus have all made the shortlist.\u000a\u000aThe nominees will be on show at the Design Museum from Oct.18, with the winners announced on Jan. 25, 2018.

aV(CNN) The Trump administration has halted a study of the health effects of a common mining technique in Appalachia, which is believed to deposit waste containing toxic minerals in ground waters.\u000a\u000a"The Trump Administration is dedicated to responsibly using taxpayer dollars and that includes the billions of dollars in grants that are doled out every year by the Department of the Interior," the statement said.\u000a\u000aStill, the National Academies -- a nongovernmental institution that researches and advises the government on science and technology -- plans to move forward with part of the research, and will hold previously scheduled public meetings this week in Kentucky, the Academies said in a statement\u000a\u000aPolitical reaction was swift to the Trump administration's decision to suspend the study of "the potential relationship between increased health risks and living in proximity to sites that have been or are being mined or reclaimed for surface coal deposits," which began last year and was expected to take two years to complete.\u000a\u000a"Mountaintop removal mining has been shown to cause lung cancer, heart disease, and other medical problems," Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, the ranking democrat on the House Committee of Natural Resources, said in a statement\u000a\u000a"Clearly this administration and the Republican Party are trying to stop the National Academy of Sciences from uncovering exactly how harmful this practice is," Grijalva said.\u000a\u000a"It's infuriating that Trump would halt this study on the health effects of mountaintop removal coal mining, research that people in Appalachia have been demanding for years," said Bill Price, Senior Appalachia Organizing Representative for environmental advocacy group Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign.\u000a\u000aA growing controversy\u000a\u000aScientists estimate that mountaintop removal mining, a form of surface mining, has occurred on at least 500 Appalachian mountaintops. It became popular in the late 1960s as a way of harvesting coal deposits too thin to work from a coal mine.\u000a\u000aIn this form of mining, the land is first cleared of forests and vegetation, then explosives are used to break up the first layer of rock into smaller pieces known as "spoil."\u000a\u000a2010 Government Accountability Office report , apparently the most recent available on the subject, showed that in 2008, West Virginia produced 69 million tons of coal from surface mining. Kentucky produced 51 million tons, while Virginia and Tennessee followed with 9 million and 2 million, respectively.\u000a\u000aThat soil and rock mixture is supposed to be returned to the land after mining is complete, but often is placed as fill in nearby valleys, which can also block headwaters of streams. In addition, when the mined coal is cleaned, a "slurry" of toxic hard metals such as lead, arsenic, manganese, sodium, and sulfate is produced that makes its way into local streams and ground wells. It's that toxic mixture that is believed to be linked to various health problems in the local Appalachian communities.\u000a\u000aOne study linked mountaintop mining to increased lung and kidney disease rates, as well as elevated death rates in surrounding communities. Another found an increase in birth defects.\u000a\u000a"Stopping this study is a ploy to stop science in its tracks and keep the public in the dark about health risks as a favor to the mining industry, pure and simple," Grijalva said. "Every time some reckless industry hurts working people, this administration is there to provide political cover."\u000a\u000aThe National Academies statement said that the group's hope is that the Trump administration will resume the study.\u000a\u000a"The National Academies believes this is an important study and we stand ready to resume it as soon as the Department of the Interior review is completed," the statement said. "We are grateful to our committee members for their dedication to carrying forward with this study."

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge impact on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000a(CNN) tl;dr version : You can vote on the first story I'll report as part of this new series on 2 degrees Celsius -- which is the agreed-upon threshold for dangerous climate change. Go here if you don't see the poll . Thanks!\u000a\u000a* * * * *\u000a\u000aIn 2013, I did something that's a little scary for a journalist.\u000a\u000aI asked you to tell me what to cover.\u000a\u000aThose experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of democratic journalism. Editors shouldn't get all the control. You, the audience, have a vital say, too.\u000a\u000aStill, in the two years since I asked for your ideas, I haven't done much, if anything, to address one of the topics you most frequently asked me to cover : climate change.\u000a\u000aI'm hoping to make good on your request now.\u000a\u000aStarting today, Earth Day, I'm planning to spend the rest of the year writing about one tiny little number -- 2 degrees. It may be the most important number you've never heard of.\u000a\u000aMaybe that plan sounds excessive.\u000a\u000a(Eight months reporting on one number!?)\u000a\u000aBut here's why it matters: If we humans warm the world more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), we greatly up the odds of climate catastrophes.\u000a\u000aThink super droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions and acidifying oceans.\u000a\u000aWe don't want to cross that mark.\u000a\u000aHumans never have lived in post-2-degree world, said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, based in Germany, and author of a paper on this history of 2 degrees.\u000a\u000a"If we start warming the planet way beyond what humans have ever experienced, God knows what will wait for us," he told me.\u000a\u000aGood news, though. If we drastically cut carbon emissions, we can stay below the 2-degree threshold. As part of this series, I'll be exploring exactly what it would take to do so.\u000a\u000aThis matters a great deal this year, since the United Nations will gather leaders and policy experts in Paris in December to try to hammer out a new international agreement on climate change. Two degrees will be one useful benchmark to see if the world is on track.\u000a\u000a"It's almost kind of like a truth keeping mechanism," said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute. "It would be hard if it didn't exist to have a sense of whether countries are on track or not."\u000a\u000aIt's not a perfect yardstick. But it's a reasonable one. Think of it like a speed limit, said Jaeger, the economist in Germany. Would a 51 mph limit be better than 50? Or maybe it should be 49? The point isn't the exact number, it's the ballpark: 200 mph would certainly be too fast, as he put it, but 20 mph is too slow.\u000a\u000aFor climate change, the point is we don't know the world will fall into crisis at exactly 2 degrees and not 2.1 or 1.8. But that range is certainly dangerous.\u000a\u000a"The way I think of it is like smoking," said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech. "How many cigarettes are too many? I don't know. I have no idea. Nobody has any idea. But we do know the more cigarettes you smoke, the greater the risk."\u000a\u000aTwo degrees, then, is our most educated estimate. A way to focus attention.\u000a\u000aIt's incredibly valuable in that respect.\u000a\u000aSince the number emerged from a relatively obscure academic paper in the 1970s, it's become widely agreed upon in the international community. In 2009, for example, 114 countries initially signed onto the "Copenhagen Accord," a nonbinding agreement that recognizes the "scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius."\u000a\u000aThat level of consensus is rare on this topic.\u000a\u000a"If there's one thing the world has agreed upon about climate change it's 2 degrees should be the benchmark," said Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org , an advocacy group.\u000a\u000aI'll be writing more about the origins of 2 degrees soon -- where this number came from (one guy, turns out, and I chatted with him), how soon we may cross that mark if we don't take action (short answer: 2050), and how much we've warmed the planet since the start of the industrial revolution, in the late 1800s, which is how these temperature increases are usually measured (0.85 degrees).\u000a\u000aRight now, though, I'd like to ask you to do something that's scary and exciting.\u000a\u000aI want you to vote on the first project I'll report for this series.\u000a\u000aAll of the options center on one theme: What does a post-2-degree world look like?\u000a\u000aI love that question because it -- like all six choices you'll see below -- came from you.\u000a\u000aCNN hosted a Facebook chat on Friday , asking our audience to come up with questions for me about climate change or about 2 degrees of warming. Many of you said you wanted to know what a 2-degree world would have in store, in general. Other folks asked about specific impacts to people and ecosystems if the climate continues to inch toward that dangerous 2-degree mark.\u000a\u000aClay Miller, from Alaska, for example, asked about the Arctic.\u000a\u000aCindy Johnson wanted to know which animals would go extinct first.\u000a\u000aJon Locke was among those curious about farms.\u000a\u000aAnd many of you, including Kayla Helton, from Florida, asked about rising seas. Kelly, a 48-year-old from California, wanted to know what would happen to "climate refugees" as the coast vanishes.\u000a\u000aTell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees Posted by CNN on Tuesday, April 21, 2015\u000a\u000aThe topic with the most votes on Monday at 5 p.m. ET is the one I'll report in May.\u000a\u000aLook for more votes like this in the future as we explore this number together.\u000a\u000aIf you'd like to follow along, consider subscribing to my "2-degree" newsletter\u000a\u000asocial Or you can track me down on the usual networks , including Snapchat.\u000a\u000aI'm @jdsutter on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\u000a\u000aI think of this kind of like non-fiction improv: You throw out the prompts, and I'll go out there looking for the most interesting and informative story.

aVIf you think it's the flames or the heat, that's understandable: those are dangerous, too. But both from a victim's and a firefighter's perspective, the deadliest enemy is smoke.\u000a\u000aSmoke causes more fire deaths than flames, according to the National Fire Protection Association , because people are incapacitated by fumes so quickly that they can't get to safety.\u000a\u000aAnd it leaves firefighters blind, because it's impossible to see anything in a smoke-filled room.\u000a\u000aThat's why firefighting teams use special cameras that allow them to see through the smoke, rendering images based on heat rather than light.\u000a\u000aThey've been around for decades, but they've always had one crucial flaw.\u000a\u000aSee-through\u000a\u000aHumans lose consciousness when oxygen concentration drops below 9 percent, but start losing judgment and coordination at around 17 percent, a whiff below the normal amount in breathable air of 21 percent.\u000a\u000aIn a building on fire, that means smoke can often hide unconscious or disorientated victims. To be able to spot them -- and also see danger areas by gauging heat levels -- rescue teams must be equipped with thermal imaging cameras, which show heat in brighter colors over darker backgrounds.\u000a\u000aBut here's the problem: "Conventional systems require you to hold the camera, so you can look into the screen - but for firefighters to not have a free hand in a dangerous environment is not ideal," said Graham Wilson, director at Design Reality, His UK-based company was tasked by firefighting equipment manufacturer Scott Safety to create a product that could address this specific concern.\u000a\u000aHands-free\u000a\u000aScott's idea was to integrate the thermal camera into the mask all firemen already use, the respirator. It has multiple functions, but primarily it protects from particles and smoke.\u000a\u000aThe new camera, called Sight, is small and -- at around 8 ounces -- light enough to not add significantly to the heft of the mask. But it projects a small thermal image inside the mask, at nine frames per second. Further settings can be easily configured through a smartphone app.\u000a\u000aSince it is mounted on an essential piece of equipment, every member of a rescue team gets one, which it's hoped will increase safety as it means firemen can see for themselves, rather than rely on voice indications from a team leader wielding the camera.\u000a\u000aAccording to its makers, it's the first of its kind in production: "But in the industry the idea is not that novel, because everyone has wanted it for so long," said Wilson. "The challenge was to turn it into a product."\u000a\u000aAnother challenge was to not bog down the mask itself: "It was tricky to fit new tech into an existing mask, because we can't afford to lose any performance on the respirator -- it has standards we need to respect," said Wilson.\u000a\u000aThe solution? No cables: the camera sends information to the in-mask display system wirelessly, so there's no need to penetrate the mask with a cable, which would limit the field of vision.\u000a\u000aLife-saving\u000a\u000aFrom the conceptual stage, Sight was developed in collaboration with actual firefighters, who were engaged in tests and training sessions: "The key tell to whether this was gonna do well," said Wilson, "Was when it was launched and firemen were coming up to our stands at conventions to say 'Hallelujah, we've been wanting this for so long!'"\u000a\u000aCompared to traditional hand-held cameras, which can cost thousands of dollars, the Sight is also more affordable: it retails for around $1,500 inclusive of the mask.\u000a\u000aBut Wilson believes the real selling point is elsewhere. "This product is going to save lives," he said. "What more could you want?"

aVText by Karla Cripps and Taehoon Lee. Video by David Hawley, edited by Diana Diroy, CNN \u2022 Updated 25th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Think latte art's a tired trend?\u000a\u000aYou haven't seen the coffees created by South Korean barista Lee Gang-bin, co-owner of Café C.THROUGH in Seoul\u000a\u000aUsing colored icing -- a technique he calls "cream art" -- Lee transforms regular cups of coffee into incredible works of art.\u000a\u000a"Coffee is a fairytale to me," he tells CNN. "It helps me express exactly what I want and brings my dreams to life. People who specialize in latte art usually only use two colors: black and white. But I wanted to break that color limit."\u000a\u000aSouth Korean barista Lee Gang-bin, owner of Seoul's Café C.THROUGH, transforms regular cups of coffee into incredible works of art.\u000a\u000aHis wild creations have earned him nearly 200,000 Instagram followers.\u000a\u000aThough his renditions of major artworks are the most popular -- including Van Gogh's "The Starry Night," Edvard Munch's "The Scream" and Leonardo DiVinci's "Mona Lisa" -- he does custom work for customers as well.\u000a\u000aRequests include everything from storybook characters, such as the Little Prince, to a Vogue Korea magazine cover. But no matter the design, Lee says it's important that his works of art can actually be consumed.\u000a\u000a"It is my rule to not make coffee that people cannot drink," he says. "I only make cream art on cold coffee. If I make it on hot coffee, the taste changes as it cools off, and I don't want the taste of the coffee to change."\u000a\u000aThe cost of each cream art coffee is 7,500 won ($6.63). Because each cup can take as long as an hour to whip up, he only makes three a day, by reservation only.\u000a\u000aThe teddy bear cream art coffee is the exception, as it can be made in just 40 seconds. C.THROUGH's menu has other, more traditional items for walk-in customers as well.\u000a\u000a"We are baristas making coffee, not just artists drawing pictures on coffee," he says.\u000a\u000aNot just a 'coffee guy'\u000a\u000aLee has been making coffee for 10 years, branching into latte art seven years ago.\u000a\u000a"I started to learn about coffee when I was 18 years old," he says. "At that time, baristas were not well-known in Korea so I worried a little bit. Soon this worry went away as I became so interested in the job."\u000a\u000aHe says it's helped that he's always had the support of his parents.\u000a\u000a"People around me were critical of me becoming just a 'coffee guy,'" says Lee. "But I stuck to my decision, just like many Koreans. I wanted to show that I could become successful with coffee."\u000a\u000aToday, his cafe is so busy he says he sleeps only a couple of hours a night. The key to his success, he says, is passion and perseverance.\u000a\u000a"I didn't study drawing but enjoyed it as a hobby," says Lee. "Then after studying coffee, I realized that not only techniques but also artistry can be put into coffee. This led me to connect coffee and art."\u000a\u000aWith the success of the cafe, he says they're able to export a new side of South Korean culture to the world.\u000a\u000a"South Korea has become very famous in recent years due to K-pop," says Lee. "Yet few people know about Korea's coffee culture. Some may think coffee is just coffee. But for me it is a bridge that can always connect one person to another."

aVThis feature is part of CNN Parallels , an interactive series exploring ways you can improve your health by making small changes to your daily habits.\u000a\u000aDepending on our age, we are supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night.\u000a\u000aBut according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a third of us get fewer than seven hours of sleep per night. In addition, 50 million to 70 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia and restless leg syndrome, which can ruin a good night's shuteye.\u000a\u000aAnd we're not alone. In bedrooms around the globe, men, women and children are tossing and turning. According to World Sleep Day statistics , sleep deprivation is threatening the health of up to 45% of the world's population.\u000a\u000aRisking life and money\u000a\u000aScience has linked poor slumber with high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, weight gain, a lack of libido, mood swings, paranoia, depression and a higher risk of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia and some cancers.\u000a\u000aCar crashes, industrial disasters, and medical and occupational errors also increase as we tire, not to mention a decrease in work productivity and efficiency.\u000a\u000astudy by RAND Europe found that the United States loses an estimated $411 billion each year from workers who sleep fewer than six hours a night. That's about 2.28% of US gross domestic product. Japan comes next, with $138 billion, or 2.92% of GDP, followed by Germany ($60 billion; 1.56% of GDP) and the United Kingdom ($50 billion; 1.86% of GDP).\u000a\u000aBut guess what would happen if those same people added an hour of pillow time? The US could add $226.4 billion back to the economy, the study said, and Japan would recover $75.7 billion, while Germany and the UK would be blessed with an additional $34.1 and $29.9 billion.\u000a\u000aConsequences on your body\u000a\u000aExactly how does a lack of sleep affect the body? There are the obvious signs: irritation, moodiness, dull reflexes and a fuzzy mind. As you can imagine, how those continue to affect us depends on whether the deprivation is short-lived or long-term and chronic.\u000a\u000aWeakened reflexes\u000a\u000aStudies show that after 17 to 19 hours without sleep, you'll be functioning as if you've been drinking enough to raise your blood alcohol concentration to 0.05%. Skip a full 20 to 25 hours of sleep, and you'll soon be at 0.1% -- well over the US legal driving limit of 0.08.\u000a\u000aIn other words, a lack of sleep for one night can impair your reflexes and decision-making to the same extent as being over the limit.\u000a\u000aBut sleeping less than the recommended amount on a regular basis can be almost as bad. A lab-based sleep study found that people who were sleeping fewer than six hours a night for two weeks -- and who thought they were doing just fine -- functioned as badly on cognitive and reflex tests as people who were deprived of sleep for two full nights.\u000a\u000aThis is evident in traffic statistics. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that at least 100,000 accidents reported to US police are the result of drowsy driving. This results in an estimated 1,550 deaths, 71,000 injuries and $12.5 billion in monetary losses, according to the National Sleep Foundation.\u000a\u000aAn unfocused mind\u000a\u000aWhile you sleep, your brain is busy. It's preparing for the next day, sorting your experiences and making new pathways for learning.\u000a\u000aTo capture newly acquired information, absorb fresh skills and form key memories -- as well as to retrieve them later -- you need plenty of sleep time to let your brain do its work. A lack of sleep therefore impacts your ability to pay attention, learn new things, be creative, solve problems and make decisions.\u000a\u000aA chronic lack of sleep is also closely tied to anxiety and depression, as the body struggles to cope with the stress of sleepiness.\u000a\u000aSome studies have found a connection between sleep apnea , a disorder with which you actually stop breathing for up to a minute, and cognitive impairment, and insomnia has been associated with reduced brain size.\u000a\u000aThere's even growing evidence that poor sleep early in life can lead to the development of the plaques and tangles that cause Alzheimer's and other kinds of dementia.\u000a\u000astudy published this month in the journal Brain found that healthy middle-age adults who slept badly for just one night produced an abundance of the protein beta amyloid, responsible for the plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's. A week of disrupted sleep upped the amount of tau, another protein responsible for the tangles associated with Alzheimer's, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease.\u000a\u000aIf that's not enough, a study in mice by the University of Pennsylvania found that prolonged periods without sleep actually killed brain cells.\u000a\u000aContinued sleep deprivation can also lead to wide swings in mood, increasing paranoia and even hallucinations. The chronically sleep-starved will also become less able to tolerate pain and resist coercion, which makes it one of the military's favorite tools for torture\u000a\u000aPoor repairs\u000a\u000aDeep sleep, the kind that comes only after a full cycle, is necessary for the body to release hormones designed to repair cells and build tissue in the body and brain, especially in children and teens.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, although preteens and teens need the most sleep of any age group -- at least nine hours a night -- they are the least likely to get enough rest.\u000a\u000aEarly start times for school, combined with today's technology lures, high stress levels and late-to-bed habits, are creating a nation of sleep-starved youngsters. Over 90% of US high school students are chronically sleep-deprived, with 20% getting fewer than five hours a night, according to a Sleep in America pol l.\u000a\u000aAccording to a study from the CDC, this sets teens up to engage in more risky behavior, such as drinking or texting while driving or not wearing a seat belt or helmet, compared with those who get at least nine hours a night. Previous studies on teen sleep found that fewer than eight hours a night was also associated with obesity, migraines, substance abuse, lack of exercise, sexual activity, feelings of depression and thoughts of suicide.\u000a\u000aThe teen sleep problem is so bad that in 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement asking schools across the country to delay the start of middle and high school to no earlier than 8:30 a.m. Even though some schools are heeding that call, the advocacy group Start School Later says that more than four in five start classes earlier than the recommended time.\u000a\u000aWeight gain\u000a\u000aStudies show that poor sleep leads to an increase in hunger and weight gain. That's partly due to the connection between sleep and the peptides that regulate your appetite: ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin, which makes you hungry, goes up when you don't get enough sleep. At the same time, leptin, which sends "full" signals to the brain, decreases.\u000a\u000aA lack of sleep is known to increase stress, which pumps up the body's primary stress hormone, cortisol.\u000a\u000aAmong other things, cortisol helps control blood sugar levels and regulates metabolism. During times of stress, the increased cortisol causes higher insulin levels, which in turn drops your blood sugar and results in cravings for fatty, sugar-filled foods.\u000a\u000aShorter, unhealthier lifespan\u000a\u000aGetting less than the recommended amount of sleep each night on a regular basis raises your risk of dying. In a longitudinal study of 10,308 British civil servants published in 2007, researchers found that those who reduced their sleep from seven to five hours or fewer a night were almost twice as likely to die from all causes, especially cardiovascular disease.\u000a\u000aHere's the worst news: As you head toward death, your chances of developing a major disease or medical condition are also much higher if you don't get enough sleep. That's because during sleep, your body is literally repairing and restoring itself on a cellular level.\u000a\u000aStudies show a significant association between a lack of sleep and cardiovascular disease. Weight gain can lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Your immune system takes a hit, making you more vulnerable to colds, flu and all sort of viruses and other infectious diseases.\u000a\u000aIt may even mess with your genes. A small study of 15 men looked at the impact of sleep deprivation on "clock genes" that regulate circadian rhythm. They found that the loss of a single night's sleep could alter those genes in key metabolic tissues. Whether that change is permanent is unknown.\u000a\u000aChanging your sleep habits\u000a\u000aThe good news is that you can do something about your sleep deficit.\u000a\u000aYou can train your brain to seek better sleep just as you train it to learn and accomplish other skills. One of the first tasks is to set up your sleep environment and establish a relaxing bedtime routine. It's that repetition that will train your brain to recognize that its time to relax and sleep.\u000a\u000aCool temperatures\u000a\u000aStart with the bedroom. Make sure your bed and pillows are comfortable and the room is cool: Between 60 and 67 degrees is best. Don't watch TV or work in your bedroom; you want your brain to think of the room as only for sleep.\u000a\u000aMood lighting\u000a\u000aBe sure to eliminate all bright lights, as even the blue light of cellphones or laptops can be disruptive. If that's hard to accomplish, think about using eye shades and blackout curtains to keep the room dark.\u000a\u000aTry to eliminate disturbing sounds as well. Earplugs or white noise machines can be very helpful, but you can create your own with a humidifier or fan.\u000a\u000aDuring the day, try to get good exposure to natural light, as that will help regulate your circadian rhythm.\u000a\u000aDevelop a routine\u000a\u000aThen, establish a bedtime routine you can follow each night. Taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, listening to soothing music, meditating or doing light stretches are all good options.\u000a\u000aFood and drink to avoid\u000a\u000aOther suggestions for good sleep include avoiding stimulants such as nicotine or coffee after midafternoon, especially if you have insomnia. Alcohol is another no-no. You may think it helps you doze off, but you are more likely to wake in the night as your body begins to process the spirits.\u000a\u000aTell us your story Tell us your story\u000a\u000aWe love to hear from our audience. Follow @CNNHealth on Twitter and Facebook for the latest health news and let us know what we're missing.\u000a\u000aAlso avoid rich, fatty foods just before sleep. If you have any digestive issues, eating fried or fatty foods, spicy meals, some citrus and even carbonated drinks can trigger heartburn and indigestion.\u000a\u000aGet moving\u000a\u000aExercise is key to promoting good sleep. According to the National Sleep Foundation, as little as 10 minutes a day of walking, biking or other aerobic exercise can "drastically improve nighttime sleep quality."\u000a\u000aFollow all these steps, and you'll be well on your way to closing your sleep deficit and improving your health.

aV(CNN) Bold, disruptive and totally unapologetic, a new Nigerian online magazine 'A Nasty Boy,' is set to ruffle a few feathers.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes our visual content will not be safe for the workplace... we won't make it any easier for you with our provocative editorials and swear words; take it in good spirits," read's the magazine's disclaimer.\u000a\u000aThe magazine is filled with provocative images, featuring nude models, articles contain swear words and avant-garde ideas.\u000a\u000aIn Nigeria, a conservative country, where public expressions of nudity are uncommon, 'A Nasty Boy' is unsurprisingly causing controversy.\u000a\u000aBut for editor Richard Akuson, the publication is sending out a clear message: he's not interested in fitting the status quo.\u000a\u000a'There has to be room for people that don't fit in'\u000a\u000aGrowing up, Akuson says he was bullied for being different.\u000a\u000a"I was always called a boy-girl," Akuson told CNN.\u000a\u000a"In university, I was called a yansh man which means a guy with a big butt...my classmates thought I was too polite, in their words too polished and that was not the way guys were meant to be."\u000a\u000aIt was this idea, that a man or woman is meant to behave in a particular way, that Akuson sought to challenge through 'A Nasty Boy.'\u000a\u000aPhotos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson In his editorial 'Boys' Richard Akuson hopes to challenge the concept of Nigerian masculinity. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson Taken by Photographer Zamani Istifanus, they put together three muscular male models who are completely naked. Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson With the photos, Akuson challenges the perceived notion of strangeness that comes with men being naked around one another. Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson After publishing the photos on his website , he decided to post on his personal Instagram page and observed a certain hesitation to like his photos despite analytics revealing a wide reach. Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson "I could see a fear to associate with an editorial like that." Akuson says. "If a friend sees someone looking at a post like that, there would be questions. They might have liked it but didn't have the confidence to show that openly." Hide Caption 5 of 5\u000a\u000a"There cannot be one singular kind of Nigerian man or woman, there has to be room for other definitions that don't necessarily fit that opinion," he adds.\u000a\u000aAkuson had previously launched three other publications but says none of them felt right, he was pushed to publish 'A Nasty Boy,' after a run in with internet trolls.\u000a\u000aCelebrating 'otherness'\u000a\u000a"I once did a story on EJ Johnson... and how I felt his wardrobe could inspire, but the conversation in the comment section completely moved from the subject matter to me. 'Why are you always interested in stories like this?; and some responses were 'Oh you know Richard is gay'"\u000a\u000a"That was the awakening for me," he said. "And from that morning I knew I would start 'A Nasty Boy.'"\u000a\u000aAkuson says after his experience he knew the time had come for a platform that allowed for self-expression and shape-shifting ideas and explored "otherness in fashion, people and culture."\u000a\u000a"There are people who do not fit the status quo but are however very Nigerian," he explains. "We should hear their stories and also celebrate them."\u000a\u000a'Fear of association'\u000a\u000aWhile the public is slowly warming up to his publication, there is still fear and hesitation to be publicly associated with the magazine Akuson claims.\u000a\u000aA large chunk of the magazine's readership resides in Nigeria, Akuson notes that the number isn't reflected in their social engagement. He feels it's because people are still weary to be publicly associated with subject matter that could be considered taboo.\u000a\u000aIn an photo editorial called 'Boys', Akuson tried to challenged the perceived notion of strangeness surrounding men being naked around one another. After it was published, he observed something unusual.\u000a\u000a"I could see from my analytics that the photo had been seen many times but the engagement was not as much. Then I got messages and calls from people who thought it was impressive work and I asked, 'why didn't you leave a comment?'"\u000a\u000aFunding also poses a huge problem for his ambitious publication with potential investors questioning its importance.\u000a\u000a"We have met people who just say outright that this is not a necessary publication, it could be something else, and it doesn't have to be this. They don't understand why it's necessary."\u000a\u000aBold and unapologetic\u000a\u000aBut Akuson does, and is driven by the effect the magazine has on people who connect to the message and need to celebrate difference.\u000a\u000aAkuson shares the story of a photographer who collaborated with him on an editorial, whose father broke his camera because he found photos of naked men on it. The incident prompted the photographer to give up on photography, but seeing his work in 'A Nasty Boy' feature on a British website lit his fire again.\u000a\u000aFinancial setbacks and going against the grain of Nigeria's conservative principle aside, Akuson's focus is in one direction and he is doing it boldly, and unapologetically.

aVAnyone who knows me also knows that I have a huge sweet tooth. I always have.\u000a\u000aMy friend and fellow graduate student Andrew is equally afflicted, and living in Hershey, Pennsylvania -- the "Chocolate Capital of the World" -- doesn't help either of us.\u000a\u000aBut Andrew is braver than I am. Last year, he gave up sweets for Lent. I can't say that I'm following in his footsteps this year, but if you are abstaining from sweets for Lent this year, here's what you can expect over the next 40 days.\u000a\u000aSugar: natural reward, unnatural fix\u000a\u000aIn neuroscience, food is something we call a "natural reward." In order for us to survive as a species, things like eating, having sex and nurturing others must be pleasurable to the brain so that these behaviors are reinforced and repeated.\u000a\u000aEvolution has resulted in the mesolimbic pathway , a brain system that deciphers these natural rewards for us. When we do something pleasurable, a bundle of neurons called the ventral tegmental area uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to signal to a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens.\u000a\u000aThe connection between the nucleus accumbens and our prefrontal cortex dictates our motor movement, such as deciding whether or not to taking another bite of that delicious chocolate cake. The prefrontal cortex also activates hormones that tell our body: "Hey, this cake is really good. And I'm going to remember that for the future."\u000a\u000aNot all foods are equally rewarding, of course. Most of us prefer sweets over sour and bitter foods because, evolutionarily, our mesolimbic pathway reinforces that sweet things provide a healthy source of carbohydrates for our bodies. When our ancestors went scavenging for berries, for example, sour meant "not yet ripe," while bitter meant "alert -- poison!"\u000a\u000aFruit is one thing, but modern diets have taken on a life of their own. A decade ago, it was estimated that the average American consumed 22 teaspoons of added sugar per day, amounting to an extra 350 calories; it may well have risen since then. A few months ago, one expert suggested that the average Briton consumes 238 teaspoons of sugar each week.\u000a\u000aToday, with convenience more important than ever in our food selections, it's almost impossible to come across processed and prepared foods that don't have added sugars for flavour, preservation, or both.\u000a\u000aThese added sugars are sneaky -- and unbeknown to many of us, we've become hooked. In ways that drugs of abuse -- such as nicotine, cocaine and heroin -- hijack the brain's reward pathway and make users dependent, increasing neuro-chemical and behavioural evidence suggests that sugar is addictive in the same way, too.\u000a\u000aSugar addiction is real\u000a\u000a"The first few days are a little rough," Andrew told me about his sugar-free adventure last year. "It almost feels like you're detoxing from drugs. I found myself eating a lot of carbs to compensate for the lack of sugar."\u000a\u000aThere are four major components of addiction: bingeing, withdrawal, craving, and cross-sensitisation (the notion that one addictive substance predisposes someone to becoming addicted to another). All of these components have been observed in animal models of addiction -- for sugar, as well as drugs of abuse.\u000a\u000aA typical experiment goes like this: rats are deprived of food for 12 hours each day, then given 12 hours of access to a sugary solution and regular chow.\u000a\u000aAfter a month of following this daily pattern, rats display behaviours similar to those on drugs of abuse. They'll binge on the sugar solution in a short period of time, much more than their regular food. They also show signs of anxiety and depression during the food deprivation period.\u000a\u000aMany sugar-treated rats who are later exposed to drugs, such as cocaine and opiates , demonstrate dependent behaviors towards the drugs compared to rats who did not consume sugar beforehand.\u000a\u000aLike drugs, sugar spikes dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Over the long term, regular sugar consumption actually changes the gene expression and availability of dopamine receptors in both the midbrain and frontal cortex\u000a\u000aSpecifically, sugar increases the concentration of a type of excitatory receptor called D1, but decreases another receptor type called D2, which is inhibitory.\u000a\u000aRegular sugar consumption also inhibits the action of the dopamine transporter , a protein which pumps dopamine out of the synapse and back into the neuron after firing.\u000a\u000aIn short, this means that repeated access to sugar over time leads to prolonged dopamine signalling, greater excitation of the brain's reward pathways and a need for even more sugar to activate all of the midbrain dopamine receptors like before. The brain becomes tolerant to sugar -- and more is needed to attain the same "sugar high."\u000a\u000aSugar withdrawal is also real\u000a\u000aAlthough these studies were conducted in rodents, it's not far-fetched to say that the same primitive processes are occurring in the human brain, too. "The cravings never stopped, [but that was] probably psychological," Andrew told me. "But it got easier after the first week or so."\u000a\u000aIn a 2002 study by Carlo Colantuoni and colleagues of Princeton University, rats who had undergone a typical sugar dependence protocol then underwent "sugar withdrawal." This was facilitated by either food deprivation or treatment with naloxone, a drug used for treating opiate addiction which binds to receptors in the brain's reward system.\u000a\u000aBoth withdrawal methods led to physical problems, including teeth chattering, paw tremors, and head shaking. Naloxone treatment also appeared to make the rats more anxious, as they spent less time on an elevated apparatus that lacked walls on either side.\u000a\u000aSimilar withdrawal experiments by others also report behaviour similar to depression in tasks such as the forced swim test. Rats in sugar withdrawal are more likely to show passive behaviours (like floating) than active behaviours (like trying to escape) when placed in water, suggesting feelings of helplessness.\u000a\u000aA study published by Victor Mangabeira and colleagues in Physiology & Behavior reports that sugar withdrawal is also linked to impulsive behaviour. Initially, rats were trained to receive water by pushing a lever.\u000a\u000aAfter training, the animals returned to their home cages and had access to a sugar solution and water, or just water alone. After 30 days, when rats were again given the opportunity to press a lever for water, those who had become dependent on sugar pressed the lever significantly more times than control animals, suggesting impulsive behaviour.\u000a\u000aThese are extreme experiments, of course. We humans aren't depriving ourselves of food for 12 hours and then allowing ourselves to binge on soda and doughnuts at the end of the day. But these rodent studies certainly give us insight into the neuro-chemical underpinnings of sugar dependence, withdrawal, and behaviour.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThrough decades of diet programmes and best-selling books, we've toyed with the notion of "sugar addiction" for a long time. There are accounts of those in "sugar withdrawal" describing food cravings, which can trigger relapse and impulsive eating.\u000a\u000aThere are also countless articles and books about the boundless energy and new-found happiness in those who have sworn off sugar for good. But despite the ubiquity of sugar in our diets, the notion of sugar addiction is still a rather taboo topic.\u000a\u000aAre you still motivated to give up sugar for Lent? You might wonder how long it will take until you're free of cravings and side-effects, but there's no answer -- everyone is different and no human studies have been done on this.\u000a\u000aBut after 40 days, it's clear that Andrew had overcome the worst, likely even reversing some of his altered dopamine signalling. "I remember eating my first sweet and thinking it was too sweet," he said. "I had to rebuild my tolerance."\u000a\u000aAnd as regulars of a local bakery in Hershey -- I can assure you, readers, that he has done just that.

aV(CNN) He is not the first to mangle spelling and syntax on social media. But President Donald Trump is surely the most powerful. So when he tweets, deletes, then tweets again and deletes again, the pedants among us are understandably quick to log on and sound off.\u000a\u000aTwitter is an unforgiving medium, especially for its superusers. The anguished swells of emotion that follow a Trump typo are symptomatic not only of our tribal politics, but the online immune system's typically intense reaction to any wobbles or flubs in its midst.\u000a\u000aBy his nature, Trump demands the incessant niggling corrections and mocking. He gives as good, often better -- or nastier -- than he gets. Ultimately, there are at least two valid points of view to consider.\u000a\u000a1) The President is a role model and should be able to tap out 140 characters without debasing our political language.\u000a\u000a2) Who cares?\u000a\u000aGood news: There is room for both. To the latter point, Trump's spelling foibles are almost always less interesting, or instructive, than our response to them. Back in 1992, former Vice President Dan Quayle, taking his cue from an incorrectly prepared index card, added an "e" to the end of a young student's correct spelling of "potato." Quayle quickly became -- and, if you're old enough, remains -- a national punchline.\u000a\u000a"It was more than a gaffe,'' he wrote, still shaken, in a memoir a couple years later. ''It was a 'defining moment' of the worst imaginable kind. I can't overstate how discouraging and exasperating the whole event was.''\u000a\u000aQuayle's biggest mistake, though, was authoring his infamous flub in an era before the narrative was set and interpreted on the internet. His lampooning -- the memes, GIFs, etc. -- would have come in waves, but waves break and modern news cycles (even pre-Trump) rarely dwell so long or harshly on any particular "defining moment." Today, Quayle would probably be fundraising off the error, offering supporters a chance to stick it to the Democrats by purchasing a $15 bag of "Potatoe" chips.\u000a\u000aThe ironic thing about Trump's mishaps are his clear desire to erase them. Often literally. For someone who, as a matter of principle, is loath to admit even the smallest mistake, the President repeatedly deletes messy tweets and replaces them with copy-edited versions.\u000a\u000aHis Thursday morning anti-media rant followed the usual script. The first run confused "there" for "their" and "too" for "to."\u000a\u000a"The Fake News is now complaining about my different types of back to back speeches. Well, their was Afghanistan (somber), the big Rally....(enthusiastic, dynamic and fun) and the American Legion - V.A. (respectful and strong)," he wrote.

It took three tries to get the second half down. If this sounds familiar, Trump kicked off a similar commotion this past weekend, when he repeatedly misspelled "heal" -- as in reconcile or repair -- as "heel," like the back of your foot or, in wrestling slang, a villain. The subject matter then was a mass anti-racism demonstration in Boston.\u000a\u000aThe first tweet read, before being erased: "Our great country has been divided for decade,but it will come together again. Sometimes protest is needed in order to heel,and heel we will!"\u000a\u000aThe next, soon to be scrubbed too: "Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heel, & we will heel, & be stronger than ever before!"\u000a\u000aFinally, more than a half-hour after it began, Trump delivered the message that still now appears in his feed: "Our great country has been divided for decades.

Hypocritical! -- to harp on the President's grammatical gaffes? Many activists opposed to the Trump agenda dismiss the shaming as a waste of time and, in some cases, counterproductive. Anti-intellectualism is part of Trump's political brand, and a prolonged mass scolding on Twitter has a way of inflaming it.\u000a\u000aOn the flip side, Trump's apparent unwillingness to spell-check himself before dashing off an opinion or sharing some bit of information speaks to his personality and highlights his administration's ramshackle communications process. Consider, at last, "covfefe."\u000a\u000aIt was a little after midnight on May 31 when Trump posted what read like the beginning of a typical complaint about the media. "Despite the constant negative press covfefe," he tweeted. Insomniac Twitter feasted.\u000a\u000aSix hours later, the mystery word's meme-ification complete, Trump returned to ask, in what read like a rare attempt at self-deprecation, "Who can figure out the true meaning of 'covfefe' ???

Countless policies, from military deployments to regulations that control the formula of a shampoo, are based on science.\u000a\u000aScientific research depends on government investment (approximately $65 billion in the US last year), which itself relies on a social compact: that basic research across all fields is beneficial to a nation.\u000a\u000aCurrently, science is being actively undermined by ideological forces motivated to maintain the status quo rather than advance the nation's long-term interest.

aVShares in Fiat Chrysler have gone crazy this week as investors speculate about a Chinese takeover of the automaker.\u000a\u000aThe stock gained as much as 13% in Milan to hit its highest level in 19 years after Automotive News reported Monday that a well-known Chinese automaker had made a bid for the company.\u000a\u000aThe article, based on unnamed sources, said Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) had rejected the offer for being too low. But it went on to suggest that other Chinese firms may also be considering bids.\u000a\u000aA Fiat Chrysler spokesperson declined to comment on "rumors about China."\u000a\u000aChina's Great Wall Motor and Geely (GELYF), which were among those mentioned in the report as potential bidders, did not immediately respond to CNNMoney requests for comment outside of office hours.\u000a\u000aGeely already owns Swedish brand Volvo, which recently promised to phase out diesel and gas engines by 2019.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the Fiat and Chrysler brands, the Italian-American group owns Jeep, Maserati, Dodge, Ram and Alfa Romeo.\u000a\u000aJeep is the prize\u000a\u000aIt's recently been ramping up sales of its Jeep brand in China, producing the SUVs through a joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group.\u000a\u000a"There's huge potential in Jeep and I think that's what potential bidders would be interested in," said David Bailey, a professor of industrial strategy at Aston University in the U.K.\u000a\u000aMorgan Stanley said in a research report this week that a Chinese takeover could make a lot of sense because it would give the new owners an easy way of expanding fast in the U.S.\u000a\u000aPlus, SUVs are a big deal in China and "Jeep is synonymous with SUVs," the analysts wrote in the report.\u000a\u000aBailey cautioned, though, that the Trump administration would likely be deeply opposed to allowing an iconic American brand like Chrysler to be sold to a Chinese buyer.\u000a\u000aSum of the parts\u000a\u000aEven if a Chinese bid doesn't materialize, investors may still have good reason to be bullish about the stock.\u000a\u000a"We see substantial hidden value," within Fiat Chrysler, the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.\u000a\u000aThey suggested that the company would be worth a lot more if it was broken up.

aVAsha Rangappa is an associate dean at Yale Law School. She is a former special agent in the FBI, specializing in counterintelligence investigations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) President Donald Trump's failed response following the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, by Nazis and the KKK was not only unpresidential, it also highlighted again the problem of Russia.\u000a\u000aThis is because throughout Europe an expanding and persistent link exists between extreme right-wing hate groups and Russia. Although there is no evidence to date that Russia is directly supporting extreme right groups in the United States, this established connection, when viewed through the lens of Trump's response to Charlottesville, suggests an opening for Russian intelligence to use domestic hate groups as a vehicle for escalating their active measures inside the United States.\u000a\u000aWhile the dominant chant during the tiki-lit march on Friday was "You will not replace us," there was another refrain as well: "Russia is our friend." Such unabashed admiration for Russia is not surprising, given that militant Russian nationalism -- the idea that political scientist Richard Arnold describes as tying "a desire for ethnic greatness to the greatness of the state" -- mirrors the goal of hate groups to reclaim white superiority in the United States as well.\u000a\u000aRussian President Vladimir Putin's traditionalist-nationalist rhetoric , which blames secularism, diversity and internationalism for the weakening of Western democracies, gives voice to the grievances that American hate groups have felt for so long.\u000a\u000aRussia has taken advantage of its exalted status among right-wing extremists to expand its influence throughout Europe. Western intelligence services have determined that right-wing movements in their countries have received financial support from Putin and in some cases, like Hungary , arms and training from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence organization. Russia has denied tampering\u000a\u000aWith the growing momentum white supremacists have in the United States under the Trump administration, it's not inconceivable that Russia could attempt to support similar operations here, particularly given the ties that already exist between leaders of white supremacist groups and the Russian government. Richard Spencer , for example, who helped organize the Charlottesville protest and is an avid admirer of Putin, married Nina Kouprianova, a Russian propagandist whose writings (under the pen name Nina Byzantina ) mirror the Kremlin's rhetoric, according to the Daily Beast. It's been reported that they are separated, which Spencer denied when speaking at Auburn University in June.\u000a\u000aKouprianova also reportedly denies being a member of any white nationalist movement, but expressed sympathy for movements that "challenge the dominant and globally oriented post-liberal ideology." And Spencer himself, along with former KKK leader David Duke, has close relationships with Alexander Dugin, whom Newsweek describes as a Russian "ultranationalist" with ties to Russia's foreign intelligence chief. Both Spencer and Duke have also used Russian state-sponsored media to propagate their extremist views. These connections create a ready-made entry point for Russian intelligence to directly engage with domestic hate groups and take their disinformation campaign a step further -- toward destabilization.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, under our current circumstances, stopping a Russian effort like this in the United States would be difficult. Although the FBI has a broad counterintelligence mandate, hate groups enjoy constitutional protections that make them presumptively off-limits for counterintelligence investigations. The reason lies in the FBI's checkered past: From 1956-1971, the FBI ran a domestic spying program called COINTELPRO, which focused on illegally monitoring, infiltrating, and disrupting American political organizations including the KKK , communist groups and civil rights groups, among others.\u000a\u000aThe Church Hearings in Congress, which followed the program's exposure, resulted in the creation of the Attorney General Guidelines, rules that significantly restrict investigations that may impinge on activities protected by the First Amendment. Even when these groups cross the line into criminal and even terrorist activity, these same constitutional protections prevent law enforcement from investigating them as aggressively as international terrorist groups.\u000a\u000aThis vacuum creates a perfect opportunity for Russian intelligence. Apart from exploiting the openness of KKK and Nazi groups to Russian propaganda that supports their ideology, Russia could also funnel financial support to these groups to intensify their activities with little fear of detection.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aRussia has another good reason to believe its efforts would be fruitful: The Trump administration no longer includes white supremacist groups as a threat in its Countering Violent Extremist program under the Department of Homeland security, so these groups can continue to expand virtually unchecked.\u000a\u000aGiven Russia's role in fueling right-wing extremism around the world, our concern over President Trump's mixed signals about hate groups should go beyond how he directly responds to events like Charlottesville. It opens the United States up to broader risks as well. His implicit endorsement of domestic right-wing extremism is a green light for Russia to extend its destabilization campaign here, if it hasn't done so already.\u000a\u000aThe Russian cloud over the Trump administration never seems to disappear.

The president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing followed suit by quitting on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThese public stands are highly unusual. CEOs are loath to alienate customers through politics and never want to be the target of a tweet storm from Trump.\u000a\u000aBut corporate leaders who were once eager for a seat at the Trump table are increasingly deciding the costs outweigh the benefits.\u000a\u000a"There is a herd effect.

The demonstrations turned violent, and a counter-protester was killed.\u000a\u000aFrazier cited a "responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism" in leaving the council.\u000a\u000aTwo more CEOs, Under Armour's (UA) Kevin Plank and Intel boss Brian Krzanich, dumped Trump on Monday night -- even after the president responded to two days of criticism by calling the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists "evil."\u000a\u000aTrump fired back at the CEOs, calling them "grandstanders" in a tweet on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul announced his departure shortly after Trump's tweet.\u000a\u000aRelated: Three CEOs walk away from Trump\u000a\u000aLarry Summers, a vocal Trump critic and former adviser to President Obama, has called on all CEOs to quit Trump's advisory boards.\u000a\u000aTrump's corporate advisers "should feel ashamed for complicity in Mr. Trump's words and deeds," Summers wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial Times. "I sometimes wonder how they face their children."\u000a\u000aThe four executives who left the manufacturing council weren't the first powerful business leaders to part ways with the Trump White House.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Trump's stances on immigration and climate change fueled the resignations of Tesla (TSLA) founder Elon Musk (from two separate boards), Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger and former Uber chief Travis Kalanick.\u000a\u000aThe risks of staying silent\u000a\u000aSeveral CEOs indicated this week that they are staying on Trump's manufacturing council, including Campbell Soup's (CPB) Morrison, Michael Dell, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt, Dow Chemical (DOW) CEO Andrew Liveris and Whirlpool (WHR) boss Jeff Fettig.\u000a\u000aLockheed Martin CEO Marilynn Hewson declined to comment, while others such as Caterpillar (CAT) CEO Doug Oberhelman and Boeing (BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg were unreachable.\u000a\u000aTrump's other major advisory board, the strategic and policy forum, includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, BlackRock (BLK) founder Larry Fink, Blackstone (BX) co-founder Stephen Schwarzman and GM's Barra.\u000a\u000a"Unquestionably, CEOs would prefer to remain silent. But at what point do they feel the risks of silence outweighs the risk of taking a public stance?" asked Bill Boulding, dean of Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.\u000a\u000aMatter of personal conscience\u000a\u000aSome, like Under Armour's Plank, must be worried about protecting their companies' brands. They fear turning off customers by being too closely linked to a controversial president with historically low approval ratings.\u000a\u000a"I love our country & company. I am stepping down from the council to focus on inspiring & uniting through power of sport," Plank said in a statement.\u000a\u000aCEOs must also stand up for their employees, some of whom may feel under attack by certain policies or statements. If they don't, they risk losing talent.\u000a\u000a"You want your employees to know you have their backs," said Boulding.\u000a\u000aRelated: Why Under Armour's CEO had to ditch Trump\u000a\u000aRisk of a backlash\u000a\u000aOf course, Frazier's resignation shows that quitting Trump carries serious risks, too.\u000a\u000aTrump tweeted late Monday demanding that Merck "bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!"\u000a\u000aCompanies like Lockheed Martin (LMT), which rely on the federal government for lucrative contracts, may also worry about a backlash from a White House that is notoriously sensitive to criticism.\u000a\u000a"You never want to get on the wrong side of an administration -- because it has an incredible ability to make your life difficult as a corporate executive," Calkins said.\u000a\u000aThat's why it's so telling that CEOs are increasingly willing to run that risk.

aV(CNN) At 37 years old, Lisa Pessah-Bloom, a mother of three, was pre-diabetic, struggling with losing postpartum pounds and concerned about her health.\u000a\u000a"I had gestational diabetes for all three of my pregnancies. After my third, my A1C (blood sugar measurement) kept rising, and the doctor told me for the first time to be careful, because I was on track for diabetes."\u000a\u000aPessah-Bloom knew that she had to shed her pregnancy pounds and get her blood sugar under control. She did a Google search on diets for diabetes and stumbled upon the Paleo diet, which includes protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs and nuts, as well as vegetables and fruit, but excludes grains, dairy, legumes, sugars and salt. "People said that their diabetes was reversed," she said.\u000a\u000aShe started eating more vegetables and unprocessed foods. But while following Paleo helped Pessah-Bloom eat a clean, lean diet, it wasn't enough to get her to her goal. She needed something else -- a support system of sorts -- and so she opened an account on Instagram under the handle @paleoworkingmama.\u000a\u000a"I started my Paleo page for motivation, really for myself," Pessah-Bloom said. But it wasn't long before she found people with health issues like herself who were also using the photo-driven app. "I started following others who reversed Crohn's and IBS too, which I also had," she said.\u000a\u000a"The more I followed people, the more I felt empowered. And then something unexpected happened. After some time, people who followed me told me that I -- me! -- empowered them. It was a chain of support," she said. "I got it from others, and I gave it to others. People asked me to come to their house to perform refrigerator cleansing! They are inspired by the pictures I post of the food I make and what I keep in my kitchen, like my spices."\u000a\u000aInsta-community\u000a\u000aThe community support that Instagram provides may be its most valuable asset for those hoping to achieve their health goals.\u000a\u000a"The first picture I posted was a mason jar of water with lemons," Pessah-Bloom said. "I had just learned about my high blood sugar, and I wrote, 'Making lemonade out of lemons.' " The post marked the start of Pessah-Bloom's new diet and exercise journey, and in her post, she encouraged others to follow and support her.\u000a\u000aI love Instagram! I can find brave inspirational people who are taking the first steps to make big changes. I love the paleo community!! Let's give @thepaleoworkingmama our support!!! #Repost @thepaleoworkingmama \u30fb\u30fb\u30fb Making lemon juice out of lemons \U0001f34b\U0001f34b. I just learned that my blood sugars are on the high end. I read that the #paleodiet can substantially lower the A1C.. So here I go. Follow me on this new journey of diet and exercise. This will be tough as I am a working mother of three kids. But will try my best \U0001f64f\U0001f3fb. Starting off with an easy morning detox before breakfast and a full glass of water before eating helps you feel full and not overeat. #lemonwater which flushes out bad stuff from your system. #paleodietbegins #weekone #momswhowork #lemonwaterbenefits #paleodiet #paleolifestyle #workingmoms A post shared by Charissa | #nocookpaleo (@nocookpaleo) on Apr 30, 2016 at 9:24am PDT\u000a\u000a"One person posted my post on her page -- she had over 15,000 followers, and she said, 'Let's give @thepalemoworkingmama our support' -- and then all of a sudden I had 100 followers. This was someone I didn't even know ... someone who has plenty of her own followers, but she really wanted me to succeed on my journey."\u000a\u000aThere's also the benefit of being part of a more intimate community. "With Instagram, you can have a separate part of your profile dedicated to food journaling, and you don't have to be worried that your family member or neighbor who just wants to see pictures of your dogs or vacations will be turned off," said Christina Chung, a doctoral student at the University of Washington and lead author of a study that analyzed women who consistently use Instagram to record and share what they eat, in order to learn about the benefits and challenges of using the platform to achieve one's health goals.\u000a\u000a"Instagram is just pictures. There are no posts about politics. It's easy to navigate, with no chaos or clutter," Pessah-Bloom added. "If you follow someone, you're following them for a specific reason ... and often someone with a similar goal."\u000a\u000aPessah-Bloom also appreciates the convenience that Instagram provides. "People are so busy, and sometimes you can't go in person to a Weight Watchers meeting. With Instagram, it's in your face. You're seeing it all the time. When I eat something bad ... and I see someone preparing something wonderful, I say, 'Why did I do that?!' It keeps you inspired!"\u000a\u000aFood pictures that create cravings for tasty, healthy food help, too. "When you see something so mouthwatering and appetizing, you're more likely to try it, and then you get hooked on eating well," Pessah-Bloom said.\u000a\u000a#Paleo almond crusted fudge squares for my beloved who turned 40 today \U0001f388\U0001f38a.

"Plus, it's more socially appropriate for people who are trying to track their diets to snap a photo of their plate when they're out with friends: Everyone's doing it, and it doesn't look weird."\u000a\u000aAs one of the study participants noted, "if I was out with friends or something, then a quick snapshot of the food would be easier than saying, 'Hold on, guys, I need to pull up MyFitnessPal and put everything down and the right serving size.' "\u000a\u000aNo fat grams on Instagram\u000a\u000aBut just how accurate is Instagram as a tracker for weight loss? Can you really know the portion sizes, fat grams and calorie counts of what you ate -- or should eat -- when you swipe through photos?\u000a\u000a"When it comes to losing weight, food pics may or may not help," said Angela Lemond, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "The food could be great quality, but even an excessive amount of 'good' food will cause weight gain."\u000a\u000aIf, for example, someone spots a picture of healthy chicken parmigiana as food inspiration for weight loss, it may be difficult to figure out the correct portion size, unless it is listed.\u000a\u000a"It's not very accurate if you are looking for tracking information such as detailed nutrients, portion size and calories, since it might be difficult to assess this information from photos," Chung said.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for a 200-calorie meal, you might search using the hashtag #200calories and find some options. But in Chung's study, participants used the platform in conjunction with other apps if they were seeking more detailed nutrition data.\u000a\u000aCalories aside, for those who use Instagram, the visual cues that the app provides -- actual pictures of food -- may be just enough motivation to continue eating on plan, or in some cases to eat less.\u000a\u000a"Before (when using MyFitnessPal), I would have a small snack pack that was a bag of chips and be like, 'Oh, that doesn't really count because it's just a little tiny bag.' But I think with Instagram, it helped me because I was taking a picture of it: It's real, and it exists, and it does count towards what I was eating. And then putting a visual image of it up really helped me stay honest," one study participant said.\u000a\u000aTensions between tracking honestly and posting something perceived as more desirable were also observed in the study. That could present a dilemma, leading some to spend time on making photos look better, explained Chung. But the thought of posting something "off-plan" may also help people stay on track, she added.\u000a\u000aInsta diet success\u000a\u000aOver a year later, Pessah-Bloom's cooking skills have improved, and she is no longer pre-diabetic. Her IBS is resolved, and she weighs less than she did at her wedding about 12 years ago. Her husband, a huge Instagram fan, has lost 40 pounds with the help of the app and his wife's cooking, and her kids eat healthier now, too.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aPessah-Bloom says she could not have done it without her online community that evolved from her photo journal.\u000a\u000a"I love the people I follow on Instagram. ... They have become my online 'support' group. Everyone inspires each other. I work full-time and have three kids. I couldn't have done any of this without Instagram."

aVCarol Costello anchors the 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET edition of CNN's "Newsroom" each weekday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single.\u000a\u000aI did. And I do.\u000a\u000aRecently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want.\u000a\u000a"I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom," 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. "There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well."\u000a\u000aJackie Demate, also 21, agreed. "I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe."\u000a\u000aCarol Costello\u000a\u000aAt first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, "Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!"\u000a\u000aJackie didn't blink. "But, Europe!" she exclaimed. "I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy."\u000a\u000aBefore you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once . That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960.\u000a\u000aWhat a fine example my generation is! Not.\u000a\u000aStill, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29.\u000a\u000aReligious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction.\u000a\u000aA study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says: "From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being." On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be "more desirable marriage prospects."\u000a\u000aBingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt.\u000a\u000a"Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt," Emily Crille told me. "That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home."\u000a\u000aI felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable?\u000a\u000aPerhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right.\u000a\u000aScandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today : "In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying."\u000a\u000aThe article also points out that "Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth."\u000a\u000aIn an effort to understand the joys of "sambo," the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden.\u000a\u000a"To put it short," he told us, "marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation."\u000a\u000aWow.\u000a\u000aFifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, "I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it."\u000a\u000aMaybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: "The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities."\u000a\u000aMy Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, "Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for."\u000a\u000aMarriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough.\u000a\u000aWhich brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point?\u000a\u000aIn the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with "I dos"?\u000a\u000aI don't know. But I would love to know if you do.\u000a\u000aRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.

From this point on, we can actually be all together as a family."\u000a\u000aIt marked two months to the day since the 27-hour surgery to separate the boys ended on October 14 -- what their dad described as a moment of "hope and a chance for a normal life." It also marked one of the fastest such recoveries on record\u000a\u000aGoodrich, who earlier in the day performed craniofacial reconstruction surgery on a 9-month-old boy, acknowledged that he'd miss the twins.\u000a\u000a"Am I happy to see them go? No," he said. "But it's time to move on. It's time for the next stage."\u000a\u000a'They're so cute'\u000a\u000aThe day before, Jadon and Anias took a similar wagon ride. It was the first time they'd ever left their room for something non-medical. This time, the staff wanted to throw them a farewell party.\u000a\u000aAza McDonald, 3, crawls into the wagon next to his twin brothers before the party.\u000a\u000aThe wagon carries meaning for the parents. After they were born, the only way the conjoined twins could be moved was for their parents to pull them in a red wagon. As the months passed, the two could no longer fit in it. They had grown too long.\u000a\u000aAs they rode Tuesday, they looked up at their mother and held hands. Jadon's head was fully revealed, with none of the bandages that once covered his scalp. Anias, whose skull cap was removed following persistent post-surgical infections, wore a turquoise knit cap.\u000a\u000aAfter a quick elevator ride to the second floor, the boys made their way through a maze of hallways and into the hospital's Grand Hall banquet room.\u000a\u000aAwaiting them were more than two dozen staff members, from the nurses and doctors on the surgical team to those in the PICU who've gotten to know the boys best. There were tears and hugs, smiles and moments of glee.\u000a\u000aAnd photos. Lots of photos.\u000a\u000aGoodrich, the world's leading expert on craniopagus surgery and the boys' main surgeon, whipped out his iPhone and snapped commemorative shots.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Separated twins 'ahead of schedule' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Separated twins 'ahead of schedule' 03:50\u000a\u000a"It's a pretty emotional day, I've got to say," said Goodrich, who delivered homemade cookies and other treats to the twins' room before the party.\u000a\u000aAnother guest was Martin O'Malley, a longtime Bronx resident who lives across the street from the McDonalds. He's helped raise donations for the family, delivered them food and felt compelled to join the party.\u000a\u000a"It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing," said O'Malley, 83, whose twin sister died at birth. "It's hard to imagine just two months ago they were attached. I'm so happy for this family."\u000a\u000aDr. Carrie Stern, a plastic surgeon resident who took part in the surgery, glanced at the boys in the wagon and whispered, "They're so cute. It's just so amazing seeing them from beginning to end."\u000a\u000a'So many unknowns'\u000a\u000aA week before the party, Nicole and Christian tended to the boys in their room. They couldn't help but wonder about the future for Jadon and Anias.\u000a\u000aThey know about Carl and Clarence Aguirre, craniopagus twins from the Philippines whom Goodrich separated 12 years ago. With twins joined at the head, one is more dominant, his body working overtime to keep the other twin alive.\u000a\u000aCarl was the non-dominant child. He suffered a neurological decline a little over a year after surgery, resulting in permanent disabilities. He speaks only a few words and is confined to a wheelchair.\u000a\u000aWhen the McDonald twins were joined, Jadon was dominant. Since the surgery, Anias has suffered multiple seizures, in addition to having his skull cap removed. He will undergo another surgery when he is 7 to insert bone. For now, his skin is the only thing covering the top of his head, and he will have to wear a protective helmet.\u000a\u000a"There are just so many unknowns," Christian said. "We just don't know how it's all going to turn out."\u000a\u000aAdded Nicole, "Because we know other cases have had that regression, you just hope and pray that that doesn't happen in this circumstance."\u000a\u000aThe couple gave up their jobs in Illinois and moved to the Bronx to be close to the hospital. When the new year arrives, they'll face a $15,000 insurance deductible, plus whatever unexpected costs might arise. Their apartment lease is up in February, and they don't know whether to renew for another year, because it's unclear how long the boys will be in rehab.\u000a\u000aNicole and Christian McDonald with 3-year-old son Aza and the twins before surgery.\u000a\u000aThe couple started a GoFundMe page after the twins were born, but after donations swelled to nearly $300,000, the McDonalds told well-wishers to instead help a friend's child in need of a kidney transplant. With the long-term financial reality of their situation sinking in, they are once again receptive to people giving.\u000a\u000a"I feel like we've got a long ways to go," Christian said.\u000a\u000aHe noted that Anias will be cognizant by age 7, aware of the surgery he will have to face to repair his skull cap: "My heart already goes out to him."\u000a\u000aChristian and Nicole faced a decision no parent should have to make. Craniopagus twins occur in one out of every 2.5 million births. About 40% are stillborn, and another third die within 24 hours. Of those who survive, 80% die of medical complications by age 2 if not separated.\u000a\u000aMom and Dad said they have no regrets about choosing surgery.\u000a\u000a"When you walk into the room and Jadon throws his arms up and wants you to pick him up and you can! He looks at me," Nicole said. "He wiggles from side to side. He giggles. And I can just swoop him up and just hold him and feel his warmth."\u000a\u000aOf Anias, she said, "He has really come full circle and begun doing all the things he used to do. And that's been so encouraging, because I always had that worry about Anias."\u000a\u000aAs she spoke, the boys held hands on a bed where Mom spread them out. At one point, Jadon pulled Anias' hand to his face and then nibbled on his brother's finger. Mom quickly intervened to save Anias from being bitten.\u000a\u000aA sense of parental normalcy, when nothing is normal.\u000a\u000aAfter nine months, 'rebirth'\u000a\u000aAt the goodbye party, doctors, nurses and staff sat around tables, a buffet of chicken, salmon, green beans, mashed potatoes and salad behind them ready for the feast.\u000a\u000aAza bounced around the room, excited for the twins.\u000a\u000aAll eyes were on Dr. Steven M. Safyer, president and CEO of Montefiore Medicine, as he told Nicole and Christian how the 35,000 Montefiore employees have been rooting for their boys and consider them family.\u000a\u000a"I believe that for life, you're members of our world, and this is a wonderful world," Safyer said.\u000a\u000aHe noted that it's been nine months since he first met the family and that "in a way, this is a nine-month deal. This is the rebirth of these two guys."\u000a\u000aTepper, the lead plastic surgeon, told the crowd he was humbled by the fact that the "McDonalds chose us. They put their trust in us to take care of their boys."\u000a\u000a"Hands down, unquestionably, the two leaders of this team are Jadon and Anias," Tepper added. "It's their resilience, it's their determination that steered this voyage. There's a reason the world calls them 'The Little Warriors.' "\u000a\u000aGoodrich told the crowd he remembered speaking by phone with Nicole the first time, back when the boys were in utero and she was wondering what could be done to separate them. She told Goodrich she had just one question. Forty-five minutes later, they were still talking: "Totally in tune and all the right questions."\u000a\u000aThe neurosurgeon thanked everyone in the room, from hospital brass to his team in the operating room to Christian and Nicole. Then he held up a hand-written note he received from Ireland, "to show you how far this story went."\u000a\u000aIt was addressed simply:\u000a\u000aDr. James Goodrich, surgeon\u000a\u000aChildren's Hospital Montefiore Medical Center\u000a\u000aAmerica\u000a\u000aNo ZIP code. No city or street address. "Somebody in the postal system got this to me," Goodrich said.\u000a\u000aWhen it came time for the parents to speak, the room grew quiet. Many clutched tissues and dabbed their eyes.\u000a\u000aChristian told the group that as grateful as he and Nicole are, they will "never be half as grateful" as their sons.\u000a\u000a"Sixteen years down the road," he said, "they're going to be driving their car. They're going to be maybe out on a date. ... Just the fact that they'll be able to go to the bathroom and take a shower by themselves. They're not going to take those things for granted."\u000a\u000aIt's ordinary for people working their jobs, he said, to not fully grasp the significance of their work.\u000a\u000a"Maybe on one of those hard days," he told them, "when it may feel like another day at the office, please know ... you're going to change people's lives, not only individuals' lives for the better, but you're going to impact whole families' lives for the rest of their life. It's a huge thing."\u000a\u000aBefore the crowd broke into loud applause, Christian ended with a message from his boys: "If I may, I just want to be their voice and say, 'Thank you for giving us, Jadon and Anias, a hope and a chance for a normal life.' "\u000a\u000aThen it was Nicole's turn. She wept as she began. She said she had written three pages of material and then tossed it in the trash. "I decided to throw it away and to get up here and to look at you all in the face and tell you just how I feel."\u000a\u000aWhen she was pregnant, she told the crowd, she knew that her boys would be separated and that "this would be the outcome."\u000a\u000a"I knew that I would have a miracle. I didn't know how." She repeated, "I didn't know how."\u000a\u000a"I prayed every day for God to make the how happen, and you are all the how," she said through tears.\u000a\u000aShe said that she considered everyone in the room part of her family and that saying goodbye was extraordinarily difficult. "That is a huge testament to you that we don't want to leave here. That's an odd thing that somebody doesn't want to leave the hospital. Everyone is usually itching to get out. We want to stay. I want the boys to talk here first. I want you to see all that, because it was you that contributed to our miracle."\u000a\u000aShe compared her boys' transition to a caterpillar's metamorphosis into a butterfly.\u000a\u000a"Every one of you have been the fiber of that cocoon. You have been what has brought us to this moment: And now they will fly."\u000a\u000aThere wasn't a dry eye in the room. Nicole handed out gifts, from framed hand-drawn butterfly paintings to photo collages of the boys' progress over the months. Dad tended to Aza while Nicole's mom picked Jadon up and glided around the room with him in her arms.\u000a\u000aMany of the workers were on the clock. They scarfed down food quickly because, after all, there are more kids who need their care.\u000a\u000aThe featured dessert was a cake with white frosting decorated in black with the symbol for infinity, which is also used to represent conjoined twins and, now, the family's infinite love for the hospital team.\u000a\u000a"Anias and Jadon," read the black lettering. "God has answered + God has heard."\u000a\u000aPlastic surgeon Stern stepped up. Two months ago in the operating room, she was the surgeon who made the final cut that separated the twins.\u000a\u000aNow, she made the first cut of the cake that marked the next step of their journey.\u000a\u000aDr. Oren Tepper holds a thank you gift the McDonald family presented to him during the party.\u000a\u000aA new space\u000a\u000aThe boys' wagon ride on Wednesday took them to the lobby of Montefiore, where paramedics and EMTs transferred them to stretchers. Aza jumped onto the stretcher carrying Jadon. More staffers crowded the lobby to send them off.\u000a\u000aTwo ambulances awaited outside, one for each twin. Aza cried uncontrollably when he had to get off the stretcher as Jadon was being placed in his ambulance.\u000a\u000aIt was 2:58 p.m. when the twins left. The sun was shining bright over the Bronx on a beautiful 43-degree day.\u000a\u000aThe ambulances drove together at a steady 20- to 30-mph pace along New York parkways to Valhalla, arriving at Blythedale Children's Hospital at 3:45 p.m.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"It's almost surreal. I can't believe this is finally happening," Christian said as the boys were wheeled into the new facility. "It's such a big step in the right direction."\u000a\u000aUnlike their sendoff at Montefiore, their arrival at Blythedale was tranquil and peaceful.\u000a\u000aBy 3:49 p.m., the boys were in their new room, spacious and brightly colored, with two beds -- one for each boy -- and two sofas that can fold out into beds for Mom and Dad. It is this facility where the boys will learn how to eat, play and walk.\u000a\u000aNicole held Anias in her arms and marveled at Jadon as he settled into his new bed.\u000a\u000a"This is beautiful. I know that the boys will flourish here. It's an exciting step, and we're ready to take off."

aVMarc J. Randazza is a Las Vegas-based First Amendment attorney and managing partner of the Randazza Legal Group. Follow him on Twitter: @marcorandazza. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Donald Trump has said a lot of strange things -- some funny, some creepy, but none scarier than what he said on Friday : that if he is elected president, he will "open up our libel laws" to make it easier to sue the media and "win lots of money." No matter what you may think about his other policy ideas, if he keeps this promise, we won't be able to effectively express dissent against anything else he might want to do. We can fight any bad policy if we have a robust First Amendment.\u000a\u000aSome say that Trump is just being a blowhard, that he doesn't know what he is talking about, and that for all his bluster, there is nothing he could or would do.\u000a\u000aI am not so sure. Trump has a history of filing SLAPP suits. SLAPP stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. This describes a lawsuit filed against someone for exercising his or her First Amendment rights -- filed with little chance of success, but with the knowledge that the lawsuit itself is the punishment. After all, if people have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves because they criticized Donald Trump, they might think better of doing so again in the future.\u000a\u000aHowever, some states, like California and Nevada , have strong anti-SLAPP laws, which dispense with such cases early and force the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorneys' fees. (Full disclosure: I was instrumental in urging passage of the Nevada Anti-SLAPP law.)\u000a\u000aTrump recently got stung with an anti-SLAPP decision, which he probably had in mind when he spoke about "opening up" our libel laws. In fact, he isn't the first big shot to try to make it easier to sue for defamation after having a SLAPP suit blow up in his face.\u000a\u000aTherefore, Trump is clearly frustrated with anti-SLAPP laws (which shows that they work) and the landmark defamation case, New York Times v. Sullivan.\u000a\u000aWhen people say that Trump can't do anything about defamation law at the federal level, I think they miss the point that there is a lot of support for a federal anti-SLAPP law. I think we need one, and in fact, HR 2304 was one such proposal this last session. If it passes, we could expect President Trump to veto it.\u000a\u000aBeyond new federal legislation, defamation law is a matter of state law, leaving little for a president to do about it. To win a defamation case, the plaintiff must show publication of a false statement of fact that damages the plaintiff's reputation. This standard can vary a bit from state to state, but it generally fits that general set of requirements.\u000a\u000aTherefore, what could Trump do to "open up" the libel laws? He personally? Nothing legally, but if elected, he could pick Supreme Court justices willing to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan, which is in my view the most important case protecting our First Amendment rights. It is the greatest protection we have from government officials or powerful businesses choking the life out of public debate and a free press. Overturning it would change everything we know about freedom of the press.\u000a\u000aIn a defamation case involving an ordinary citizen suing for defamation, the citizen only needs to show that the defendant knew the statement was false, or failed to exercise "reasonable care" before publishing it. So let's say that a blogger writes an article about a private citizen accusing that person of a crime, based on a false statement by a witness, without following up. That might be a failure to exercise reasonable care, and the blogger might lose the case.\u000a\u000aBut if the same blogger wrote one about a public figure, like Trump, then Trump has to prove that the blogger did so with "actual malice."\u000a\u000aEven some judges and lawyers get this wrong, so don't feel bad if you didn't know what "actual malice" means. It has nothing to do with "malice" at all. It means that the defendant published the statement knowing it was false or with a reckless disregard for the truth.\u000a\u000aSo if we return to my example, let's say someone wrote a blog post about Donald Trump, accusing him of a crime, but based it just on an anonymous email, without following up -- that might be considered to be "reckless disregard."\u000a\u000aWhy the different standard depending on the plaintiff?\u000a\u000aFrom New York Times v. Sullivan: "(W)e consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."\u000a\u000aDebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open... Justice William Brennan\u000a\u000aHow beautiful that language is. It encapsulates what America is all about, the way only Justice William Brennan could.\u000a\u000aThe court recognized that public figures have access to the media to defend themselves, and it went on to reject any notion that the speaker must prove truth; instead the plaintiff must prove falsity. This is all because the First Amendment needs "breathing space" in order for free speech to survive. And if we impose liability for merely erroneous reports on political conduct, it would reflect the "obsolete doctrine that the governed must not criticize their governors."\u000a\u000aSo what if Trump appoints one or two Supreme Court judges who are willing to overturn Sullivan? Justice Elena Kagan has already voiced skepticism about the extension of Sullivan too far into other kinds of libel cases. The only member of the court I think we could count on to be strongly opposed to overturning it is Chief Justice John Roberts.\u000a\u000aNo matter how flawed it is, our democracy depends upon robust free speech and free press rights. New York Times v. Sullivan matters more than anything else. If we lose the right to criticize the government in wide-open and robust debate, we lose an important part of what it means to be free.

aVSur, Lebanon (CNN) In southern Lebanon, near the border with Israel, lies a distinctive orange house.\u000a\u000aLocated just past a Lebanese Armed Forces military checkpoint in the Mediterranean city of Tyre, it is surrounded by luscious banana groves, sleeping goats and chirping birds.\u000a\u000aThis beautiful oasis is home to 68-year-old Mona Khalil, a self-proclaimed "protector of the sea turtles."\u000a\u000aIn 2000, Khalil moved back from the Netherlands -- where she'd sought refuge for 17 years during the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990) -- to a piece of land she'd inherited from her grandmother.\u000a\u000aOn her return, she discovered that the endangered green turtle and the loggerhead, which is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, can both be found nesting on the nearby secluded elMansouri beach.\u000a\u000aMona Khalil, a Lebanese ecologist, activist looks at a turtle at a coast in the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre in 2002.\u000a\u000aThat same year, Khalil launched The Orange House Project -- a turtle conservation and eco-tourism project -- to help protect Lebanon's turtles. She painted the house orange to symbolize the safe haven the Netherlands had provided her with.\u000a\u000a"This project was my dream since I was a child. I loved the beach and the land here," Khalil tells CNN.\u000a\u000aTurtle warrior\u000a\u000aOver three years, Khalil was trained by scientists from the Mediterranean Association to Save the Sea Turtles (MEDASSET), who visited the beach in Lebanon.\u000a\u000aInitially, Khalil's efforts were resented by some locals who she says were involved in dynamite fishing -- the practice of using explosives to kill schools of fish.\u000a\u000aAccording to Michel Bariche , professor of marine biology at the American University of Beirut and author of a book on marine resources in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, "blast fishing" has been used in Lebanon since at least the 1930s.\u000a\u000aAlthough now illegal, it still occurs in some remote regions, he adds in an email.\u000a\u000aNewborn marine turtles head towards the sea at Mansuri beach, about 95 km south of Beirut.\u000a\u000aWith the help of coastal guards, however, Khalil says she stood her ground and now says fishing with dynamite has ceased in the area.\u000a\u000aUnsurprisingly, that has helped the local wildlife.\u000a\u000aBetween the months of May and September, the turtles' hatching season, Khalil wakes at sunrise to monitor their habitat.\u000a\u000aShe carefully traces the beach for eggs, placing those she finds underneath a secure metal mesh further up the embankment.\u000a\u000aKhalil meticulously details her findings and tracks the footsteps of adult turtles which scramble up the sand banks to lay eggs. She has presented her findings at MEDASSET's biennial conference, and makes her data freely available.\u000a\u000aVolunteers also regularly help her to clean the beach of plastic and other waste. These are both locals and guests on vacation, some of whom stay in The Orange House's three guest rooms, which helps fund the upkeep of the project.\u000a\u000aMona Khalil, a conservation specialist who is part of the Orange House conservation project, carries a baby sea turtle before releasing it to the sea in El-Mansouri near Tyre, south Lebanon August 28, 2014.\u000a\u000aTumultuous times\u000a\u000aAlthough most visitors these days are treated to a tranquil beach vacation, Khalil has experienced some sticky moments during her time in the Orange House.\u000a\u000aDuring the violent 2006 conflict between Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israel, Khalil stayed put.\u000a\u000a"I refused to go. It was the hatching season," Khalil says. "One of the rockets came into the house and blew up.\u000a\u000a"Me and my animals were all traumatized and I lost a bit of my hearing. But otherwise I'm still alive and kicking."\u000a\u000aThe fighting was much more aggressive than Khalil had expected, but she would still monitor the beach and help the turtles hatch when she could.\u000a\u000a"I managed to protect most of them," Khalil says.\u000a\u000aMona Khalil, a conservation specialist who is part of the Orange House Project, removes turtle eggs to move them to a safer place in order to protect them from predators in El-Mansouri near Tyre, south Lebanon.\u000a\u000aIncredibly, that summer the turtle population thrived.\u000a\u000a"We had 82 nests, the highest number (we've had) within 1.4km (the length of the beach). It was because the local people were not having fun on the beach," Khalil says.\u000a\u000aTraveling to the region\u000a\u000aAs such, foreign travelers to The Orange House Project must obtain special permission to enter the region from the Lebanese army.\u000a\u000aMona al-Khalil (R) and Habiba (second name not available) collect turtle eggs and baby marine turtles 26 August 2004 at Mansuri beach, about 95 kms south of Beirut.\u000a\u000aBut Khalil claims the biggest affront to her project and the turtles these days is construction work that can encroach on the beach.\u000a\u000aStill, Khalil remains resilient: "I live every day to the fullest and don't worry about tomorrow," she says.

Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Like most parents, my weekends are consumed with getting my girls, ages 9 and 11, to and from various activities.\u000a\u000aThis weekend, we had two soccer games, one sleepover party, two play dates, religious school and an outing with my sister-in-law. We also would have had a baseball double header, but that was canceled due to the rain.\u000a\u000aIn between, there were definitely a few fights and complaints, homework assignments that needed to get done, a house to get ready for not one but two houseguests and, of course, meals to prepare and snacks to pack.\u000a\u000aIt's the same story every weekend and week. My mom jokes that she can't keep up with how crazy our lives are, but I know I'm not alone.\u000a\u000aAnd that is why a recent New York magazine story really resonated with me. Headlined "Just like Burnout at Work, It's Possible to Burn Out on Parenting," the story talked about a recent survey of more than 2,000 parents, conducted by researchers in Belgium. They found that just as people can burn out from their professional jobs, mothers and fathers can burn out, too.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, found that close to 13% of the parents surveyed, 12.9% of mothers and 11.6% of fathers, had what the researchers called "high burnout." That meant they felt exhausted, less productive and competent and emotionally withdrawn -- qualities that are similar to professional burnout -- at least once a week.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure I needed a study to tell me parental burnout is real, and neither did many of the parents I contacted via social media and email. What I wanted to find out from parents is why parents today may be experiencing burnout more than parents did in previous generations and what we can do about it.\u000a\u000aPressure to be a 'superhero in everything'\u000a\u000aLyss Stern is author of "Motherhood is a B#tch!"\u000a\u000aBy all accounts, Lyss Stern seems like the mother who has it all together. A mom of three, she built a thriving business called Divalysscious Moms, a networking and event company for New York City mothers, creating what she calls "fabuLyss" opportunities for mothers to connect and recharge.\u000a\u000aBut Stern was so busy taking care of her business; her three kids, who are now 3, 9 and 13; and her husband and dealing with the death of her father that she never took time for herself. About a year and a half ago, she said, she hit rock bottom and found herself crying on a rock during a retreat in Massachusetts.\u000a\u000a"I think I was just overwhelmed by everything," said Stern. "I think at that moment, it was like my 'aha' moment: 'Lyss, you need to get your life back on track. You need to start taking care of yourself.' "\u000a\u000aShe was burned out, she said, and experienced another "aha" moment when she returned home.\u000a\u000aThis parenting manual includes tips for moms to combat parental burnout.\u000a\u000a"I turned to my husband, I said, 'I need to make changes. I need to take baby steps, because I want to get healthy, healthy physically and healthy mentally, so I could be the best mom,' " said Stern, who wrote about her journey in the hopes of inspiring other burned out mothers in the just released book "Motherhood is a B#tch! 10 Steps to Regaining Your Sanity, Sexiness, and Inner Diva."\u000a\u000aHer mom (and my mom, too!) certainly wouldn't say they were burning out as parents when they raised us, said Stern. "Today, so many moms have these high-powered jobs, and they have the kids, and we want to be the best at our jobs, and you want to be the best with your kids, and then you want to sometimes take time for yourself, and you feel guilty, but you can't feel guilty. You're allowed to go to a movie with your husband. You're allowed to go to a movie with your friend without having a breakdown."\u000a\u000aThe "modern mindset" that you have to essentially be a "superhero in everything you do" is part of the problem, said Vanina Nikolova, a mom of two boys, ages 2½ and 6, in San Jose, California. Nikolova is the senior data analyst for Power to Fly, which connects women to remote opportunities in tech and prides itself on transforming how women are treated at work.\u000a\u000aShe said parenting burnout is so real that at times, she dreams someone would kidnap her for two weeks so she can finally get some rest from the kids, housework, co-sleeping with a toddler, food fights and everything else that comes along with raising two young boys.\u000a\u000a"You have to excel at work. You have to excel in your relationship. You have to excel in society. You have to be a great parent who feeds the kids with organic food, stimulates their brains while still in uterus, finds the right balance between protecting them and yet exposing them to the real world, shuttles them to sports, arts," and the list goes on and on, said Nikolova. "A supercomputer would go crazy. How about a simple human being!"\u000a\u000aParenting in social media age\u000a\u000aSocial media certainly hasn't helped, many parents said.\u000a\u000a"Gone are the days of backyard birthday parties with a homemade cake, a peanut hunt and a game of 'drop a clothes pin in the bottle,' " said Shelby Rideout, founder of Bright Signs Learning, a children's educational company that uses sign language to teach early reading concepts. "Thanks to Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram, parents now get to feel 'less than' for throwing that kind of party. These exaggerations on social media become a measuring stick in which to gauge your success or failure as a parent," said Rideout, a parent of four, ranging in age from 21 months to 6 years.\u000a\u000aParents exhaust themselves trying to keep up with the false standard of perfection they see around them, she said. "It doesn't seem to matter that these family portraits conjured up on social media do not offer a true depiction of what families are really going through. This is a perfect recipe for burnout."\u000a\u000aFor working parents, there is the pressure to excel in your career and master the work/life balance, while giving your children everything you never had to ensure that they turn into well-rounded, happy and successful adults, said writer Jennifer Bosse, a mom of two boys ages 4 and 6 in Fort Mill, South Carolina, who has contributed to the Huffington Post, Scary Mommy and Mamalode. For stay-at-home parents like herself, there are pressures too, she said.\u000a\u000a"There is the underlying need to feel valued and validated within society (a society which still places a higher value on what you provide to the job force)," she said. "Socializing with other adults can be difficult, the days long, the routine monotonous and the job, overall, relatively thankless."\u000a\u000aBosse, whose husband travels frequently for work, said she has definitely experienced burnout, and for her, the experience is one of a "complete shutdown."\u000a\u000a"I feel touched out, emotionally low and mentally blank. I am merely there," she said. What has helped her is finding outlets outside of home and openly communicating with her husband about her needs. "I was always afraid of saying I needed a break because I thought it would make me sound like a horrible mother, but as I progress in this journey, I realize that everyone needs time to realign."\u000a\u000aThe need for 'me' time\u000a\u000aFinding that "me" time is key, many parents said. Nikki Little, a mother of 4-year-old twin boys, said she and her husband agreed from day one that it is important that they both get time for themselves.\u000a\u000aThey recently trained for the same half-marathon and alternated their run days so one would run and the other would put the boys to bed. "My husband and I both want each other to feel like we can have our 'me' time without guilt -- which is why we encourage each other to take that time as needed, with the mutual agreement of not committing to so much that it takes significant time away from being together as a family," said Little, a social media director for a public relations firm.\u000a\u000aWhat pains her, she said, is when she hears from moms who say they truly do everything when it comes to parenting while their husbands enjoy plenty of "me" time.\u000a\u000a"That's not acceptable in my book. It is not a badge of honor to say you sacrifice everything for your family and put yourself last. Self-care and 'me' time are so, so important to avoid parental burnout," she said.\u000a\u000aJanis Brett Elspas had four children born in the same year, a singleton plus triplets, so she knows a thing or two about burnout. Up until the age of 3, her four kids were home with her all day. She remembers the relief she felt when her husband returned home from work and she could do basic things for herself that she was neglecting, like taking a shower, going to the dentist for an overdue appointment or even reading a book in a peaceful bedroom to get her energy back.\u000a\u000a"I just don't know how single parents raise their children without a second pair of hands to help. I'm convinced that there are few moms or dads out there who can deal with kids 24/7," said Elspas, founder of The Mommy Blog Expert.\u000a\u000aHer kids are now all grown and in college, but looking back, she thinks today's parents of young kids are even at higher risk for parental burnout than she was, in part because there are more single parents and households in which both parents need to work out of necessity. On top of that, there is the impact of technology.\u000a\u000a"Burnout is also fueled by the constant vigilance, the need to deal with the ever-increased speed of technology, the internet and all the dangers in the world we now have to protect our children against," she said.\u000a\u000aIs 'burnout' an excuse?\u000a\u000aMindee Hardin, a mom of six in Beaverton, Oregon, said that if parents are truly feeling "burnt out," they should examine why they are feeling that way and fix it as soon as possible. She worries that some parents may use it as an excuse to check out of engaging with their kids. She believes far too many parents are doing that already.\u000a\u000a"A large percentage of parents are already so selfish with the majority of their time being spent on many things besides investing in their kids, the last thing they need is one more excuse to disconnect the only hour a day they are engaging as it is," said Hardin, founder of Juice Box Consulting , where she helps moms make the best career choices for their family needs.\u000a\u000aShe says she overworked herself into a divorce and bankruptcy about seven years ago and has been trying not to make the same career, marriage and mothering mistakes in her second marriage. She wrote about her experience in her new book "Boogie Wiped: The Story of My Mom Life Crisis."\u000a\u000aShe believes the growing depression and suicide issues in tweens and teens is directly related to parents who "can't seem to enjoy their company long enough to have a meal with them once a day," she said. "Disconnected, overcommitted, exhausted parents + ignored, socially connected kids = a void so big in a child's heart it can't ever be filled," Hardin wrote in an email. "It's an epidemic in my opinion."\u000a\u000aLouise Sattler, a mom of two grown children, said the need to compete is driving some of the burnout parents feel today. "For some reason, we are not happy being 'just average,' " she said.\u000a\u000a"Moms in particular need to be 200% at everything. We need to give ourselves permission to be just 'average' at some parts of our lives and perhaps let other aspects go. That load of laundry can wait until tomorrow, as reading an extra bedtime story to your child is more important," said Sattler, co-founder of 411 Voices , a collective of professionals with social media experience.\u000a\u000aStern, the author of "Motherhood is a B#tch!" wholeheartedly agrees. "Everybody has to stop looking at everybody else and look to within," she said. "My kids this morning had Frosted Flakes for breakfast. They had sugary cereal. Now, the past two days, they had eggs, but today they didn't have eggs. ... Mothers, I'm sure, will come after me and say, 'Lyss Stern is a terrible mother, because she gave her kids Frosted Flakes for breakfast today,' but at the end of the day, it's OK."\u000a\u000aShe added, "We all need to let go of whatever that perfect image is in our heads and be content and happy with who we are and do the best job that we can do, because nobody knows what goes on behind anyone's closed doors at the end of the day."\u000a\u000aBurnout is certainly not just an issue for mothers. As the recent study revealed, almost the same number of fathers as mothers said they were experiencing high burnout.\u000a\u000aBuzz Bishop, a father of two, ages 7 and 9, jokes that he's just getting started with this thing called parenting. But he shares an interesting -- and hopefully helpful -- perspective about burnout.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Here's the thing about burnout: As soon as you're just about done, things change. An infant eventually learns to sleep through the night; a toddler will become toilet trained. When they walk, you don't have to pack a stroller when you go out. At meals, they eventually learn to feed themselves," said Bishop, a radio host in Calgary, Alberta, who writes about parenting at DadCAMP.\u000a\u000aIf you are feeling burned out as a parent, just hang in there, says Bishop. "The rules of the game will change soon enough, and you'll have an entirely different game to play, which may or may not be more fun. As my brother used to say, 'Whoever called them the terrible twos never had a 3-year-old.' "\u000a\u000aOr a tween or a teen, many parents might add.

aVSt. Augustine, Florida (CNN) When he was 11 years old, LJ Stroud of St. Augustine, Florida, had a tooth emerge in a place where no tooth belongs: the roof of his mouth.\u000a\u000aLJ was born with severe cleft lip and palate, which explained the strange eruption, as well as the constant ear infections that no antibiotic could remedy.\u000a\u000aWith her son in terrible pain, Meredith Stroud arranged for surgeries to fix his problems.\u000a\u000aBut just days before the procedures were to take place, the surgeons' office called to cancel them.\u000a\u000aLike nearly half of all children in Florida, LJ is on Medicaid, which has several types of insurance plans. The state had switched LJ to a new plan, and his surgeons didn't take it.\u000a\u000aLJ wasn't alone. In the spring and summer of 2015, the state switched more than 13,000 children out of a highly respected program called Children's Medical Services, or CMS, a part of Florida Medicaid. Children on this plan have serious health problems including birth defects, heart disease, diabetes and blindness.\u000a\u000aThe state moved the children to other Medicaid insurance plans that don't specialize in caring for very sick children.\u000a\u000aStroud says that for her son, the consequences were devastating. Despite hours of phone calls, she says, she couldn't find surgeons on his new insurance plan willing to do the highly specialized procedures he needed. Over the next seven months, her son lost 10 pounds, quit the football team and often missed school.\u000a\u000a"He was in pain every day," Stroud said. "I just felt so helpless. It's such a horrible feeling where you can't help your kid."\u000a\u000aLJ filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida, and he was eventually placed back on Children's Medical Services and received the care he needed. But some Florida pediatricians worry about other children with special health care needs who, two years later, are still off the program.\u000a\u000aThe doctors aren't just worried; they're angry.\u000a\u000aFirst, the data analysis the state used to justify switching the children is "inaccurate" and "bizarre," according to the researcher who wrote the software used in that analysis.\u000a\u000aSecond, the screening tool the state used to select which children would be kicked off the program has been called "completely invalid" and "a perversion of science" by top experts in children with special health care needs.\u000a\u000aThird, in fall 2015, a state administrative law judge ruled that the Department of Health should stop using the screening tool because it was unlawful. However, even after the judge issued his decision, the department didn't automatically re-enroll the children or even reach out to the families directly to let them know that re-enrollment was a possibility.\u000a\u000aFinally, parents and Florida pediatricians raise questions about the true reasons why Florida's Republican administration switched the children's health plans. They question whether it was to financially reward insurance companies that had donated millions of dollars to the Republican Party of Florida.\u000a\u000a"This was a way for the politicians to repay the entities that had contributed to their political campaigns and their political success, and it's the children who suffered," said Dr. Louis St. Petery, former executive vice president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\u000a\u000aExperts outside Florida are also disturbed that the children were switched out of CMS, a program that's served as a model for other states for more than 40 years.\u000a\u000a"CMS is well-known and well-respected," said Dr. James Perrin, professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. "It's one of the earlier programs to build in assurances that these kids get the kind of care they need."\u000a\u000a"These are the sickest and most vulnerable kids, and (changing their insurance) can mean life or death for them," said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. "This is really very troubling."\u000a\u000aDr. Rishi Agrawal, an associate professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, agreed, adding that Florida should have more carefully considered how the insurance switch would affect the children's health care.\u000a\u000a"The process in Florida was particularly abrupt and poorly executed," he said.\u000a\u000aMara Gambineri, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Health, said that "at no time (during the insurance switch) did children go without medically necessary services."\u000a\u000aState officials, including a spokesman for Governor Rick Scott's office, initially declined to comment directly on the pediatricians' and parents' concerns that the children might have been switched to benefit contributors to the Republican Party of Florida. On Friday, after this story was published, the Florida Department of Health released a statement asserting that such a claim "is 100 percent false."\u000a\u000a"The department's number one priority is protecting the health and well-being of all Florida residents, especially children with special health care needs," Gambineri wrote in an earlier email. "The department remains committed to providing quality health care services to Florida's children with special health care needs."\u000a\u000aA mother's anguish\u000a\u000aIn spring 2015, LJ's mother received a phone call from a nurse at the Florida Department of Health.\u000a\u000aStroud had no idea that one word she would say to that nurse -- just one single word -- would cause her son months of pain and suffering.\u000a\u000aMeredith Stroud's son, LJ, was born with cleft lip and palate. He lost his Children's Medical Service coverage when he was 11.\u000a\u000aThe nurse asked Stroud a series of questions, including whether LJ was limited in his ability to do things other children could do.\u000a\u000aDespite his birth defect, LJ goes to school and plays with friends, so she answered no.\u000a\u000aStroud says that because of that answer, LJ lost his insurance with CMS, the program that has cared for children with special health care needs in Florida for 40 years, and was put on a different Medicaid insurance plan.\u000a\u000aLJ was one of 13,074 Florida children kicked off CMS -- that's about one in five children in the program -- as a result of the telephone survey, according to a presentation testimony and a letter from Florida's top health officials.\u000a\u000aStroud thinks back to her answer to the nurse's question about limitations.\u000a\u000a"That question's not fair," Stroud said of the one that got her child kicked off CMS. "What [the Florida Department of Health] did was totally wrong."\u000a\u000a"It was a trick question," she added.\u000a\u000aPediatrician: 'A truly duplicitous question'\u000a\u000aExperts agree with her.\u000a\u000a"I personally find it pretty astonishing that they can take a survey question like that and use it to justify the de-enrolling of these kids," said Dr. Jay Berry, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School who studies policies for children with special health care needs.\u000a\u000aWhat Florida did was "completely invalid," added Dr. John Neff, professor emeritus of pediatrics at the University of Washington, another expert on children with special health care needs.\u000a\u000aThe pediatricians explained that many children with serious and chronic medical conditions -- such as cleft lip and palate, HIV, diabetes and cystic fibrosis -- are often able to do things other children can do. However, they still require extensive and highly specialized medical care.\u000a\u000aThe question the Florida Department of Health nurses asked -- "Is your child limited or prevented in any way in his or her ability to do the things most children of the same age can do?" -- would lead to disqualifying children who truly have special medical needs from a program designed for them, said Stephen Blumberg, associate director for science at the National Center for Health Statistics and one of the world's leading experts on the epidemiology of children with special health care needs.\u000a\u000aQuestion No. 3 "Is your child limited or prevented in any way in his or her ability to do the things most children of the same age can do?"\u000a\u000a"You would get false negatives. Your conclusion would be that a child does not have special health care needs when, in fact, the child does," he added.\u000a\u000aThe Department of Health no longer uses the same screening method that resulted in 13,074 children being removed from CMS.\u000a\u000a"It is unfortunate the negativity surrounding this issue is a continued topic of inquiry, as the department and our stakeholders have put in a significant amount of time and effort to move past this issue for the benefit of the children we serve," wrote Gambineri, the Department of Health spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aBut pediatricians in Florida point out that many children who were removed from Children's Medical Services using the controversial questionnaire were never put back on.\u000a\u000a"This was a truly duplicitous question," said Dr. Philip Colaizzo, a pediatrician in Jupiter, Florida, who said that many of his patients with special health care needs were taken off CMS. "It was a trick question."\u000a\u000a"It's a perversion of science," said Dr. Jeffrey Goldhagen, professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine and medical director of the Bower Lyman Center for Medically Complex Children at Wolfson Children's Hospital.\u000a\u000aGoldhagen added that he was speaking for himself and not the institutions where he works.\u000a\u000a"It was a scam job," added Dr. Nancy Wright, a pediatric endocrinologist in Tallahassee who said that dozens of her patients with diabetes were removed from the program.\u000a\u000aDr. Nancy Wright, a pediatric endocrinologist, says dozens of her patients lost their coverage on Children's Medical Services. "For the children with diabetes that I work with, it was a disaster," she said.\u000a\u000a"They really tried their darnedest to kick the kids out of CMS," added Dr. Carrol Fenn, an orthodontist in West Palm Beach. "They've messed up kids' lives."\u000a\u000a"They're the most vulnerable of our population, and that they can be booted off the plan that was designed to help them is just amazing. How can someone in an office make a decision like that?" asked Dr. John Obi, an adjunct clinical professor in plastic surgery at the University of Florida, who operates on children with cleft lip and palate.\u000a\u000a"I congratulate whoever came up with that question," he added wryly. "If you want to exclude virtually anybody, that's the way to do it."\u000a\u000aJohns Hopkins expert: 'I'm speechless'\u000a\u000aChristina Bethell's team came up with that question -- and she's furious.\u000a\u000aBethell is a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She and her team spent many years and millions of dollars coming up with the right questions to accurately identify children across the United States who might have special health care needs.\u000a\u000aThe list of questions -- known as the Children with Special Health Care Needs Screener -- is publicly available on the Hopkins website. Many state and federal agencies use it to help decide which children might benefit from special health services.\u000a\u000aThe Florida Department of Health, however, used the questions to do something completely different: to kick children out of a program.\u000a\u000aThat's scientifically invalid, Bethell said. Using the questions that way -- especially the question about limitations -- would lead to denying children with special health care needs the services they require.\u000a\u000a"I'm speechless," she said.\u000a\u000aTo make matters worse, Bethell said, Florida repeatedly and publicly cited research done by her group at Hopkins -- the Children and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative -- to support the children's removal from CMS.\u000a\u000a"I feel really manipulated," she said.\u000a\u000aShe thinks of the children who were taken off CMS and fumes that the tool used to remove them was her own work.\u000a\u000a"I'm angry," she said. "And I'm crestfallen for these families."\u000a\u000aGrave consequences for Florida children\u000a\u000aThe Shabanehs in Tallahassee are one of those families.\u000a\u000aAref Shabaneh, 8, is blind, and his sister, Yasmeen, 11, is severely visually impaired. Their mother, Reema Shabaneh, says they were kicked off CMS in 2015.\u000a\u000aShabaneh says she told the Florida Department of Health nurse that they didn't have limitations.\u000a\u000a"Aref wants to do everything by himself," she said. "He can play ball with friends. The ball has a bell, so he can hear it coming."\u000a\u000aAfter they were kicked off CMS, Shabaneh said, she couldn't find an ophthalmologist on the new insurance plan willing to care for her children.\u000a\u000a"I was so scared," she said.\u000a\u000aWhen Jennifer Rodriguez received the phone call from the Department of Health nurse, she said, she told the nurse she didn't know how to answer the question about limitations. Her son, Alejandro, suffers from a congenital heart defect, asthma and kidney problems. Sometimes, his heart races and he has trouble breathing, but other times, he feels up to playing soccer with his friends.\u000a\u000a"When I tried to explain the answer, she cut me off and said she was just doing her job and needed a yes or a no," she said.\u000a\u000aRodriguez says she answered that her son, who was 10 at the time, did not have limitations. He then lost his CMS coverage.\u000a\u000a"It makes me angry, because you would think that since he's seeing a cardiologist, a nephrologist, a urologist and an asthma doctor, they would see he's not your average child," she said.\u000a\u000aLJ, Alejandro and the Shabaneh children filed lawsuits and were put back on CMS. They were represented by the Public Interest Law Center at Florida State University.\u000a\u000aAlejandro Rodriguez wears a nebulizer mask to help him breathe. After he filed a lawsuit, the state put him back on Children's Medical Services.\u000a\u000aMany Florida pediatricians say their patients also suffered when they were taken off CMS and put on other Medicaid plans. The doctors say those other plans typically have fewer pediatric specialists than CMS, which specializes in caring for very sick children.\u000a\u000aDr. Lisa Cosgrove, a pediatrician in Merritt Island, Florida, said she had a difficult time finding an orthopedist to treat a 6-year-old with a broken elbow who had been taken off CMS. The girl ended up having surgery later than she should have and now can't extend her elbow all the way.\u000a\u000aShe said a baby born with a clubfoot also suffered because she couldn't find an orthopedist willing to take the baby's plan. The baby couldn't have the necessary casts to twist the foot back into place and may need surgery, Cosgrove said.\u000a\u000aDr. Elizabeth Curry, a pediatrician in Port St. Joe, Florida, said that last year, she took care of a baby whose eye wiggled back and forth involuntarily, which can be a sign of a brain tumor.\u000a\u000aCurry said it took her more than a month to find an ophthalmologist willing to take the baby's Medicaid plan -- and the doctor she finally found was three hours away, in Pensacola.\u000a\u000aFortunately, the baby turned out to be fine.\u000a\u000a"This child could have had cancer. That's a kid who should have seen a doctor right away," Curry said. "I feel terrible for these children. It makes me so angry."\u000a\u000aDr. Elizabeth Curry, a Florida pediatrician, says some of her patients didn't get the treatment they needed because the state had removed them from Children's Medical Services.\u000a\u000aBecause of problems like these, switching the children's insurance "was a complete dereliction of Florida's responsibility to children," said Goldhagen, the professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine.\u000a\u000aGambineri, the spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Health, said the children didn't suffer as a result of the switch, because the insurance plans they were moved to were "more than capable" of caring for them. She added that even before the 13,074 children were switched, those plans cared for tens of thousands of children with special health needs.\u000a\u000aOther pediatricians agree that plans besides CMS have done a good job of caring for these very sick children.\u000a\u000aThe other plans "do a pretty good job with our families," said Dr. Karalee Kulek-Luzey, medical director of the Pediatric Health Care Alliance, a group practice with multiple locations in the Tampa area. "They're working really hard."\u000a\u000a"For the most part, they do a good job," said Dr. Michael Freimark, a pediatrician in Plantation, Florida.\u000a\u000a"We have a good relationship with the plans," said Dr. Michael Gervasi, president and chief executive officer of the Florida Community Health Centers, a large medical practice with offices in several counties. Most of the time, he said, the plans take care of the children's needs, but if there's ever a problem, his practice contacts the plan, and they fix it.\u000a\u000aAref's older sister, Yasmeen Shabaneh, was also was removed from Children's Medical Services. She has a vision condition so serious that even a minor bump could cause her retinas to detach.\u000a\u000aFlorida's 'outreach' to experts\u000a\u000aIn January 2016, about eight months after the Florida Department of Health started to move the 13,074 children out of CMS, Jennifer Tschetter, then the department's chief operating officer, testified before the state legislature. She said that the decision to use the Hopkins screening tool was made "in consultation with ... national experts."\u000a\u000aBut it remains unclear who those experts were.\u000a\u000aTschetter, who has since left state government, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.\u000a\u000aGambineri, the Florida health department spokeswoman, said the department did "research" into what Louisiana, California, Texas and New York "were doing and experiences they had in regard to clinical eligibility for children with special health care needs."\u000a\u000aWhen asked for the names of individuals Florida consulted in those states, Gambineri didn't respond.\u000a\u000aGambineri added that "outreach" was made to the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.\u000a\u000aAn official at that agency said she spoke with a Florida health official.\u000a\u000aDr. Marie Mann, senior medical adviser in the Division of Services for Children with Special Health Needs at the federal agency's Maternal and Child Health Bureau, said she spoke with Kelli Stannard, then interim chief, bureau of network operations, at CMS.\u000a\u000aMann says she told Stannard she couldn't give her any guidance.\u000a\u000a"I told her I was not in a position to provide advice," Mann said.\u000a\u000aMann said she suggested that Florida health officials reach out to Daniel Armstrong and Dr. Jeffrey Brosco, director and associate director respectively of the Mailman Center for Child Development at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\u000a\u000a"We will make sure they're both involved in this review process," Stannard wrote back to Mann in an email obtained by CNN under the Freedom of Information Act.\u000a\u000aCNN asked Gambineri, the department spokeswoman, whether the department ever reached out to Armstrong to review and make recommendations on using the telephone survey to screen children out of CMS.\u000a\u000a"Not to our knowledge," Gambineri answered.\u000a\u000a"I played no role in the decision-making process related to the use of the tool for the Children's Medical Services program," Armstrong wrote in an email to CNN.\u000a\u000aBrosco said he told the Department of Health that in his opinion, a child should not be kicked off CMS based on a parent's answer to the question about the child's limitations.\u000a\u000a"I gave them my feedback, and they said, 'thank you for your work,' " Brosco said.\u000a\u000aIn July, Brosco was named the Florida Department of Health's deputy secretary for CMS.\u000a\u000aChristmas shopping at the Florida Mall\u000a\u000aDespite the lack of support from the very experts they'd consulted, Florida health officials forged ahead with using the phone survey to disqualify children from CMS.\u000a\u000aThey had a schedule to stick to.\u000a\u000aIn November 2014, state officials set out to "go live" with the phone survey in six months, according to a timeline developed by the state and obtained by CNN under the Freedom of Information Act.\u000a\u000aBefore implementing the surveys, the officials gave themselves 21 days to "solicit feedback from the field" about the questions they would ask the parents.\u000a\u000aOne of the first things they did was to ask one of the state's most experienced pediatricians to leave a meeting.\u000a\u000aIt was St. Petery, who at the time was the executive vice president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and who has an encyclopedic knowledge of Medicaid rules and regulations. He'd served as interim director of CMS for six months during the mid-1970s.\u000a\u000aHe'd also been a thorn in the side of the state Department of Health for years. He'd been instrumental in a lawsuit that accused the state of failing to reimburse doctors properly in the Medicaid program and to ensure that children receive adequate care.\u000a\u000aHis side eventually won that lawsuit, and the American Academy of Pediatrics gave him a prestigious award for being "a tireless advocate for children's health and well-being."\u000a\u000aDr. Louis St. Petery, a pediatric cardiologist and frequent critic of Florida's health policy, was asked to leave a state meeting where Children's Medical Services screening was discussed.\u000a\u000aOn December 13, 2014, St. Petery showed up at the Department of Health meeting. It was for the regional medical directors of CMS, the group of pediatricians who help run the program. St. Petery wasn't one of the directors, but he'd been attending their meetings for many years in his role with the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\u000a\u000aSt. Petery said that just before the meeting started, Tschetter, then the department's chief operating officer, approached him.\u000a\u000a"She said, didn't I want to go Christmas shopping at the Florida Mall?" St. Petery remembered. The mall was adjacent to the conference center in Orlando where the meeting was taking place.\u000a\u000aSt. Petery said he told Tschetter that he hates shopping, especially around the holidays, and wanted to stay at the meeting.\u000a\u000a"I protested. I asked her, is this meeting not in the sunshine?" he said, referring to Florida's Sunshine Law, which gives the public the right to access most government meetings.\u000a\u000a"After she told me for the third time to leave, I decided not to create a scene," he said.\u000a\u000aSt. Petery got up and left.\u000a\u000aOther doctors watched the action, stunned.\u000a\u000a"We were all kind of shaking," said Dr. Barbara Rumberger, one of the CMS regional medical directors who attended the meeting.\u000a\u000aAfter St. Petery departed, health officials explained that they would start screening children off of CMS. Their justification: a new analysis showing that half the children on CMS might not belong there.\u000a\u000aThere are no minutes for this meeting, according to Department of Health officials, but a year later, Tschetter presented similar data to the Florida Legislature.\u000a\u000aA 'totally inaccurate' analysis\u000a\u000aBy Florida law , a child can be in CMS only if he or she has a "chronic and serious" condition requiring health care "of a type or amount beyond that which is generally required by children."\u000a\u000aThe analysis Tschetter presented showed that about half of the children on CMS had lower than average risk scores, an assessment of how much a patient uses health care services.\u000a\u000aTschetter called these results "surprising." By legislative mandate, children on CMS are supposed to have health needs greater those of other children.\u000a\u000a"The analysis made clear, certainly to the department, that we were not meeting legislative direction: (that) the children in the plan have both chronic and serious health care conditions," Tschetter told legislators. "It was clear to the department that something had to be done, because complying with legislative direction is certainly not optional."\u000a\u000aBut an expert who developed the software Florida used to make that data analysis said the state did its calculations incorrectly.\u000a\u000a"It was clear to the department that something had to be done." Jennifer Tschetter, former chief operating officer, Florida Department of Health\u000a\u000a"It's totally inaccurate," said Todd Gilmer, co-developer of the Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System and chief of the division of health policy at the University of California, San Diego.\u000a\u000aGilmer's software, which is used by dozens of state Medicaid programs, tracks patients' diagnoses and their prescription drug use to calculate risk scores for each individual.\u000a\u000aAfter viewing Florida officials' analysis of the data, he said they made two errors when they calculated that half the children on CMS had below-average risk scores.\u000a\u000aFirst, he explained that his software relies on doctors' diagnoses, and Florida failed to account for the fact that doctors frequently don't document a child's full diagnosis in the medical record. For example, if a quadriplegic child goes to the doctor because of bedsores, doctors often write down the reason the child came in -- the bedsores -- instead of the more serious diagnosis of quadriplegia.\u000a\u000aSecond, he said, Florida did the wrong calculation for disabled children, who represent 40% of the patients on CMS, according to Mallory McManus, a spokeswoman for Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration.\u000a\u000aHe said his software compares disabled children with each other. Even the ones who fall in the lower half of the risk-score spectrum still have serious and chronic illnesses, he said, such as HIV or heart failure.\u000a\u000aHe said that what Florida did was akin to assembling a group of people who are over 7 feet tall and calling the bottom half of that group short.\u000a\u000aGilmer called Florida's analysis "kind of bizarre" and said he was disappointed to see his software "misapplied" by the Florida Department of Health.\u000a\u000aSpokeswomen for the Florida Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration did not respond directly to Gilmer's criticism.\u000a\u000aGambineri, the health department spokeswoman, said that the department no longer uses the screening method that it used in 2015 and that parents can ask to have their children re-screened at any time.\u000a\u000a"Our mission is now and has always been to provide the best health care possible to the populations that we serve," McManus wrote in an email.\u000a\u000aPediatrician: 'We were just irrelevant'\u000a\u000aPediatricians say that by the time the Department of Health meeting was held at the Orlando conference center at the end of 2014, they felt like Florida was dead-set on screening a large number of children off CMS.\u000a\u000aThey said state officials didn't listen to their concerns, even though they were stated repeatedly, both in person and in writing.\u000a\u000aAt the meeting, health officials asked the pediatricians to tell them what was on their minds, according to Rumberger, one of the doctors who was there.\u000a\u000aShe said she and her colleagues brought up concerns that children might be taken off CMS inappropriately.\u000a\u000aThe Department of Health official wrote down what the doctors said on pieces of paper taped to the wall, Rumberger said. The official then told the doctors that these were issues to discuss at another time.\u000a\u000a"She said, 'We're going to park these. We're putting these ideas in the parking lot for some time, and we're not talking about these things today,' " Rumberger remembered, adding that she was speaking on behalf of herself and not in her role as a CMS regional medical director.\u000a\u000a"We were all amazed at what they did," she added.\u000a\u000aA few months later, the state held a series of telephone conference calls with the same CMS regional medical directors.\u000a\u000a"They didn't ask us 'What do you think?' or 'Do you have any suggestions?' " Rumberger said. "It was just 'This is how we're going to do it.' It was clear they didn't want to have a free discussion."\u000a\u000a"It appears to be a very conscious decision to not get input and not receive any dissension," said Goldhagen, the professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida. "We were just irrelevant."\u000a\u000aDr. Rex Northup, another CMS regional medical director and associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine, agrees.\u000a\u000a"It was like, 'When we want your opinion on a given topic, we'll let you know, and we'll provide that opinion to you,' " Northup said, adding that he speaks for himself and not the university or any other institution.\u000a\u000aSeveral doctors present on those conference calls said they voiced their concerns anyway.\u000a\u000aThere's no record of these concerns. According to the Florida Department of Health, no minutes were taken of these phone conferences.\u000a\u000aCNN asked the Florida Department of Health about the meeting where St. Petery was asked to leave and about doctors' complaints that the state steamrolled through a screening tool that would harm sick children.\u000a\u000a"When CMS began the process of implementing a new screening tool in 2014, the department may have underestimated the need for stakeholder input and the time required to obtain feedback and ensure our community was comfortable with the mechanisms for determining clinical eligibility," responded Gambineri, the Department of Health spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aShe added that the department has "engaged our stakeholders using several methods" including public meetings to solicit input from patients, parents and providers and "remains open to feedback and input in order to best serve children with serious and chronic medical conditions."\u000a\u000aTrue to its schedule, the state started screening children off CMS in May 2015.\u000a\u000aFlorida pediatricians repeatedly told the state that it was hurting sick, vulnerable children.\u000a\u000aIn August 2015, Goldhagen, Rumberger, Northup and 11 other doctors with positions at CMS wrote a letter to a Department of Health official saying the screening process was "flawed" and was removing too many children.\u000a\u000aThe doctors did not receive a response, Goldhagen said.\u000a\u000aTwo months later, St. Petery wrote to Department of Health officials, sharply criticizing the use of the screening tool.\u000a\u000aHe said he never received a response, either.\u000a\u000aDr. Elizabeth Curry, examining Micah Creamer, says she wrote to the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, expressing her concerns about patients being kicked off Children's Medical Services, but the agency didn't respond.\u000a\u000aCurry, the Port Saint Joe pediatrician who practices in a rural area of the Florida Panhandle, said she also complained to the state's Agency for Health Care Administration about children being kicked off CMS, along with other issues affecting children on Medicaid.\u000a\u000aShe said the agency worked with her on some of the other issues but didn't respond to her complaints about the children being taken off CMS.\u000a\u000a"Our Agency has been in contact with the provider and is working with the health plan to resolve what issues might be resolved," wrote McManus, the agency spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aCurry said she took her complaints even higher.\u000a\u000a"I even called the governor's office once and left a message," she said. "I admit that I finally gave up. I'm just trying to take care of my patients."\u000a\u000aPediatricians interviewed for this story said they felt pressure from the state not to speak to the media about the removal of the children from CMS.\u000a\u000aOn November 15, 2016, Dr. John Curran, then the Florida Department of Health's deputy secretary for CMS, said on a conference call that a CNN reporter was working on this story, according to several doctors on the call.\u000a\u000aThat evening, a department official wrote an email to the doctors who'd been on the call. It advised these pediatricians that prior to responding to media inquiries, they should contact the department's communications director.\u000a\u000a"I'm going to be so fired for saying all these things," Rumberger said.\u000a\u000aBut she and other pediatricians say they're speaking up because they feel that the Department of Health hurt children because they didn't listen to their concerns.\u000a\u000aThey say it could be because pediatricians don't tend to have millions of dollars to donate to political campaigns.\u000a\u000aBut insurance companies do.\u000a\u000a'Like a plot in a Carl Hiaasen novel'\u000a\u000aAll of this -- the telephone survey, the question about limitations, the analysis that's been called flawed -- leaves many Florida parents and pediatricians suspicious about why the state wanted to take 13,074 children off CMS and why it worked so hard and so quickly to do it.\u000a\u000aSwitching the children from CMS to the other Medicaid plans didn't save taxpayers money, according to McManus, the agency spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aThe doctors wonder, then, whether the inspiration for the change was political: to send taxpayers' dollars to generous donors to the Florida Republican Party.\u000a\u000aCMS is a public program; it's not owned by a private insurance company.\u000a\u000aWhen the children were taken off CMS, they were switched to 11 insurance plans that are owned by private companies. The parent companies of nine of those 11 plans donated a total of more than $8 million to Florida Republican Party committees in the five years before the children were switched.\u000a\u000a"I knew it had to be about money," said Wright, the pediatric endocrinologist in Tallahassee who said that dozens of her patients had their insurance switched. "This sounds very believable for Florida, and I'm from Florida."\u000a\u000a"When this was all unfolding, I told my office manager, 'I feel like we're in a plot in a Carl Hiaasen novel,' " she added, referring to the Miami Herald columnist who writes about politics and corruption in Florida.\u000a\u000aDr. Nancy Wright, a pediatric endocrinologist, says she thinks the state's motivation for taking patients off Children's Medical Services "appears to be about money. ... It's clearly not medical."\u000a\u000aThe companies that own the nine insurance plans contributed $8.6 million to Florida Republican Party committees from 2010 to 2014, according to an analysis done for CNN by the National Institute on Money in State Politics , a nonpartisan nonprofit group.\u000a\u000aHere's a breakdown of how much money each insurance company with a Medicaid contract contributed to Florida Republican Party committees from 2010 to 2014:\u000a\u000a$5.9 million from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida. Florida True Health is an affiliate of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida. At the time the money was contributed, Florida True Health owned 40% of Prestige Health Choice, which has a Medicaid contract with the state of Florida. In 2015, Florida True Health purchased Prestige outright.\u000a\u000aContributions between $232,500 and $668,082 from each of six insurance plans and their parent companies that have contracts with Florida Medicaid: Amerigroup, UnitedHealthcare of Florida, Humana, Sunshine State Health Plan, Aetna and WellCare. WellCare's Florida Medicaid policy is marketed under the name Staywell.\u000a\u000a$90,000 from Simply Health, which owns a Medicaid plan called Better Health.\u000a\u000a$849,433 from Miguel Fernandez, the former chairman of Simply Health. In addition, Fernandez donated about $1.3 million to Scott's Let's Get to Work political action committee from 2010 to 2014.\u000a\u000aInsurance companies' outsize contributions to Florida Republicans\u000a\u000aNearly all states pay insurance companies to insure some of their Medicaid patients; this is not unique to Florida.\u000a\u000aAnd insurance companies often contribute money to state political parties. That's not unique to Florida, either.\u000a\u000aWhat is unusual is the size of the contributions, even for a large state.\u000a\u000aTake UnitedHealthcare, an insurance giant with business in all 50 states. From 2010 to 2014, United contributed $442,500 to Florida Republican Party committees, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.\u000a\u000aThe company's next largest contribution to any other state political party was $145,000 to California Democrats -- less than half the Florida amount.\u000a\u000aHumana, another insurance company with a national reach, gave substantially more money to Florida Republican Party committees than to any other state political party committees.\u000a\u000aFrom 2010 to 2014, Humana donated $482,815 to Florida Republican Party committees. Its next largest contribution was $213,823 to Florida Democrats. The next largest contribution after that was $22,000 to the Illinois GOP, less than one-20th the size of the contribution to Florida Republicans.\u000a\u000aBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida gave Florida Republican Party committees $5.9 million from 2010 to 2014 and gave Florida Democrats $1.8 million . The next largest contribution after that from any other Blue Cross and Blue Shield company in the United States was $730,696 from Blue Shield of California to Democrats in that state -- about one-eighth the size of the contribution to Florida Republicans.\u000a\u000aFlorida's payments to the insurance companies\u000a\u000aNearly all states pay private insurance companies monthly premiums to insure Medicaid patients. It's become big business.\u000a\u000aThe Florida Department of Health declined to say how much it paid the private insurance companies to insure the 13,074 children when they were switched out of CMS.\u000a\u000a"If they got 13,000 new kids, (it's) that times however many dollars per member per month," St. Petery said. "I think that's a lot of money when you start talking about that many kids."\u000a\u000aLJ Stroud sued the state of Florida to be put back on Children's Medical Services. He has now had the procedures that he needs.\u000a\u000aThese children came from CMS, a Medicaid program for sick children, and the state pays insurance companies more money to care for such children.\u000a\u000aThis is how it works, according to McManus, the spokeswoman for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration.\u000a\u000aFlorida takes a look at all the people who've signed up with an insurance company and calculates a risk score for that group based on factors such as the age of the enrollees in the plan and their health conditions.\u000a\u000aA plan with the lowest risk score has a "typical population" and might be paid a rate of, for example, $320 per person per month, McManus said. A plan with sicker enrollees might have a risk score that's twice as high and so would be paid $640 per person per month, she added.\u000a\u000aThe numbers can get even higher from there.\u000a\u000a"The state will pay a pretty good rate for these children," said Agrawal, the pediatrician at Northwestern who studies health care systems for children with special medical needs.\u000a\u000a"They could get paid thousands more per month for a child with serious medical needs," said Steve Schramm, founder and managing director of Optumas, a health care consulting group.\u000a\u000a"The enhanced reimbursement may be 10 times what the insurance companies get for a well child," said Goldhagen, former director of Florida's Duval County Health Department.\u000a\u000aYasmeen Shabaneh sued Florida and was placed back on Children's Medical Services.\u000a\u000aSick children are, of course, also costlier for insurance companies because they need more care. But insurance plans monitor that care to manage costs.\u000a\u000a"Plans have gotten very sophisticated in their ability to manage very sick kids, so their willingness to take very sick kids is great," said Jeff Myers, president and CEO of Medicaid Health Plans of America, an industry group representing insurance companies.\u000a\u000aPediatricians questioned whether such outsize political donations were an attempt to gain influence and favor with Florida's Republican administration, which orchestrated the transfer of the children out of CMS and to the private companies.\u000a\u000a"It certainly raises a lot of suspicion and concern," said Northup, the associate professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine.\u000a\u000a"Why would they make contributions in the hundreds of thousands and the millions to Florida Republicans? Why would they be so uniquely committed to Republicans in Florida? It gives one pause," he added. "If you follow the money, at the very least, it's worrisome."\u000a\u000a"It's the left-hand-washing-the-right-hand kind of business," said Dr. Joseph Chiaro, who was Florida's deputy secretary of health from 2005 to 2011. "It breaks my heart."\u000a\u000aSix Florida pediatricians gathered in Orlando to tell CNN their concerns. They practice in rural, suburban and urban areas. Some of them are Republicans, and others are Democrats.\u000a\u000aThey said they feared that big donors had influence on the state's decision-making process and that in many cases, the children suffered as a result.\u000a\u000a"I don't see this in writing anywhere, but my impression is, this was a way for political payback at the expense of the sickest of the Medicaid children," St. Petery said.\u000a\u000a"It just comes back to money or power. It's not about health care for the children," said Wright, the pediatric endocrinologist in Tallahassee.\u000a\u000a"Just follow the money," said Colaizzo, who runs a rural health care clinic in Pahokee, Florida.\u000a\u000aState leaders "don't give a damn about the kids. They don't give a damn about the families," said Dr. Marcy Howard, a pediatrician in Crystal River, Florida.\u000a\u000aState officials and insurance companies respond\u000a\u000aMcManus, the spokeswoman for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, wrote in an email."The Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program was designed to provide comprehensive care to recipients through high quality health plans with a payment structure designed to ensure that plans paid an appropriate rate based on the health conditions of those enrolled in their plan."\u000a\u000a"The program currently covers more than 2 million of Florida's children, offers the strongest provider network and access standards in program history, and provides families with a choice of high quality, nationally accredited plans so that they can choose the plan that best suits their needs, including specialty plans for those who qualify," she added.\u000a\u000aCNN reached out to officials at all nine insurance companies. Two responded.\u000a\u000a"WellCare contributes to a variety of organizations that shape health care policy, including the Florida Republican Party committees, the Democratic Party committees and those without political affiliation," wrote Alissa Lawver, a spokeswoman for WellCare. "The company also discloses and publicly reports all political contributions on its website above and beyond the requirements of state and federal law. As a provider of managed care, WellCare is committed to partnering with the state of Florida to provide access to quality, affordable health care solutions for the state's most vulnerable populations. We maintain a robust provider network and offer comprehensive care management services to create personalized, coordinated care plans to help improve and maintain the health of families and children across the state."\u000a\u000aShe added that WellCare has accountability to Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, "which provides careful oversight of the state's Medicaid program to ensure all members, including children that transitioned from Children's Medical Services, receive access to the right care, at the right time and in the most appropriate setting."\u000a\u000aEthan Slavin, a spokesman for Aetna, said the company makes "donations to campaigns for both major political parties to support and address issues that impact our customers and members."\u000a\u000aHe added that "we are required to meet state rules and regulations regarding our network of health care providers and are consistently compliant with those requirements" and that "we regularly work with our members, health care providers and the state of Florida to move children with special health care needs into the Children's Medical Services program, when appropriate and in the best interest of our members. Our integrated care management program regularly identifies these children and assists in this process."\u000a\u000aMiguel "Mike" Fernandez, founder and former chairman of Better Health, said he had contributed several million dollars to both Republicans and Democrats. He added that states move Medicaid patients into the care of private companies so they can "move the risk off their financial books."\u000a\u000aA victory for Florida families\u000a\u000aMany pediatricians use strong language to describe their anger and frustration with the Florida Department of Health and what it did in 2015 to the 13,074 children.\u000a\u000a"This has just been a nightmare, and we're still experiencing the fallout," said Dr. Toni Richards-Rowley, treasurer of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\u000a\u000a"It's disgusting," said Cosgrove, the pediatrician in Merritt Island. "It's all about money and not looking out for the children."\u000a\u000a"Honestly, it makes me want to puke," said Lida Sarnecky, nurse manager of the team at the University of Florida that takes care of children with cleft lip and palate.\u000a\u000a"In my heart, what I want to do is go down to Governor Scott's office and ask him, 'What if this were your child or grandchild who couldn't receive the care they needed? How would you feel then?' " she said.\u000a\u000aBy June 2015, some Florida parents had had enough.\u000a\u000aFive children, including Alejandro Rodriguez, and Yasmeen and Aref Shabaneh, sued the state Department of Health to get it to stop using the telephone questionnaire to take patients off CMS, claiming that the state Department of Health hadn't gone through formal rulemaking procedures.\u000a\u000aThe children won.\u000a\u000aThe state didn't fight the ruling. Instead, it came up with a new way to screen children for the program -- one that doesn't rely on a telephone survey and takes into consideration a child's diagnosis.\u000a\u000aAref Shabaneh lost his Children's Medical Services coverage when his mother told the state he didn't have limitations. "Aref wants to do everything by himself," she said.\u000a\u000aMany parents and pediatricians assumed the state would soon reach out directly to parents to let them know they could reapply to have their children put back on CMS.\u000a\u000aThey were very wrong.\u000a\u000aFive months after the judge's decision, St. Petery, the Tallahassee pediatric cardiologist, implored the secretary of the Department of Health to reach out to parents.\u000a\u000aTo St. Petery, the reasoning was obvious: A judge had said that the state had violated the law. Reaching out to the parents was a way of correcting wrongdoing.\u000a\u000aThe state had a notice on its website about the ability to be rescreened for CMS, and at a meeting with state legislators, a department official had given out a phone number parents could call. But St. Petery knew that busy parents of very sick children might not attend official state meetings or notice pages on government websites.\u000a\u000a"I would hope that you would consider notifying each of the parents of those 13,074 children that the tool by which their child was screened out of CMS has been declared invalid, and that they have the right to appeal that decision," St. Petery wrote to Dr. John Armstrong, then secretary of the Department of Health and the state surgeon general.\u000a\u000aArmstrong wrote back that doing so would violate federal regulations, since the children had been switched to other Medicaid insurance plans.\u000a\u000a"Federal regulations prohibit direct marketing to children currently being served by another managed care plan," he wrote back to St. Petery.\u000a\u000aCNN was unable to reach Armstrong for comment. Gambineri, the Florida Department of Health spokeswoman, said he "is no longer employed by DOH."\u000a\u000aNot satisfied with Armstrong's response, St. Petery sought help from US Rep. Kathy Castor, a Democrat from Tampa. Castor took his concerns to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\u000a\u000aOn March 23, 2016, an official at that agency sent an email to Justin Senior, then the Medicaid director at Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration. CNN obtained the email under the Freedom of Information Act.\u000a\u000aIn that email, the federal official explained to Senior that federal regulations do not prohibit Florida from reaching out directly to families.\u000a\u000a"To clarify, 42 CFR 438.104 does not prohibit marketing," wrote Jackie Glaze, associate regional administrator for the Division of Medicaid and Children's Health at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, citing a federal regulation.\u000a\u000aMore than a year later, on July 24, 2017, the Florida Department of Health sent a letter to parents letting them know that their children could be screened to get back on CMS. The letter was sent to 6,081 parents whose children were removed from CMS and put on another Medicaid plan and were still on that plan and financially eligible for Medicaid, according to Gambineri, the Florida health department spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aThat letter was sent nearly two years after the judge's decision. Pediatricians say they're angry it took that long to directly let parents know about the possibility of getting back on CMS.\u000a\u000aGambineri said there was concern that parents might get confused.\u000a\u000a"It was originally thought to be, and still is considered a risk, in terms of confusion and disruption to families, to send a letter because they have had rescreening available since 2015," Gambineri said a few months before the letter was sent out.\u000a\u000aNelson Mandela and Mr. Rogers\u000a\u000aNow that LJ Stroud is back on CMS, he's a happy, strapping 13-year-old who loves to play football and horse around with his brother and sisters in the family's backyard in St. Augustine.\u000a\u000aBut his mother looks back on the dark days in 2015, after her son was switched off CMS, when she says he would lie on the couch in pain, unable to get the surgeries he needed.\u000a\u000aIt's not just her son's physical pain that makes Stroud angry; it's his emotional pain.\u000a\u000aSince LJ Stroud was placed back on Children's Medical Services, he's been able to play football again.\u000a\u000aWhen LJ was on CMS, Stroud says, he received excellent care and was a contented, well-adjusted child, never thinking of himself as different despite his birth defect.\u000a\u000aBut she says that when he was in pain because he couldn't have surgery, he started to feel sorry for himself.\u000a\u000a" 'Why did God make me this way?' " she says he asked. " 'Why can't I be like my brothers and sisters?' "\u000a\u000aWhen she hears about how top Florida officials have spoken with pride of what they did to her son and to more than 13,000 other children, she becomes livid.\u000a\u000aLast year, Armstrong, then Florida's surgeon general and secretary of health, made a presentation to the Florida Children and Youth Cabinet, a panel created by the state Legislature to promote children's welfare.\u000a\u000aDeclaring that the Department of Health "cares about every child in Florida," Armstrong explained how the state removed the 13,074 children from CMS.\u000a\u000aArmstrong's presentation quoted two great advocates for children, Nelson Mandela and Fred Rogers.\u000a\u000aFirst, he quoted Mandela: "There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children."\u000a\u000aAnd he quoted Fred Rogers, the star of the children's television show "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood": "Anyone who does anything to help a child in life is a hero to me."\u000a\u000aStroud struggles for words to describe what she thinks of Armstrong quoting these two champions for child welfare.\u000a\u000a"It's just -- it's just disgusting," she said. "I feel my blood boiling just thinking about it."\u000a\u000aEditor's note: The original version of this story has been updated to include a new response from the Florida Department of Health, to clarify the CMS eligibility screening process the department uses currently, and to include the full name and position of one its employees.

aV(CNN) Meals from the sunny Mediterranean have been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life, along with a reduced risk for diabetes and high blood pressure.\u000a\u000aNow you can add lowering your risk for dementia to the ever growing list of reasons to follow the Mediterranean diet or one of its dietary cousins.\u000a\u000aNew research being presented at the Alzheimer's Association International conference in London this week found healthy older adults who followed the Mediterranean or the similar MIND diet lowered their risk of dementia by a third.\u000a\u000a"Eating a healthy plant-based diet is associated with better cognitive function and around 30% to 35% lower risk of cognitive impairment during aging," said lead author Claire McEvoy, of the University of California, San Francisco's School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aMcEvoy stressed that because the study was conducted in a nationally representative older population "the findings are relevant to the general public."\u000a\u000a"While 35% is a greater than expected decrease for a lifestyle choice, I am not surprised," said Rudolph Tanzi, who directs the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and recently co-authored a book with Deepak Chopra on genes and aging called "Super Genes."\u000a\u000a"The activity of our genes is highly dependent on four main factors: diet, exercise, sleep and stress management," said Tanzi, who was not involved in the study. "Of these, perhaps diet is most important."\u000a\u000aMcEvoy's study investigated at the eating habits of nearly 6,000 older Americans with an average age of 68. After adjusting for age, gender, race, low educational attainment and lifestyle and health issues -- such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, depression, smoking and physical inactivity -- researchers found that those who followed the MIND or Mediterranean diet had a 30% to 35% lower risk of cognitive impairment.\u000a\u000aThe more people stayed on those diets, said McEvoy, the better they functioned cognitively.\u000a\u000aThose who marginally followed the diet also benefited, but by a much smaller margin. They were 18% less likely to exhibit signs of cognitive impairment.\u000a\u000aWhat are the Mediterranean and MIND diets?\u000a\u000aForget lasagne, pizza, spanakopita and lamb souvlaki -- they are not on the daily menu of those who live by the sunny Mediterranean seaside.\u000a\u000aThe true diet is simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra virgin olive oil. Say goodbye to refined sugar or flour and fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all.\u000a\u000aMeat can make a rare appearance, but usually only to flavor a dish. Instead, meals may include eggs, dairy and poultry, but in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. Fish, however, are a staple.\u000a\u000aThe MIND diet takes the best brain foods of the Mediterranean diet and the famous salt-reducing DASH diet, and puts them together. MIND encourages a focus on eating from 10 healthy food groups while rejecting foods from five unhealthy groups.\u000a\u000aMIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, with DASH standing for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.\u000a\u000aMIND was developed by Martha Clare Morris, a nutritional epidemiologist at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center in the US.\u000a\u000aThose who follow MIND reject butter and stick margarine, red meats, cheeses, fried or fast food and sweets. Instead, they eat at least six servings a week of green leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale, and at least one serving a day of another vegetable. Three servings a day of whole grains are a must.\u000a\u000aThey also add in at least three servings of beans, two or more servings of berries, two servings of chicken or turkey, and once serving of fish each week. Olive oil is their main cooking ingredient, and they drink a glass of wine a day.\u000a\u000aMorris has some powerful stats behind her diet.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, she studied 923 Chicago-area seniors and found those who say they followed the diet religiously had a 53% lower chance of getting Alzheimer's, while those who followed it moderately lowered their risk by about 35%. Follow-up observational studies showed similar benefits.\u000a\u000aMorris and her colleagues are currently recruiting volunteers for a three-year clinical study to try to prove the link.\u000a\u000aAdditional evidence\u000a\u000aA second study presented at the conference also examined the impact of the MIND diet. Researchers from Wake Forest School of Medicine followed 7,057 women, average age 71, over almost 10 years and found those who most closely followed the MIND diet had a 34% reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer's.\u000a\u000aA third study at the conference looked at the dietary habits of 2,223 dementia-free Swedish adults over six years who followed the Nordic Prudent Dietary Pattern (NPDP) diet, which avoids sweets and fatty and processed foods. Instead, the diet emphasizes eating non-root vegetables, apple/pears/peaches, pasta/rice, poultry, fish, vegetable oils, tea and water, and light to moderate wine intake.\u000a\u000aSwedes who stuck to the diet at a moderate or higher level preserved their cognitive function better than those who ate more processed and fatty foods.\u000a\u000aLastly, a fourth study examined MRI brain scans of 330 cognitively normal adults, with an average age of 79, and found eating foods that raise inflammation in the body -- such as sweets, processed foods and fried and fatty foods -- raised the risk for a shrinking "aging" brain and lower cognitive function.\u000a\u000aThat comes as no surprise to neurologist Rudy Tanzi.\u000a\u000a"Foods that keep blood pressure normal, provide us with antioxidants, and maintain healthy bacteria in our gut, or microbiome, will serve to help keep chronic inflammation in check in the brain and entire body," said Tanzi.\u000a\u000aDespite the similarities of the results, experts point out that all of this research is observational, meaning that it is based on reports by individuals as to what they eat. To prove the connection between diet and dementia risk, said McEvoy, researchers will need to move to scientifically controlled experiments.\u000a\u000a"I think the studies, taken together, suggest a role for high quality dietary patterns in brain health and for protection against cognitive decline during aging," said McEvoy. "Diet is modifiable, and in light of these studies we need clinical trials to test whether changing diet can improve or maintain cognition."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aUntil that definite proof is available, say experts, there's no harm in using this information to makes changes in your diet and lifestyle that could help protect your brain.\u000a\u000a"Although the idea that a healthy diet can help protect against cognitive decline as we age is not new, the size and length of these four studies demonstrate how powerful good dietary practices may be in maintaining brain health and function," said Keith Fargo, Alzheimer's Association Director of Scientific Programs and Outreach.\u000a\u000aTanzi agrees. "It's about time we started placing a greater emphasis on what we eat as we strive to have our 'healthspan' keep up with our increasing 'lifespan'."

aV(CNN) The suicide rate among girls between the ages of 15 and 19 reached a 40-year high in 2015, according to new data from the National Center for Health Statistics .\u000a\u000aIn the shorter term, the suicide rate for those girls doubled between 2007 and 2015, the research indicates.\u000a\u000aBy comparison, the 2015 suicide rate for boys in this age group was lower than in the peak years of the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. The researchers derived suicide rates from official data from death certificates.\u000a\u000a"These data show that between 2007 and 2015, there's substantial increases in suicide rates for both young males and young females," said Tom Simon, an author of the report and associate director for science in the division of violence protection at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which published the new data Thursday.\u000a\u000a"For young males, there was a 31% increase in suicide rates, and for young females, the suicide rate doubled," Simon said.\u000a\u000aPotential factors\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the suicide rate for males between 15 and 19 increased from 12 per 100,000 population in 1975 to 18.1 per 100,000 in 1990. It then declined to 10.8 per 100,000 by 2007 and then increased again to 14.2 per 100,000 by 2015.\u000a\u000aAmong females, the suicide rate increased from 2.9 per 100,000 in 1975 to 3.7 per 100,000 in 1990, dipped to 2.4 per 100,000 in 2007 and then spiked to 5.1 per 100,000 in 2015.\u000a\u000a"We know that overall in the US, we're seeing increases in suicide rates across all age groups," Simon said, putting the new report in perspective.\u000a\u000a"We're not seeing the same kind of increases among the oldest adults, but we are seeing substantial and sustained increases now for the other age groups really going back to 2000," he said, adding that the the pattern is "pretty robust."\u000a\u000aIf you suspect someone may be at risk: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any \ufb01rearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional. Source: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. For more tips and warning signs, click here.\u000a\u000aCarl Tishler, an adjunct associate professor of psychology and psychiatry at the Ohio State University who was not involved in the report, said the high suicide rates among older teens in 2015 "could be the result of a lot of things."\u000a\u000a"Some of the opiate or heroin overdoses in adolescents may be interpreted by emergency departments as suicides. There may be more Internet suicides," Tishler said.\u000a\u000aSimon said it's "unlikely" that increases in suicide rates are due to any single factor. Possible risk factors for suicide include a history of substance abuse, exposure to violence, social isolation, conflict within relationships, stigma and a lack of available support.\u000a\u000aSimon suggested that the lingering effects of the Great Recession in the late 2000s may have contributed to stress within families, causing anxiety in teens.\u000a\u000a"In times of economic prosperity, suicide rates go down," he said. "In times of economic instability, suicide rates go up."\u000a\u000aGender differences\u000a\u000aSocial media can have either negative or positive effects, Simon said. Cyberbullying and harmful content might push a vulnerable teen toward self-harm, yet "social media can help increase connections between people, and it's an opportunity to correct myths about suicide and to allow people to access prevention resources and materials."\u000a\u000aDorian A. Lamis, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine/Grady Health System, theorized that use of social media and cyberbullying may affect teenage girls more than boys, resulting in rising suicide deaths among older teen girls.\u000a\u000a"Some research has suggested that the timing of puberty in girls is a contributing factor for the increased suicide rate," said Lamis, who was not involved in the new research. Puberty starts as early as 8 in some girls. The psychosocial and physical changes may leave girls "vulnerable to depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders earlier on in life." These known risk factors for suicide may catch up with a girl as she grows older.\u000a\u000aTishler noted that previous studies from the CDC have indicated that males take their own lives at nearly four times the rate of females and thus represent 77.9% of all suicides. Yet females are more likely than males to have suicidal thoughts.\u000a\u000a"If you look at suicide attempts by girls, it's typically that girls attempt suicide about four to one or three to one over boys, yet boys complete suicide in the reverse," Tishler said. "That tends, we think, to have to do with the modality of suicide attempt."\u000a\u000aSimon noted that in this older teen age group, the primary method chosen by boys is firearms, yet for girls, the most common method is suffocation. Still, a significant number of females may choose to poison themselves with an overdose , which can be remediated in an ER in some cases, Tishler said.\u000a\u000aHe theorized that girls now have access to pills that may be more lethal -- or more quickly lethal -- than those available to girls in the past, and this may have contributed to the rising rate of suicide deaths among teen girls. Similarly, Lamis conjectured that girls may have access to "more lethal methods in their suicide attempts, resulting in an increased number of deaths."\u000a\u000aThe new report also does not indicate how many of the teens who completed suicide were in treatment with a medical health professional and how many were receiving medication for depression or other mental illness, Tishler said. He added that he's convinced that the quickness to start or change these medications, which are categorized as psychotropic, "is done in such a manner that makes people more vulnerable to attempting suicide."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Physicians need to be careful" when increasing, starting or stopping psychotropic medications, because this may "give someone energy to die by suicide," Tishler said.\u000a\u000aOne symptom of depression can be psychomotor retardation, which medication reduces, helping people become more active. They may attempt more activities to do better in school or to be more social. The medicines may give depressed teens more energy to plan and follow through with a suicide attempt or die by suicide. Psychotropic drugs also can change mental status and in some cases may increase suicidal thoughts, which is why some of them come with warnings.

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 18th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 On the shores of Dong Mo Lake, about 40 kilometers east of Hanoi, sequined dancers twirl with ribbons, while guitarists perform intimate concerts on rafts.\u000a\u000aThere's camping, yoga and swimming -- not to mention 40 hours of non-stop live music.\u000a\u000aIt might sound like Glastonbury but this, in fact, is Quest , a lifestyle festival now in its fifth year.\u000a\u000aIt's not alone. Hanoi, which has long been the country's creative heart, is challenging regional powerhouses such as Tokyo, Singapore and Seoul for the festival capital of Asia title.\u000a\u000a"Hanoi absolutely has potential to become a music hub in Asia -- there's a strong cultural underpinning to work with," Jeremy Wellard, co-founder of Quest, tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"As Vietnam's economy keeps growing, and as social structures change, we are going to see the country become a player in the arts and culture scene."\u000a\u000aA new beat\u000a\u000aHanoi's 7.5 million inhabitants famously buzz around in an impenetrable, deafening sea of motorbikes.\u000a\u000aDespite this, the city retains a quaint, historic feel with its low-rise colonial architecture and leafy promenades.\u000a\u000aIt was this romantic vibe that inspired Wellard to relocate to Hanoi from Australia, where he'd helped organize music events such as Brisbane's hip-hop festival Stylin'Up and the G20 Cultural Celebrations , a citywide arts and culture festival.\u000a\u000aIn 2011, Wellard and a few friends spent a weekend at Son Tinh Camp, at Dong Mo.\u000a\u000aA freshwater lake, forests, tents for rent ... they quickly saw its potential.\u000a\u000a"We wanted to bring that festival atmosphere to Hanoi, at a place that felt like an escape, without the city bearing down on us," he says.\u000a\u000aA performance at Quest.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Quest launched as a "really DIY project," with roughly 250 festival-goers. This year, it'll be 20 times that size, with five stages and about 5,000 guests between November 10 and 12.\u000a\u000aEnglish pioneers of ambient house The Orb are on the line-up, alongside gypsy-electro-nu-rave act Slamboree Sound System, Hanoi's own house and techno artist DJ Tùng Tím and dreamy Indonesian pop act Stars and Rabbit.\u000a\u000a"We were lucky to be around at a time when Hanoi really started to open up to the outside world and the tastes of Vietnamese were opening up," says Wellard.\u000a\u000aPlease don't stop the music\u000a\u000aQuest isn't an anomaly.\u000a\u000aThis April, house and techno festival Equation joined Hanoi's festival scene, at the same camp site as Quest at Dong Mo Lake.\u000a\u000aEquation festival debuted in April.\u000a\u000aIts founders -- the team behind Cliche Records , a Hong Kong-based music label, booking and promotion agency -- tell CNN that Hanoi was the obvious choice for their event.\u000a\u000a"Hong Kong was saturated and too hard to pull off," Ouissam Mokretar, one of the festival's co-founders, tells CNN. "Seoul and Japan have the same problem, with space and pricing.\u000a\u000a"China, Manila and Bangkok are so hard with the politics and the laws. But Vietnam is still emerging. Travelers are coming and falling in love with the country and local kids want to experience new things."\u000a\u000aEquation revolves around two main stages, with a third platform in the wings for yoga, film screenings and craft workshops.\u000a\u000aMore than 30 acts performed over three days, including American electronic musician DJ Shlomo Alex from Tokyo (now based in Berlin), and Norwegian act Telephones\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Monsoon Music Festival -- which has hosted Grammy-winner Joss Stone and German rock band the Scorpions -- returns for the third time this autumn, with thousands of guests expected at the Citadel of Thang Long, a historic fort south of West Lake.\u000a\u000aA city on the move\u000a\u000aMokretar says Hanoi's expanding festival scene is thanks, in part, to the city's growing network of budget flights.\u000a\u000aIn the past year, VietJet has launched direct routes from Hanoi to Yangon, Seoul, Busan, and Siem Reap -- with a link to Kuala Lumpur to follow this September.\u000a\u000aFellow low-cost carrier Jetstar Pacific Airlines also introduced affordable, direct flights to Osaka earlier this year.\u000a\u000aOuissam Mokretar, Equation festival co-founder \u201c(Hanoi is) much more connected now than just a year ago -- the difference from 2016 is crazy.\u201d\u000a\u000a"(Hanoi is) much more connected now than just a year ago -- the difference from 2016 is crazy," recalls Mokretar.\u000a\u000a"Tickets are almost 50% cheaper. Last year, flying between Taipei and Hanoi cost around $400, but now VietJet opened a route and it's only $150."\u000a\u000aThe relative affordability of attending a festival in Hanoi, compared with Hong Kong or Tokyo, also has an impact.\u000a\u000aTickets to Quest, for example, cost $57 for the three-day weekend, compared with $208 for a three-day ticket to Hong Kong's annual Clockenflap festival.\u000a\u000aAn appetite for music\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 8 Down time at the Japan Ultra Music Festival . A glittery haven for hardcore EDM junkies, the festival takes place again this September in Tokyo's Odaiba Ultra Park.\u000a\u000aNana Nguyen, a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman who has attended Quest for the past four years, says it has an open-minded, "free love" mentality -- much like what you might expect to find at European or American festivals.\u000a\u000a"The (countryside) festival location might be a little inconvenient, but once you're there in nature, you feel really refreshed, relaxed and free," Nguyen tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"It's good to have that break from the city. We're all working all the time, and there you can feel like there's another side of Hanoi."\u000a\u000aShe also put Quest's success down to a voracious appetite for new music in Vietnam.\u000a\u000a"This generation, they are really into entertainment -- much more than before. They want to be modern, up on all the new fashion and music trends," says Nguyen.

aVStory highlights Nikki Haley: Widespread human rights violations a warning sign that breakdown in security is coming\u000a\u000aSyrian war just one example of how such violations can spiral into all-out war, she says\u000a\u000aAmbassador Nikki R. Haley is the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. The views expressed are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Imagine you are the parent of a boy -- a teenager. Policemen come to your home in the middle of the night and take your boy away. He is held without explanation for weeks. And when he finally comes home, your boy has all the marks of having been tortured. Bruises from being beaten. Red, open wounds from being burned. Then you look at his hands and the worst is confirmed. Where his fingernails once were, there are only raw, bloody, exposed nerves. Grown men with pliers, he tells you, ripped his fingernails off in prison.\u000a\u000aFor a group of parents in Syria in 2011, this was not an exercise in imagination but a horrifying reality. Their boys were arrested and tortured for the crime of writing anti-government graffiti on the wall of a school. When the parents marched in protest to demand their children's release, security services opened fire on them. When more people came out to protest the killings, the government fired on them again. Soon, the point of no return was reached.\u000a\u000aNikki Haley\u000a\u000a"We were asking in a peaceful way to release the children but their reply was bullets," a relative of one of the boys told a reporter . "Now we can have no compromise with any security branches."\u000a\u000aThe Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.\u000a\u000aAs the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.\u000a\u000aRead More

She is an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and a former gender scholar at Stanford University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In Paris on Thursday, fashion designer Rick Owens gave audiences quite a show when he sent male models down the runway wearing clothes with peepholes that offered a glimpse of the guys' formerly private parts.\u000a\u000a"Nudity is the most simple and primal gesture -- it packs a punch," Owens said of his decision to have his models bare all. "It's powerful. ... Who else can really get away with this stuff? It's a corporate world!"\u000a\u000aThe looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate -- after all, they can't be worn out in public and won't be sold in stores. But let's be honest: Were we even shocked? After all, female models have been asked to sashay down runways in states of near nakedness for years.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity. There was Michael Fassbender in "Shame," of course. And who can forget the uproar over the cameo of Ben Affleck's penis in "Gone Girl," albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it? And if we've seen Ben Affleck's penis, who cares about some male model's?\u000a\u000aOf course, women have been going full frontal in films for years.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) We're all used to seeing "concept cars" -- those bits of automotive frippery that manufacturers trot out at motor shows every few months. Generally, they're either design tinsel that will never see the light of day, or previews of cars that will soon appear in showrooms.\u000a\u000aAnd then there's the Mercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion.\u000a\u000aCatchy name aside, this odd-looking creation has had such a varied life that its maker refuses to call it a "concept." It's a research project instead, hence the name (the 'F' is a German prefix denoting 'research vehicle' status).\u000a\u000aDesigned for living\u000a\u000aThe Mercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion: Forerunner of a mobility revolution\u000a\u000aThe F 015 made its debut at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas more than two years ago. It's packed with advanced (or what was considered advanced in 2015) autonomous technology, and can, in theory, run for almost 900 kilometers on a mixture of pure electric power and a hydrogen fuel cell.\u000a\u000aBut while countless other vehicles are still trying to prove that cars can, literally, drive themselves, Merc's offering takes this for granted. Instead, this vehicle wants us to consider what we'll actually do while the car is driving us around.\u000a\u000aThe steering wheel slides into the dashboard to create more of a "lounge" space. The seating configuration allows four people to face each other if they want to talk. And when the onboard conversation dries up, a bewildering collection of screens -- one on the rear wall, and one on each of the doors -- offers plenty of opportunity to interact with various media.\u000a\u000aThe F 015 could have done all of this as a flash-in-the-pan show car -- seen at a couple of major events before vanishing without trace. But in fact it has been touring almost constantly since that Vegas debut.\u000a\u000aOn the day that I managed to get up close with the car at a Mercedes facility in the UK, engineer Thomas Jaeger admitted that the F 015 had probably racked up tens of thousands of air miles.\u000a\u000aNot bad for a car that is estimated to have been driven less than 500 kilometers under its own steam (or battery, at least) during the same period. More than a quarter of a million people have now managed to get up close and interact with the F 015 during its lifetime.\u000a\u000a"We have learned so much from this project," Jaeger said. "The most important thing is that people aren't afraid of autonomous vehicles. They see them as an opportunity -- and they are already interested to know what else they'll be able to do when they don't have to look at the road."\u000a\u000aThe key, Jaeger said, is communication. "Of course, people are keen to experience movies or games while they're on the move," he said.\u000a\u000a"But they also want to be productive, whether it's using this time to sort out things with their lives, or to catch up with friends -- either in the car or on social networking. Their feedback says that they're ready and excited by the extra time that autonomous cars can give them."\u000a\u000aA work in progress\u000a\u000aClimbing aboard the F 015, you see how it could work. The powered doors slowly open to reveal a huge aperture through which you enter the car, albeit with a significant duck of the head.\u000a\u000aThe futuristic seats aren't particularly comfortable, but with a decent set of padded Mercedes armchairs, this environment would be a pretty pleasant.\u000a\u000aMercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion in San Francisco 2015\u000a\u000aOn the move, the F 015 creaks and shudders, as all one-off vehicles do. And it feels heavy. But that's because it is -- carbon fiber body panels notwithstanding, the amount of bespoke engineering and technology on board makes the car heavier than many large SUVs.\u000a\u000aWhen the vehicle is at rest, the only noise it produces is the constant whoosh of computer fans under the hood. There are a total of 14 processing devices on board, but only four are involved in making the car autonomous. The rest -- 10 MacBook Pros, as it turns out -- are dedicated to operating the user interface and throwing graphics around on the screens.\u000a\u000aParts of this car have dated in the two-and-a-half years since its debut. The 32in touchscreens in the doors, for example, are relatively poor-contrast LCD displays, not hi-tech, ultra-crisp OLED. And the rear-projection instrument panel that wraps around the dashboard isn't particularly clear, especially in sunlight.\u000a\u000a"When we made the car, the idea of a single curved display was just impossible," Jaeger said. "Nowadays we know we could go to one or two suppliers and have it made."\u000a\u000aNonetheless, Jaeger said that the engineering team hasn't tinkered with the vehicle, preferring to compile a (lengthy) list of ideas of what to do next. He also admitted that work has just started on the next "research project."\u000a\u000aWhatever form it takes, it will be pushed forward by the technical know-how of gifted engineers and designers. But now, thanks to the F 015, feedback from the general public will play its part too.

I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning.\u000a\u000aAnd yet people hate her. Her negative ratings, in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of 'Why don't they like you?'\u000a\u000aOf course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that 'there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.'

Most other criminal activity unambiguously violates our social norms. There's no 'gray area' when it comes to smoking meth at a cocktail party, for example. Most crimes are also social faux pas, such that you would neither engage in, nor tolerate the behavior from a peer.\u000a\u000aWith DUIs, however, there are mixed messages.

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 In a city where the housing price per square foot is more than $1,400 , space is the ultimate Hong Kong luxury.\u000a\u000aThe only place you can really stretch out? A hotel suite, of course. Sure, you'll pay for the privilege. But, rest assured, hotels know how to spoil guests who are visiting Hong Kong . The best suites in town not only include an enormous floor plan, but also must-have harbor views and the odd cinema, personal chef and rooftop Jacuzzi or two.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking to splurge, these are a few of the most amazing suites in Hong Kong:\u000a\u000aInterContinental Hong Kong\u000a\u000aThe Presidential Suite terrace at InterContinental Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aInterContinental Hong Kong sits on the edge of Victoria Harbour, on the Kowloon peninsula. On the top floor of the hotel, the Presidential Suite is the largest in the city.\u000a\u000aBut the experience starts before you check in, with a choice of Bentley, Phantom VI Rolls Royce or Mercedes transfer from the airport. With 7,000 square feet of space, this abode offers everything you could possibly need, from a private study to a gym, dining room, kitchen and five bedrooms -- should you be traveling with friends or family.\u000a\u000aBest part? The suite's 2,500-square-foot rooftop, where travelers can relax, lounge around in the Jacuzzi or take a dip in the infinity swimming pool -- with panoramic views of the harbor and Hong Kong Island skyline.\u000a\u000aMaking the most of the panoramic setting, the hotel will arrange all kinds of private experiences, from yoga to tai chi, private musical serenades on the suite's grand piano, and even rooftop dinners.\u000a\u000aAnd with NOBU, Rech by Alain Ducasse and two-Michelin-starred Yan Toh Heen downstairs, a dinner here, arranged by your personal butler, will be one to remember.\u000a\u000aPrice tag: From $12,628\u000a\u000aInterContinental Hong Kong , 18 Salisbury Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong; \u200e+852 2721 1211\u000a\u000aKerry Hotel\u000a\u000aThe Kerry Hotel opened this spring in Hung Hom, a burgeoning Kowloon district on the northeast side of Victoria Harbour.\u000a\u000aDesigned by acclaimed Hong Kong interior designer Andre Fu (who is also behind The Upper House hotel), the contemporary highrise welcomes guests into a sky-high lobby and outdoor deck. Panoramic windows are a given inside the Presidential Suite, which sits on the top floor of the hotel, offering views of the Hong Kong Island skyline from a less common angle.\u000a\u000aThe suite features a private bar, smart lighting, Bose sound systems and a wraparound terrace that looks out over Kowloon city, the open sea and the mountains beyond.

The high ceilings and ornate frescoes, violinists and white-gloved service are all reminiscent of a luxurious bygone era.\u000a\u000aIn the Peninsula Suite on the 26th floor, a recently renovated design takes a more contemporary approach -- aside from the antique furniture and marble bathrooms. It's designed to feel like an apartment. That is, of course, if your flat includes mahogany walls, custom silkscreens, a personal gym, an 85-inch cinema screen and sculptures by Chinese artist Sun Yi. There's also a study and a walk-in closet, plus the living room hosts a baby grand piano and a private balcony to enjoy the views of Victoria Harbour.\u000a\u000aGetting around town is just as classy, thanks to complimentary Rolls-Royce chauffeur service -- on call 24 hours a day.

aV(CNN) George and Amal Clooney have joined the fight against hate groups in the United States.\u000a\u000aThe couple, through the The Clooney Foundation for Justice, have made a $1 million donation to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) that will fund a joint initiative to combat hate groups.\u000a\u000aThe move comes more than a week after an August 12 "Unite the Right" rally sparked violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead and 19 injured. Two Virginia state troopers who were monitoring the protests were also killed in a helicopter crash.\u000a\u000a"What happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate," they said.\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of the event, President Donald Trump was criticized for his unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in a press conference given days after the unrest.\u000a\u000a"I think there is blame on both sides," Trump said during a news conference August 15.\u000a\u000aGeorge Clooney appeared to reference the President's comment in an additional statement, provided to CNN by a representative.\u000a\u000a"Amal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality.

aVTonight at 9 p.m., "Piers Morgan Tonight" welcomes one of the most-decorated Olympic athletes in history, 16-time medal winner Michael Phelps.\u000a\u000aJoining Piers Morgan tonight, the 27-year-old swimming legend is asked to extend his thinking outside of the pool, as the host dives in with a deeper, and broader question:\u000a\u000a"Who are your sporting idols?" Morgan asks.\u000a\u000a"Michael Jordan," responds Phelps. "He changed the sport of basketball in my eyes. On and off the court, the guy made basketball what it is. And, you know, what he did."\u000a\u000aWhat the basketball Hall of Famer did, was rewrite the history of his craft, much in the same way Phelps is doing with his. A six-time NBA champion, and two-time Olympic gold medalist, Jordan's overall talent was rivaled only by his overwhelming will to win, a trait not lost on the equally-competive Phelps:\u000a\u000a"I think one of the coolest things that I loved about him was it didn't matter what he had going on off the court or if he was sick or this, that. He never used an excuse," explains the man who has twice tied the record with eight medals of any type at a single Olympics. "He came out every single night on the court and did what he had to do to get his job done. That's what champions do. It doesn't matter what else is going on when you walk in to your arena, whatever you excel at, you\u2019re there to take care of the job that you have to do."

The two are also collaborating on Google's Mountain View campus in California.\u000a\u000aThe current designs seem characteristic of the two men. Heatherwick was the mastermind behind the recently scrapped garden bridge in London, and last year, Ingels opened what he calls a " courtscraper " -- a structure that combines a communal courtyard with the density of a skyscraper -- in New York.

aVCNN National Security Analyst John Kirby is a retired rear admiral in the US Navy who served as a spokesman for both the state and defense departments in the Obama administration. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Sometimes you have to take a knee. Even in the crunch of a crisis. Even when it's the last thing you want to do. Sometimes, you have to pause, catch your breath and try to figure out what's going well and what needs to improve.\u000a\u000aThat's the situation the Navy finds itself in today, even as it tries to find 10 missing sailors off the destroyer USS John S. McCain.\u000a\u000aEven as it wraps its arms around worried families and anxious crewmembers.\u000a\u000aEven as it searches for answers to questions it hasn't been able to satisfy since another ship, the USS Fitzgerald, collided with a merchant ship just over two months ago. How could this have possibly happened? At all? Again?\u000a\u000aThere won't be any easy answers to those questions, that's for sure. But the investigation is off and running, and, not unlike what investigators have already found in the case of Fitzgerald, it's likely they will discover lots of things that went wrong.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED US Navy destroyer collides with ship Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US Navy destroyer collides with ship 01:13\u000a\u000aBut given that this is the third Navy collision and the fourth forward-deployed ship in the Pacific region to be involved in a mishap in less than a year's time (the cruiser USS Antietam ran aground in January and USS Lake Champlain, another cruiser, struck a Korean fishing boat back in May), it is wholly fitting that the Navy is conducting a broader review of training and procedures across the fleet.\u000a\u000aIt's also fitting that they plan to conduct what Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson is calling an "operational pause" to, as he says, "ensure we are taking all appropriate immediate measures to enhance the Navy's safe and effective operation around the world."\u000a\u000aAround the world -- not just in the Western Pacific, where all these incidents happened, but around the world, where the Navy operates each and every day.\u000a\u000aThey will do this smartly. Not every fleet commander will conduct this pause the same way. Not every commander will take the same amount of time to get it done. Some will stop what they are doing for a day or more. Others won't have that luxury. Each fleet will flex, making certain the Navy's myriad commitments in every body of water are still met.\u000a\u000aOur sailors may be taking a knee, but they will still be able to answer all bells.\u000a\u000aWhat Navy leaders learn from this pause will probably be instructive. If they really listen to the sailors who man the watches and the weapons, who run the engineering plants and keep our ships in fighting trim, they may glean better -- and safer -- ways of doing things.\u000a\u000aLet's hope so. Because naval operations are dangerous enough without introducing or permitting practices and policies that compound those dangers.\u000a\u000aMaybe our sailors need more sleep. Maybe they need more training. Maybe they need ships and systems and sensors in better working condition. Maybe, in some cases, they just need better leaders.\u000a\u000aThe pause will shed light on these and many other factors. As Admiral Richardson said today, "the emphasis ... is really to take a look at the fundamentals, at the unit and team level to make sure that we are not overlooking anything ... the basic seamanship, airmanship, those sorts of things: teamwork, how we do business on the bridge, the fundamentals."\u000a\u000aFundamentals, yes. But lawmakers who decry the Navy's shiphandling of late ought also to consider what deleterious effect their own poor budget management has wrought.\u000a\u000aI'm not arguing that sequestration and year after year of tardy appropriations or continuing resolutions are solely to blame for what happened to these ships and their crews. But neither can it be argued that the ridiculous fiscal uncertainty with which Navy leaders have had to contend has not had an impact on training, steaming and flying time.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 10 US Navy sailors missing after collision Replay More Videos ...

Readiness begets the ability to fight and win when deterrence fails. So, yes, I think it's fair to examine the degree to which budget woes may have helped create the conditions that led to these tragedies.\u000a\u000aFrankly, it would be a bigger tragedy if we didn't -- because things aren't getting any easier in the Asia-Pacific theater. No one knows that better than the Pacific Fleet commander, Adm. Scott Swift, who once commanded the Seventh Fleet. He knows the Navy needs to be able to plan, train, budget, equip and deploy accordingly.\u000a\u000aRep. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, put it best. "We ask a lot of our men and women in the Navy," he said. "The time they spend at sea is increasing, while their ships age and their funding gets cut. These are just the conditions that can lead to an increase in the kinds of accidents we are witnessing."\u000a\u000aSome -- including Chairman Thornberry -- worry that with everything going on in the Pacific, this is the worst possible time for these mishaps to occur or for the Navy to take a pause. Mr. Thornberry said it's "no way to protect America."\u000a\u000aHe's got a point. In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to do that. But the world isn't perfect, and neither are the officers and crew of any particular warship. The dangers they face aren't going to get any easier to face if they don't figure out what's happening in the fleet -- and fix it.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aI remember a story one of my professors at the Navy War College told about a young Marine platoon commander in the Korean War.

Every few minutes the young officer would dash behind a boulder and take a knee, then dash back out and issue new orders.\u000a\u000aWhen the firefight at last ended, he had saved his men. One of his troops asked him what he had been doing behind that rock.\u000a\u000a"I was asking myself three questions," he said. "What am I doing? What am I not doing? And how can I make up the difference?"\u000a\u000aIt's never OK for a Navy ship to collide with anything. There's never a perfect time to pause, but we should not stop asking ourselves these same questions. It is in the asking -- and the answering -- that we get better. And better is what we must be after.\u000a\u000aTime to take a knee.

aVNic Robertson is CNN's international diplomatic editor. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000aSeven months into his presidency, his foes have him figured out while America's friends are ducking for cover.\u000a\u000aTrump's off-script, off-color campaign-style rallies that roll back-to-back with the carefully scripted aspirations of his administration suggest to large parts of the world a man who cannot control himself -- much less the nation he leads.\u000a\u000aNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told CNN last week in a conversation about stability in the face of Russian aggression, that what America's NATO allies need right now is predictability: "As long we are strong, as long as we are predictable, we can also engage in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid escalation and to avoid a new Cold War."\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of the awful events in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump has shown those outside America that he is anything but predictable. His wildly variant public interpretations of violent, anti-Semitic rallies by neo-Nazis and white supremacists and the removal of Confederate statues have caused European leaders to shake their heads in bewilderment.\u000a\u000aBy one day equating neo-Nazis with civil rights protesters, then days later saying the country has no place for racists before flip-flopping again, he has left international onlookers baffled.\u000a\u000aA week later, it seems that neither he nor his White House team has learned anything, as he repeated the same mistakes at a campaign-style rally in Arizona.\u000a\u000aThis time, he also expressed support for a former local sheriff whose stop and search policies of Latinos has seen him accused of racism -- a charge he denies, which seems good enough for Trump -- and convicted of criminal contempt.\u000a\u000aTo outsiders, Trump seems to be shunning the American dream in favor of something far more sinister. Britain's former ambassador to the United States, Peter Westmacott, tweeted this in response to the Arizona rally: "Shades of 1933 Germany. And an invitation to autocrats w/o America's checks & balances to play the same game more dangerously. Leadership??"\u000a\u000aTrump's America seems to be getting out of kilter. And while friends such as Westmacott voice their fears, America's enemies are gearing up to take advantage.\u000a\u000aChina sent a swift, stinging rebuke this week to Trump's biggest foreign policy foray since coming to power.\u000a\u000aHis much-vaunted Afghanistan plan should have marked a moment when the world took Trump seriously.\u000a\u000aAlas, the fact it came so soon after the Charlottesville turmoil -- and that he followed it 24 hours later with a 77-minute attack on his enemies -- somewhat spoiled the moment. No one should be surprised that the wait for Trump to make sense of himself and his America is over.\u000a\u000aIn his Afghanistan speech, Trump reversed course, saying he'd send more troops to the embattled nation. He also threatened Pakistan, saying it has "much to gain" by supporting the United States and had "much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists."\u000a\u000aBefore Pakistan had responded, China -- uncharacteristically -- came to its defense, saying the world needed to do more to recognize that country's fight against terrorism.\u000a\u000aPakistan, which has long played the United States off against China, seized the moment by doubling down on the Chinese comments and refuting Trump's claims.\u000a\u000a"No country has done more than Pakistan to counter the menace of terrorism. No country in the world has suffered more than Pakistan from the scourge of terrorism."\u000a\u000aChina is already at loggerheads with Trump, angered by fears of a trade war and worried by the recent escalation in tensions between the United States and North Korea.\u000a\u000aWhere months ago, world leaders may have been wary of Trump's unpredictability and cautious in their response, they are rapidly realizing one of his biggest weaknesses: He appears incapable of focusing on any issue for long enough and is therefore unable to deliver policy in his nation's best interest.\u000a\u000aWe could well be entering a free-for-all era of foreign policy. The assumption seems to be that if no one at home will tell the emperor he has no clothes, then why should those looking on from the outside?\u000a\u000aTrump's apparent refusal to base his thinking in reality only becomes more stark to his adversaries the more he speaks.\u000a\u000aIn Arizona, he told his cheering supporters that Kim Jong Un was listening to him: "I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us. I respect that fact very much. Respect that fact. And maybe -- probably not -- but maybe something positive can come about."\u000a\u000aHe offered no evidence of how he calibrated Kim's sudden change.\u000a\u000aFor his part, Kim was only too happy to show he was listening, responding the following day by telling his rocket engineers to increase production of his more stealthy and dangerous solid fuel rockets.\u000a\u000aRussian President Vladimir Putin, as we know, looked into Trump's eyes at the G20 in Germany, listened to his bluster and decided to move on.\u000a\u000aAllies, too, have had plenty to consider in recent weeks.\u000a\u000aAs Trump's desired plans for health care have failed and he lashes out at allies such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. John McCain, a Republican war hero, the writing is on the wall for overseas partners who fail to meet his expectations.\u000a\u000aNo surprise that British Prime Minister Theresa May -- who raced to Washington days after Trump's inauguration to be the first world leader to embrace him, or at least hold hands with him -- now keeps her distance.\u000a\u000aIn Germany, where elections are barely a month away, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces attacks from her main opponent, who claims she is too similar to Trump.\u000a\u000aSuch is Trump's global standing that in Europe's largest economy -- the economic engine room of his largest trading bloc and his grandfather's homeland -- he is a pariah, a political liability.\u000a\u000aEmbattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unusually held his tongue over Trump's moral equivocation and failure to criticize anti-Semitic chants in Charlottesville. But not so Trump's own ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who told an Israeli reporter that Trump's response " was not fine.\u000a\u000aFriends, even close ones, are finding it harder to stand with Trump and his vision of America, which raises the question: Where will those friends be when Trump needs them? That question may need answering sooner than even Trump realizes at the United Nations, where he faces Russia's and China's increasing pushback over his North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aThe honeymoon where the world hoped and waited for something better -- something stable and predictable -- is over.\u000a\u000aWhat greater measure of global evaporation of post-inaugural latitude could there be than a UN panel's " early warning" to Trump , demanding he "unequivocally and unconditionally" reject discrimination?\u000a\u000aHow will he respond?\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aShould he face the United Nations down -- as he likes to do with so many other perceived adversaries -- and demand it shut down its headquarters in New York?\u000a\u000aNothing would make his real enemies happier. They know Trump can cause chaos, but it seems increasingly to favor their ends if he does.\u000a\u000aWorld leaders have taken their own silent poll on Trump and found him wanting in about every department. A global liability -- not a global leader.

aVIn 2014 the country opened the largest wind farm in Africa, valued at $1.4 billion, in the southwest near the city of Tarfaya. Then, in early 2016, it switched on the first facility of the world's largest concentrated solar plant, Noor-1 , on the fringe of the Sahara desert. When completed in 2018, it will power one million homes and make Morocco a solar superpower.\u000a\u000aAnd while the country is still heavily reliant on energy imports (90 percent in 2013, according to the World Bank ), it plans to generate 40 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020.\u000a\u000aFollowing this road has led to Morocco hosting the UN's 2016 summit on climate change, COP22 , in Marrakech. So what lies ahead?\u000a\u000aCutting the energy bill\u000a\u000aMorocco ranks seventh in the world in the 2016 Climate Change Performance Index , and is the only non-European country in the top 20.\u000a\u000aIt's also one of only five countries to have achieved a "sufficient" rating for its efforts to keep warming below 2°C in the Climate Action Tracker (no country has achieved the "role model" rating as of yet, so "sufficient" is currently the best grade).\u000a\u000aAn aerial view of the solar mirrors at the Noor 1 Concentrated Solar Power plant, 12.5 miles outside the central Moroccan town of Ouarzazate.\u000a\u000aHow did it get there? "We started with a question: How can we decrease our energy bill?" Said Mouline, director of the National Agency for the Development of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"Morocco is a very energy dependent country. In 2009, that bill amounted to $10 billion."\u000a\u000aSo, in 2011, Morocco altered its constitution to include sustainable development, stopped subsidizing fossil fuels to make renewables more competitive, and started welcoming private investments in the clean energy sector.\u000a\u000aEfficiency is key\u000a\u000a"This transition has two paths, and renewables are just one. The other is energy efficiency. Both need to be developed at the same time," Mouline said.\u000a\u000aOne key action is reducing waste: the electricity state utility, ONEE, has started a program to replace old incandescent light bulbs in Moroccan households with 10 million compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), which are far more efficient.\u000a\u000aTo offset the initial cost -- CFLs are six time more expensive -- the utility allows users to pay for them in installments through the bill, which itself is lowered by the better efficiency.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Environment Program estimates that by switching just 40 percent of households, power consumption would drop by 20 percent, cutting 2.74 million tons of CO2 emission by the end of 2021 -- as much as would be created by consuming 308 million gallons of gasoline, according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Calculator.\u000a\u000aAs part of its efforts for a greener future, Morocco has also started to transition its 15,000 mosques to renewable energy, and in July it banned the production, sale and use of plastic bags, of which it used three billion each year.\u000a\u000aA $3.5 billion economy boost\u000a\u000aMouline, who's also a member of the Steering Committee of COP22, says energy efficiency is the cheapest way for countries to meet their targets under the Paris agreement.\u000a\u000a"The government set some ambitious goals. Fifty two percent of our energy capacity must come from renewables by 2030, and by the same date we must achieve 20 percent better energy efficiency in all sectors: transport, housing, agriculture.\u000a\u000aThe wind farm in Melloussa, 21 miles from Tangiers in northern Morocco, has 165 turbines, with a production capacity of 140 megawatts.\u000a\u000a"That means that if our energy consumption doubles by 2030, we want to actually consume 20 percent less than that. We want to stop wasting energy," he said.\u000a\u000aAnd the country could run entirely on green energy by 2050, according to a study by Stanford University on the energy roadmap of 139 countries.\u000a\u000aThis would contribute about $3.5 billion to the economy and add over 88,000 permanent jobs, the study predicts.\u000a\u000aAn example for Africa\u000a\u000aAt an event held at COP22 in 2016 promoting solar energy in Africa, Morocco's efforts were used as an example of how Sub-Saharan Africa can capitalize on the highest irradiation rates in the world, even though solar power only makes up approximately 0.5% of energy production in the area.\u000a\u000aThe event highlighted the World Bank and International Finance Corporation's efforts to raise $16 billion for solar, hydro, and geothermal energy projects throughout the continent.\u000a\u000aAccording to Mouline, this transition will be inevitable: "We are switching, all over the world. Last year more money was invested in clean energy than fossil fuels for the first time. Look at how many new jobs renewables, energy storage and electric mobility have created."\u000a\u000aMorocco's wind farm in Tarfaya, which produces 850MW, has created an new industry in the country, as 70 percent of the spare parts for the turbines are manufactured locally.\u000a\u000a"Making electricity is only a part of a larger strategy."\u000a\u000aWater security\u000a\u000aAs a country made up of 78 percent desert or dry zones, according to FAO estimates , Morocco faces special challenges in the fight against climate change.\u000a\u000a"At the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, Morocco was one of the first countries to ratify the agreement on biodiversity, desertification and climate change," said Abdelâdim Lhafi, High Commissioner for Water, Forests and the Fight Against Desertification of Morocco.\u000a\u000a"Before 1992 and starting in the 1960s there were strong policies about water, and Morocco now has about 140 dams with a total storage of 18 billion cubic meters (635 billion cubic feet), which is crucial for a country that is severely hit by droughts."\u000a\u000aDue to increased demand, demographic changes and tourism, some areas of the country now experience water scarcity: "But we've made a lot of progress in the use of water, especially in agriculture which absorbs 85 percent of our supply. That's why we're looking at new technologies for our 1.2 million hectares of irrigated areas, to preserve our food security," Lhafi said.\u000a\u000a"We've done a lot, but we still have a lot to do in the coming years."

"You can't say buy our products by day and then by night put your brand on policies that put us in harm's way."\u000a\u000aNooyi is the only woman of color on either of Trump's councils. The Pepsi CEO is also considered a trailblazer for Indian-Americans and women alike. Nooyi, who grew up in India, has been a vocal champion of diversity during her decade atop Pepsi and was ranked by Fortune as the second most powerful woman in business.\u000a\u000aBut Color of Change suggests that Nooyi's role on Trump's council undermines her track record on diversity.\u000a\u000a"You've got a high-profile CEO who has talked about diversity and equality who is enabling Trump," Robinson said.\u000a\u000aPepsi did not respond to a request for comment on Color of Change's campaign.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Color of Change launched campaigns urging Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger and former Uber boss Travis Kalanick to sever ties with Trump. Both execs eventually did quit Trump's business council. After pressure from Color of Change and others, PayPal (PYPL, Tech30) said Tuesday it's working to cut off service to groups that "promote hate" such as white supremacists and Nazis.\u000a\u000aOver the past few days, Color of Change has also ramped up the pressure on Walmart (WMT) and Campbell Soup (CPB), two other consumer-facing brands whose CEOs are sitting on Trump's business council.\u000a\u000aRelated: CEOs under fire to dump Trump\u000a\u000aConsumer products companies like Pepsi have to listen when activists threaten to mobilize their followers against them.

These are companies that black people shop at and employ black people," Robinson said.\u000a\u000aNooyi has commented on the violence in Virginia, sending a tweet on Sunday -- before Merck (MRK)CEO Kenneth Frazier kicked off a series of CEO cutting ties with Trump.

McMillon said Trump's remarks on Monday, in which he denounced white supremacists by name, "were a step in the right direction."\u000a\u000aHe has not commented about Trump's incendiary comments during a Tuesday press conference at Trump Tower.\u000a\u000aTrump said "there's blame on both sides" of the Charlottesville violence. "You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent," he said.\u000a\u000aThe comments created instant outrage and led Richard Trumka, one of the country's most powerful labor union leaders, to announce his resignation from the manufacturing council.\u000a\u000a"CEOs who remain on Trump's committees will need to clearly communicate that the participation does not indicate support for his various positions and programs," said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\u000a\u000aActivists are now ramping up the pressure on Pepsi, Campbell Soup, Walmart and even on Wall Street firms.\u000a\u000aMake the Road New York, which focuses on poor and working class communities of color, said it plans to deliver more than 400,000 petitions calling on JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and Blackstone (BX) founder Stephen Schwarzman to dump Trump.

aVThe clerk read the Arizona senator's surname in the microphone of the tense Senate chamber. The two words were met with silence -- McCain had stepped out of the room minutes before.\u000a\u000aBut moments later, he reappeared. By then, the alphabetical roll call had reached Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan. McCain walked over to the front of the chamber, raising his right arm. He held it up in the air until he had the attention of the clerk.\u000a\u000a"No," he said, with a swift thumbs-down.\u000a\u000aIt was a "no" that could barely be heard on C-SPAN, and a thumbs-down that viewers would not have been able to easily make out. But the moment was crystal clear for the dozens of reporters watching from the gallery above, who let out a collective gasp and made a stampede exit for the wooden double doors behind them to report the news.\u000a\u000aIn hindsight, it seems clear: McCain had made up his mind to vote "no" well before he walked into that chamber.\u000a\u000aThere were hints in his body language, the demeanor of the colleagues who approached him and the way the senator navigated the room. As he huddled with members in a series of hushed conversations while Thursday night turned into Friday morning, there were words that could almost be heard from above and even discerned through lip-reading.

Hide Caption 34 of 34\u000a\u000aAll of Thursday, the usually talkative senator had declined to show his cards to probing reporters. There was an evening phone call with House Speaker Paul Ryan aimed at reassuring a group of concerned senators they would get their demands for a conference committee, but even after that call, McCain simply said he wasn't convinced. Since his dramatic return to the Senate several days earlier, McCain had agitated over the rushed and partisan way in which Republican leaders crafted their Obamcare repeal bill.\u000a\u000aNow, with the future of the GOP health care bill in great suspense -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell needed 50 "yes" votes and could only afford two defections -- McCain stepped out of his office in the Russell building to make his way to the Capitol shortly before midnight. A CNN reporter was waiting for him, but until the moment he got into the elevator, the senator was on his cell phone.\u000a\u000a"Which piece?" McCain said into the phone. "No, I didn't see it. What did it say?"\u000a\u000aAfter a pause, the senator responded: "All right, I'll get ready to do that. But it's very hard to do the right thing."\u000a\u000aHe ignored the reporter's question about how he would vote.\u000a\u000aWhen McCain walked onto the Senate floor, the chamber was still largely empty. The vote was called shortly after midnight and most senators still had not arrived.\u000a\u000aIn the cavernous, air-conditioned room, McCain sat down behind a desk next to his best friend, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. From the gallery above, the intensity of the conversation was unmistakable. Both men leaned back into their seats, and it was McCain who did most of the talking, gesturing as though he were trying to explain something. Graham nodded along.\u000a\u000aGraham's phone -- his famous flip phone -- began to ring, and he stepped out the back to take the call. By then, a number of senators had walked into the chamber. But none would approach McCain. For a short while, he sat alone, looking intently ahead of him, a striking contrast to the continuous fanfare he had received from colleagues since returning to Washington after his brain cancer diagnosis and surgery.\u000a\u000aSomething was off for GOP leaders. McConnell and his top deputies, including Sen. John Cornyn and Roy Blunt, were gathered with heads bowed, talking quietly.\u000a\u000aThen, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska approached McCain. Murkowski was one of two senators who had voted "no" earlier in the week on a procedural vote and was speculated as a possible "no" vote again on Friday. As McCain spoke to his colleague, he was so animated -- pumping his fists and speaking slowly for emphasis -- that it was possible to read his lips.\u000a\u000a"I promise," he seemed to say to Murkowski. Moments later, he gestured with his index finger several times. "One senator," he appeared to say, with space between the two words.\u000a\u000aThere was soon another conspicuous sign: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one senator widely expected to vote "no" on Friday, walked up to McCain. When she did, the group broke into laughter. Collins got comfortable, setting down her bright pink bag.\u000a\u000aBy this point, Vice President Mike Pence had arrived. If 50 senators voted yes, he would need to be the final, tie-breaking vote.\u000a\u000aMcCain and Pence spoke for a long stretch, with the vice president standing and the senator still sitting. Once again, McCain was spirited and energetic.\u000a\u000a"I promise you," were the words that the senator appeared to say to Pence at one point.\u000a\u000aBy 1 a.m. ET, it was more than clear that the problem was serious. What was supposed to be a relatively quick procedural vote had dragged out for almost an hour, stuck in limbo as GOP leaders were huddled in hushed conversations. Many eyed McCain from around the room.\u000a\u000aSuddenly, the senator was on the move. He stood up from his desk, hugging and kissing Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, before walking over to the other side of the room where the Democrats sit.\u000a\u000aSurrounded by colleagues from the other party including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, McCain abruptly flexed his armed inward like a gorilla. It was with such force and playfulness that reporters watching from above collectively laughed, prompting some of the senators to look up. Schumer smiled at the press.\u000a\u000aSen. Chris Coons, one of the senators in that huddle, said this was the moment that McCain informed them of his decision. "He stood with a group of us and said, I am a 'no,'" Coons told CNN afterwards. "I was trying not to jump up and down and smile."\u000a\u000aIt was also during this conversation that McCain urged his Democratic colleagues to take up the defense bill as quickly as possible after health care was behind them. McCain has hinted that he would likely be returning to Arizona for cancer treatment next week, and he hoped to have a vote on the defense bill on Friday.\u000a\u000aShortly before the roll call began to be called, McCain briefly stepped out of the Senate chamber.\u000a\u000aReporters would later learn that McCain spoke on the phone with President Donald Trump off of the Senate floor. The President tried -- with no success -- to change McCain's mind.

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.\u000a\u000aNanjing, China (CNN) \u2014 Nanjing has always been a destination for history buffs.\u000a\u000aFrom the magnificent medieval battlements of the city's ancient wall to the impressive final resting place of modern China's founding father Sun Yat-sen, Nanjing is packed with some of the country's most famous landmarks.\u000a\u000aBut the old capital's magic isn't only found at grand monuments, mausoleums and temples.\u000a\u000aHere's our guide to exploring the hidden corners that really make this city of eight million a place worth lingering.\u000a\u000aThe station time forgot\u000a\u000aThe abandoned station is popular place to dress up in 1930s clothing and take wedding photos.\u000a\u000aAt first glance, with its peeling paint and shuttered windows, Pukou Railway Station, on the north side of the river that divides Nanjing, is an unlikely tourist destination.\u000a\u000aBuilt in the early 1900s in European style, it was a major transport hub until a rail and road bridge was built across the Yangtze River in 1968.\u000a\u000aToday it lies largely abandoned in a ramshackle suburban neighborhood but the building, which must have been striking in its heyday, attracts a small but steady stream of visitors keen to capture a slice of a bygone era.\u000a\u000aIt's been used as a location in several Chinese movies set in the Republican era (1912-1949) -- and it's a popular place for local couples to take wedding shots dressed up in 1930s-style clothing.\u000a\u000aA walk along the eerily empty platforms, lined with elegant columns, takes you past a water fountain and discarded empty carriages that are no longer used on China's high-speed modern rail network.\u000a\u000aFor college student Summer Wang, 20, visiting from Hubei province more than 300 miles away, the station's appeal lies in its literary links.\u000a\u000aIt was the setting for "My Father's Back," a touching 1925 essay about a father's love for his son by poet Zhu Ziqing -- a classic of modern Chinese literature.\u000a\u000aThere are plans to redevelop the station as a shopping arcade but Wang thinks this would spoil its unique atmosphere.\u000a\u000a"There's a real sense of history here. You feel like you're going back in time," she says.\u000a\u000aA hotel built with 600-year-old bricks\u000a\u000aThe Yangtze Hotel is built with bricks from the city's 600-year-old wall.\u000a\u000aNanjing's 33-kilometer Ming Dynasty (from the mid-1300s to mid-1600s) wall and its 13 fortified gates are arguably the city's main attraction -- it's listed as a monument of national importance.\u000a\u000aBut China's "other Great Wall" wasn't always as well protected and once held more of the city in its grasp.\u000a\u000aThe 600-year-old bricks -- instantly recognizable by their blue-black color, large size and unusual inscriptions -- make cameo appearances in many of the city's older buildings.\u000a\u000aIn the chaos before and after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, the wall was plundered as a high-quality and easily accessible building material.\u000a\u000aLook out for the bricks on the campus of South East University in the city.\u000a\u000aThe embossed calligraphy tracked where the bricks were made. If they weren't up to standard the emperor could order the brickmaker's execution.\u000a\u000aRemarkably, the Yangtze Villa Hotel on Zhongshan North Road near the city's old port was built using only Ming Dynasty stone slabs, which are 40 to 50 centimeters long and 20 centimeters wide.\u000a\u000aAn unusual example of rural European architecture in China, the three-story structure was built between 1912 and 1914 by a French man who traded with the Nanjing government in 1914 for a massive consignment of the Ming Dynasty bricks.\u000a\u000aLocal architect Zhou Qi has worked to preserve the former guesthouse, which from the 1950s until 2012 contained municipal offices.\u000a\u000aThe renovation is almost complete and next year will open to paying guests once more.\u000a\u000a1865 Creative District\u000a\u000aDirecting Nanjing's trends since 2013.\u000a\u000aEvery major city needs an "it" neighborhood where young creative types cluster and set trends.\u000a\u000aIn Nanjing, authorities hope it'll be the 1865 Creative Park -- where turn-of-the-century machinery factories and a decommissioned military arsenal have been turned into an art zone and business hub.\u000a\u000aIt's similar in feel to the 798 Art Zone in Beijing , which now has world-class galleries, loft-style apartments and trendy book stores, but it's not quite as happening -- the park opened in 2013, so it's still early days.\u000a\u000aOn a typical weekday morning, the galleries, curio shops, bars and cafes are largely empty -- unless there's a film crew using the historical backdrop for a shoot.\u000a\u000aThe renovated buildings have kept much of their industrial character, with double-height windows, brick walls and exposed metal beams -- at least one with a five-ton winch still attached.

aVWashington (CNN) When President Donald Trump travels to Missouri next week to sell a fledgling tax reform effort, more than brackets and rates will be on the line.\u000a\u000aWhite House officials say an entirely new West Wing system for decision-making is being tested as Trump sets out to fulfill a chief campaign promise after efforts on other facets of his agenda sputtered.\u000a\u000aEnacted by new Chief of Staff John Kelly, the structure for streamlining information within the White House and normalizing the decision-making process has drawn praise from aides rattled by months of disorder and chaos.\u000a\u000aBut its first test is pocked with obstacles, most of Trump's own making. He's derided and mocked Republicans on Capitol Hill, including the man whose assent is required for any package to get a vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000aAnd a key administration shepherd of the efforts, National Economic Council chairman Gary Cohn, is openly airing his displeasure at Trump's equivocal statements about white supremacists and neo-Nazis even as he pushes forward with crafting the outlines of a plan.\u000a\u000a"It will be one of the firsct big tests" of Kelly's system, said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation chief economist who advised Trump's campaign. "The tax cut is the next big domestic priority. Given they failed on health care, it raises the stakes."\u000a\u000a"I don't think we know at this point whether (Kelly) can discipline Trump or manage his messaging or not," Moore said. "At the very least he will be a much better traffic cop."\u000a\u000aWhite House officials this week described a West Wing rapidly falling in line with Kelly's mandates, though questions remain about the willingness of Trump himself to adhere to his new chief of staff's rigor.\u000a\u000aA pair of memos distributed on Monday spelled out a rigid system for providing information to the President and for formalizing decisions that come from the Oval Office, according to people familiar with the documents.\u000a\u000aDrafted by Kelly and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter over the past several weeks, the memos specify that all materials \u2014 policy documents, briefing books, and news clippings \u2014 must first be reviewed by one of those two men before reaching Trump's desk.\u000a\u000aIt's a change meant to curtail what was previously a haphazard flow of documents or print-outs \u2014 some of dubious origin \u2014 to the stack of reading material that Trump sifts through daily. It's also designed to ensure all relevant administration agencies are able to weigh in on decisions.\u000a\u000aTrump has not resisted the changes, according to senior administration officials. But even Kelly has acknowledged privately that he cannot plug every channel through which information flows to the President, including from cable news, members of his family, and in nighttime phone calls from friends.\u000a\u000aThe intent of the changes are to better execute the agenda items that Trump has struggled to push forward during the first months of his term, including a failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Kelly has insisted that Trump's schedule be better aligned to promote his projects, according to a person familiar with his thinking, with improved advance planning and a regular schedule of travel to sell his plans.\u000a\u000aTrump did not tour the country to promote health care changes, but he's due Wednesday in Springfield, Missouri, to promote the tax reform effort, according to the White House. An official said Trump would make similar tax-related stops around the country over the next several months, a strategy that Kelly has backed.\u000a\u000a"I can assure you that the President's No. 1 objective is now to get tax reform done," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday. "He is going to go on the road. We're starting with his first trip next week, and the President is 100% supportive of us passing legislation this year."\u000a\u000aPeople close to Trump believe the tax reform effort is poised to succeed where health care did not because Trump himself is better versed in the tax code than he was on health care. While Trump made little effort to delve into specifics of health care, he has expressed strong opinions on tax details going back to last year's campaign, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\u000a\u000aSo far, the process for advancing tax reform has included a mix of administration officials and key Republicans on Capitol Hill \u2014 the so-called "big six." That includes Cohn, McConnell, Mnuchin, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the two top tax writers in Congress -- Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady.\u000a\u000aOf that group, Trump has openly insulted one, caused another to almost resign, and spurred anxieties in at least two more \u2014 a starting point that White House officials concede is less than ideal.\u000a\u000aHis spat with McConnell escalated this week when it emerged the pair haven't spoken in weeks and exchanged profanities during a heated call this summer . The White House said the pair were on track to meet after Labor Day.\u000a\u000aCohn, meanwhile, was on the brink of resigning after the President's freewheeling press conference in which he likened white supremacists to counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, a person familiar with the situation said.\u000a\u000aCohn told the Financial Times that he came under intense pressure to leave his post in the aftermath of Trump's remarks about hateful protests, though ultimately decided to remain on.\u000a\u000a"I am reluctant to leave my post as director of the National Economic Council because I feel a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people. But I also feel compelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks," he told the newspaper.\u000a\u000aHis departure would have delivered a blow to Trump's tax reform efforts. But even his decision to remain largely overshadowed the rest of his Financial Times interview, which provided the most substantial view to date of Trump's tax reform efforts.

aVStory highlights The biggest mistake that was made during the Holocaust was that people didn't speak up, says Sonia K, a survivor\u000a\u000aWe must stand against anti-Semitism and racism, or we could find ourselves repeating a regrettable history, she says\u000a\u000aSonia K. is a Holocaust survivor who was forced to live in the Warsaw Ghetto before being taken to Majdanek , Auschwitz, Ravensbruck, and Malchow concentration camps. She was liberated in April of 1945 by American soldiers in Mittenwald, Germany. Sonia went on to have a family and open the first Jewish business in Mittenwald after the war. She currently lives in Brooklyn, New York, where she volunteers with Hadassah, Amit and State of Israel Bonds. Sonia is a client in Selfhelp Community Services' Brooklyn Holocaust Survivor Program. Selfhelp is a nonprofit that supports seniors and at-risk populations in New York, including Holocaust survivors.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When I came to the United States in 1949 after the Second World War, the world had just witnessed the horrific culmination of centuries of anti-Semitism: the indefensible murder of 6 million Jews.\u000a\u000aSonia K.\u000a\u000aIn the 1930s, we all believed that nothing like the Holocaust could ever happen, and for the past seven decades, we've said that nothing like it can ever happen again.\u000a\u000aBut the last few months have felt like 1938 all over again, the year when Kristallnacht -- a night when riotous violence against Jews swept through Nazi Germany \u2014 announced the brutal persecution to come. I'm scared -- not for myself, but for my children, my grandchildren, and all children.\u000a\u000aSome might dismiss the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, as the actions of unhinged or fringe individuals. Others might believe President Trump's comments equating neo-Nazi and anti-fascist protesters are merely reflective of his often exaggerated speech. However, Holocaust survivors know all too well that what starts as a protest or an offhand comment can turn into something far worse. In the 1930s, the warning signs of what was to come were similar to the events unfolding today -- and society didn't listen. We can't afford to make that mistake again.\u000a\u000aSonia K. and her husband Josef.\u000a\u000aI was born in Poland and forced to live in the Warsaw Ghetto until mid-1943, when I was taken to Majdanek concentration camp and then Auschwitz. By the time I was liberated in April 1945, I had survived four concentration camps.

aV(CNN) The race to the top has just gotten tighter, with two rising mega-towers in the Middle East battling to become the world's tallest.\u000a\u000aConstruction has now begun on The Tower at Dubai Creek Harbor , a vast waterfront development, with completion scheduled for ahead of Dubai's Expo 2020 world fair, which kicks off in October that year.\u000a\u000aPiercing through a canopy of clouds, The Tower, at 3,045ft (928m), aims to take the title of world's tallest tower, which the 2,723ft-tall (830m) Burj Khalifa , also in Dubai, has held since 2010.\u000a\u000aBut it's got competition. The Jeddah Tower , in Saudi Arabia, is also slated to finish in 2020.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, this gleaming vertical will be 236ft (72m) taller than Dubai's creation.\u000a\u000aIf The Tower in Dubai wants the world title, even for a short time, it has to open its doors before the Jeddah Tower.\u000a\u000aThe Tower will be the heart of Dubai Creek Harbour, one of the largest tourist and lifestyle developments in the world stretching across 2.3 square miles (6 sqkm).\u000a\u000aReady, steady, go!\u000a\u000aBoth of these towers are feats in modern engineering.\u000a\u000aThe Tower , in Dubai, is being constructed by Emaar, the real estate giant also behind the Burj Khalifa, and will anchor the Dubai Creek development, serving -- developers hope -- as a magnet for tourists.\u000a\u000aDesigned by Swiss-Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava Valls , it will feature The Pinnacle Room -- an observation point offering 360-degree views of the emirate -- and public vertical gardens, while 18 to 20 floors have been reserved for homes, restaurants, shops and a boutique hotel.\u000a\u000aIf construction runs to schedule, this $1 billion tower will have been thrown up in just three years.\u000a\u000aThe Jeddah Tower, in Saudi Arabia, will have taken a little longer.\u000a\u000aConstruction on this graceful arrow to the sky began on April 1, 2013, and was originally slated for completion in 2018, but its opening date has already been pushed back twice.

"2020 is a real possibility for completion."\u000a\u000aBecause less than 50% of The Tower's height is occupied by usable floor space, it is defined by the CTBUH as a "supported tower" rather than a "building".\u000a\u000aThis technicality precludes The Tower from achieving the distinction of being the world's tallest building.

aV(CNN) When it comes to the hit Netflix series " 13 Reasons Why ," many viewers find themselves on either side of a controversial debate.\u000a\u000aOn one end, fans of the binge-able show applaud the series for raising awareness about the tragedy of youth suicide and shedding light on how to spot warning signs of depression or suicidal thoughts.\u000a\u000aOn the other end, mental health experts describe the show as worrisome and point to how its relatable characters and graphic depiction of suicide can pose a health risk for young people already struggling with mental health issues.\u000a\u000aIt turns out that following the show's premiere in March, online searches for terms related to suicide awareness and prevention increased, but so did search terms associated with ideation -- and those had greater relative upsurge, according to the paper, which published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday.\u000a\u000aAfter the premiere of "13 Reasons Why," the search phrase "how to commit suicide" rose 26% above what would normally have been expected for that time; "suicide prevention" went up 23%; and "suicide hotline number" climbed 21%, based on the paper's data.\u000a\u000a"The time for rhetorical debate is over," said John Ayers, research professor at San Diego State University and lead author of the paper.\u000a\u000a"While '13 Reasons Why' has certainly caused the conversation to begin -- it's raised awareness, and we do see a variety of suicide-related searches increasing -- our worst fears were confirmed," he said. "That is, thousands of people, thousands more, are searching online about ways to kill themselves."\u000a\u000aBased on best-selling author Jay Asher's 2007 young adult book of the same title, the show follows the fictional story of a teenage girl named Hannah Baker, played by actress Katherine Langford. Hannah leaves behind 13 mysterious cassette tape recordings after killing herself. Each audio recording is addressed to a person who Hannah says played a role in her devastating decision to end her own life.\u000a\u000aThe show, co-produced by actress and pop star Selena Gomez, has been renewed for a second season. Filming for the upcoming season reportedly has commenced in parts of California's Bay Area\u000a\u000aDue to the findings in the new paper, Ayers called for the second season to be postponed and changes to be retrofitted to the already released first season.\u000a\u000aIn a statement that Netflix provided to CNN, the entertainment streaming company said, "We always believed this show would increase discussion around this tough subject matter. This is an interesting quasi experimental study that confirms this. We are looking forward to more research and taking everything we learn to heart as we prepare for season 2."\u000a\u000aA surge of suicide searches\u000a\u000aFor the paper, researchers collected data on suicide-related Google search trends in the United States from March 31, when "13 Reasons Why" premiered, through April 18, before former NFL player Aaron Hernandez's suicide , which would have skewed the search data.\u000a\u000aThe researchers also eliminated search terms in the data related to the popular superhero movie "Suicide Squad," resulting in a final database of 20 suicide-related search terms.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that searches for 17 of those 20 terms were higher than expected for 12 of the 19 days that were studied following the release of "13 Reasons Why."\u000a\u000aFor instance, suicide-related searches were 15% higher on April 15 and then 44% higher on April 18, the researchers found. The queries that focused on suicidal ideation had the largest increases, the data showed.\u000a\u000aOverall, the increase over the 19-day period represented a total of about 900,000 to 1.5 million more searches than otherwise expected, Ayers said.\u000a\u000aNetflix gave "13 Reasons Why" a TV-MA rating , which is for mature audiences, and the first season's episodes 9, 12 and 13 - which contain more explicit material - had specific warnings prior to the beginning of each episode.\u000a\u000aAt midnight on the day of the show's debut, 13ReasonsWhy.info , a website built by Netflix, launched. It includes links to various suicide helplines\u000a\u000aAdditionally, during production of the first season, "13 Reasons Why" executive producers consulted with several mental health professionals and doctors who helped guide the show's storytelling approach to suicide, sexual assault and bullying, according to the Netflix statement.\u000a\u000aYet in the new paper, the researchers wrote that the show could have done more to reduce associations with suicidal ideation by closely following the World Health Organization's media guidelines for preventing suicide (PDF).\u000a\u000aFor instance, the guidelines recommend avoiding detailed descriptions or portrayals of a suicide method, among other recommendations.\u000a\u000a"Psychiatrists have expressed grave concerns because the show ignores the World Health Organization's validated media guidelines for preventing suicide. The show's staff instead continue to prefer their gut instincts," Ayers said. "The show's makers must swiftly change their course of action, including removing the show and postponing a second season."\u000a\u000aIn an op-ed published in Vanity Fair in April, a writer for the "13 Reasons Why" series defended the decision not to shy away from main character Hannah's suicide and to include a gruesome scene of her death in the first season.\u000a\u000a"From the very beginning, I agreed that we should depict the suicide with as much detail and accuracy as possible. I even argued for it -- relating the story of my own suicide attempt to the other writers," wrote Nic Sheff, one of the show's writers.\u000a\u000aIn the op-ed, Sheff detailed how a woman once told him about her painful suicide attempt and her account caused him to reconsider his own suicide attempt.\u000a\u000a"If that woman had not told me her story, I wouldn't be here now. I would've missed out on all the amazing gifts I have in my life today," Sheff wrote.\u000a\u000a"So when it came time to discuss the portrayal of the protagonist's suicide in '13 Reasons Why,' I of course immediately flashed on my own experience. It seemed to me the perfect opportunity to show what an actual suicide really looks like -- to dispel the myth of the quiet drifting off," he wrote.\u000a\u000aThe risk of suicide 'contagion'\u000a\u000aAll in all, the new paper suggests an association between "13 Reasons Why" and suicide-related Google searches. However, the analyses cannot definitively conclude that the show caused the searches. Also, it could not be ascertained from the data whether any of the searches actually led to a suicide attempt.\u000a\u000aMore research is needed to determine the true risk-benefit when it comes to the association between "13 Reasons Why" and heightened interest in suicide among viewers, said Madelyn Gould, a professor of epidemiology in psychiatry at Columbia University, who was not involved in the new paper.\u000a\u000a"These analyses, by Ayers and his team, seem to indicate that suicide awareness was heightened and I think that that is a relief, but unfortunately at what price was that awareness raised?" Gould said.\u000a\u000aA separate paper previously suggested that some online searches for suicide-related terms could be tied to suicide deaths. In that paper, searches such as "complete guide of suicide" correlated with actual suicide deaths between 2004 and 2009 in Taiwan. That research published in the Journal of Affective Disorders in 2011.\u000a\u000aAs for the new paper, although there were some limitations in the study design, the authors took a creative first step in examining the influence of "13 Reasons Why" by analyzing online search trends, said John Ackerman, suicide prevention coordinator at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\u000a\u000aHe was not involved in the new paper, but wrote a blog post in April about "13 Reasons Why" and guidance for parents.\u000a\u000a"It addresses an important question: Are we seeing actual suicidal thinking and behavior being influenced by a television show?" Ackerman said about the paper.\u000a\u000a"I believe most people working on the show felt like by raising awareness of youth suicide and portraying it graphically, they would somehow discourage young people from engaging in suicidal behavior. Sadly, this is not how suicide contagion works," he said.\u000a\u000aSuicide contagion refers to when exposure to suicide within a family, group of friends, military unit, or through the media may be associated with an increase in suicidal behaviors, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services\u000a\u000aGould said that such contagion can be demonstrated in a theory termed the Werther Effect , which refers to how negative stories about engaging in suicidal behavior can be linked to an increase in deaths by suicide.\u000a\u000aThe Werther Effect's name stems from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1774 novel, " The Sorrows of Young Werther ," which ends in suicide and was reportedly linked to a wave of young men in Europe deciding to kill themselves in the late 1700s.\u000a\u000a" 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' elicited a kind of epidemic of copycats, of people dressing up like this character in the book," said Dr. Victor Schwartz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the new paper.\u000a\u000aWhile most teens can read novels or watch shows, like "13 Reasons Why," and not have suicidal thoughts or behaviors as a result, not all can, said Schwartz, who serves as chief medical officer of the JED Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on emotional health and suicide prevention among teens and young adults.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Cyberbullying blamed in teen suicides Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cyberbullying blamed in teen suicides 02:39\u000a\u000a"Looking at it from a prevention standpoint, it's concerning when a young person already has a prehistory or an existing mental health problem with anxiety, depression, and, for a smaller group, actually psychotic illnesses," Schwartz said, adding that such illnesses are risk factors for suicidal behavior.\u000a\u000a"If a young person has a history of serious mental health or substance concerns, then obviously that adds a layer of vulnerability" when consuming media about suicide, he said.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, positive contagion has been more recently termed the Papageno Effect , which refers to how positive stories of overcoming suicidal thoughts can be linked to a decrease in deaths.\u000a\u000aSo, fictional tales or news reports about a character finding coping strategies for suicidal thoughts can have an inverse relationship with suicidal behaviors. The Papageno Effect's name stems from the character Papageno in Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute." In the opera, the character overcomes a suicidal crisis.\u000a\u000aThe new "13 Reasons Why" paper adds to a body of research conducted by Ayers and his colleagues that highlights the influence that celebrities and the media can have on public health outcomes.\u000a\u000aPreviously, Ayers and his colleagues analyzed how actor Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago was associated with an increase in Google searches for HIV testing kits and a boost in kit sales. Their study published in the journal Prevention Science in May.\u000a\u000aThe researchers wrote in their new paper that further examinations of "13 Reasons Why" might reveal whether the show also could be tied to actual changes in behaviors, from calls placed to national suicide hotlines or estimated suicide attempts.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aGlobally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15- to 29-year-olds, according to the WHO. In the US, about 4,600 young people between 10 and 24 die by suicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u000a\u000a"Maybe this will have some impact on the producers of '13 Reasons Why' as they develop their second season," Gould said about the new paper. "None of us know what that second season is going to be about. I hope that they recognize that it's not just suicidal behavior that can get modeled and that there are other deleterious behaviors that can get modeled as well."

aVSarah Sekula, CNN \u2022 Published 21st August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Meet Leland Kent. He is slightly obsessed with rust and decay, peeling paint and piles of debris. He's OK breathing in musty air and unusual smells, crawling through mud, squeezing through fences and hoisting himself over barbed wire.\u000a\u000aAll in the name of art.\u000a\u000aHe's what you call an urban explorer. Part historian and part artist, he spends much of his time photographing New Orleans' long-forgotten buildings.\u000a\u000a"Most people are amazed at what I photograph," says Kent, creator of abandonedsoutheast.com . "They are intrigued by the decay and what objects are left behind."\u000a\u000aSince 2014, he's explored about 100 derelict buildings across the Southeast and a dozen or so in New Orleans.\u000a\u000aDuring that time, he's come to realize that there's no shortage of vacant buildings to explore. Twelve years after Hurricane Katrina ripped through the city, New Orleans still has loads of abandoned buildings -- about 20,000, according to local government officials.\u000a\u000aThe ruins of New Orleans\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 11 The auditorium inside Booker T. Washington High School in New Orleans. The school was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina. It's near the Superdome.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor Kent, each of those crumbling structures is another chance to discover beauty -- even in the former New Orleans Public Service Power Plant, also known as the Market Street Power Plant, which shut down in 1973.\u000a\u000aWhen you enter, he says, you can see all five levels, the bottom of which is flooded with murky, green water. Light streams in through broken windows. You are surrounded by pipes and rust. It's steampunk heaven.\u000a\u000a"It's quite a sight," he says. "It's really awe-inspiring standing inside of it. I mean, it's massive."\u000a\u000aNot to mention creepy. The perfect backdrop for movies and TV shows. The science fiction film "Oblivion" was shot there as well as the AMC series "Into the Badlands."\u000a\u000aA growing trend\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of folks just like Kent who are intrigued by the beauty of decay. Just Google #urbex #ruinporn or #urbxunderground, and you'll find everything from defunct amusement parks in Kentucky to dilapidated mansions in Detroit.\u000a\u000aFor Kent, the chance to see something others will never see is particularly appealing. One place he has visited a handful of times is Charity Hospital in the lower Mid-City neighborhood.\u000a\u000aThe building has recently been cleaned up, but when Kent visited in January 2015, he says there were containers of discarded body parts, biohazard waste, broken windows, walls of peeling paint and piles of debris. On the basement wall he could see the water line left behind by Katrina's floodwaters.\u000a\u000aThat begs the question: How safe is it to enter these buildings?\u000a\u000aYou never know what to expect. Kent has come across graffiti artists, homeless people, other explorers and drug addicts. But he says no one has ever been aggressive.\u000a\u000aHe has had a few alarming animal encounters, however. He spotted a huge black snake in an abandoned Florida factory once that chased him out of a building.\u000a\u000aThe New Orleans Police Department points out that trespassing is not only illegal, but can also be dangerous.\u000a\u000a"There may be structural problems with the building that could cause harm. In some situations, dangerous individuals may be using the building for illegal activity, posing additional hazards for urban explorers," says Beau Tidwell, communications director for the NOPD.\u000a\u000a"A lot of times there are abandoned places in the rougher part of town, so you just have to be cautious," Kent says. "I've avoided places because people were hanging around outside."\u000a\u000aGaining access\u000a\u000aHow exactly does Kent go about gaining access? "If someone owns the property, I ask for permission to photograph," he explains. "Sometimes it is a matter of finding a broken window or unlocked door."\u000a\u000a"There are places I visit that are considered off limits," he adds. "No one would be given permission, so the only way to gain access is by trespassing."\u000a\u000aDespite the risks, he says he'll continue to explore, even going back to places he's already visited like the Touro-Shakespeare Home, a former nursing home on the west bank of the Mississippi River.\u000a\u000aOutside, vines swirl around the columns and concrete fountains are overgrown with weeds. There are stepped parapets, a prominent front portico and diamond-patterned brickwork. Inside, 20-foot domed ceilings tower over walls covered in graffiti and all the stained-glass windows have been removed. But it's easy to imagine the building being quite a sight in its glory days.

aVMichael Smart is an assistant professor of transportation planning at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The views expressed are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Imagine being able to travel from New York to Los Angeles without having to step on a plane, yet be able to do so in a fraction of the time it would take to drive. On the surface, that tantalizing prospect took a step closer with the news last month that a Japanese maglev train had reached a top speed of close to 400 mph, breaking its own world record in the process.\u000a\u000aAnd the sight of futuristic looking trains whizzing past platforms at hundreds of miles per hour isn't confined to Japan: China, France and Spain, to name a few, have their own high-speed rail networks. Indeed, while these bullet trains may look futuristic, they have been around for decades; they're a tried and tested technology that the Japanese debuted over 50 years ago.\u000a\u000aSo surely it's only a matter of time before large numbers of U.S. passengers are doing a daily commute to New York from Washington and Boston in about the time it would take them to drive to work in their own cities, right?\u000a\u000aNot anytime soon.\u000a\u000aWhile several countries have undertaken the tough work of raising the money to invest in bullet trains, it's unlikely the United States will ever see the vast network of high-speed trains that blanket other countries. Indeed, passenger rail service in the United States lags behind much of the rest of the developed world, for several reasons.\u000a\u000aFor a start, much of the United States is not exactly an ideal market for high-speed rail. Compared to places where rail really flourishes -- Japan and Western Europe, for instance -- the United States is geographically vast. As a result, in much of the country, cities are far enough apart that air travel provides significant time savings, even compared to some of the fastest trains.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Japan's trains as safe as they are fast Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan's trains as safe as they are fast 02:19\u000a\u000aThe layout of cities matters, too. When you arrive in Tokyo, Paris or Barcelona, it's often convenient (and even pleasant) to walk to your final destination. When it's not, a fast and frequent mass transportation system awaits to whisk you away. This is not the case in many American cities, where arriving by train typically means jumping into a cab or renting a car for the last leg of your journey. Simply put, in many sprawling U.S. cities, getting to your destination by train can still mean you've got quite a way yet to get home. We could change that. And we probably should. But we're not there yet.\u000a\u000aStill, there are several parts of the United States where high-speed rail makes a great deal of sense.\u000a\u000aThe Northeast Corridor (Boston-New York-Washington) comes in at the top of just about every list of potential candidates for high-speed rail, with the distances involved being considered within the "Goldilocks" zone for fast trains. For example, at just over 200 miles from New York to both Boston and Washington, fast trains could compete with even faster airplanes by offering centrally located stations and providing an alternative to the hassle of airport security lines. These cities are dense, have strong downtowns, and extensive mass transit systems once you arrive.\u000a\u000aJust as importantly, rail on the Northeast Corridor can also compete with driving, mainly because traffic congestion makes driving in the region so slow and unreliable, while tolls and parking costs can make it an expensive and time-consuming option. Rail in the northeast even has a great track record; after Amtrak's almost-high-speed Acela service began on the Northeast Corridor in 2000, ridership exploded, quickly outstripping air travel between New York and Washington.\u000a\u000aHowever, the biggest barrier to improved rail service in the United States is simply the lack of political will. At the federal level, support for passenger rail service has languished and Washington has devolved decision-making (and increasingly, funding) to the states. With the nation's transportation trust fund nearly broke and no permanent solution in sight, it seems unlikely the federal government will champion high-speed rail -- a costly endeavor -- in the near future.\u000a\u000aWithout leadership from the federal government, the states are largely in control. Yet many of the most promising corridors for high-speed rail cross state lines, making it difficult to plan for better rail service. In 2009, the Obama administration awarded nearly a billion dollars of stimulus money to plan and upgrade a high-speed rail line connecting Chicago to Milwaukee and Madison. A year later, Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, rejected his state's portion of the money and the project was, for the time being, at least, derailed. (The money quickly found its way to a grateful California for its high-speed rail line.)\u000a\u000aStill, all is not lost for those hoping to see high-speed rail in the United States.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours Replay More Videos ...

Several privately funded projects are also in the planning stages. For instance, a Dallas-to-Houston line promises 205 mph service in 2021 without a single dollar from the taxpayer. Meanwhile, another private company has already begun construction on a Miami-to-Orlando line with a more modest speed of 125 mph, with service expected to begin in 2017.\u000a\u000aAll this points to how high-speed rail will likely progress in the United States: piecemeal. It is doubtful that we will have a nationwide system of fast trains soon. And this is not necessarily a bad thing; through a combination of private and public action, we should target markets where high-speed rail makes sense. That means looking for shorter corridors connecting dense places with existing mass transit infrastructure.\u000a\u000aHigh-speed rail won't be cheap, so we'll have to choose wisely. Some of the most promising corridors are also the most expensive; Amtrak estimates upgrading the Northeast Corridor to true high-speed rail would cost upward of $150 billion . Such an undertaking requires careful consideration of the economic, environmental and other costs and benefits of individual projects. But more importantly, it requires the kind of long-term planning that seems to have become vanishingly rare.\u000a\u000aThankfully, high-speed rail doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach. And while given the choice I would rather be riding Japan's speeding bullet trains, even the incremental improvements we've seen in services like Amtrak's Acela can make rail travel a lot more appealing for the hundreds of thousands of passengers who rely on it every year.\u000a\u000aRead CNN Opinion's Flipboard magazine.

That joke, delivered in the 1960s by trailblazing comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory, who passed away Saturday, seems unsettlingly relevant in today's America. Though we aren't in the midst of the struggle for civil rights, that joke was about the evils of white supremacy -- something we are clearly still grappling with today.\u000a\u000aGregory has been credited by most as the first African-American comedian to reach fame by challenging racism through comedy. Richard Pryor may have put it best in a 2004 interview : "Dick Gregory was the greatest, and he was the first.

aVDr. Howard Markel, the George E. Wantz distinguished professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, is the author of " The Kelloggs: The Battling Brothers of Battle Creek. "\u000a\u000a(CNN) This morning, more than 350 million people devoured a bowl of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. All told, more than 128 billion bowls of Corn Flakes are consumed each year. While perusing the cereal box, peering over the bowl and gripping a spoonful of the stuff, few of these sleepy diners know that two men created those famously crispy, golden flakes of corn. John Harvey Kellogg, one of America's most famous physicians, and Will Keith Kellogg, John's longtime lackey and whipping boy, were brothers from the Michigan hamlet of Battle Creek. Together, they introduced and mass-marketed the concept of "wellness."\u000a\u000aAnd in so doing, they transfigured breakfast.\u000a\u000aIn early 1906, at the advanced age of 46, Will Keith Kellogg acrimoniously left his brother John's employ at the famed Battle Creek Sanitarium, a medical center and grand hotel -- a "university of health" that treated the wealthy ill and the worried well and promoted wellness or, as the doctor called it, "biologic living."\u000a\u000aWill marched across the street and founded the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, the original name of the Kellogg Company, which today enjoys more than $14 billion a year in net sales of breakfast cereals, snacks and other manufactured foods in 180 nations around the globe.\u000a\u000aFlaked cereals were initially developed by the Kellogg brothers as a health food for "invalids with poor digestion." Dr. Kellogg specialized in treating people with chronic flatulence, constipation, indigestion, all from consuming of the then-typical American diet of greasy fried foods, salted or cured meats, creamed vegetables, spicy pickles and condiments, and too much caffeine and alcohol. No wonder Walt Whitman once called stomachaches "the great American evil."\u000a\u000aWill's genius was to recognize that there were far many more people looking for a nutritious and convenient breakfast, so he substituted tasty corn for the bland wheat originally used, added some salt and sugar against the doctor's prescription, and came up with Corn Flakes.\u000a\u000aThe dawn of 'processed food'\u000a\u000aWill was a serious student of the "science" of business, whether he was publishing his brother's books and magazines, selling the foods and health products John invented, running the Battle Creek Sanitarium or manufacturing cereal. He methodically analyzed, applied and adopted efficiency techniques and business systems espoused by the best commercial gurus of the day.\u000a\u000aPhysician John Harvey Kellogg, shown at age 86, championed "biologic living" to millions, including famous figures who came to "the San."\u000a\u000aFor nearly a quarter of a century, while John enacted one scene after another of fraternal dominance, the quiet, stolid Will was doing far more than merely taking orders. He was preparing to become a renowned captain of industry. Just as Henry Ford was figuring out the economies of scale to sell the millions of automobiles rolling off his vaunted assembly line, Will Kellogg revolutionized the administration of the modern medical center and, later, the mass production and marketing of "processed food."\u000a\u000aWill tirelessly persuaded American grocers to carry his products and consumers to relish his cereals. Heralding breakfast as "the most important meal of the day," Will made the hectic mornings of beleaguered mothers and fathers so much easier by providing a quick, convenient, healthy, nutritious breakfast they could simply pour out of a box and into a bowl. He was an early adopter of the newly created field of mass advertising and invested millions of dollars in a neverending barrage of colorful and attractive ads, slogans and jingles, cartoon characters and, when radio and later television took the nation by storm, entertaining shows and commercials. He was quick to recognize and target youngsters as the demographic group most likely to hunger for his products, as they hunted for the prizes he cleverly placed in his cereal boxes.\u000a\u000aW.K. Kellogg, shown in 1940, was a successful industrialist who "revolutionized mass production of food," starting with Corn Flakes.\u000a\u000aWill Kellogg, of course, benefited by creating his business at the dawn of the 20th century, when huge corporations and nationally known brands began to dominate the American landscape. He became the "Corn Flake King" during the synchronous rise of urban populations, better living and nutritional conditions, and a national system of transportation, first by rail and later by highways, which allowed for the rapid delivery of raw grain into his factories and cases of cereal out of them. He capitalized on the widespread distribution of his food products, thanks to the development and rise of self-serve grocery stores, supermarkets and, perhaps most important, clean, safe, fresh pasteurized milk -- the essential accoutrement of any bowl of cereal.\u000a\u000aYet there was far more to Will Kellogg's genius than mere timing or the willingness to adopt new business methods. As he labored to process whole grains into ready-to-eat cereals, he refused to be satisfied with the status quo. The boss' charge was to always improve on what the company produced. He developed ever-more-sophisticated means of packaging to keep his cereals fresh and toasty, whether on the grocery shelf or in the kitchen cabinet.\u000a\u000aFrom the start of his manufacturing career, Will announced himself to the American public with a facsimile of his signature on every box of the "original" Kellogg's Corn Flakes. It was initially devised as a means of thwarting the dozens of copycat companies stealing ideas and sales from his cereal business.\u000a\u000aAbove Will's signature was the solemn promise that the box's contents were tasty, crisp, nutritious and, most important, genuine. This pledge, backed by better and better means of quality control, was essential to building a longstanding, trustworthy and profitable relationship with the American public. Today, an artist's rendition of Will's signature -- the familiar red script "Kellogg's" -- appears on virtually every product his company manufactures. It is a scribble almost as famous as another iconic American scrawl, "Walt Disney."\u000a\u000aThe most-consumed breakfasts in history\u000a\u000aIn essence, Will Kellogg inaugurated an entirely new industry centered on the transformation of foods from their natural state into cooked, shaped, chemically manipulated, mass-manufactured products. During his lifetime, his name appeared on billions of boxes of Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, All-Bran, Bran Krumbles, Pep, Corn-Soya Shreds and similar products. After his death in 1951, his company pushed glucose-loaded concoctions such as Kellogg's Sugar Frosted Flakes, Sugar Smacks, Froot Loops, Cocoa Krispies, Pop Tarts and a long list of other processed foods.\u000a\u000aMany of these products are nutritious and convenient; others may have played a significant role in fueling the current obesity epidemic among children and adults. Regardless of the precise ingredients filling the Kellogg Company's horn of plenty, Will's crunchy concoctions make up the most-consumed breakfasts in the history of humankind.\u000a\u000aJohn, the once-famous doctor, built his kingdom upon the foundation of his personality and theories on wellness and vitality. It was a realm he dreamed would last forever but one that effectively ended with his funeral. Will died a little more than eight years later, and despite their differences, he is buried only a few dozen feet away from his older brother in Battle Creek's Oak Hill cemetery.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe company he founded remains a multinational behemoth of food production. The charitable foundation he endowed with the mountain of money he made on Corn Flakes is one of the largest in the world and continues to work for the welfare of children, families and communities. When uttering the name "Kellogg" today, it is, undoubtedly, Will's industry we recall. As Bing Crosby crooned in the opening refrain of a song he recorded in 1968, "What's more American than Corn Flakes?"

aVThe company that makes them, Fiskars, claims to have sold over a billion worldwide, so there's a good chance you have a pair at home.\u000a\u000aBut you may not know this: In Bäckström's homeland of Finland, the scissors are so iconic that their 50th birthday is being celebrated with a special exhibition at the Helsinki Design Museum.\u000a\u000aThese simple household tools have become a source of national pride in a country that takes design seriously, according to Pekka Korvenmaa, a professor of design and culture at Finland's Aalto University.\u000a\u000a"They're the most widely-spread Finnish design product," said Korvenmaa in a phone interview.\u000a\u000a"In Finland, when we say 'scissors' we mean Fiskars. There are no other scissors -- more or less -- so it's taken for granted."\u000a\u000aGame-changing design\u000a\u000aEveryday users may give little thought to the design of scissors, but Korvenmaa heralds it as ground-breaking.\u000a\u000a"Its success comes from the ergonomic performance -- the shape and grip of the handle. You take the scissors into your hand and feel the fit," he said.\u000a\u000aHowever, the real game-changer wasn't the shape but the materials. Most of the scissors available in 1967 -- when Bäckström made his design breakthrough -- were the heavy iron variety used by tailors.\u000a\u000a"Tailors' scissors were horrendously expensive, so Fiskars took the shape and cast it in a cheap material -- plastic," said Korvenmaa.\u000a\u000a"Rather than being forged from iron, the blades were made from pressed steel which was held together by a single piece of metal in the middle. The whole production process became quite simple and inexpensive."\u000a\u000aAlthough Fiskars calls the design an " amazing leap in cutting performance ," its success was as much a matter of affordability.\u000a\u000a"Scissors became much more accessible," explained on the phone Marika Orkamo, Fiskars' Vice President of branding and marketing.\u000a\u000a"Not every household had them, even in the 1960s. But eventually they became part of the mass market."\u000a\u000aA happy accident\u000a\u000aFiskars has flirted with different colors over the years. Red handles, for instance, are used to differentiate left-handed models.\u000a\u000aBut the company's brand remains tied to the distinctive orange of its best-selling product -- 'Fiskars Orange' even became a registered trademark in Finland in 2003.\u000a\u000aThe choice of this particular hue, however, came about by accident, according to Orkamo.\u000a\u000a"When the first samples were being produced, there were supposed to be three options -- black, green and red," she said. "But the guy who mixed the plastic had just made an orange-colored juicer, and he had some leftovers in the machine.\u000a\u000a"He wanted to use orange first so that they didn't waste any plastic. When [Fiskars' employees] were presented with the four final choices, they had a vote, and orange beat black by nine votes to seven."\u000a\u000aWhile the original color stuck, changes have been made to the design first proposed by Bäckström, who died in 1998 aged 75. The cutting angle has been altered to improve performance, and a more durable plastic has been in use since the 1980s.\u000a\u000aNot just for the home\u000a\u000aNext month, the Design Museum Helsinki will host an exhibition of work by artists and designers who use -- or are inspired by -- the simple orange scissors.\u000a\u000a"It's such an everyday object that we were worried it could be quite boring," said Orkamo, who curated the exhibition. "But then we started thinking about the different ways the scissors are used, and all the industries that use them."\u000a\u000aThe result is a varied collection of contributions from fashion designers, paper-cutters and food artists. The exhibition also features a playlist by a Finnish musician who goes by the name "DJ Fiskars."\u000a\u000aSome of the participants play explicitly on the scissors' color and design. But others, like artist and designer Martin Bergström, simply used them as a tool. Hailing from Sweden, Bergström will present two pieces: a long flowing dress and collages made from dried flowers.\u000a\u000a"I've had these scissors around since I was a child," he said on the phone. "I've used them in my work for a long, long time.\u000a\u000a"Fiskars' scissors are very well-known in Sweden too -- but I don't think everyone knows they're Finnish. Most people probably think they're from Sweden!"

The coffins, inside and out, are littered with fragments of clothes, bones and ceramics.\u000a\u000aFor three decades, Wong How Man, a Hong Kong-based explorer, has been hellbent on chasing coffins like these in gravity-defying graveyards across China in an attempt to discover more about this unusual burial custom.\u000a\u000aWong, who began his career as a journalist with National Geographic, first came across a group of coffins perched 90 meters (300 feet) up a cliff face in southern Sichuan, to the north of Guizhou, in 1985 during an expedition to track the Yangtze River from mouth to source.\u000a\u000aA life-long obsession was born.\u000a\u000a"At first, it was simply how the hell did they get there and then I couldn't stop thinking about why," he says. "And there're so many theories."\u000a\u000a"Hanging coffins" rest in a cave in Guizhou, southwest China.\u000a\u000aCoffin-chasing\u000a\u000aHanging coffins, as they're known, are found across a swathe of central China -- mostly in remote valleys to the south of the mighty Yangtze River, which flows from the Himalayan foothills to China's eastern coast.\u000a\u000aThe coffins rest in a variety of formations, sometimes barely visible from the ground below. They're lined up in the crevices in the cliff face, balanced on wooden cantilevered stakes, placed in rectangular spaces hewn in the rock face or stacked high up in caves like those Wong saw on his latest coffin-chasing expedition to Guizhou.\u000a\u000aThe oldest are said to be in the eastern province of Fujian, dating back 3,000 years. There's no clear reason why this practice took place.\u000a\u000aAncient literature from the Tang Dynasty suggests that the higher the coffins were placed, the greater the show of filial piety to the deceased. Others say the reasoning was more practical: It prevented animals from poaching the bodies and kept land free to farm.\u000a\u000aNew sites are still being discovered. In 2015, the People's Daily newspaper reported that a total of 131 hanging coffins were discovered in the central province of Hubei, placed in man made caves in a cliff 50 meters wide and 100 meters high.\u000a\u000a"Experts haven't figured out how ancient people managed to transport the coffin, body and funeral objects -- together weighing hundreds of kilograms -- to the cliff caves," the report said.\u000a\u000aMany questions, few answers\u000a\u000aIntent on discovering more about this extraordinary practice, Wong began to amass a library of what little scholarly research had been carried out on the practice. He published his first paper in 1991 in a US archeology journal.\u000a\u000aHowever, it wasn't until 2000, once Wong had founded the non-profit China Exploration and Research Society (CERS), that he was able to get up close and excavate one of these high-rise cemeteries -- at a site named Washi in northern Yunnan not far from the first site Wong laid eyes on.\u000a\u000aThe site in Washi, Yunnan where Wong's organization conducted an archeological excavation.\u000a\u000aHe and his team rapelled down the cliff face to assess the coffins, which rested on rotting stakes of wood. They then built bamboo scaffolding to secure the most vulnerable coffins, which also allowed them to examine and document the contents.\u000a\u000aWhat he found raised more questions than it answered. The oldest coffins dated back to the Tang dynasty but many contained bones from multiple bodies. Wong believes the bodies would have been buried first and the bones put in the hanging coffins once the bodies had decomposed.\u000a\u000aThe coffins, which were dug out of a solid piece of wood, were then packed with sand -- making them enormously heavy. "They must have known they would eventually fall down," says Wong.\u000a\u000aRapelling down a cliff to get a look at the coffins.\u000a\u000aWong's research has tied the burial custom to the Bo people -- a rebellious minority tribe that once inhabited the border between today's southern Sichuan and northwestern Yunnan provinces.\u000a\u000aIt's thought they disappeared in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), persecuted by military expeditions led by China's Imperial Armies. But Wong believes some remnants of the tribe assimilated into other local minority groups and may have survived secretly until today. His research formed the basis of a 2003 Discovery Channel documentary on the hanging coffins, where they attempted to recreate how the caskets would have been transported up the cliff face.\u000a\u000aSome believe they were lowered down from above while others believe they were raised up via scaffolding.\u000a\u000aIt's not just the mind-blowing effort it must have taken to erect the coffins that makes the cliff and cave burials so fascinating. The custom seems so at odds with underground burial and cremation -- the way most modern societies, including China's, handle death.\u000a\u000aBut the open-air burials do have something in common with other funerary practices in China's borderlands. Tibetans and Mongolians practice sky burials -- where bodies are chopped up and offered to vultures or other animals.\u000a\u000aIn more recent years, Wong's obsession has taken him to Sagada, Luzon, in the Philippines, where cliff burials were practiced as recently as 2007.\u000a\u000aCliff burial site in Sagada, Luzon in the Philippines.\u000a\u000aNo protection?\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, I inadvertently rekindled Wang's interest in China's hanging coffins when I shared some photos of the caskets in a cave in Guizhou I came across unexpectedly during a trip to the province in 2016.\u000a\u000aNever having heard of hanging coffins in this area, Wong set out from his China field office in Kunming in the neighboring province of Yunnan with a small team to find out more. The cave where the coffins are located is only accessible by river, which emerges from the spectacular limestone cave where the coffins are stacked.\u000a\u000a"I like when information comes to me like this in a personal way," says Wong. "The Internet, there's so much information available. It takes away the joy and the reward for big effort. I like the footnotes."\u000a\u000aThe Guizhou cave with the coffins is only accessible by river, where bamboo rafts are the traditional form of transport.\u000a\u000aLi Fei, a researcher at the Guizhou Provincial Institute of Archaeology, says that there were up to 100 cave coffin sites in the province and the burial practice was followed by Yao and Miao minorities in the region. Most of the coffins date back to the Ming or Qing (1644-1912) dynasties, he adds, though some date back to the Tang dynasty.\u000a\u000aThe Guizhou site Wong and I visited, like others, wasn't well-protected. Reluctant to scramble up the rocky sides of the caves I didn't get close, but Wong said that while some of the 30 or so coffins were intact, most were falling apart -- bones and disintegrating clothing visible.\u000a\u000aWong was told that there used to be more than 300 coffins in an elevated part of the cave but a fire destroyed them.\u000a\u000aBanknotes have also been left by more recent visitors to the site, a superstitious offering for the dead, though not all visitors are respectful -- one skull had a cigarette jutting out of its jaw. In a steep gorge down river, local tourist authorities have erected fake hanging coffins -- perhaps an effort to satiate tourist curiosity and preserve the existing site.\u000a\u000aThe stunning karst scenary near the Guizhou cave.\u000a\u000aLooting\u000a\u000aIn 1999, at one of the most famous hanging coffin sites in Matangba, Sichuan, which Wong had first visited in the 1980s, he discovered that many of the coffins had been looted -- despite being some 90 meters above the ground and being protected as "national cultural relics." The swag allegedly included ancient swords and other valuables, says Wong.\u000a\u000a"Going back 20, 30 years, yes China had different priorities and limited funding, but today China has such influence and (protecting these sites) would be small change. It's about the integrity of the their culture and cultural identity. "\u000a\u000aAn event held by the Chongqing Cultural Heritage Research Institute.\u000a\u000aXu Jin, a researcher at Chongqing Cultural Heritage Research Institute, studies a hanging coffin site at Longhe, near Chongqing, where coffins are grouped by families. He's held educational events to teach people about the coffins.\u000a\u000aHe says in a karst region where caves and cliffs are plentiful, burying the dead at a height might have seemed a better option than in land that erodes easily and is prone to sinkholes.\u000a\u000aLittle studied\u000a\u000aArcheology in China is a well-funded and well-regarded field but the study of the suspended coffins appears to have been neglected.\u000a\u000aAnke Hein, an archeologist at Oxford University, who has studied burial customs in western China, says the phenomenon straddles different time periods, geographical regions and even disciplines -- falling between archeology and anthropology.\u000a\u000a"I'm sure if someone really wanted to do this they could," says Hein. "But you would need the cooperation of difference provinces and local governments, which is difficult, and requires a lot of energy."\u000a\u000aBamboo scaffolding erected to allow a CERS team to excavate the coffins in Yunnan.\u000a\u000aMost expertise seems to be regional, confined to provincial bureaus that focus on individual sites rather than the practice as a whole.\u000a\u000aThe earliest mention of them in Wong's library is an account by a US missionary in the 1930s. The most comprehensive study in Chinese is by a scholar named Chen Mingfang, who was colorfully profiled by the Los Angeles Times in 2001 . Now likely in her seventies, CNN was unable to track her down.\u000a\u000aWong's spent much of his career exploring, documenting and trying to protect traditions like these in China's borderlands but he doesn't think the mystery of exactly how or why people chose to bury their dead in this way will ever be known.

aVBut he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\u000a\u000aTen Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.\u000a\u000aHis hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound.\u000a\u000a"I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aWith no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.\u000a\u000aPhotographer Pieter ten Hoopen\u000a\u000aThe studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.\u000a\u000aOne by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.\u000a\u000a"This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aThe project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.\u000a\u000aThe photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.\u000a\u000aWhether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aThe word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.\u000a\u000a"They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible," he said. "I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective."\u000a\u000aThe studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.\u000a\u000a"I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aHe said some patients at the hospital "had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio."\u000a\u000aI build classic photo studios ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten Hoopen\u000a\u000aTen-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.\u000a\u000aHawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.\u000a\u000aTen Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.\u000a\u000a"I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment," he said. "It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you."\u000a\u000aHow did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?\u000a\u000a"It wasn't hard," he said. "I just told them to relax and have fun.\u000a\u000a"Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature."

aV(CNN) She's faced death threats, violence and depression, but the former captain of Afghanistan's women's football team Khalida Popal refuses to be silenced.\u000a\u000a"There are so many women who can't get out of Afghanistan and die," Popal told CNN during a recent visit to London, where she attended the Beyond Sports awards. "I have a voice -- I feel a responsibility to those who can't speak out."\u000a\u000aThe 29-year-old Popal was hounded out of Afghanistan by those who believed women had no right to kick a ball around a field and assaulted by angry gangs. In the end it got too much for her and she made a daring underground escape to the safety of Europe.\u000a\u000aPopal can speak freely now -- those who wanted her dead because she dared to promote women's football and would not be cowed still remain -- but at least they are now thousands of miles away.\u000a\u000aAnd in the safe haven of Denmark, and with her parents having been granted asylum to join her, Popal's world is a very different place.\u000a\u000aNever did she think that just kicking a ball around a school yard with a friend would lead to such upheaval -- nor provide the opportunities which have enriched her life.\u000a\u000aFootball has brought a new sense of freedom to the women of Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aGame time\u000a\u000aIn 2004, at the age of 16, Popal began playing football at a time when the Taliban had banned women from participating in sports or attending stadiums -- the local football arena had also been used for public executions.\u000a\u000aSo, in the shadow of the school, the girls found a secluded yard with high walls in which they could practice -- though Popal says they had to make sure not to make a sound in case of discovery.\u000a\u000aThe Afghan women's national football team played a friendly against the local NATO force.\u000a\u000aSlowly but surely, more girls began to join in, finding solace and escapism in the sport even while prying eyes continued to disapprove.\u000a\u000aEmboldened, the girls then took to the field, a move which led to stones being thrown and full out assaults, says Popal.\u000a\u000aSo taken with the girls' plight, the local NATO base allowed them to train on its field -- as long as they vacated it whenever a helicopter came in to land.\u000a\u000aThe NATO women's team even played a friendly against the Afghan national side to show their support.\u000a\u000aThe US is approaching the 15th anniversary of its war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. It's the longest foreign conflict in US history, with little sign that the NATO allies can disentangle themselves from the country's continuing problems.\u000a\u000aAfghanistan's women's national football team members take a break from training as a US Black Hawk helicopter lands.\u000a\u000aLiving underground\u000a\u000aAmid the conflict and as the profile of women's football grew, Popal, by now captain of the national team, continued to speak out, and her critics began to take more threatening action.\u000a\u000a"I had to leave Afghanistan -- it wasn't safe for me," she said. "I had death threats -- I felt in danger and insecure."\u000a\u000aIt was April 2010 that she began the mission to leave Kabul, the capital, by stealth.\u000a\u000aAfghan women practising on the NATO field.\u000a\u000a"I'll never forget that day. It all happened so quickly. I had to leave everything and save my life. I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my own family, or my teammates. I didn't get the chance to tell them to stay strong.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to tell them I am not giving up but was going away to become stronger -- and come back stronger."\u000a\u000aFor two months she lived underground, slowly working her way towards the border with Pakistan and onto India. Popal says her escape involved people risking their lives to help her leave Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aWhile in India she applied for asylum in Denmark with the help of sports kit manufacturer Hummel, which had made the uniform for the Afghan women's team.\u000a\u000aThrough her work with Hummel she was able to reach Denmark, though Europe was to provide Popal with equally testing challenges.\u000a\u000aDepression\u000a\u000aEnsconced in an asylum center, Popal's journey began to catch up with her. Alone, without family or friends, she found herself struggling to deal with her new surroundings.\u000a\u000a"It was the worst period of my life," Popal said. "When I escaped I left everything behind and had no idea where I would end up. I didn't know about how the asylum center worked -- it was so hard."\u000a\u000aDepression set in -- she remembers feeling "sick" and wondering about her fate. Many of those who had arrived at the center some months before her had yet to find out about their future.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Lionel Messi's biggest fan?

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000aHow are you? It must be so exhausting running for President. I hope you're taking good care of yourself.\u000a\u000aI happened to be flipping through the channels on Thursday night when I saw you talking to Donald Trump at the Republican debate about what you called "New York values." I wasn't sure at first what you meant, but then you explained: "I think most people know exactly what New York values are: socially liberal, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, focused on money and the media."\u000a\u000aFor a moment I actually thought Mr. Trump was speechless, but duh, he's a New Yorker like me, and nobody cherishes the First Amendment more than us!\u000a\u000aAnyway, it's a new day.\u000a\u000aAnd I just took a car service home from my fiance's apartment on the Upper East Side. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with the UES. It's in Manhattan on the opposite side of Central Park where you had that fundraiser at those two gay guys' apartment in April? I hope that while you were here, you and your wife had time to visit the Goldman Sachs' headquarters to thank them for that big loan they gave you.\u000a\u000aJudy Gold\u000a\u000aI bet you saw the building as your plane was landing; it's one of those huge towers downtown by ground zero. Maybe you didn't have enough time, since you never know how the traffic is going to be on the George Washington Bridge when you're driving in from the airport.\u000a\u000aI live on the Upper West Side and my girlfriend and I are planning to get married as soon as we can find a big enough apartment to comfortably fit all four of us (two kids included). Both our apartments are rent stabilized, so we're taking our time finding the right place. If you're not familiar with the rent laws in New York, you should check them out.\u000a\u000an 1997 , our Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, extended rent regulation laws after a big to-do with Republican State Sen. Joseph L. Bruno, who wanted them eliminated. Thank goodness, our mayor had two important allies: Republican State Sens. Roy Goodman of Manhattan and Frank Padavan of Queens, who both agreed with the Democratic-controlled State Assembly.\u000a\u000aHave you ever been to Queens, Ted? It's the most racially diverse county in the contiguous United States . My favorite Greek restaurant is in Astoria. Do you like Greek food? It's yummy. Asghar, my driver, and I were talking about how many great places there are to eat here in NYC. He was born in Pakistan, and moved here as a baby. He married a woman from Colombia and their two kids are just beautiful, and get this -- they're also tri-lingual! They speak English, Urdu and Spanish. I must admit that I'm a little jealous about that.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Republican presidential candidates line up on stage before a debate Thursday, January 14, in North Charleston, South Carolina. From left are Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Jeb Bush. It is the sixth GOP debate of this election cycle and the first of 2016. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Trump, who has been leading GOP polls for months, answers a question during the debate. "I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly, and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger," he said. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Cruz speaks during the debate. The senator from Texas opened the event by talking about the U.S. sailors recently detained by Iran. "Today," he said, "many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads. ... I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America." Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Bush waves to the audience. The former Florida governor has been trying to build momentum that he had in the early stages of his candidacy, and he went after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton early in the debate. "She's under investigation with the FBI right now," he said. "If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that." Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Rubio delivers an answer during the debate. He frequently attacked President Barack Obama. "When I become president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders," the senator from Florida said. "When I'm president of the United States, we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military." Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Carson promised this week he would "insinuate" himself into the conversation when needed. After a discussion between Rubio and Christie during the debate, Carson told moderator Neil Cavuto, "Neil I was mentioned too." Cavuto asked, "You were?" Carson quipped, "Yeah, he said everybody." On a more serious note, Carson noted the "divisiveness and the hatred" in today's society. "We have a war on virtually everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imagine, we have people at each other's throat," he said. "And our strength is actually in our unity." Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Kasich touted his economic record as governor of Ohio. "Our wages are growing faster than the national average," he said. "We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life." Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Christie, like most of the candidates on stage, continued to be tough on the current administration. "Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama," he said of the recent State of the Union address. Christie also said "you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership. I will not do that. If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House."

"The biggest reason that we're seeing the hollowing out of middle America is the breakdown of the American family," he said. "We have been too politically correct in this country because we don't want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children." Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Fiorina makes a point during the undercard debate. "The state of our economy is not strong," she said in her opening comments. "We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them. ... It's time to take our country back." Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Huckabee laughs during the debate, which was hosted by the Fox Business Network. His opening statement was much more serious. "There are a lot of people who are hurting today," said the former Arkansas governor. "I wish the President knew more of them.

aVIt\u2019s the world\u2019s largest gathering of twins \u2014 and one big lab for researchers Story by Brandon Griggs, CNN Photographs by Maddie McGarvey for CNN Video by Michael Nedelman, CNN\u000a\u000aTwinsburg, Ohio (CNN) \u2014 If you unwittingly pass through this Midwestern town on the first weekend in August, you might think you\u2019ve stumbled into a mirrored funhouse.\u000a\u000aEverywhere you look there are identical twins, all of them wearing matching outfits. Here, two stout gray-haired men dressed as pilgrims. Over there, a pair of bearded dudes in lederhosen, hoisting trays stacked with mugs of beer. Even the baby girls in the two-seat stroller, sporting Steelers onesies, are spitting images.\u000a\u000aThis double-vision spectacle is Twins Days, an annual festival that brings thousands of twins from around the globe to northeastern Ohio to celebrate their twin-ness. The festival bills itself as the largest annual gathering of twins in the world.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also one big petri dish for scientists, who flock to the festival every summer to study twins\u2019 genetics and behavioral differences.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a club you can\u2019t buy your way into,\u201d says Katie Barry, 32, of New York City, who has been coming to Twins Days with her twin sister Kristy every year since they were 7. She gazes around at the carnival of costumed couples with a smile, searching for the right words.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s this oasis of twin love.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Where\u2019s your twin?\u2019\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s almost too perfect that Twins Days is held in Twinsburg. The Cleveland suburb is named for identical twin brothers who helped settle the town and died of the same ailment in 1827, within hours of each other.\u000a\u000aThe festival got off to a quiet start in 1976, when 36 sets of twins showed up. It grew fast. This year, the event attracted more than 1,900 sets of twins, along with a smattering of triplets and at least one set of quadruplets. They come from almost every US state and from as far away as Australia.\u000a\u000aThe event has a county fair feel and includes a parade, look-alike contests, a talent show and an enormous group photo \u2014 a human blanket of twins \u2014 taken in a field from atop a crane.\u000a\u000aTwin humor is abundant. Siblings stroll the grounds in T-shirts that say, \u201cThing 1\u201d and \u201cThing 2,\u201d \u201cThe Good Twin\u201d and \u201cThe Evil Twin,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not Steven\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not David.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoshua and Jacob McClelland, 16, pose on opposite sides of a \u201cmirror\u201d at the festival.\u000a\u000aMore than a few have rhyming names, like Bernice and Vernice, Carolyn and Sharolyn and Jeynaeha and Jeyvaeha.\u000a\u000aIt may be the only place in America where you can stroll into a hotel and be asked by a staffer, \u201cWhere\u2019s your twin?\u201d\u000a\u000aFor many identical twins, who spend the rest of the year drawing stares and enduring stupid questions \u2014 actual example: \u201cDo you have the same birthday?\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a rare chance not to stand out.\u000a\u000aTwins say they enjoy profound bonds that few \u201csingletons\u201d \u2014 as non-twins are called here \u2014 fully understand.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome people bring spouses or boyfriends, and it\u2019s a terrible mistake,\u201d says Barry, \u201cbecause they feel isolated.\u201d\u000a\u000aKatie and Kristy Barry, 32, of New York City, in homemade costumes inspired by \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn exclusive club\u000a\u000aAbout 33 in every 1,000 human births in the US are twins, a rate that has climbed in recent decades as more women marry later and take fertility drugs or employ in vitro fertilization. Identical twins are an even more exclusive club \u2014 roughly 4 in every 1,000 births.\u000a\u000aThey are formed when a single fertilized egg splits in two after conception, creating two embryos with the same genetic makeup and DNA.\u000a\u000aScientists love to study them because they help answer the age-old question about nature vs. nurture. Because identical twins share the same genes, any differences between them \u2014 say, more wrinkled versus less wrinkled skin \u2014 must be the result of their environment.\u000a\u000aTake Laura and Linda Seber, 41, from Sheffield, Ohio.\u000a\u000aThe pair tied for 8th in their high school class of 404 students, attended the same grad school \u2014 \u201cIt was great to buy one set of books,\u201d Linda says \u2014 and now share a home while working as physical therapists.\u000a\u000aJade Huynh participates in facial-recognition research with scientists from West Virginia University.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we\u2019re genetically identical, I should be able to do everything that she does,\u201d says Linda. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s difficult being compared to each other. Because if I can\u2019t achieve what she achieves, it\u2019s like \u2026 why? Why can\u2019t I do that?\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, it is hard to underestimate the mysterious psychic forces that bind one twin to another.\u000a\u000aDon and Dave Wolf, 59, have identical graying beards that hang halfway down their chests. The identical twins live in Fenton, Michigan, and do long-haul trucking, sharing turns at the wheel during marathon cross-country drives.\u000a\u000aThe pair recall waking up one morning as boys, age 11 or 12, to discover they had just had the same dream. A few years later, Dave suddenly became overwhelmed with concern for his brother only to learn from their dad that Dave had just broken his collarbone in a motorbike crash.\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t explain it. I didn\u2019t feel any pain,\u201d Dave says. \u201cBut I just knew something had happened.\u201d\u000a\u000aDon and Dave Wolf, 59, share a home in Michigan and drive a tractor-trailer together.\u000a\u000aIn the name of science\u000a\u000aIn a long white tent on the festival grounds, a long row of twins sit at tables before trays of color-coded food flavors: milk, potato chips, artificial sweeteners. Wearing nose clips to mask aromas, they uncap each sample, take a taste and then spit into a plastic cup before taking a swig of water and tasting the next. They record their opinions on an iPad.\u000a\u000aThese twins are serving as volunteer subjects for the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a nonprofit research institute in Philadelphia whose sponsors include such food giants as Coca-Cola and General Mills.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur question is whether some people are taste-blind and if so, to what? Our interest is whether this is a genetically determined trait,\u201d says Danielle Reed, a Monell behavioral geneticist. \u201cWe like to compare genetically identical twins to twins that are no more similar than ordinary siblings.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis can help food scientists understand which traits \u2014 say, an affinity for bitter flavors \u2014 are most strongly determined by genetics.\u000a\u000aTara Louis tastes different types of milk as part of genetic research into food preferences.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can imagine if we look subjectively at their DNA we could predict what will taste better or worse to people,\u201d Reed says. \u201cSo you can tailor dietary advice to people's actual ability to taste and smell.\u201d\u000a\u000aMonell is just one of a handful of research groups that attend Twins Days. A few feet away at Procter & Gamble\u2019s Olay tent, scientists are studying twins to better understand the aging process and its effect on skin. Nearby, a forensics expert from the Los Angeles Police Department is collecting latent fingerprints from identical twins \u2014 yes, twins\u2019 prints are slightly different \u2014 to improve fingerprint-identification tools.\u000a\u000aAnd at West Virginia University\u2019s tent, biometric researchers take hi-res photos of twins and record them speaking to help computer scientists create better facial and voice recognition systems. The FBI has funded similar research here as well.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you can build a system that can differentiate between identical twins,\u201d says Jeremy Dawson, a WVU associate professor of computer science, \u201cthen it\u2019s a lot easier to tell the difference between (regular) people.\u201d\u000a\u000aPatrick M. Ketter and Paul R. Ketter Jr. sport patriotic outfits. One twin is liberal, the other more conservative.\u000a\u000aDoug and Jill and Phil and Jenna\u000a\u000aTwins Days is also about the science of attraction.\u000a\u000aNew kings and queens are crowned here each summer. But the closest thing to perennial festival royalty are the Malms.\u000a\u000aGregarious identical twins Doug and Phil Malm grew up in Idaho. Identical twins Jill and Jenna Lassen, both introverts, grew up in Michigan. Their father would address them as \u201csisters\u201d because he was too proud to admit he couldn\u2019t tell the girls apart.\u000a\u000aAll four were visiting the Twinsburg festival in 1991 when they met and sparks flew. Luckily, there was never a question over who would be with who.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was instant,\u201d says Phil, who chose Jenna. \u201cWe knew right away which one we were with.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhil, Jenna, Jill and Doug Malm. The foursome met at Twins Days in 1991 and were married here two years later.\u000a\u000aThe foursome now live in Moscow, Idaho, as members of a tiny subset \u2014 identical twins married to identical twins. Doug and Phil, 60, are retired carpenters, while Jill and Jenna, 50, work in day care.\u000a\u000aAll four share one home. Separate houses, even side by side, wasn\u2019t an option.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt never would have worked,\u201d Doug says.\u000a\u000aBut the couples have had to learn to solve domestic disputes as a foursome.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we fight, we can\u2019t work it out as just two of us. We have to work it out as four,\u201d Phil says.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, sometimes household confusion reigns.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I look at my wife and her sister, there are days when I cannot tell them apart,\u201d Doug says.\u000a\u000aHe has been known to come up behind Jill and give her a playful bite on the neck, only to realize he\u2019s nuzzling Jenna. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he says, \u201cwe get teased for a while.\u201d\u000a\u000aLauren and Allison Knight wear matching tops celebrating their Canadian heritage.\u000a\u000aA year\u2019s worth of data\u000a\u000aBack at the research tents, the twins line up, sometimes for an hour or more, to participate. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial arrangement.\u000a\u000aThe twins enjoy it because they get money or free samples. Many say they feel good knowing they are contributing to science.\u000a\u000aThe scientists like it because it\u2019s an efficient way to gather data from a hard-to-find group of people.\u000a\u000aThe Monell Chemical Senses Center expects to collect research on some 450 twins over the course of the weekend.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe collect a year\u2019s worth of data in four hours,\u201d Reed says.\u000a\u000aBraeden and Aaron Chulskiy, 2 1/2, are pulled in a wagon by their dad.\u000a\u000aThe saddest man at Twins Days\u000a\u000aAmid the procession of coupled siblings, one man wanders alone.\u000a\u000aShawn Riggins, 45, wears a T-shirt with images of his twin brother Shane\u2019s face and a festival badge bearing both their names. And he wears his heart on his sleeve.\u000a\u000aShane is not here. He died last September of colorectal cancer.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of emptiness that no words can describe,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cThere is a pain that\u2019s so deep you can\u2019t cry it out. You can\u2019t scream it out. You just need to walk through.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s not here in the physical, but I see him every day when I walk past a mirror.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe two brothers had been coming to Twins Days together for 20 years. They thought they were fraternal twins until 2002, when they took DNA tests at the festival and learned they were identical.\u000a\u000aShawn Riggins, center, talks with friends at his first Twins Days without his twin brother Shane, who died last year.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe looked exactly alike,\u201d says Shawn, who is a kindergarten teacher in Columbus, Ohio, and remains cancer free. \u201cWe did everything together. We had the same eyeglasses. We had the same facial hair. If we went to an event, we always had to walk in at the same time.\u201d\u000a\u000aShawn agonized for months about whether to come to Twins Days this year. But in the end, he decided the support of his fellow twins, many of whom knew Shane, made it worth the trip.\u000a\u000a\u201cI came back here because no one else but a twin can understand the enormity of what I\u2019m feeling,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aThe scientists, focused on sets of twins, no longer want to study Shawn. They can measure twins\u2019 DNA, but they can\u2019t fathom the depths of their grief.\u000a\u000aBut twins here, many of whom remember his brother, take him in their arms for tearful embraces.\u000a\u000aJust then, as if on cue, a woman approaches Shawn and gives him a long hug. He thanks her.\u000a\u000aFor now, he says, \u201cthe energy in this place has given me the strength to stay.\u201d\u000a\u000aRiggins takes a deep breath, pulls himself together and shuffles toward a passing throng of festivalgoers. He\u2019s ready for more hugs, two at a time.

aV(CNN) The most dismaying of Pew's findings is that the drop in regard for America goes well beyond Trump. Sixty-four percent of the people surveyed expressed a favorable view of the United States at the end of the Obama presidency. That has fallen to 49 percent now. Even when U.S. foreign policy was unpopular, people around the world still believed in America -- the place, the idea. This is less true today.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, I wrote a book about the emerging "Post-American World," which, I noted at the start, was not about the decline of America but rather the rise of the rest. Amid the parochialism, ineptitude and sheer disarray of the Trump presidency, the post-American world is coming to fruition much faster than I ever expected.

aVMel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. This commentary has been updated since its publication. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I just finished reading one of the most powerful things I've ever seen.\u000a\u000aIf you've already seen it, you likely feel the same way:\u000a\u000aIt is riveting. It's raw. I hung on every single word.\u000a\u000aIt is the 12-page victim impact statement written by a woman who was raped in January 2015 on the Stanford University campus after a night of drinking at a party.\u000a\u000aThe power of her words stood in stark contrast to those of the father of her attacker. He, too, wrote a letter to the judge who held his son's fate in his hands. It is deeply disturbing in its plainspoken and clueless banality, and tells you everything you need to know about why the crime of rape so frequently goes unpunished in America.\u000a\u000aThis is a case with no ambiguity. There were witnesses to her attack: two male Stanford students were riding their bikes across campus when they spotted Brock Allen Turner on top of a woman who wasn't moving. These men are among the heroes in her heartbreakingly sad story.\u000a\u000aThey chased him, tackled him and held him until the police came. The victim had no memory of the rape. She was unconscious behind a dumpster when Turner assaulted her. His defense: she consented.\u000a\u000aHe was convicted of all three felony accounts and will register as a sex offender. He faced 14 years in prison, and will only serve six months. (update: Turner was released from jail Friday after serving 3 months of his sentence.)\u000a\u000aAt the sentencing, the victim read her letter aloud and addressed Turner directly. In it, she gives a harrowing description of her rape and a jaw-dropping account of its aftermath. Reading it will expose you to the horror every rape victim faces as she is retraumatized over and over while society seeks "justice" against her rapist.\u000a\u000aI'm a parent. I was so moved that I printed out a copy. I wanted my family to read it. Not just our two daughters, but my husband and our son.\u000a\u000aThat's who should be reading this letter. Give it to your sons, your brothers and your mates.\u000a\u000aIf anything is going to change the culture of rape in our society, it will be a turnaround led by men like the two guys who stopped it that night and the Santa Clara county district attorney, Jeff Rosen, who called the sentence "unjust."\u000a\u000aRosen added that "the fact that the defendant preyed upon an intoxicated stranger on a college campus should not be viewed as less serious than if he assaulted an intoxicated stranger in downtown Palo Alto... Campus rape is no different than off-campus rape. Rape is rape."\u000a\u000aWe women know all too well about victim blaming, alcohol as an excuse for assault. It's not alcohol that's raping women; it is men.\u000a\u000aOur sons, all the young men in our lives need to be told: Alcohol is never an excuse\u000a\u000aAs the victim wrote: "Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked."\u000a\u000aIt's black and white: If a woman is drunk, she can't consent.\u000a\u000aAfter hearing from the victim, the judge also considered the appalling letter from the rapist's father, Dan Turner.\u000a\u000aIn it, he pleads with the judge for leniency for his son, explaining that his son should not have to go to prison for "20 minutes of action." The father describes how "this" has affected his son negatively\u2014he has lost his appetite and doesn't like eating "ribeye steak" anymore.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? 03:45\u000a\u000aHe writes, "The fact that he now has to register as a sexual offender for the rest of his life forever alters where he can live, visit, work, and interact with people and organization." He argues that his son's "life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve."\u000a\u000aIn the end, the judge sentenced Turner to six months in county prison, saying a harsher penalty would have a "severe impact" on the aspiring athlete. His sentence includes probation and his name in a sex offender registry.\u000a\u000aThat last part isn't to punish Turner -- it's to protect us all from him. You know why he has to register as a sexual offender? It's because he committed a sexual crime.\u000a\u000aEven after the trial. Even after the conviction, there is still denial -- Turner's dad writing that his son has "never been violent to anyone including the night of" the crime! Twelve jurors believed otherwise. And now the Turners will appeal.\u000a\u000aSocial media has been rightfully ablaze. The most compelling tweet I have seen is this one by Twitter user Jez Kemp, who edited the dad's letter to highlight the victim-blaming, swapping in female pronouns to illuminate the issue. Take a look:\u000a\u000aRape isn't a story about alcohol. It's one of choices. And every man has a choice. To rape or not. To rescue or ignore. To deliver justice or give someone a slap on the wrist.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that will change this is awareness by men. The good guys. That's why I'm asking you to share this letter with your sons, your brothers and your friends.

aVCambridge University Press has reversed a decision to censor hundreds of articles at the request of the Chinese government after a backlash from academics and activists.\u000a\u000aThe university press, which describes itself as the oldest publishing house in the world, had admitted to blocking online access in China to academic works on Tiananmen Square, the Cultural Revolution and Tibet.\u000a\u000aThe University of Cambridge said in a statement on Monday that its academic leadership and the publisher had agreed to reinstate the blocked content "with immediate effect" to "uphold the principle of academic freedom."\u000a\u000aThe censored academic articles appeared in the highly regarded journal China Quarterly. Its editor, Tim Pringle, said the reversal followed a "justifiably intense reaction from the global academic community and beyond."\u000a\u000a"Access to published materials of the highest quality is a core component of scholarly research," he said in a statement on Monday. "It is not the role of respected global publishing houses ... to hinder such access."\u000a\u000aThe decision to censor the articles drew condemnation from academics around the world.\u000a\u000aIt represented "a craven, shameful and destructive concession" to the Chinese government's "growing censorship regime," Georgetown University professor James Millward wrote in an open letter published over the weekend.\u000a\u000aBy Monday, an online petition threatening a boycott of the publisher and its journals had gathered hundreds of signatures.\u000a\u000aRelated: Facebook finds a way into China\u000a\u000aThe not-for-profit publisher had defended its action as necessary to ensure that China doesn't block "entire collections of content."

aVJerusalem (CNN) Israel's military has announced the acceleration of a new subterranean wall around Gaza, aimed at cutting off tunnels dug by Hamas militants running beneath the enclave's border with Israel. The 3 billion shekel ($850 million) wall will span the 51-kilometer (32 miles) border.\u000a\u000aCNN has learned that the wall will rise roughly 6 meters (20 feet) above the ground and penetrate to an undisclosed depth. It's being described as a "smart wall" capable of detecting underground activity, and will sit behind the existing fence around the territory, creating a buffer zone between the two barriers.\u000a\u000a"We are progressing according to plan, and in the upcoming months we will be accelerating and expanding the building of the barrier," an Israeli military official told CNN.

aV(CNN) Even if you've never heard of it, Helvetica has been part of your life.\u000a\u000aThis typeface is, very literally, everywhere: computer screens, billboards, buildings, street signs and posters.\u000a\u000aLook around you. It's likely that some manifestation of Helvetica won't be too far away.\u000a\u000aSince its launch in 1957, it's become the go-to type for company logos and transport hubs, making it one of the most widespread designs of all time.\u000a\u000aBut like every icon, Helvetica divides opinions, and many designers consider it unoriginal, uninspired and unattractive.\u000a\u000aSo why has it ruled the world for 60 years?\u000a\u000aThe right name\u000a\u000a"Helvetica has a complicated history. In fact, it was not called Helvetica until four years after it's release," American designer and design historian Paul Shaw explained over the phone.\u000a\u000aIt started its life as "Neue Haas Grotesk," a boringly descriptive moniker which included the name of its maker (the Haas foundry), its design type (neo-grotesque or realist) and the fact that is was new (or "neue" in German).\u000a\u000a"The original name sucked," said Shaw.\u000a\u000aThe name Helvetica, which means "Swiss" in Latin as a homage to its country of origin, was adopted in 1960 to make it easier to sell it abroad.\u000a\u000aAnd so it did: "Helvetica gets its first kick because the Germans come up with a great name and make it available in the two mechanisms of the day, machines and foundry type, so that anybody could buy it."\u000a\u000aIts design wasn't original: Helvetica was born out of a typeface from 1896 called Standard in the US and Akzidenz-Grotesk in Germany, which had been used as the avant-garde typeface from the 1920s, especially in Switzerland.\u000a\u000a"Standard as a name was brilliant, but it also caused problems, because people started saying 'We'll just use the standard typeface' and those who were not designers took that literally to mean whatever we've been using for everything else. That's how Helvetica accidentally slipped through the cracks," said Shaw.\u000a\u000aThe right look\u000a\u000aHelvetica's creators, graphic designer Max Miedinger and his boss, Eduard Hoffmann, wanted a neutral and versatile design. It had to be a modern-looking "sans-serif" type, without the extending features at the end of strokes that were common in the print world.\u000a\u000aIts lack of personality was not just intentional, but paramount. Legendary designer Massimo Vignelli , who used Helvetica for the New York Subway system, said in Gary Hustwit's eponymous 2007 documentary : "There are people that think that type should be expressive. They have a different point of view from mine."\u000a\u000aIts mix of features, or lack thereof, happened to be exactly what designers were looking for: "Helvetica showed up at the right place, the right time," said in an email Ellen Lupton, curator of contemporary design at the Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York.\u000a\u000a"It provided something that designers wanted: a typeface apparently devoid of personality. In contrast, other popular sans serif typefaces that existed at the time, such as Gill Sans and Futura , have stronger voices and more distinctive geometries. Helvetica met our craving for corporate vanilla," said Lutpon.\u000a\u000aThe right brand\u000a\u000aHelvetica wasn't an immediate hit in Europe, although it was available there first.\u000a\u000aFamed designer Bob Noorda doesn't use it for the Milan metro signage, choosing his own version of the Standard typeface instead: "He could have used Helvetica, but he didn't, and neither did the Dutch for Schiphol airport. Helvetica just didn't have the cachet it has today," said Shaw.\u000a\u000aBut it didn't take long before it became the standard for advertising and corporate branding in the US: "In 1967 it creeps into the design for the Yankee Stadium," said Shaw, "And by 1968 it's everywhere in America -- it is the typeface."\u000a\u000aVignelli chooses it for the American Airlines logo, which will remain untouched until 2013 -- one of the most enduring corporate identities of the 20th Century. It ends up -- sometimes with minor variations -- in countless company logos including those of BMW, Crate&Barrel, Fendi, Jeep, Kawasaki, Knoll, Lufthansa, Mattel, Nestlé, Panasonic, Scotch, Skype, Target, Texaco, Tupperware, and Verizon. NASA paints it on the side of the Space Shuttle. The US government redesigned its tax forms with it.\u000a\u000aThe classic American Airlines logo design by Massimo Vignelli.\u000a\u000aIn 1984, Steve Jobs puts it in the Macintosh: "This was a key move. If Apple didn't use it, Helvetica would have remained a designer's preference, same as Times New Roman. Instead, it becomes the default sans serif when sans serif fonts are becoming popular among the populous and not just avant-garde designers," said Shaw.\u000a\u000aThe world is conquered: "It's air, you know. It's just there. There's no choice. You have to breathe, so you have to use Helvetica," says influential German typographer Erik Spiekermann in "Helvetica," a 2007 documentary.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Helvetica at 60 Patrick Thomas \u2013 Spanish design studio Husmee pays tribute to the Helvetica typeface for its 60th anniversary with an original poster collection from 19 designers.

Hide Caption 6 of 6\u000a\u000aThe right species\u000a\u000aThe popularity of Helvetica continues today. It was the system font on the original iPhone, and it remained part of iOS until 2015, when Apple replaced it with its own San Francisco.\u000a\u000aIt continues to inspire: the font used in this article and the rest of CNN's website is a close relative of Helvetica called CNN Sans . Microsoft's knockoff of Helvetica, called Arial, is one of Windows' most popular system fonts.\u000a\u000aIn Venice, Arial is replacing Helvetica in some Vaporetto signage, such as the word 'Rialto' here.\u000a\u000aHowever, it's not easy to get a kind word on Helvetica from designers: The fact that people didn't feel passionate about it in retrospect is interesting," said Shaw, "It's not a terrible typeface, it's just heavily overrated."\u000a\u000aAccording to Shaw, there was not a lot design-wise that made it better than either Standard or Univers, its great rival that was released in the same year.\u000a\u000a"I am not a big fan of Helvetica, but I admire its ability to spread and take root worldwide," said Lupton.\u000a\u000a"It is an invasive and drug-resistant species that may never be eradicated. Even designers who don't often use Helvetica in their own work take pride in the fact that it is such a persistent cultural icon."

aVElaine Yu, CNN \u2022 Updated 16th September 2016\u000a\u000aNanjing, China (CNN) \u2014 More than 150 years after rebels destroyed it, Nanjing's famed "Porcelain Tower" -- one of the Seven Medieval Wonders of the World -- has been brought back to life.\u000a\u000aSort of.\u000a\u000aA modern, steel reconstruction of the pagoda now sits by the Yangtze River in the same area as the original, which was built in the early 15th century.\u000a\u000aThe new tower, reportedly funded by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, is surrounded by a futuristic, Buddhist-themed museum that opened late last year.\u000a\u000aThe sites are collectively known as the Porcelain Tower Heritage Park.\u000a\u000aDuring a recent visit to the museum we found relics from the sixth century and earth-colored ruins standing next to modern palatial designs -- including a giant floating 3-D Buddha head made of tiny dots of light.\u000a\u000aThese visual effects are amplified by background music fit for a "Lord of the Rings" soundtrack.\u000a\u000aThe reconstructed pagoda stands near the City Wall's Gate of China.\u000a\u000aWhat led to the reconstruction?\u000a\u000aDespite a centuries-spanning history, the Porcelain Tower's ruins weren't open to excavation until 2007.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, archeologists unearthed a number of holy and treasured relics, including a reliquary in which the remains of the Buddha (Shakyamuni) are believed to be enshrined.\u000a\u000aThey were discovered in an area now called the "millennium-old underground palace," which the rebuilt tower serves to protect.\u000a\u000aA couple of years later the cash started rolling in.\u000a\u000aWang Jianlin -- who made his fortune as chairman of China's largest property developer Dalian Wanda Group -- decided to fund the Porcelain Tower Heritage Park project, according to a report in the official People's Daily.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, he reportedly donated 1 billion yuan (about US$150 million) to the municipal government in his name to fund the reconstruction.\u000a\u000aThat gives the Porcelain Tower another landmark claim: The single largest personal donation in Chinese history.\u000a\u000aNew addition to the historic quarter\u000a\u000aIn 1412, during the Ming Dynasty, the Yongle Emperor ordered the tower's construction in the ancient capital of Nanjing. It took 17 years to complete.\u000a\u000aPart of the larger Bao'en temple complex, which means "Temple of Gratitude" in Chinese -- the tower was built with glazed, white porcelain bricks and rose 78 meters from an octagonal foundation.\u000a\u000aIt's said that rebels destroyed the tower during the Taiping Rebellion in the 19th century as they took over the city.\u000a\u000aA model of the Bao'en Temple complex during the 15th century Ming dynasty.\u000a\u000aThe new tower was built with steel beams and offers great views of the city.\u000a\u000aLike the original, the pagoda has nine stories, each of which serve as viewing platforms accessible by an inner staircase or an elevator.\u000a\u000aFrom these vantage points, the city's many layers of history are visible.\u000a\u000aThe City Wall , a circular fortification and defensive complex built in the Ming dynasty, can be seen snaking through the city alongside neighborhoods with Republican-era housing and modern skyscrapers.\u000a\u000aThe Qinhuai and Yangtze Rivers, which have long nurtured Nanjing's trade and culture, can also be viewed.\u000a\u000aThe temple area is located near the Gate of China, which served as the former capital's southern gate and grand entrance of the City Wall.\u000a\u000aThe exhibition deploys highly visual renderings of Buddhist themes.\u000a\u000aModern technology used to rebuild medieval wonder\u000a\u000aThe Porcelain Tower Heritage Park might be steeped in history but the visitor experience is anything but dated.\u000a\u000aVisitors can use their smartphones to scan the QR codes scattered throughout the park for more information (in Chinese).\u000a\u000aA room encased in mirrored walls and thousands of light bulbs with ever-changing colors is supposed to represent the Buddhist concept of light and "sarira" (shelizi in Chinese) -- referring to the bodily relics of Buddhist spiritual masters.\u000a\u000aIf it weren't for the decorative Buddha statues, visitors might think they've walked onto an empty, 90s-inspired dance floor.\u000a\u000aThese highly visual renderings of the site's sacred elements can be found throughout the museum.\u000a\u000aWhile ruins have been carefully preserved in their original locations, they're often layered with grand interior designs and enhancements like animated illustrations projected onto wall art.

Afghans will do well if they believe they have got the kind of strategic partnership that President Obama offered them in 2009 when he explicitly said, we will be your strategic partner.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\u000a\u000aJIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Welcome back. I am Jim Sciutto in Washington. General Stanley McChrystal is four star general and commander of American forces - coalition forces in Afghanistan. He was - he's credited with transforming the U.S. forces into the elite fighting force they are today. He is author of a new book "Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World." And it is certainly a very complex world.\u000a\u000aGeneral McChrystal, thanks very much for joining us. Had the pleasure of seeing you when you were commander in Afghanistan. You've been travelling around the country a little bit so it's nice to see you out of the uniform.\u000a\u000aGEN. STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, U.S. ARMY (RET.): It's great to be here. Thanks.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: I want to begin with the case of Bowe Bergdahl, Taliban Five because today that deal is expiring and we are still waiting here what the next step will be. But first I want to ask you about Sergeant Bergdahl.\u000a\u000aYou were commander when he was taken. Were you a deserter?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I've been in command for about a month and when he left his base we didn't know. We had reason to believe he walked off his base but he could have been a confused young man, and that may still be the ruling, I am not sure. So, we made every effort we could like we would for your son or daughter to try to recover him as fast as we could.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: Now, if it was discovered at the time, and I know that the questions - the details were certainly murky then and to some degree there are still questions today, but if he was a deserter, would that change at all U.S. efforts to rescue him?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: It's hard to make that kind of judgment because it would have been impossible to know at the moment if he was a deserter. We were trying to prevent him from being taken into Pakistan where we thought he would fall into the hands of Haqqani for two reasons. One, because he's an American citizen and one of ours, a comrade. And second, because he would then become a chip in the power gain there, and we were concerned about both of those.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: Do you have any concerns about the deal that was made a year ago to trade these five senior Taliban leaders for his freedom?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I think if you look going forward getting back an American soldier was important particularly until he is adjudicated it impossible to say what was the cause. So, it was important to get him back. I think now we've got to move forward. We got to decide what we deal with. The five that are back - presumably, they will go back to the battlefield but they won't change the dynamics. It's not going to change the balance of effort there, five guys, but it's just something we are - watch as we go forward.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: But that's an enormous concern. You say presumably they will go back to the fight, first of all that's an alarming assumption. And yes, there are a number of members of Taliban who won't change but they are quite senior in the organization. Would that not be a loss? Would that not put U.S. forces in danger there?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: I wouldn't make it too important. They were in captivity quite awhile. They're not going to go back, I think, to a key operational role. I say presume, because you have to assume to worst case in a case like this. We can't have assumed to have changed their thinking in a time they were in our captivity, I mean, anymore than we would want an American who had been held by the enemy to change his thinking. So, I think we have to presume that their bonds with their old organization are probably going to be pretty strong and just go from there.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: And if they do go back, that deal you still think was a good deal to gain his freedom?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: It's hard to make a judgment on a deal like that. It's an American soldier and so getting him back to me is a pretty sacred responsibility.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: I want to ask you about Iraq. The fight against ISIS is not going well. The map really immutable for the last several months despite a massive U.S.-led air campaign and a massive advantage among the Iraqi and Kurdish forces aligned against the forces of ISIS. You have been very public in saying you need U.S. forces - boots on the ground to fight this fight and win. Is that what is necessary to turn this around?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Well, what I have actually said is we first need a very clear strategy to deal with ISIS and to establish a framework for the region. Because if we don't have a direction of where we are going, where the instate will be, the just defeating ISIS will just be a sort of a meaningless act.\u000a\u000aSecond, we have got to recognize what ISIS is, and it's a phenomenon of the 21st century. It's based on some age-old ideas but as you and I both know is they are operating in a way that is disorienting to organizations of the region. They've got this incredible tactical ability to combine suicide bombers with pretty flexible tactics on the ground and this superb information warfare campaign. It's very decentralized. It makes us all worry about what they are doing.\u000a\u000aI think we are going to have to show leadership in the region. I think American presence and leadership is going to be critical to build a team of teams against ISIS.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: To demonstrate leadership do you have to commit American forces on the ground?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: I think you have got to demonstrate American revolve and leadership. In some cases it could be Americans on the ground with Iraqi forces helping leverage as you know one (INAUDIBLE) army in a difficult time like the Iraqi army is needs that feel of the cloth of comrades. And I think Americans can be a big part of that, but I don't think thousands and thousands of American forces on the ground to be ground forces (INAUDIBLE) would do that is probably the right move right now.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: So, you mean - and this is something that General Dempsey and others have raised, the idea of forward deployed advisers. So, in other words military advisers instead of back in the base, they are on the forward lines or forward ground controllers. Is that what you're talking about?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Yes, it is. Because war is about confidence.\u000a\u000aIf you know when the Iraqis pulled out of Ramadi, it was a military calculus, but in reality it was much more a loss of confidence. Sometimes just the presence of American advisers with their connection to air power and whatnot can bolster the confidence of leaders and provide additional advice as well.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: And confidence seems to be key because you here this - the words of Secretary Ash Carter saying, they didn't have the will to fight.\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Confidence is everything at every level. It starts having confidence in your leaders all the way up to your national leaders and then in yourselves. And I think that's something we could potentially help with.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: I want to ask you about Afghanistan because this was meant to be the year of the end of the U.S. Military presence in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aThe president has extended the smaller force that is there for a bit of a longer period of time. But the reporting on the ground is that those forces are doing more kinetic activity than the president had described. Initially he said, well, they will protect U.S. forces for its protection et cetera but there is evidence that they are doing offensive operations, going after Taliban leaders. Is this a stealth extension of the U.S. war in Afghanistan?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: I think it is just a recognition that we can get a balance.\u000a\u000aMost of the fighting on the ground is being done by Afghan police and military and they are bearing most the casualties. I think America brings some very specific capabilities to do precision operations with Afghan partners in many cases. But I think it goes back to confidence as well.\u000a\u000aAfghans will do well if they believe they have got the kind of strategic partnership that President Obama offered them in 2009 when he explicitly said, we will be your strategic partner. You can't put a number on that. It's not a specific number of Americans planes or boots on the ground. It's the sense that we are an absolutely committed friend that will help them protect their sovereignty.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: But that sounds like a long commitment. And I'm harkening back a number of years.\u000a\u000aI remember you said to me when we were in Kabul, and this is a good five years ago, you made the comparison to U.S. troops in Germany and Korea, they of course been there for decades. That that kind of commitment is not unusual when you are facing an enemy, in this case like the Taliban. Are you saying that you need an American force presence in Afghanistan for years and years to come to give that confidence?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I think you make that calculus. I think both Japan and Germany turned out pretty well and they could have turned out very differently. And so, I think, that if you look in the long sweep, wars don't have a set beginning and set end. As you know, all the things you do that lead up to a war and of course more importantly after a war prevents the next one.\u000a\u000aSo I think, if we look at our policy as a long continuum, and not being in a hurry and say, we may have people there for a long time. But in reality it's cheaper than doing spasmodic moves of big forces into (INAUDIBLE).\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: Finally, as you write this book about leadership, you have got a very strong reputation, of course, from your commands in Afghanistan. There are some who talk about you as a future political candidate. Do you plan or have any ideas or thoughts or ambitions to run for office?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: No, Jim. I really want young people - qualified young people. I'd like to see more young veterans going in but I have zero intent.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: A lot of politicians who've said that and then changed their minds.\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: No, let me be - let me be. I am not going to run for any office, period.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: OK. General McChrystal, thanks very much for joining us today.\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Jim, thanks so much.\u000a\u000aEND INTERVIEW

aVJohn McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Language changes with the times, and when it comes to our conceptions of gender, the times are most certainly changing.\u000a\u000aWe are opening up to the idea that binary conceptions of gender are unnecessarily rigid and don't correspond to the self-image of a great many people, and even that people's sense of their gender may not correspond to their biological sex. In this new world, a bland opposition between "he" and "she" seems increasingly antique, and even insulting, to many.\u000a\u000aHowever, doing something about that is going to be a challenge. We are dealing not with merely giving new names to new things or actions, which is easy, but with using new pronouns, which is very hard.\u000a\u000aThis is hard because human cognition makes some parts of language more resistant to change than others. Nouns, verbs and adjectives, for example, are like software. It feels natural to add them, subtract them, revise them.\u000a\u000aWe expect them to change from era to era -- of course we now have blogs and twerking when we didn't 20 years ago; of course young people now call "fierce" what their equivalents long ago called "keen," "neat," "wicked," "rad," and so on. They are what linguists call open class words.\u000a\u000aPronouns, however, are closed class words. As shorthand for any thing or concept, pronouns are used so often and so unconsciously that they are more like hardware. A new object or practice is one thing -- but a new "you" or a new "him" or "her"?\u000a\u000aIt's harder to wrap our minds around changing something so cognitively fundamental, just as one does not pop up with new prepositions: You might wish there were a little word to indicate "on as in upside down on a ceiling, rather than on a wall or floor." But if you made one up it wouldn't catch on -- nouns and verbs are lightbulbs; prepositions are the wiring inside the walls.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Getting real: Explicit language on TV in the seventies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Getting real: Explicit language on TV in the seventies 02:51\u000a\u000aSix-thousand years ago, in the ancestor of most of today's European languages on the Ukranian steppes, while most of the language would have seemed like Hittite to us (because it sort of was!), its speakers were using pronouns that sounded roughly like "me," "you," and "we" (not to mention the "tu" familiar from French and Spanish). That's how hardy pronouns are.\u000a\u000aThis is why previous attempts to fashion gender-neutral pronouns haven't caught on (believe it or not, there were once calls for the blend hesh!), and why as clever as today's "ze" is, its evolution from in-house tradition to society-wide acceptance will be slow at least, and possibly ill-fated. Bias alone will play its part, surely, but even without it, new pronouns require a mental effort analogous to conceiving dimensions beyond the third.\u000a\u000aIf anglophones are to accept new pronouns for new times, two things will be necessary. For example, the truth is that one thing that helps people change their pronoun usage is shame. For example, of all the "blackboard grammar" rules that English speakers are schooled in, such as that two negatives mean a positive or that one must say fewer books rather than less books, only one has truly caught on to the extent that it is part of the grammar actual people use comfortably. It is the rule stipulating that one must say "Billy and I went to the store" rather than "Billy and me," because me is "wrong" as a subject.\u000a\u000aThis is a rule no one imposed on English until a couple hundred years ago, and is unheard of in many other languages like French and Swedish. However, for better or for worse, it has been so successfully drilled into our heads as a mark of basic intelligence and propriety.\u000a\u000aNow, I would hope that pronouns like "ze" would not be imposed with the knuckle-rapping and contemptuous indignation with which the Billy and I rule has been promulgated. However, there is room for presenting "ze" as a matter not of fashion, but of basic civility -- people must think of new pronouns as the proper thing to do, not as a stunt.\u000a\u000aTo the extent that societies change their pronoun usage, it tends to involve recasting old pronouns, or even expressions, into new functions. European languages like French, for example, use the plural "vous" to address a single person with respect. Spanish's respectful "usted" began as "your mercy," "vuestra merced," not as a brand new little word imposed by fiat. In this light, our own "they" could be handy as a new way to address people gender-neutrally. Many have called for exactly this.\u000a\u000aAnd not just recently -- English speakers have been using "they" in the singular for eons. In starchy old "Vanity Fair," William Thackeray writes "A person can't help their birth." Today, we spontaneously use sentences such as "Tell each student they should hand in the paper on Tuesday." However, this is another of those things that we are told is a mark of ignorance because "they is plural." However, our new times may require that we get past that notion, which shouldn't be a problem because it has always been absurd.\u000a\u000aAfter all, in French, vous "is plural," yet no one seems to mind. Once upon a time, you "was plural" while thou was used in the singular. Today, you "is" singular as well and no one bats an eye. In the same way, in our "hardware," "they" is both singular and plural. Our new conceptions of gender are a good time to get past the conservatism about singular "they."\u000a\u000aThe naysayers complain about the prospect of sentences like "They is upstairs," but this is a distraction: gender-neutral they should be used, as it has been forever, with plural verb forms: "They are upstairs" will mean that one person is upstairs as well as two or more. "But won't that be confusing?" one may ask -- upon which the answer is another question: When have you been confused as to whether "You are my favorite" referred to yourself or yourself and some other people? Context pulls a great deal of weight in how we communicate.\u000a\u000aAssessing the prospects of new pronouns like ze and recast pronouns like they, my bet would be on they, in terms of the chances that, in 50 years, everybody is on board and on to the next controversy. What we do know, however, is that we are at a point where anglophones will need to accept some kind of change in how we use the language. Call it a teaching moment --language not only never stops changing, but could not.

aVWow, so it looks like we have a budget deal in Washington. A debt ceiling and spending crisis has been averted. It\u2019s good news. But let\u2019s all calm down. It\u2019s only temporary. The agreement does not address the long-term fiscal problems we have. Problems that were mostly created by none other than the \u201cbaby boomer\u201d generation. Yeah, you know who you are.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re tanned and healthy and living way past average life expectancy. You\u2019ve got a defined benefit pension plan from a large company or government that was created years ago when people didn\u2019t understand how horribly these plans can go wrong and now can\u2019t afford to meet its liabilities, but you don\u2019t care as long as you get your check which you don\u2019t really need anyway. And your social security check. And your Medicare reimbursement check. You once hated the government. You smoked pot and protested against Vietnam and President Nixon. That was a long, long time ago.\u000a\u000aLife has been good for you. You\u2019re a baby boomer. You were born between 1946 and the early 1960\u2019s. You had Woodstock and the Stones in the \u201960s, discos and coke in the \u201970s, Wall Street in the \u201980s, Bill Clinton in the \u201990s and now you\u2019re retiring to Arizona and Florida on the backs of your stressed-out kids whose own children stay at home with them into their 20s because they have no jobs. Tom Brokaw once wrote a book about the greatest generation, those brave people who survived the depression and fought in World War II. Unfortunately that great generation spawned a generation of narcissists: the baby boomers.\u000a\u000aThe boomers have created liabilities that will take generations to pay off. Our national debt is now at around $17 trillion, larger for the first time in recent history than the size of our entire economy. And it\u2019s projected to continue to significantly grow over the next few decades unless something dramatic is done to reduce it. Boomers don\u2019t like to talk about fiscal responsibility or living within their means. They like their credit cards and government secured mortgages on overvalued properties. They enjoy their malls and their cars and their houses and as long as someone\u2019s willing to lend them the money to buy this stuff they don\u2019t seem to care much about how it will be one day paid. They still represent an enormous voting block and have no intention to have this lifestyle threatened. This is the real reason Washington can\u2019t create a long-term deficit reduction plan. The boomers love their safety nets.\u000a\u000aThese safety nets were created over the past few decades by boomers and for boomers, with little regard to the future. One of the major reasons our national debt is so high is because 40 percent of our government\u2019s spending goes to some type of insurance: social insurance, retirement, health benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. These systems are bankrupt. But they\u2019re needed to pay for the boomers\u2019 healthcare and pension plans. People that were born after 1965 are working hard to make sure that the boomer generation gets their retirement and disability paid for by the government. But it\u2019s still not enough. So our government has to borrow and print money. And our debts balloon. Who will pay these debts? Ah, who cares says the boomers. Not my problem.\u000a\u000aThey are the source of one of the biggest problems with Obamacare. Whether you support the Affordable Care Act or not (and I think there are lots of great things about it), one undeniable fact is that the cost of this new system is being put squarely on the shoulders of the young. People in their 20s need less health care than the boomers in their 60s and 70s. This is not only because younger people today have healthier lifestyles but because many boomers spent most of their young lives smoking, drinking sugary sodas and engaging in risky, unprotected sex. There are 34 million mostly young and uninsured people who will be required on January 1, 2014, to pay for health insurance just so the boomers can take advantage of the added benefits that health insurance companies have to now legally provide.\u000a\u000aThey are, thank God, the last reminders of our racist, homophobic, sexist past. When you look at those \u201cwhite only\u201d diners and drinking fountains in those photos from the 1960s you just can\u2019t believe it. Or how women were treated. And gays. But many of our beloved boomers were teenagers back then, living with parents who watched Ozzie and Harriet and were raised to believe that people who weren\u2019t white weren\u2019t to be trusted, women were meant to stay at home, and gays were sinners. Over time, these attitudes have changed, mainly because people in their 20s and 30s are smarter, better educated and more open-minded. Unfortunately, and although we now have a black President, the last remnants of the boomer generation who still wield power in their churches and companies are doing their best to keep women out of the corporate suite, protest against gay marriage and fight immigration reform.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re scrambling to fix the environment because of their excesses. For years, and despite warnings, the boomers refused to recycle and ran companies that spewed ozone-destroying chemicals into the air. There are countless plots of land that are unusable because of chemicals and pesticides dumped by this generation. I\u2019m no environmentalist, but even I have to shake my head at the destruction laid upon the planet over the past 40 years alone: decimated forests, extinct species, smog filled skies, islands of plastic floating in the ocean. Only recently are steps being taken by younger generations to attempt to reverse this trend.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that the baby boomer generation is quickly getting older. Ten thousand boomers are retiring each day. We can\u2019t ship them all off to an island, unfortunately. But I\u2019m optimistic that the next generation of leaders will not make the same mistakes. Governments will take care of people who are truly needy \u2014 not just because they turned 65 and have a car payment \u2014 and this will help fix our deficit problems. Racism will continue to decline as the world becomes smaller and more social. Our environment will improve because kids in elementary school are being taught to care about the planet. Ultimately, these generations will fix the problems that the boomers created. And we can soon bid farewell to that horrible generation.\u000a\u000aFollow @GeneMarks on Twitter.

aVFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It wasn't very long ago that staging a coup d'état meant bringing out tanks into the streets or launching a massive popular revolt to topple one government and replace it with another.\u000a\u000aBut that is so 20th century.\u000a\u000aWhat happens now is much more gradual, but no less effective. Complacency is costly. Early moves demand a firm response.\u000a\u000aModern-day would-be dictators don't overthrow another government. What they do is take over the system of government. As we have seen from autocrats -- from Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela to Vladimir Putin in Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, and others currently in different stages of this process -- the secret is manipulating the democratic norms, wearing them down to a thin shell, a cosmetic shield that contains only the wrecked remnants of democracy.\u000a\u000aTheir stories offer an anthology of cautionary tales filled with useful information for people who want to save their states from a similar fate.\u000a\u000aThe autocrats move in and slowly start dismantling the system. First, they win an election, then they begin discrediting the opposition, smearing and undercutting the free press, inventing "enemies of the people," at home to undercut critics' claims. Foreign threats are also helpful, especially if the autocrats can claim they have allies lurking within the homeland.\u000a\u000aAccusing the opposition or the media of being part of an "elite," or a "deep state" allows an autocrat to paint those who point out problems as having ulterior motives . This keeps the public from heeding their arguments and their warnings. Then, the autocrat and his team systematically dismantle the independence of the judiciary and, ultimately, the rule of law.\u000a\u000aBefore long, the democratically or pseudo-democratically elected leader is indistinguishable from a dictator. By the time most people realize what has happened, it's too late to push back. In fact, by then, the leader, in full control of a false narrative, may also be enormously popular. A government of, for, and by the people becomes all about protecting the rule of one individual or party, plus cronies.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Venezuela signals the start of 'dictatorship' Replay More Videos ...

Under the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, the economic catastrophe has reached unimaginable depths. It is far worse than the Great Depression, magnified by out-of-control crime . Still, Maduro, who was anointed by the late President Hugo Chavez, is doing whatever it takes to keep himself and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela in power.\u000a\u000aLast weekend's election of a constituent assembly, clearly fraudulent , aimed at perpetuating the party's control. Opposition leaders are in prison, the independent media has been crippled by a law banning news that "foments citizens' anxiety," or "disrespects authority."\u000a\u000aAnd the Supreme Court, like practically all other institutions, works at the behest of the President.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Erdogan watches brawl outside Turkish embassy Replay More Videos ...

He systematically took over all the levers of power.

When fraudulent parliamentary elections in 2011 gave control of the parliament to Putin's United Russia party, they held the largest protests since the fall of the USSR. Three months later, Putin won his third presidential election.\u000a\u000aBy then, Russia was well underway to complete domination by Putin. From his earliest days he moved to take control of the media and the message. State television, the main source of news for 90% of the population, became a government propaganda outlet. Independent media was gradually snuffed out. The opposition has been largely muzzled, the judiciary is no longer independent , and true democracy is a fading dream\u000a\u000aIt's not unlike what happened in Turkey, where President Erdogan, who has governed Turkey since becoming prime minister in 2003, recently staged a constitutional referendum consolidating power. International observers lambasted the process as undemocratic. But Erdogan won, setting in motion a process that turned the once-figurehead presidency into the center of executive, legislative and judiciary power. What more could an autocrat want?\u000a\u000aErdogan accelerated his power grab after a 2016 coup he called a " gift from God ." He used it to destroy what was left of a free media, shuttering outlets, imprisoning critical journalists, firing more than 100,000 people from their jobs, and arresting tens of thousands of teachers, police officers, and government workers under the pretext that they supported the coup.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aAutocrats everywhere have taken note of the successful new method, but so have citizens who don't want to let the process reach its conclusion. In Poland, a recent attempt by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to take over the judiciary triggered such massive protests that the largely ceremonial president decided to veto the controversial law, a move that surprised even jubilant democracy activists.\u000a\u000aIn countries where democratic institutions have deeper roots, such as the United States, anyone seeking to undermine the system faces much higher obstacles. Besides, with such an anthology of available examples, an autocrat aiming to consolidate power has now lost the element of surprise.

aVBut there's a catch: how do you develop technology that can withstand the sea's harsh environment with minimum disruption to the ecosystem?\u000a\u000aOne Israeli-based company, Yam Pro Energy -- believes it can offer the ideal solution and is set to build a wave-energy plant on the coastline of Accra, Ghana's capital city.\u000a\u000aWave technology is an endeavor that has recently been trying to catch up with the likes of solar and wind energy.\u000a\u000aIt exploits a resource -- the oceans -- that covers 71 per cent of our planet, it's environmentally friendly, mostly cost-free once set up and it could be revolutionary to coastal countries.\u000a\u000a"There's so many wave power companies and as many different devices, so finding one that actually works best is trial and error," said Mark Jacobson, who is a Stanford University professor and director at The Solutions Project , a company which aims to help the world move to 100% renewable energy.\u000a\u000aHowever, Yam Pro Energy says its innovative technology is the "best choice in renewable energy systems."\u000a\u000aThe machinery will utilize the crashing waves to harvest hydraulic pressure and turn it into electricity.\u000a\u000a"It was easy," laughed Yam Pro Energy's CEO, Zeev Peretz. "We negotiated (with Ghana) for many years, but in the end we succeeded."\u000a\u000a"The demand (for energy) is very big and I think it will help people (improve) their life."\u000a\u000a"Floaters" will be connected to wave breakers on the coastline and will bob up and down as waves crash in.\u000a\u000aPeretz said their technology was much more efficient than other renewable energy sources because it can generate 65% of energy per year, compared to solar panels and wind turbines which generate between 22-24%.\u000a\u000a"The rest is heat and just waste," Peretz said.\u000a\u000aThe technology will be built on Ghana's coastline in Accra.\u000a\u000aThe advantages of wave power, the company argues, is that their machines do not emit pollution, waves are more predictable than other renewable sources and despite the original set up being costly, the running and maintenance costs are low.\u000a\u000a"If the waves are too high we are given forecasts days ahead which helps to analyze the situation," Peretz said.\u000a\u000aWhile construction in Accra won't begin until well into 2017, Yam Pro Energy has already secured the coastline to build its power station. It has also teamed up with local partners, secured its power purchase agreement (PPA) from the local electrical company and has been given space on the grid so it can sell the energy produced.\u000a\u000aPeretz said 10,000 households will benefit from the project.\u000a\u000aNo impact on wildlife?\u000a\u000aAccording to Emanuele Taibi, an island energy analyst from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the biggest challenge with wave power is proving it can withstand the sea's harsh environments.\u000a\u000a"There are quite a lot of prototypes and they're doing quite well, but (for an investor), the main point is over 20 years -- how will the machine perform?"\u000a\u000aPeretz said Yam Pro Energy had taken this into consideration and that it will conduct maintenance frequently.\u000a\u000aThe "floaters" can be pulled up out of the water if maintenance needs to be done or if the conditions are too rough.\u000a\u000aCompared to other devices -- like buoys -- which can become destroyed and sink in rough seas, Yam Pro Energy's patent is more efficient, it says.\u000a\u000a"We don't have to send scuba divers or boats out. All the maintenance is from the land, so we just put floaters up and you (can) do whatever you need to do (then) put them back down."\u000a\u000aThe company prides itself on providing renewable energy that's clean and affordable in an environmentally responsible way. But Greenpeace's UK Chief Scientist and Policy Director, Doug Parr told CNN that while it supported wave power, checks needed to be in place to ensure the technology doesn't impact wildlife.\u000a\u000a"No source of power has zero impact on the environment," he said, adding that assessments need to be made to "judge whether the clean energy benefits are justified."\u000a\u000aFuture predictions\u000a\u000aJacobson, from The Solutions Project, supported the development of wave technology in Ghana, but said that its growth won't be as rapid as solar and wind. "While there's a reasonable resource of wave power to exploit, if you're comparing it to other technologies it's just not going to be penetrating as much," he said.\u000a\u000aInstead, it will compliment other renewable energy technologies. "It's definitely worthwhile doing ... We should invest (in it) as much as we can."\u000a\u000aThe Solutions Project predicts that if Ghana can transition to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2050, wave energy will account for 1.4 per cent of it.\u000a\u000aAnd while that may seem small, Jacobson insisted it wasn't. "The amount of energy worldwide is enormous. So something that is large is actually small in comparison to the power demand worldwide."\u000a\u000aHe said there was "no downside" in transitioning into a world which only uses renewable energy.\u000a\u000a"These countries can become more energy independent. There's less risk of conflict, less terrorism because there's fewer centralized plants and you solve the climate problem simultaneously."\u000a\u000aIRENA's Taibi was more optimistic. He said that while the growth of wave power has been gradual, it was only "a matter of time" before it became the "sixth pillar" of renewable energy that will become commercialized.\u000a\u000a"The good news is there's quite a lot of innovation coming from different approaches to the same resource."

aVSouthampton, NJ (CNN) Michele Allen has had many dogs over the years. But a 13-pound shelter dog with heart problems and bad teeth changed her life forever.\u000a\u000aMonkey was a foster dog, and Allen and her husband took care of him for the last few months of his life.\u000a\u000a"Monkey's death was really hard on (us)," Allen said. "We knew what we were getting into, and we decided to just love him as much as we could."\u000a\u000aAs Allen learned that so many older, terminally-ill dogs like Monkey were being euthanized in shelters, she decided to open her six-acre farm to them.\u000a\u000aSince 2015, her nonprofit -- which she affectionately named Monkey's House -- has provided a loving place where dozens of dogs have spent their final days.\u000a\u000a"I can't think of a better way to channel our grief than to honor him," said Allen, a former nurse. "He would have just loved that dying dogs were coming to his house to live for a little bit before they leave."\u000a\u000aAllen said most people think a dog hospice would be a sad place. But she calls it "the happiest place on earth."\u000a\u000a"We're very busy giving them a story, a life, adventures, love, special moments," she said.\u000a\u000aAllen cares for around 25 dogs at a time. All dogs get home-cooked meals based on their medical needs, with individual meal plans created by the organization's veterinarian. The dogs also receive herbs and natural supplements, acupuncture and chiropractic care.\u000a\u000aAround 50 volunteers help Allen and her husband, Jeff, care for the dogs. Allen says someone is always cooking, doing laundry, walking dogs or preparing medication.\u000a\u000a"It's extremely important to me that we not fail them in their final moments," she said. "I want them to have a very gentle passing, and I want them feeling as loved and supported as they can be."\u000a\u000aCNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Allen about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: How do you address all the dogs' specific needs so well?\u000a\u000aMichele Allen: We'll do whatever we have to do. The first thing is changing it up nutritionally. I've learned a tremendous amount of ways that I can help them with food. If I have them for a week before they see Dr. Morgan (the organization's vet), sometimes I can tone down some of their issues so that she can hone in on what things we need to get to work on. And that's through nutrition alone.\u000a\u000aSo, nutrition, amazing vet care and whatever medications they need. We also use alternative therapies like acupuncture, chiropractic work and cold laser therapy. We see a rehabilitation specialist. He works with pain management in rehab and has an underwater treadmill that the dogs work on. It seems like we start doing right (by them) and their body picks up.\u000a\u000aCNN: And you've built a great team of volunteers.\u000a\u000aAllen: We call all the volunteers aunts and uncles. I would say about 20 come out every single week for a decent amount of time. They'll come in, they'll look at our board in the kitchen, and there'll be dogs that need to have a bath, that need a walk or dogs that shouldn't be walked. So, they'll kind of go within their comfort zone of what they choose to do.\u000a\u000aWhat's really incredible to me is when we have a dog that is short on time, if I ask, "Could they please spend some time with them?" that dog will have volunteers booked solid until they pass.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Michele Allen: Monkey's House Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Michele Allen: Monkey's House 02:11\u000a\u000aCNN: This can't be easy. What keeps you going?\u000a\u000aAllen: Every life matters, and their lives matter tremendously. In the shelter world, statistically, every dog here could be put to sleep right now. That's just a horrible injustice to these companion animals who have brought us joy, have brought us love and have licked our tears. They shouldn't leave like that.\u000a\u000aI want them feeling at home, I want them in my arms or in the arms of their favorite volunteer. I want them to have a very gentle passing, with them feeling as loved and supported as they can be.\u000a\u000aCNN: How has this work changed your life?\u000a\u000aAllen: The life that I'm leading now with them, I'm tired, but every single day is incredible in some way. It used to be that it was Monday, and then it was Tuesday, and then we had to remember to take the garbage out, we had to pick up groceries on the way home from work.\u000a\u000aNow, it'll be like, somebody made a new noise that was a joyful noise, or somebody walked that didn't walk before, or someone who had a tumor, the tumor disappeared on its own. That's incredible. That's an amazing way to go through life, and I feel very blessed to be doing that right now.\u000a\u000aWant to get involved?

aV(CNN) The moment is different for everyone.\u000a\u000aMaybe it was when a young girl was burned alive while her parents watched complicitly. Perhaps it was the orchestrated slaughter of a family, a pregnant woman's belly stabbed again and again like the film over a frozen TV dinner. Was it when a psychopath ate a sausage next to his freshly-castrated hostage? Or one of the uncountable, imaginative depictions of rape and psychological abuse?\u000a\u000aEvery "Game of Thrones" fan has had it, the moment when they looked away from the screen and wondered:\u000a\u000a"Is suffering the only thing these people do?"\u000a\u000aIt's exhilarating and exhausting, attending this renaissance faire from hell. But we are approaching the final episodes of the penultimate season, when plots converge and some of the more painful story lines are being resolve. In turn, the surviving characters have started down a fascinating and oft-neglected path: They are actually having to deal with the aftermath of their trauma. And we, for better or worse, get to watch.\u000a\u000aReal life problems, but with dragons\u000a\u000a"The Moment," for many, happened two years ago in the fifth season when Sansa Stark, a teenage member of the show's most sympathetic and suffering family, was raped and belittled by her psychopathic new husband, Ramsay, on their wedding night.\u000a\u000aThe story arc, which wasn't included in the books, was a brutal nadir for the show. Sansa had already risen above several seasons' worth of manipulation and abuse, and viewers were turned off by the regression\u000a\u000aMercifully, in time, things got better for Sansa. She eventually escaped and fed her husband to a pack of starving dogs before returning home and reuniting with her scattered, broken family.\u000a\u000aWhere some narratives would treat this new chapter of her life as a clean slate, it's clear Sansa carried her trauma with her, as a laurel on her head and an albatross around her neck.\u000a\u000aSansa reunites with her long-lost siblings after seasons of abuse.\u000a\u000aSometimes, it pulls her down. This season, she speaks with alarming admiration about an enemy who previously held her hostage and manipulated her. She conflates justice and revenge when she tries to banish two children whose disloyal houses had chosen to support the now-dead Ramsay.\u000a\u000aTV and movie writers are often criticized for using rape as a piece of character development and then ignoring whatever comes after. As ominous as they appear, Sansa's uneasy interludes make her trauma journey realistic.\u000a\u000a"Sansa is a victim of complex trauma, particularly in the form of domestic violence," says Sharie Stines, a therapist, relationship coach and writer who specializes in complex trauma recovery and personality disorders. "She was betrayed by everyone and abused and objectified."\u000a\u000aThat's not something a person just gets over, Stines says. In fact, even when someone is healed, the ordeal is never completely erased.\u000a\u000a"All of our experiences mold and shape us, so recovery is a lifelong process, not a destination."\u000a\u000aCome for the action, stay for the complex character decisions\u000a\u000aLet's look at a slightly less sympathetic character. In the opening episodes of this season, Theon, a man of middling morals who was held hostage, tortured, castrated and brainwashed (by Ramsay, as it so happens), is faced with saving his sister during an attack on their ship.\u000a\u000aAs he contemplates his choice, you can see his mind retreating to the days of his captivity. His eyes flick around, observing the present horror. Someone is getting their tongue cut out. Death is everywhere.\u000a\u000aHe jumps overboard, leaving his sister behind.\u000a\u000aWhat are we to make of that?\u000a\u000aSome viewers jeered: What a coward! What a selfish man. On cue, the Twitter machine churned out memes mocking his quick escape.\u000a\u000aEven though Theon has never been a favorite character, others recognized the decision as a realistic manifestation of his pain, perhaps even symptomatic of post-traumatic stress disorder.\u000a\u000aTheon shaves Ramsay Bolton, showing his full acquiescene to his servile 'Reek' character\u000a\u000a"You see, when people experience trauma their personality splits off into 'sub-selves' or personas or 'modes,'" to compartmentalize and protect themselves, Stines says.\u000a\u000aThis hits home for Theon, who was groomed to become a servant named Reek during his captivity, a manipulation so strong he struggled with his identity even after he was rescued.\u000a\u000aWhile Theon as Theon is intense and full of swagger, "Reek represents the part of a person triggered by trauma," says Stines. "And he has a learned response to acquiesce to that trauma."\u000a\u000aIn other words, Reek came roaring back, and with him came compelling conversations about choices and why they're made, and what it means to recognize someone's internal struggle.\u000a\u000aThe viewer feels it, too\u000a\u000aWith any piece of good storytelling, there's a symbiotic relationship between the viewer and the characters they care for. Whether or not we feel for Theon, how we react to Sansa's abuse, it shows us something about ourselves.\u000a\u000a"Because of the power of TV and film, people experience certain emotions while watching. With a show such as this, where the traumatic experiences never stop coming, the audience is definitely going to feel something," Stines says.\u000a\u000aThe importance of the characters' journeys are not lost on the actors, either. Alfie Allen, who plays Theon, spoke at a press event in 2015 about a moving fan encounter\u000a\u000a"She pulled me aside and said 'I get beaten by my husband. He hits me in places that no one ever sees, in the way that you receive abuse in 'Game of Thrones,' it's not pathetic and it gives me strength'," he said. "...(I)t kind of made me realize that I do have responsibilities as an actor."\u000a\u000aIndeed, Stines says watching fictional drama can actually help people work through their own trauma.\u000a\u000a"It can break through denial and minimization and assure someone that what they are going through is not trivial, that they are not crazy," Stines says. "It seems to me, if there is some sense of satisfaction from a resolution of some sort (on the show), that could be therapeutic."\u000a\u000aIt's not about a happy ending\u000a\u000aAn interesting byproduct of all of this suffering is that, almost universally, the triumphs of every hero in "Game of Thrones" have been forged by their trauma. By now, even non-viewers could recognize the long silver hair of Daenerys Targaryen, one of the show's most important heroines. So much has happened, it's easy to forget the first time we saw her: About to be sold as a bride to a stranger in a strange land, timid and scared, unprepared for the dark days to come.\u000a\u000aDaenerys is threatened by her brother in Season 1 after he sells her to her new husband.\u000a\u000aSix seasons later, with dragons circling above and a throne at her back, she delivers an affecting speech that shows she has not forgotten a thing:\u000a\u000a"I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me, I don't remember all their names. I have been sold like a broodmare. I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled," she says.\u000a\u000a"Do you know what kept me standing, through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any god, not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen."\u000a\u000aDaenerys is now an ambitious queen.\u000a\u000aHow many viewers could see themselves in that self-affirmation? How many trauma survivors had a much-needed moment of recognition, a reminder that one of the most powerful women on television is also one of their own?\u000a\u000aShowing suffering as a whole experience -- the complex healing, the lifetime of coping, and yes, the possibility of triumph -- isn't wish fulfillment. It's accuracy.\u000a\u000aAfter all, we derive so much more from fiction than pure entertainment. It inspires and challenges us, and when we invest in a story we are doing so with the hope we will be repaid -- not necessarily with a happy ending, but with something that, despite dragons and doom, will be unmistakably, unshakably human.

aVAn action film bursting with patriotic zeal just broke the Chinese box office.\u000a\u000a"Wolf Warrior 2" has raked in 3.5 billion yuan ($520 million) at theaters as of Tuesday, according to Beijing-based movie industry site MTime. That makes it China's highest grossing film to date.\u000a\u000aThe movie takes place in an unnamed African country, where an elite Chinese soldier ventures into a war zone to save trapped Chinese workers. It's loosely based on several true stories involving military evacuations of Chinese workers from Libya back in 2011 and from Yemen in 2015, according to local media reports.\u000a\u000aRelated: Box office slump is hurting AMC theaters\u000a\u000aWith "Captain America" directors Joe and Anthony Russo reported to have consulted on "Wolf Warrior 2," the movie has the look and feel of a typical Hollywood action flick. The difference is it features a Chinese hero saving Chinese citizens.\u000a\u000a"People know Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger, why don't we have this type of actor representing China?" Wu Jing, the movie's lead actor and director said in comments aired on state-run broadcaster CCTV.\u000a\u000aWu also starred and directed in the first "Wolf Warrior" movie, which was far less popular among domestic moviegoers, pulling in just 545 million yuan ($80 million) in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe sequel, however, has succeeded in tapping into audiences' patriotism. It premiered just ahead of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.\u000a\u000aWith the tagline "Whoever offends China will be hunted down and punished wherever they are," the movie was panned as "jingoistic" by RogerEbert.com. The LA Times, however, found its patriotic fervor "bracing."\u000a\u000aThe closing image of "Wolf Warrior 2" is a Chinese passport with a message scrawled across the back: "The citizens of the People's Republic of China: When you encounter danger overseas, do not give up! Please remember, right behind you, there is a powerful motherland!"\u000a\u000aSome moviegoers took to Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, to heap praise on the film.\u000a\u000aRelated: OJ, Netflix and 'Dunkirk': Your summer guide to media and entertainment\u000a\u000a"I'm so proud to hold a Chinese passport," wrote one Weibo user. "I have to say this is the first ever real action movie in China," wrote another.\u000a\u000aThe hashtag "Wolf Warrior 2" has been viewed more than 1.2 billion times on the social media platform.\u000a\u000aThe movie hauled in ten times as much money at the box office as "The Founding of an Army," a state-backed Chinese film that also doled out a hefty dose of patriotism to coincide with the Chinese military's anniversary.\u000a\u000a"Wolf Warrior 2" overtook fantasy flick "The Mermaid," the previous top grossing movie in China.

aVWhen it comes to taxes, Rand Paul wants them simple and flat.\u000a\u000aThe blunt-spoken, Libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky, who won the 2016 presidential straw poll among leading conservatives, favors a flat tax: a one-rate income tax system with a minimum of tax breaks for individuals and businesses.\u000a\u000aBut Paul hasn't settled on what that rate should be.\u000a\u000aHe has publicly discussed 17%. An aide said if Paul does make a formal proposal, the rate would not be higher than 17% and could be lower.\u000a\u000aMuch would depend on which tax breaks Paul chooses to keep. Two would definitely remain: the standard deduction and personal exemptions. But both would be considerably larger than they are under today's code.\u000a\u000aThe Paul aide said the senator might also consider preserving in some form the tax breaks for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.\u000a\u000aPaul hasn't ruled out other types of tax reform if they "eliminate" complexity and regulation. But he has sketched out his views on a flat tax over the past few years.\u000a\u000a"What you'd have is an attrition if not an outright elimination of the IRS because it would be so simple that people would comply, and it would be very simple to know whether they complied or not," Paul told Fox News last year.\u000a\u000aUnder a Paul flat tax, an individual would owe taxes on his wages, salaries and pension payments. But fringe benefits at work would remain tax free to workers, as they are today. One example of that is the contribution employers make to pay for workers' health insurance.\u000a\u000aCapital gains, dividends and interest would also be tax free at the individual level, but would be taxed at the business level. Capital gains on owner-occupied housing would also be tax free.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Paul would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.\u000a\u000aRelated: Paul takes step toward White House run\u000a\u000aCould a flat tax no higher than 17% raise as much revenue as the current system? No. To do that you'd need to have a rate at least in the low- to mid-20% range, said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate of the Tax Policy Center.\u000a\u000aBut raising the same amount of revenue isn't Paul's goal.\u000a\u000aOn the contrary, Paul favors tax reform that would raise less revenue than today's tax code is projected to. At the same time, he wants to eliminate deficits within five years and proposes to do so in large part by reducing spending (as a percent of the size of the economy) every year over a decade.\u000a\u000aPaul asserts that his flat tax would be progressive since the net percentage of one's wages paid in taxes would rise along with income.\u000a\u000aHere's a simplified example of what that means: Say a married couple with two kids makes $100,000 in wages and is allowed to exempt $35,000 for their standard deduction and $6,500 for each dependent. Their total exemption would be $48,000.\u000a\u000aSo they would pay 17% on the remaining $52,000 of their income, or $8,840 in federal income taxes. That represents 8.84% of their gross income, which is their net effective tax rate.\u000a\u000aIf the same couple made $200,000 in wages, they would owe $25,840 in taxes for an effective tax rate of 12.92%.\u000a\u000aBut the overall effective rate could be lower still for high-income households because they are more likely to have investment income, which would be tax free under Paul's guidelines.\u000a\u000aRelated: Republican tax reform plan unveiled\u000a\u000aAnd, Rosenberg noted, the 15.3% payroll tax -- which is money that workers and their employers pay into Social Security and Medicare -- would still be the biggest tax bite for low-income households.\u000a\u000aA pure flat tax system wouldn't alter the payroll tax, although it's not clear whether Paul would like to.\u000a\u000aIdeally, he would prefer a flat tax in which no one pays more than they currently do. But he has implied, and his aide confirmed, that if the effective rates of the very wealthy go up to ensure that the income tax burdens on lower and middle-income families don't increase, he would be okay with that.\u000a\u000aUnless he puts out a detailed flat-tax proposal, however, it's impossible to say definitively who would be helped or hurt by the changes.\u000a\u000aOf course, if Paul decides to run for president in 2016, he would hardly be the first Republican candidate to call for a flat tax.\u000a\u000aSteve Forbes ran on a 17% flat tax in 2000. Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich ran on an optional flat tax in 2012. Their rival Herman Cain proposed a flat-ish tax called 9-9-9. And there have been plenty of flat-tax proposals introduced in Congress over the years.\u000a\u000aIt's not at all clear when Congress will take up the issue of tax reform seriously, or if a flat tax of some kind would ever garner sufficient support. Many believe not much will happen to overhaul the tax code until the next president takes office in 2017.\u000a\u000aBut should Paul make a run for the White House, you can expect to hear more about the flat tax over the next couple of years.

[CLINTON]: Oh, I said, look, I'm - we have another one shortly after New Hampshire, as I remember, on the calendar. And I said we should start looking for dates and working to get those scheduled. I'm perfectly fine with that.But first things first. We have to agree that we're going to debate in New Hampshire, both the governor and I have agreed and we're waiting for the senator to decide to join us. [BLITZER]: So I just want to be precise. After the Democratic National Committee sanctions debates, you are now ready to commit to three more debates, is that right?[CLINTON]: Well, I have been very public in saying I would like the DNC to work with all of the campaigns, because that's what it did when it set up this schedule and obviously, we want to be supportive. But I am urging publicly that we do this debate next week in New Hampshire. And then I've said I am more than happy for us to start scheduling additional debates as we go through the spring and April and May and try to get those on the calendar.\u201d\u000a\u000aClinton responds to Trump\u2019s veterans event and tonight\u2019s GOP debate: "You know, I am certainly not going to get into the machinations of the Republican Party primary process, other than to say I deeply regret the tone, the rhetoric that you're hearing, not only from Mr. Trump, but a number of the other candidates, the kinds of insulting remarks they're making about groups of people in our country, their strong opposition to The Affordable Care Act, wanting to defund Planned Parenthood, coming back to trickle down economics.\u000a\u000aYou know, it's really quite a disturbing spectacle that we have going on. So whether or not they are together when they debate and reinforce these positions, which I think would be so harmful to our country, is something that, you know, they have to decide among themselves.But I'm going to continue to point out the stakes in this election, because ultimately, it will come down to one Democratic nominee and one Republican, who are fighting for the future of America. And I strongly disagree with the direction that the Republicans intend to take our country. And that's why I'm fighting so hard to be that Democratic nominee, to be able to make the case that we want to build on the progress we've made and we sure don't want the Republicans ripping it all apart."\u000a\u000aClinton on female voter turnout in the election: "Well, look, I am thrilled to have so much support from leading women in our country, from elected women, from women activists, from organizations like Planned Parenthood fighting for women's rights. I'm running to be president because I think I have the best combination of experience, qualifications, plans and ability to get the job done.\u000a\u000aBut I do think it's an asset to be running to be the first woman president. And I want everyone, women and men, in all parts of our country, to join me in making sure we build on the progress we've made and not let the Republicans rip away the White House and set us back."\u000a\u000aClinton responds to the idea of appointing President Obama to the Supreme Court: "Well, I have no idea that he'd ever be interested, but it was a fascinating idea. And if I'm so fortune enough to be president and get the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, which I hope I do, then I would certainly talk to him about it. I think he has other plans for his future, but hey, it would be worth the effort. We know he's a brilliant writer. He taught constitutional law. So I think it's worth a try."\u000a\u000aFULL POST

"We (had) installed escalators, elevators and had equipped the rooms with their main utilities."\u000a\u000aInvestors had hoped that Sathorn Unique Tower's central location and river views would have performed well on the property market.\u000a\u000aWith a legal battle over foreclosure ongoing, the tower's future remains in limbo.

aVSalamiyah, Syria (CNN) Standing on a hill overlooking a massive expanse of desert in central Syria, local commander Almunqez al Salamuni delivered his verdict on what drives ISIS militants.\u000a\u000a"You feel that the fighters of ISIS are brainwashed. They are coming to die. They are fearless. They fight until the end," al Salamuni said.\u000a\u000aAs we talked, warplanes that he said were from the Syrian air force circled overhead. They dropped bombs on villages he claimed were under ISIS control, some less than a mile from where we were standing.\u000a\u000a"Getting rid of ISIS is only a question of time. Because the Syrian army has decided to defeat them totally in this area," said al Salamuni.\u000a\u000aWe're in the Salamiyah area of central Syria with the permission of the Assad government, which granted the visas that allowed us to enter the country.\u000a\u000aSyrian army shifts focus\u000a\u000aIn the past, the US criticized the Syrian government and its backers -- namely Russia, Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah -- for evading confrontations with ISIS. Instead of targeting the extremist group, US officials argued, the army was going after moderate rebels seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\u000a\u000aBut recent months have seen a major escalation of hostilities between pro-Assad forces and ISIS, with the Syrian military making a major push to oust the group from the ISIS stronghold of Deir Ezzor.\u000a\u000aDeir Ezzor is a strategic town in the southeastern Syrian desert, widely expected to become ISIS' final battlefront after the group's imminent defeat by US-backed forces in Raqqa.\u000a\u000aThe Syrian military's shift of focus has come partly as a result of a ceasefire agreement in southwest Syria, brokered by the US and Russia. This has freed up resources in a military that, two years ago, was stretched thin as it battled various anti-government groups across the country.\u000a\u000aAnother factor is a seemingly tacit understanding between the US and Russia -- Assad's most powerful backer -- that defeating ISIS in its self-proclaimed caliphate is now a strategic priority.\u000a\u000aSyria's Deputy Foreign Minister and former permanent envoy to the United Nations Faisal Mekdad confirmed that Damascus was training its sights on the extremist group.\u000a\u000a"We have to define our priorities," Mekdad said in an interview with CNN.\u000a\u000a"And right now our priorities are liberating the Syrian desert on the way to Deir Ezzor," he added.\u000a\u000aNew ISIS fronts\u000a\u000aNot far from Deir Ezzor, Assad's army is trying to hold off ISIS on another front, this one lying uncomfortably close to one of the regime's major arteries.\u000a\u000aThe Salamiyah area, near the Homs-Raqqa highway, has turned into an ISIS hotbed in recent weeks. Many ISIS fighters getting squeezed out of Raqqa have taken root in the vicinity, launching sporadic attacks on the major highway.\u000a\u000aSalamiyah is now a major battleground.\u000a\u000a"With America and the SDF driving ISIS out of Raqqa, all of these fighters are coming down here to Salamiyah," a regional Syrian military commander, who asked not to be named, told me.\u000a\u000aThe Syrian military has been sending reinforcements to this area to thwart ISIS incursions and push the terror group back.\u000a\u000aSyrian forces that took us to the front line said ISIS is also changing its tactics, deploying smaller and often very young groups of fighters to attack and sometimes perpetrate massacres in villages surrounding Salamiyah.\u000a\u000a"Even when they are surrounded, they never give up," commander Almunqez al Salamuni said.\u000a\u000a"They want to hold the territory they move into. It is very hard to get them out of places they invade," he added.\u000a\u000aISIS rapid attacks\u000a\u000aOne such incident happened on May 18 of this year when ISIS fighters launched a pre-dawn raid on a village called Aqareb, entering homes and killing dozens of civilians.\u000a\u000aSyrian forces dispatched reinforcements, using tanks and artillery to drive the militants out, but the carnage was substantial: more than 50 civilians killed, many of them women and children.\u000a\u000aThe Syrian military took us to an almost completely demolished house in Aqareb and introduced us to nine-year-old Mudar, the only villager who survived the ISIS invasion.\u000a\u000a"They came in and shot my mother, my brother and my two sisters. I played dead, they stepped on me, but I did not move," Mudar said.\u000a\u000aThe fighters then went on to the roof of the building to set up battle positions, Mudar explained.\u000a\u000aThe Syrian military deployed tanks and dozens of troops to kill the militants. The episode fueled hatred among the soldiers who vowed to destroy the group in this area.\u000a\u000aBut that fight could take a long time. While the Syrian military has been making rapid gains against ISIS near Deir Ezzor, recently taking back the important village of al-Sukhna, out here in Salamiyah they have seen more of a seesaw battle.\u000a\u000aSyrian government forces are weary of ISIS' rapid attack tactics. Meanwhile, ISIS fighters have tried to take more villages around the area and are determined to disrupt the Syrian government's only major land route to Aleppo, and its supply line for many of its forces in the east of the country.\u000a\u000aBut the Syrian army soldiers there say they're determined to see off the militants. "I am ready to fight day and night against ISIS," said Jamal Kabalan, a fighter with a pro-government military force.\u000a\u000a"We have decided already that ISIS will not get out of this area."

aV(CNN) "Death Note" has spawned a cottage industry in Japan, with the graphic novels (or manga) adapted into animation, movies and TV. Netflix's film based on the property, however, seriously loses something in translation, yielding a thriller that practically suffocates on its own convoluted plot.\u000a\u000aThe basic premise seems promising enough, with a high-school student, Light (Nat Wolff), having a book labeled Death Note literally fall from the sky into his possession. It's then explained to him by the mischievous creature Ryuk (voiced by Willem Dafoe) -- who resembles a cross between "Guardians of the Galaxy's" Groot and a porcupine -- that any name Light writes in the book will die, provided he can think of their face.\u000a\u000aA series of grisly accidents follows, as Light and a classmate ("The Leftovers'" Margaret Qualley) go on what amounts to a righteous killing spree, one ledger entry at a time.

aV(CNN) There is really just one salient question when it comes to today's decision by the Drug Enforcement Administration to expand the number of growers of research-grade marijuana, while still not changing the scheduling of marijuana: Will this decision make it significantly easier for scientists to study the medical benefits of marijuana?\u000a\u000aThe answer sadly is: unlikely. And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.\u000a\u000aUp until today, the University of Mississippi has been the only federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana in the United States. In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same. The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.\u000a\u000aWhile this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.\u000a\u000aImagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door. In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.\u000a\u000aMarijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.\u000a\u000aThat is the predicament of medical marijuana.\u000a\u000aBecause marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.\u000a\u000aPotential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research. Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance , institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive. There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place. Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press. This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.\u000a\u000aSisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.\u000a\u000aThen, after years of those bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock. Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself. Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.\u000a\u000aThe problem, however, is that last word in NIDA's name: "abuse."\u000a\u000aAccording to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary "Weed," the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine. Abrams makes an important point. Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.\u000a\u000aConsider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years. That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits. The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis," "Cannabis induced pancreatitits" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer." That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture of the harm-benefit ratio.\u000a\u000aContradictory policy\u000a\u000aThe road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.\u000a\u000aWhile the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.\u000a\u000aThe DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.\u000a\u000aThis is one of many quotes from his 1988 petition (PDF) to unschedule marijuana.\u000a\u000a"In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care."\u000a\u000aAgain, that was from a judge with the DEA itself. And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWhether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives. Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.\u000a\u000aWith regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts. The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi , whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.\u000a\u000aThat a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.

aVFilms documenting Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House yield insights into 40th presidency\u000a\u000aAs a new television-savvy president wields his unique brand of politics from the White House on the world stage, a CNN Film exploring an earlier president\u2019s novel approach to communications comes to CNN from filmmakers Pacho Velez and Sierra Pettengill. The Reagan Show is an all-archival film, comprised largely of footage filmed by the U.S. Naval Photographic unit and called \u201cWHTV.\u201d This material documented Reagan\u2019s eight years in the White House and was preserved by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. While previous administrations made WHTV, the Reagan White House far exceeded its predecessors in the volume of filmed self-documentation that it produced. Archival news footage from the era augments this fly-on-the-wall perspective on the dramatic history and pageantry of the Reagan years.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show also represents a new milestone for CNN Films, which celebrates its fifth anniversary this fall. Velez and Pettengill are alumni of the inaugural filmmakers\u2019 retreat created by a partnership with Tribeca Film Institute, Camden International Film Festival, and CNN Films in 2015. Each June, the annual workshop is hosted by Points North Institute in Camden and Rockport, Maine, and provides master classes, mentorship, and guidance to emerging documentary filmmakers. This film is the first co-production to be acquired for broadcast by CNN Films from alumni of the workshop, fulfilling a goal of CNN Films to contribute to the industry through nurturing documentary filmmaking and filmmakers.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show, will premiere on CNN/U.S. in back-to-back broadcasts on Monday, Sept. 4 at 8:00pm and 9:30pm, with limited commercial interruption. The film will encore Saturday, Sept. 9 from 10:00pm to 11:30pm and Sunday, Sept. 10 from 2:30am to 4:00am on CNN/U.S., again with limited commercial interruption. The Reagan Show will also screen for the public at New York\u2019s Museum of the Moving Image on Wednesday, Aug. 30 at 7:00pm, followed by a discussion with the co-directors, moderated by CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter. All times Eastern.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe went through nearly 1,000 hours of footage, and think that this all-archival approach allows for an exciting insight into the tools of performance that Reagan employed,\u201d Velez and Pettengill said about The Reagan Show.\u000a\u000aThrough the juxtaposition of network news coverage and WHTV footage, the viewer often gains a behind-the-scenes view of many of the events profiled in the film: the president at inauguration, pardoning turkeys in the Rose Garden, and negotiating arms reductions with Mikhail Gorbachev. Often, this technique reveals how the event was conceived by Reagan and his White House planners, as well as how the public would eventually see the event later through the network news.\u000a\u000a\u201cSubstantively and stylistically, Ronald Reagan was perhaps the most skilled communicator-in-chief of our modern era. Pacho and Sierra have made an impressive and extensively-researched film that demonstrates how essential media communication skills are to a president\u2019s success and legacy\u201d said Amy Entelis, executive vice president for talent and content development for CNN Worldwide.\u000a\u000aThe filmmakers ultimately focus on the geopolitical rivalry between America and the Soviet Union, the most fraught and consequential diplomatic relationship of the Reagan era. The film shows how, as the former film and television star began his second term as president, Reagan was challenged on the world stage by the relatively youthful new Soviet leader. Gorbachev, shrewdly determined to wield power through leveraging his own charisma and media savvy to modernize the image of his nation, rarely missed an opportunity to play any diplomatic advantage to global news cameras.\u000a\u000aMany of the pivotal inflection points in the critical INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) Treaty deliberations between these two men were made for television, and conducted before an expectant international press corps. The film shows how, alongside the technical negotiations, Reagan\u2019s years of actor-training helped him gain advantage symbolically, which had realpolitik consequences that seem to continue to have lasting influence for the U.S.-Russia relationship.\u000a\u000aReflecting on Reagan\u2019s time in office, journalist Peter Jennings remarks in a contemporaneous news report included in the film: \u201cNo presidency before this one was so often judged as if it were a performing art. I shudder when it\u2019s suggested that politicians who come after him are going to have to succeed first on television.\u201d With political irony and insight, the \u2018media archaeology\u2019 of The Reagan Show reveals how the communicator-in-chief effectively used his skills to his advantage for official diplomacy, as well as to establish his legacy in the role of a lifetime, the presidency.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the telecasts, The Reagan Show will also stream live for subscribers via CNNgo on Sept. 4 (at www.CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV, and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android. The film will be available the day after the premiere (Monday, Sept. 5) on demand via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms, and CNN mobile apps.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show is a CNN Films co-production in association with Impact Partners and Artemis Rising Foundation, and presented for U.S. broadcast exclusively by CNN Films. The film is executive produced by Dan Cogan, Amy Entelis, Houston King, and Regina Scully. The film is edited and written by Francisco Bello and written by Josh Alexander; Daniel Garber and David Barker also edited the film. Laura Karpman is the film\u2019s music composer. The supervising producer is Courtney Sexton.\u000a\u000aArt http://bit.ly/2itqhcn\u000a\u000aAbout CNN Films\u000a\u000aCNN Films, celebrating its fifth year in 2017, produces and acquires documentary feature and short films for theatrical and festival exhibition and distribution across CNN\u2019s multiple platforms.

Bhutan cooperates closely with India in determining its foreign policy, and the Indian army is involved in the training of its armed forces.\u000a\u000aChina, which does not have formal diplomatic ties with Bhutan, has repeatedly denied that it has violated any treaties and has called India's involvement in the issue "utterly unjustifiable."\u000a\u000aA Chinese soldier gestures as he stands near an Indian soldier at the ancient Nathu La border in 2008.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to reporters on July 24, China's Defense Ministry spokesman Senior Col. Wu Qian promised to carry out further military drills in the region.\u000a\u000a"We will preserve our sovereign territory and security interests at any cost," he said.\u000a\u000aThe dispute comes at a time of deteriorating ties between India and China over several issues, including Chinese investment in Pakistan, its naval presence in the Indian Ocean and India's unwillingness to join Beijing's signature One Belt One Road initiative.\u000a\u000a'A lot left to learn'\u000a\u000aXinhua is one of China's largest state media organizations.\u000a\u000aOn Indian social media, the reactions varied from angry to amused while more than a few responded with racist abuse directed at the Chinese.\u000a\u000a"Pretty rich of you to make fun of Indian accent, while the host here can't even pronounce simple English words," one user commented on the original Xinhua video.\u000a\u000aChan said Chinese state media had come a long way in recent years, but "there's a lot left to learn."\u000a\u000a"China's the second largest economy in the world, they want to expand their soft power, this is extremely self-defeating," she said.

aVJeffrey Sachs is university professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Give the Republicans their due: They are persistent. Since Ronald Reagan became president in January 1981, the Republican Party has focused relentlessly on tax cuts. And Donald Trump is no exception -- he told the crowd at his Phoenix rally Tuesday, "We're giving you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country."\u000a\u000aThe truth is: Republican tax cuts go largely to the rich, and the new Republican proposals this fall will be typical in this regard.\u000a\u000aWhen asked how to pay for such tax cuts, the Republican answer is unswerving. First, the tax cuts will pay for themselves through higher growth. Second, if they don't, then cut social spending. And third, if neither growth nor spending cuts save the day, higher budget deficits will be acceptable.\u000a\u000aSuch claims have been proved wrong time and again: Tax cuts don't pay for themselves; the public justifiably resists cuts in social services; and the high deficits that result weaken the country and put a burden on the young, who will eventually service the public debt. Both Reagan's tax cuts in 1981 and George W. Bush's tax cuts in 2001 failed to pay for themselves and led to many long years of fiscal austerity to get large budget deficits under control.\u000a\u000aThe wrong time\u000a\u000aThe Republicans are at it again, pushing for another round of personal and corporate tax cuts at a hugely inopportune time. Once again, the Republicans in Congress claim that tax cuts will raise growth, boost wages, help the poor, unleash productivity and ultimately pay for themselves. Yet this time around the starting point for tax cuts is far worse than in 1981 or 2001.\u000a\u000aFirst, there is no "business cycle" or "stimulus" argument for another round of tax cuts since the unemployment rate is already cyclically low, at around 4.3%.\u000a\u000aSecond, the current budget trajectory is already one of large and growing deficits, projected by the Congressional Budget Office to average around 4% of gross domestic product during the coming decade. There are simply no more federal revenues to lose.\u000a\u000aThird, the rich are already doing very well and don't need any extra fiscal advantages, while the poor and working class are struggling and depend more than ever on the health care, social services and public investments financed by federal revenues. When candidate Trump's tax-cut plans were scrutinized, the super-rich were found to be the huge beneficiaries.\u000a\u000aRather than giving up federal revenues in yet another round of tax cuts, we actually need higher revenues as a share of GDP. The first aim of budget policy should be to reduce the chronic deficits to begin to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP, through a combination of cost-saving and sensible tax increases aimed at closing loopholes and taxing harms to the economy (such as carbon emissions).\u000a\u000aThe second aim should be to help those in the bottom half of the income distribution, both the poor and working class, who are hurting badly with stagnant earnings and insecure working conditions.\u000a\u000aThe third aim should be to finance the modernization of infrastructure, including the shift of US energy toward low-carbon sources including wind, solar, hydroelectric power and nuclear energy, rather than coal, oil and gas. Tax cuts this year would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve any of these three vital goals.\u000a\u000aThe rich don't need a cut\u000a\u000aThere is indeed no case whatsoever for reducing the personal income tax rates on high-income Americans. The richest Americans are already enjoying an era of unprecedented wealth and prosperity. Their tax revenues and more are needed to fund the federal government.\u000a\u000aThere is a glimmer of a case for a modest reduction in the US corporate tax rate -- to bring it in line with other large economies -- but only as part of a package that increases overall revenues, protects the poor, finances improvements in our infrastructure and reduces the budget deficit. The case is a modest one and would make sense only as part of a larger bipartisan fiscal agreement. Yet no such balanced package is remotely on offer. The simple fact is that the billionaires who steer the Republican Party, including the Koch Brothers, Robert Mercer, Sheldon Adelson, and of course Donald Trump, are not thinking about the country's needs, but only about their own insatiable greed.\u000a\u000aThe Republicans' argument for corporate tax cuts that we hear most these days is that corporate tax cuts will boost wages by bringing investments back to the United States. This claim is wildly exaggerated for two main reasons.\u000a\u000aThe first is that a cut in the corporate tax rate would give corporate shareholders a huge tax break on earnings from investments made long ago. The beneficiaries of such a tax cut would be the richest Americans, and without any boost to wages from such pre-existing investments.\u000a\u000aSecond, even if new corporate investments are spurred, those new investments are as likely to be labor saving as labor using. We could easily end up with modestly higher overall investment spending but with fewer jobs at lower wages as a result.\u000a\u000aIncreased investments in robots and artificial intelligence systems spurred by the corporate tax cuts could lead to layoffs and lower wages as new robots replace existing workers. And any overall benefits for economic growth are likely to be modest. As the United States cuts its tax rate, other countries will as well, in a new global race to the bottom in corporate tax collections.\u000a\u000aBetter ways to help workers\u000a\u000aIf the real goal is to help wages and workers, there are far better policies than a corporate tax cut. The earned income tax credit should certainly be expanded for low-income workers. Workers should be helped to meet their health care and education costs, the opposite of the Republican offer. And tax revenues that would be lost to a corporate tax cut would be much better used to fund the promised investment in infrastructure, which would not only modernize the economy but also provide construction jobs along the way.\u000a\u000aThe truth is that the United States needs a bipartisan budget deal, involving higher not lower overall tax revenues as a share of GDP, to cut the budget deficit, finance needed social services and expand infrastructure investments. Part of the overall budget package could include a modest cut in the US corporate tax rate with the lost corporate revenues more than made up for by tax increases elsewhere.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aMy own guess is that the push for tax cuts this fall will fail to produce a political agreement, just as with health care. Trump is too unstable a leader to broker a complex political deal.\u000a\u000aThe simplistic version being developed by the Republican congressional leadership and White House is likely to be so unrealistic and lopsided for the rich that it is will produce a massive political backlash. Successful tax policy for the country's long-term needs will require a return to serious governance in a post-Trump era.

aV(CNN) Despite President Trump's announcement that the opioid crisis is "a national emergency" two weeks ago, there has been no formal declaration from the administration.\u000a\u000aAt the time, Trump said, "we're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis. It is a serious problem the likes of which we have never had."\u000a\u000aHis statements came just days after a White House commission on opioids, headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, said in a draft report , "The first and most urgent recommendation of this Commission is direct and completely within your control. Declare a national emergency under either the Public Health Service Act or the Stafford Act."\u000a\u000aNo formal declaration\u000a\u000aThe Stafford Act provides access to resources and funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and is typically used after natural disasters such as Superstorm Sandy.\u000a\u000aThe Public Health Services Act gives the Department of Health and Human Services broader authority in tackling a public health emergency, such as last year when Zika was declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aYet two weeks later, no formal declaration about opioids has been made. "The President is considering not just the emergency authorities outlined in the report, but other potential options as well, to ensure we're doing all that we can to tackle this crisis head on," a White House spokesman said. "The President recently instructed his administration to take all appropriate and emergency measures to confront the opioid crisis. Right now these actions are undergoing a legal review."\u000a\u000aThe White House also confirmed that the administration will declare a formal state of emergency but would not elaborate on when. "We are declaring one but we are considering which option to use to declare one," the spokesman said.\u000a\u000aIt's unusual to have a lapse between an announcement like the President's and a formal declaration.\u000a\u000a"I'm no historian who's studied all of these instances, but typically, the paperwork and the specifics are drawn up before public announcements are made," said Dr. Jay Butler, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials , a consortium of senior public health officials from all 50 states, US territories and the District of Columbia that provides guidance and support to state health departments.\u000a\u000aSix states have declared a state of emergency over the opioid crisis: Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Virginia, Maryland and Massachusetts.\u000a\u000a28 ongoing national emergencies\u000a\u000aThe National Emergencies Act of 1974 outlines how a president can activate special statutory power during a crisis. Under the statute, an national emergency automatically expires every year unless it is renewed. Currently, there are 28 active national emergencies, none of them related to public health. The last health-related national emergency was declared by former President Barack Obama in regards to swine flu in 2009.\u000a\u000aBut declaring the opioid crisis a national emergency doesn't automatically grant access to emergency funds. Public health-related emergencies are typically declared using the Public Health Services Act, Butler said. Though this act gives both the president and the secretary of health and human services some broad latitude, such as reassigning federal staff members and providing waivers on how federal funds can be used, it doesn't open up emergency funds.\u000a\u000a"There is no pot of money waiting to be tapped the way there is for a Stafford Act declaration," Butler said.\u000a\u000aBut Butler says that just because there isn't a pot of money attached to the Public Health Services Act, it doesn't mean a national emergency declaration can't authorize funds to be used to fight the opioid epidemic. In addition, he says, the act can be key in implementing some of the recommendations in the commission's interim report, such as changes to Medicaid reimbursement for treatment that is currently available only to facilities with 16 beds or fewer and expanding access to medically assisted treatment, considered the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment.\u000a\u000a142 Americans die every day from drug overdose\u000a\u000aThe opioid crisis' mounting toll is staggering. More people die of drug overdoses -- including both prescription painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone and illicit drugs like heroin and fentanyl -- than from guns or car accidents. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdoses are the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States.\u000a\u000aThe President's opioid commission says that about 142 Americans die every day from a drug overdose, equal to the death toll from the September 11 attacks every three weeks. Most of those overdoses are from opioids.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aButler says that the opioid crisis is a priority for every state. "Things are happening in all of the states right now, and those activities are going to continue. They're oftentimes being done at the expense of other things," he said.\u000a\u000aBut he added that the federal government has been a partner in this effort. "I want to be very clear, regardless what the future is or what this emergency declaration means, the feds have been very supportive."

aVThis article was originally published by The Spaces , a digital publication exploring new ways to live and work.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It happens every few years: a seismic shift in the way we live our lives fuels a change in human behavior so significant, it blows the concept of the office as we know it out of the water.\u000a\u000aModern technology is no exception. Fast becoming the catalyst behind one of the biggest shake-ups the office has ever seen -- from design to location and from sustainability to well-being -- it is the shift of our generation. And hard though it may be to believe that robotic security guards and app-controlled meeting rooms are just the beginning, there is still a long way to go.\u000a\u000aSo what might the workplace of the future look like? We asked six office-space experts from around the world to hazard a guess as to where, and how, we will all be working in 10 years from now.\u000a\u000aThe architect\u000a\u000aNorman Foster\u000a\u000aLord Norman Foster is one of the best known architects in the world. Now 82, he is the designer behind some of the world's most iconic buildings including City Hall in London, the Reichstag Dome and, most recently, the $5-billion new Apple Campus 2 in California.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aNorman Foster: Greener -- in every sense. Young people will choose office buildings based on facilities and lifestyle but also on their sustainability credentials. Future generations will be much more demanding and much more questioning in terms of what a potential employer will be doing to tackle climate change. So I think we will see a shift where creating a good quality working environment which is more responsible in terms of sustainability becomes good for business as well as for the environment.\u000a\u000aA rendering of Apple Campus 2, designed by Foster & Partners.\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aNF: More nature and more sustainable features. And perhaps less real estate developer involvement. The overarching trend is very much the entrepreneurs pushing new ideas for design forward. Apple Park was initiated by Steve Jobs then carried on by (chief design officer) Jony Ive and his team with the support of (chief executive) Tim Cook. As a rule, developers now tend to just follow the market whereas the entrepreneurs lead it.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think will be the single biggest driver of change in the way we work over the next 10 years?\u000a\u000aNF: I think the social agenda will be the big driving force. And technology. But also trying to overcome our natural, human fear of change.\u000a\u000aHow will this affect the built environment of our cities?\u000a\u000aNF: Take 3D-printed buildings as an example. I think, if properly harnessed this would offer a lot of opportunities. The downside would be mindless repetition or intrinsically bad design practice. But I would ultimately take a more optimistic view and say it offers greater customization potential and greater room for creativity.\u000a\u000aOf course it raises some very big social issues. If you are able, through robots and AI, to do things very quickly and efficiently that are otherwise very labor intensive, then that's liberating in one sense. But there are issues over the future of the workforce -- but historically these sorts of changes have resulted in higher levels of education and a more productive redeployment of labor.\u000a\u000aThe workspace innovator\u000a\u000aTanya Wood\u000a\u000aTanya Wood is director of Soho Works , the workplace offshoot of hospitality group and members' club Soho House. She oversees the group's co-working spaces in London's Shoreditch as well as potential future expansion plans.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aTanya Wood: By then we expect the work place to have become even more comfortable -- a place where you choose to spend more time without the pressures and formality of the traditional office. With a call for more flexible working hours already, people are spending less physical time at their formal office. They want spaces that actually cater for, and enhance, their working lives. That could be access to everything from gyms or social space, bedrooms or a provision of studios and specialist equipment or facilities to support content creators.\u000a\u000aSoho Works, Shoreditch\u000a\u000aWhat do you think will be the single biggest driver of change in the way we work over the next 10 years?\u000a\u000aTW: Evolving socioeconomics. By this I mean that more international travel, better gender equality (and sharing of childcare) and new technologies will result in a society that wants and needs more choice, autonomy and independence in their working life.\u000a\u000aHow will this impact the built environment of our cities?\u000a\u000aTW: Traditional office space is under pressure so office landlords will need to adapt to stay relevant.\u000a\u000aHow will it affect the way we use our homes?\u000a\u000aIn the future we expect that the workplace will complement home life more and more. When an office caters for more aspects of your life, home can become a true sanctuary.\u000a\u000aSoho Works, Shoreditch\u000a\u000aHow do you think the concept of the office as a business club will develop over the years?\u000a\u000aTW: People love to belong and feel part of something. The idea of professional networking is not new and by bringing this under one roof you create a very fertile ground for collaboration, which empowers workers. With co-working operators expanding globally, suddenly the membership becomes about much more than just a building or a physical space to go and work in, it's also an international supportive community.\u000a\u000aThe connectivity guru\u000a\u000aTamara Brisk is managing director of Wiredscore France. Launched in New York in 2013 by Michael Bloomberg, the connectivity ratings system scores commercial buildings on everything from internet speed to mobile connections. It now has offices in the UK, France, Germany and Ireland and has certified more than 750 buildings across the globe\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aTamara Brisk: Offices in a decade will be designed to best foster our cognitive processes and working preferences. We already know that people are more creative at certain times of day and that environmental stimuli can amplify collaboration but we are at the very beginning of our understanding.\u000a\u000aIn a decade, knowledge workers will be more productive because they will be better able to tap their mental capacities. For example, individuals will know that our finest strategic brainstorming prowess happens in the middle of the day and even have mental warm-up exercises to foster their performance.\u000a\u000aOur work spaces in the future will provide different environments for different phases of work -- like protective insulated cocoons for periods of deep concentration. These will be in addition to today's stimuli-filled social co-working spaces that promote collaboration.\u000a\u000aDUO, a Wired certified building under construction in Paris, designed by Jean Nouvel.\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aTB: We will see more flexibility of space usage. For example, building cafeterias that were only used during breakfast and lunch hours in the past will serve as collaborative work spaces and meeting rooms. Open space offices will be divisible at the click of a button.\u000a\u000aWe will see fewer long-term leases. While businesses will still require and benefit from co-locating their employees, they will want more flexibility to add and subtract space as their needs evolve.\u000a\u000aThe #Cloud.Paris building is another Wired Certified development in the French capital.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think will be the single biggest driver of change in the way we work over the next 10 years?\u000a\u000aTB: Research about how to best unlock our mental capacity and manage the speed and ubiquity of information will make us more productive with no supplementary effort.\u000a\u000aHow far do you think connectivity will move on in offices over the next decade?\u000a\u000aTB: It will become as important as location and price in the choice of an office. Excellent, reliable connectivity will become standard.\u000a\u000aThe accidental co-working entrepreneur\u000a\u000aMikael Benfredj\u000a\u000aMikael Benfredj is founder of Patchwork , a furniture store turned co-working space in the heart of Paris. When people started to use the display furniture as make-shift workspaces, Mikael embraced the demand for a change of use and now has plans to expand.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aMikael Benfredj: I don't think companies will be separated the way they are today. There might not be one dedicated building for a single company. Or even dedicated floors. I hope large companies will want to expand their values and culture more profoundly around their partners and clients. Design will be sunnier -- meaning it should have more space available outside -- and smarter, meaning more automation.\u000a\u000aPatchwork Paris\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aMB: We will see more integrated services such as childcare facilities, laundries, hairdressers, banks and post offices, plus more regulation -- things like lighting, chair comfort and screen hours will all be monitored. And I think offices will be more disability-friendly too. And there will be less personalization of your specific spot or desk.\u000a\u000aHow will the changing office affect the way we use our homes?\u000a\u000aMB: Work will be more invasive. Even more than it is today, thanks to frictionless technology and the ability to work anywhere. I think workspace will become a meetingspace.\u000a\u000aPatchwork Paris\u000a\u000aHow has your experience of watching a furniture store evolve into a co-working space shaped your view on the way people want to work?\u000a\u000aMB: Considering we didn't do it on purpose, it was very inspiring to watch the transformation of the usage of the space in a short period of time. I remember the days when one or two people would come into the store to work. It was very calm. Today it's like a factory. There are 40 to 50 people every day, coming in and out all day long to have meetings and work.\u000a\u000aThe office design consultant\u000a\u000aDespina Katsikakis advised Google when it was first developing its office concept -- possibly now one of the most copied on the planet. She is now advising on 22 Bishopsgate in London, set to become the UK's first WELL Certified building and acts as a consultant on the future of workplace design for Accenture, BBC, Deutsche Bank, Lend Lease, Nokia, and GlaxoSmithKline, Microsoft, and Morgan Stanley.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aDespina Katsikakis: We will see a much more diversified portfolio or flexible and on-demand work spaces. Both the nature of corporate portfolios and our own personal workspaces\u200b will become a series of locations to work, based on convenience, function and comfort. This will mean they are much simpler and used much more intensively and intermittently.\u000a\u000a22 Bishopsgate, London\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aDK: More choice of environments, amenities and services with a focus on people's performance. And I think we will see less offices with one-size-fits-all rows of desks with a focus on cost reduction and hard metrics.\u000a\u000a22 Bishopsgate will have London's first climbing wall.\u000a\u000aHow will this impact the built environment of our cities?\u000a\u000aDK: Existing building stock will be \u200breinvented as a blurring of functions becomes the norm as a result of technology that allows us to work, live, learn and play anywhere and anytime.\u000a\u000aThe Bay Area agent\u000a\u000aDan Harvey is vice chairman of the Bay Area Occupier Services group for the world's biggest commercial property agent, CBRE. He works closely with the biggest office occupiers in San Francisco and Silicon Valley and has up-to-date insight into current and future trends when it comes to office requirements of some of the most innovative companies in the world.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aDan Harvey: We're already starting to see a push-back on some of the tech and the elimination of privacy. So a departure from open-plan as a blanket design default and a move back to some private offices. Collaboration is great but there is an emerging feeling that without a choice, people are sometimes finding it challenging to get stuff done. So through that push for a productive workforce, future offices may become more private again.\u000a\u000aA sensory deprivation tank.\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aDH: Going straight to the unusual stuff, we could see more sensory deprivation tanks and things that help staff reach this 'state of flow' that everyone is talking about here in the Bay Area. It sounds quite crazy but access to this sort of experience, the removal of neuro stimulation to allow employees to work at their creative best, is popular. And while we won't see less technology we might well see more controlled tech.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think will be the single biggest driver of change in the way we work over the next 10 years?\u000a\u000aDH: The growth of the 'office experience' -- the hospitality side.

aVToday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Senator and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul (R-KY), joined anchor, Jake Tapper to discuss the 2016 presidential race.\u000a\u000aFor more information, see http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/. Also, text highlights and a transcript of the discussion are below.\u000a\u000aMANDATORY CREDIT: CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\u000a\u000aContacts: Lauren Pratapas \u2014 Lauren.Pratapas@turner.com; 202.465.6666; Zachary Lilly \u2013 Zachary.Lilly@turner.com\u000a\u000aTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\u000a\u000aPaul on Trump: \u201cI think he will get wiped in a general election. It would be terrible for any of the ideas of limited government. I'm still not sure that Donald Trump is for limited government, for balanced budgets. One of the biggest things that he's been for in his last several years is using eminent domain for the government to take private property from one property - private property owner and give it to himself for his casinos and parking lots. That's not a conservative notion. And, really, most of Donald Trump is nothing more than sort of bits of populism, but no consistent conservative philosophy.\u201d\u000a\u000aPaul responds to Cruz\u2019s immigration stance: \u201cI think, on several things, he wants to have it both ways. On immigration, at the time, he supported an amendment that said, OK, we're not going to get citizenship, but we will allow illegal status. And he wanted the bill to pass. In fact, I was in the same category. I thought citizenship was too far, but the compromise would no citizenship, but give people a legal status. That's what Cruz was for. He was - he's been explicit about it. And now he says never and that he never did it. And so I think he should just admit that he changed his mind, that he used to be for legalization, but he's not anymore. But he's done the same thing\u2026 So, I think, on a number of issues, he wants to have it both ways, depending on which audience he's talking to.\u201d\u000a\u000aPaul reacts to criticism from Rubio: \u201cWell, you know, the difference between Marco Rubio and I is, I show up for work. He's missed about a third to a half of his votes this year. And we had the biggest vote of the whole year, voting on a trillion dollars worth of spending, and he didn't show up. So, yes, I think he ought to resign or give his pay back to the taxpayer.\u000a\u000aPaul on the status of his campaign: But, as far as I'm concerned, yes, I do need to do well in the early primaries. We're - we're in it to win it. We're not in it just to mess around. I'm not in it to place in the lower tier. If we're in the lower tier, obviously, we will reassess. But we don't plan to be.

aVWATERFORD, Mich. (WXYZ) - A listing for a mansion in Waterford, Michigan is going viral. The home sits on a lake, but the inside of the home is what has people talking.\u000a\u000aPHOTOS | Check out all the pictures from the listing for the mansion\u000a\u000aMark Z, the realtor selling the mansion, said he was taken aback when he first walked in.\u000a\u000a"I was shocked that the decor has not been updated from back in time when this was the style," he said.\u000a\u000aThat time is the 1990s.\u000a\u000a"I feel like I went back in time," said realtor Mark Z. "The colors are unique. The decor is unique."\u000a\u000aHe isn't surprised the listing is starting to go viral.\u000a\u000aThe house on Forest Bay Drive boasts more than 10,000 square feet, six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a million dollar lake view.\u000a\u000aThe various shades of pink, purple and turquoise travel from room to room.\u000a\u000aIt's on sale for approximately $800,000, although it was appraised for $1.8 million.\u000a\u000a"It's definitely going to be a harder sell because of the uniqueness of the colors and the decor," Mark Z said.\u000a\u000aThe mansion also has features like a home theater and an indoor in-ground pool in the lower level\u000a\u000aMark Z says it could cost anywhere from $500,000 to a million dollars to update the inside of the house.\u000a\u000a"For remodeling, they say anywhere from $50-$100 a square foot, I think you could recoup maybe 25 percent of that," he said.\u000a\u000aHe has a guarantee to sell a home or he will buy it, but this is a short sale, so that could be tricky.\u000a\u000a"We would definitely purchase it for the price that we are listing it at, but in this case, like I said, we need the bank to approve it, so it kind of ties our hands."\u000a\u000aHowever, he believes a buyer is out there.

"I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they're so committed to what they do. They're really devoted and hardworking."\u000a\u000aWhile those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style.\u000a\u000a"My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way," she said. "I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, 'I'd love a portrait of you and your cow,' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they're so passionate about what they do."\u000a\u000aRead More

aVWashington (CNN) President Donald Trump is facing down the first major hurricane of his administration well aware of the potential of monster storms to make -- or break -- a political career.\u000a\u000aAfter Trump spent Friday morning tweeting about his frustration with Senate rules, lauding his "fantastic" chief of staff and taunting Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the administration seemed to buckle down as Hurricane Harvey took aim at the Texas coast. George W. Bush's botched response to Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,000 people and inundated New Orleans in 2005, loomed large over Trump's White House.\u000a\u000a"It's not just on my mind, but it's on the mind of all the emergency managers in our community," White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said of Katrina during a press briefing.\u000a\u000aHe insisted the government's ability to respond to storms has improved since Katrina and said Trump is fully engaged in preparations as he heads to Camp David for the weekend. Bossert said Trump is worried about all Americans in the storm's path -- regardless of whether they voted for the President.\u000a\u000a"This is right up President Trump's alley," Bossert said. "Not only has he shown leadership here, but his entire focus has been on making America great again."\u000a\u000aWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she expected Trump to visit Texas next week.\u000a\u000aOpportunity for Trump\u000a\u000aHarvey provides an opportunity for Trump early in his tumultuous presidency. A strong, even-handed and coordinated response from federal, state and local officials could give the President a chance to demonstrate leadership skills. If he can muster a level of discipline that often evades him, a news cycle dominated for days could help Trump, distracting from feuds with fellow Republicans, including his widely criticized response to violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aBut an uneven performance could reinforce perceptions of an administration in chaos and unable to execute the basic tasks of government.\u000a\u000aKatrina is the most famous example of a hurricane sparking political -- as well as material -- devastation. Bush's distracted response inflicted a blow from which his presidency, already reeling from the insurgency in Iraq and the failure of Social Security reform, never recovered.\u000a\u000a"Just as Katrina was more than a hurricane, its impact was more than physical destruction," Bush wrote in his memoir "Decision Points." "It eroded citizens' trust in their government. It exacerbated divisions in our own society and politics. And it cast a cloud over my second term."\u000a\u000aBush said he was slow to realize the chaotic nature of the response to the storm from New Orleans city authorities and Louisiana state leaders. His White House then made things worse by releasing photos of Bush staring at the devastation out of a window of Air Force One, making him look detached from the suffering.\u000a\u000aAfter viewers watched harrowing scenes of Americans abandoned by their government in their flooded city, Bush praised his hapless director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Mike Brown, for doing "a heck of a job." That comment triggered a torrent of ridicule.\u000a\u000a"In a national catastrophe, the easiest person to blame is the President. Katrina presented a political opportunity that some critics exploited for years," Bush wrote in "Decision Points."\u000a\u000aHis Katrina missteps were all the more surprising as he had witnessed the perilous nexus of hurricanes and politics during his father's presidency, a few months before the 1992 election.\u000a\u000aHurricane Andrew\u000a\u000aAfter Hurricane Andrew ravaged Florida, Dade County Emergency Management Director Kate Hale complained about the national response, instantly turning a story about a disaster into a huge political issue.\u000a\u000a"Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one?'' Hale asked.\u000a\u000aFederal aid soon poured into Florida. George H.W. Bush visited and then delivered an Oval Office address on the storm. Even though polls showed a majority of Floridians approved of Bush's management of Andrew and he went on to win the state, suggestions that he was slow to react were fuel for Bill Clinton's narrative that he was not focused on domestic issues.\u000a\u000aOne Bush who sought to turn hurricanes into an advantage was Jeb Bush, who was lauded for his emergency response efforts while Florida governor. He used that experience to contrast himself with Trump during the 2016 GOP primaries.\u000a\u000a"Look, there's some people running that are really talented about filling the space, about saying big things," Bush said in Pensacola in August 2015.\u000a\u000a"They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership," he went on. "Talking is not leadership. Doing is leadership."\u000a\u000aUltimately, of course, that experience wasn't enough for Bush to prevail over Trump.\u000a\u000aLearning lessons of Katrina\u000a\u000aBarack Obama learned the political lessons of Katrina well, and his White House went out of its way to show him engaged, visiting emergency officials and calling for evacuations when storms threatened the US coast. When Hurricane Sandy roared across the east coast in a classic "October Surprise," Obama flexed leadership skills and empathy just over a week before the 2012 election.\u000a\u000aTrump, who had yet to officially launch his political career, was already alert to the political consequences of a devastating storm during Sandy.\u000a\u000a"Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars," Trump tweeted on October 30, 2012.\u000a\u000aNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's famous embrace of Obama and his praise of the administration's response conferred bipartisan bragging rights upon the President in the final chapter of the campaign. Christie's alignment with Obama helped him win re-election a year later in a state that usually votes Democratic at the presidential level, though it infuriated fellow Republicans and proved a liability during the 2016 GOP primary.\u000a\u000aSandy also showed how blanket television coverage of storms can obliterate other news. Obama's Republican opponent Mitt Romney simply found it tough to break through at a crucial political moment.\u000a\u000aNearly five years later, Sandy's political legacy is still unfolding. Should New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker run for president in the future, his campaign would likely highlight his performance during Sandy while he was mayor of Newark and used his Twitter account to connect with residents and offered to deliver blankets, baby milk and other supplies.

aVOREGON CITY, Ore. \u2013 Officers and emergency personnel recovered the body of a climber from a rock climbing area in Oregon City.\u000a\u000aThe climber was killed by falling rock at the edge of Waterboard Park, officials at the scene said.\u000a\u000aSomeone reported the climber missing on Wednesday night. A friend of the climber found his car near the park, and later found him unconscious at a "known climbing area."\u000a\u000aEmergency crews said they found the victim suspended on an unstable rock wall about 30 feet from the ground. He was pronounced deceased at the scene.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHis name has not been released, but Clackamas Fire officials say he was from Canby.\u000a\u000a"It was obvious that a large amount of rock had fallen from above the climber and presumed to be the cause of injury to the climber," a Clackamas Fire Dist. No. 1 official said. "In recovery mode crews will develop multiple plans and safely and methodically remove victims from the situation."\u000a\u000aOfficials said they weren't sure whether the climber was wearing a helmet. They think the rock that hit him was about 3 feet wide and 10 feet long.\u000a\u000aThe road around the park was closed a few years ago because of the falling rocks and unstable hillside. Still, families like Angela Woods' come to the park to scamper around on the boulders.\u000a\u000aWoods admit she's a little nervous watching her 7-year-old daughter climb like a pro.\u000a\u000a"it's a little unnerving, yes." said Woods. "But she's been up here since she was practically a baby, so she knows her way around. You just always have to be aware of your surroundings."\u000a\u000aA Clackamas Fire spokesperson said the tough territory made the recovery of the climber difficult and dangerous, but no rescue personnel were injured.\u000a\u000aWith unstable conditions and remote access to the park, officials said they strongly recommend that people do not climb in the park area.\u000a\u000aThe National Parks Service has a list of safety warnings for rock climbers:

It's a very young but very vibrant Silicon Valley. And I'd say that they're, you know, for a while, people thought about China as like, well, they would copy what you do and they're always behind. What's happening is the copying is catching up. But when it catches up, there's nothing left to copy. And so what we're starting to see is innovation. It's starting to percolate up in China. And I think that's really exciting.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn innovation: \u201cThe way I look at innovation is it's really about creative problem-solving. It is - it's about, on one end, being very creative and almost being an idea person and seeing ideas and interesting ways of doing things everywhere. But on the other side, it's about being very, very analytical and very, very dedicated to details. I like to say god is in the details. So if you're analytical and logical, almost like a machine, I'm a computer engineering - well, I went to school as a computer engineer, but bringing a creative idea and ideation piece to that, put them together, you're now a creative problem-solver. And that's where I think innovation comes from. And here at the company, you know, I try to - we look for creative problem-solvers and we try to push people to solve things creatively, because that's where innovation is.\u201d\u000a\u000aFull transcript available after the jump.

aV(CNN) Photorealism -- the process of replicating a photograph through a different medium -- was once considered a fad, but the 1970s arts movement has stood the test of time.\u000a\u000aNow, nearly five decades after the term was first coined by art dealer Louis K. Meisel, the works of some of the movement's most influential artists are being displayed together at "From Lens to Eye To Hand: Photorealism 1969 to Today," a new exhibition at the Parrish Art Museum in Water Mill, New York.\u000a\u000aThe show features 40 paintings and 33 works, including "Hotel Empire" by Richard Estes, one of the fathers of the movement, as well as more recent contributions from the likes of Yigal Ozeri, Raphaella Spence and Bertrand Meniel.\u000a\u000a"'From Lens to Hand' assembles key works from major public and private collections to survey a profoundly influential yet under-recognized art movement; the more than seventy paintings and works on paper from the 1970s to today illuminate the very definition of photorealism since its founding," says Terrie Sultan, Director of Parrish Art Museum.\u000a\u000aPhotos: This isn't real Jamie Salmon \u2013\u000a\u000aBritish-born Jamie Salmon takes it to the next level.

aVNew York (CNN) Kayla Mueller, Peter Kassig, Alan Henning, David Haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by ISIS in the past year.\u000a\u000aThe exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive. What we do know is ISIS holds at least one female aid worker, and possibly more. The International Federation of the Red Cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in October 2013 remain missing, but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them.\u000a\u000aAbductions and killings of aid workers are, unfortunately, nothing new, but the numbers are. According to Aidworkersecurity.org, at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013, a 121% increase on 70 recorded killings the year before.\u000a\u000aNot all were victims of ISIS, a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled Syria. In fact, according to the same report, it is the Taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers, in large part in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aHere's the difference: ISIS is changing the game. The Taliban may have many reasons for abductions (flexing their muscles, negotiating prisoner releases), but they also have a record of frequent hostage release. The need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters, or mattered.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The ISIS terror threat Photos: The ISIS terror threat Wounded passengers are treated following a suicide bombing at the Brussels Airport on March 22, 2016.

Abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income (ISIS demanded at least $6 million for Kayla Mueller, and reportedly $200 million for two Japanese hostages) or, failing that, their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness. So far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by ISIS is extremely low, save for those whose ransoms were paid. The freeing of 19 kidnapped Assyrian Christians shocked many, because release is not a common part of ISIS' playbook.\u000a\u000aThese tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide, who may look to emulate ISIS' model of abduction and violence. One example is West African extremist group Boko Haram, which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies, an approach disturbingly similar to ISIS'.\u000a\u000a"Humanitarian work has always been risky, but it's never been more dangerous than it is now," says Caryl Stern, president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF . "There used to be a time when an organization's flag provided a great deal of protection. That's no longer the case."\u000a\u000aThe response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of Syria and its environs altogether, but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers. Still, outside workers like Mueller, Kassig, Henning and Haines were inside Syria when they were taken, and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations. Not only that, but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency, local staffers become bait. Indeed, the majority of victims have been working in their own countries.\u000a\u000aISIS doesn't just target aid workers. Journalists, soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list. But in the Wild West that is Syria and its borders, few of these remain, save for aid workers. In a space devoid of government, refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities, the new front line in the war on terror, a sometimes unwelcome association. And as ISIS spreads beyond Syria's borders, the risks grow further afield.\u000a\u000aYet despite these risks, thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million. While some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection, many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit. Their security and locations for the most part are under constant review.\u000a\u000aWhen CNN approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences, and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level, many declined, in large part due to security concerns. For this reason, some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous.\u000a\u000aSenior relief director for NGO working in the Syria region\u000a\u000aIf I think back, I've been doing this work for about 20 years, and I remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection, some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much, much more difficult; we're asking people to put themselves in harm's way in some circumstances.

Hide Caption 85 of 85\u000a\u000aMy family is not thrilled at all because what they see on the news is Westerners being kidnapped and beheaded ... when they worry, I worry about them and that doesn't help me be in a good state of mind to do my work. I'm very selective about where I say I go. I need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that's here, not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people I'm responsible for in this region.\u000a\u000aI don't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one, two, three times -- who don't see a future for their children... Someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security, and I mean that in the personal sense of a mother who, when she goes to sleep at night with her children, she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day.\u000a\u000aMark Ohanian, International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) director of programs\u000a\u000aFear is always there in the back of everyone's mind. We just need to continue what we're doing, stopping is not an option, halting our operations is not an option, and we are taking great risks, our staff are taking great risks.\u000a\u000aIt is a difficult thing to tell family, to tell colleagues. Oftentimes I just don't mention all the details of where I go because they just don't need to know. But it needs to be done, we also can't run an operation remotely. ... I'm not going to the front lines, I'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we're not adrenaline driven people. We want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks, but it's about calculated risks. We don't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger.\u000a\u000aIf we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security, morale, pressure from here, pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place. There's not going to be another organization that's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that IOCC may create, that's not going to happen. So that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization; we feel that responsibility that we've got to deliver on this thing.\u000a\u000aDima (last name withheld), aid worker, IOCC\u000a\u000aThere's an internal motivation that keeps you going. You feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance, and know it's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service. So yes, you need be of course strong, motivated, passionate, and of course feel the need to assist and deliver.\u000a\u000aMichael Bowers, senior director for strategic response and emergencies, Mercy Corps\u000a\u000aIt's an unprecedented time, and what we're calling the new normal ... as we've seen in the last year, the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups, who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we're not the U.S. Army, we don't have a physical ability to repel.\u000a\u000aThere may be in people's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance: like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car, you'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community. I think that golden age is more myth than reality, but regarding today's reality it's extremely dangerous it's so true. And your flag, your neutrality, your white car, all the good intention you have, that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies.\u000a\u000aThere's a phrase that the U.N. uses and a lot of NGOs use which is "stay and deliver," so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there, but we always have to be in a risk management role; we have to critically look at: do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get?\u000a\u000aThe fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends, and that has more of a toll, I think, with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly, sometimes I don't tell them till I'm already on my way so I don't have to have those calls before I even get on an airplane. It's hard; there are some areas where the family and friends don't understand why you're going there, and you re-articulate, "If not you, then who?" and you ask, "Would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened?"

aV(CNN) An Australian senator known for her strong stance against Muslim immigration has been widely condemned for wearing a burqa to Parliament House.\u000a\u000aIn video of the parliamentary session, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson can be seen taking her seat in the floor-length Islamic garment.

aVAaanchal Malhotra is a New Delhi-based artist, oral historian and author of "Remnants of a Separation: A History of the Partition through Material Memory." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) This month marks 70 years since the Partition of India, a momentous event now receding from view. In many Indian and Pakistani families like mine, "Partition" has become a word unspoken, shrouded in silence and sheathed with painful memories.\u000a\u000aBy focusing on the political events leading to the birth of India and Pakistan, the history books often fail to capture the experiences of individual refugees in what is believed to be one of the largest mass migrations in human history.\u000a\u000aGenerations have grown up in the shadow of the monumental displacement that changed the face of the subcontinent, even if it is present in their own families' stories. So, in 2013, I began a quest to uncover the everyday items that traveled with refugees in both directions -- and the powerful stories behind each one.\u000a\u000aA personal connection\u000a\u000aHaving settled in Delhi, the families of all four of my grandparents can be traced to a land that now lies across the border. They originally hailed from places as far away as Dera Ismail Khan and Lahore, both in modern-day Pakistan.\u000a\u000aYet growing up, the word "Partition" was all but absent from my vocabulary. At least, it was until I encountered objects that had once belonged to my ancestors in an undivided India -- a pocketknife, a yardstick, a ghara (a type of metallic vessel), a peacock-shaped bracelet and a set of kitchen utensils.\u000a\u000aGhara brought from Lahore to Amritsar to Delhi.\u000a\u000aThese were the possessions that accompanied my great-grandparents as they fled their homes during the Partition in 1947. Through them, I learned of my own family's migration and life before the divide.\u000a\u000aBeing introduced to these mundane items made me realize the way in which objects can retain memories. Upon touching their old possessions, my grandparents -- and many others I have interviewed since -- drifted back to the time when they were in everyday use.\u000a\u000aWhat I witnessed was how the physicality -- the texture, scent and surface -- of an object preserved and invoked memories from one of Indian subcontinent's most catastrophic events. Witnessing this, I asked myself: Could objects embody stories of family and friendship, harmony and violence, opulence and poverty? Could they be the only physical traces of life across an uncrossable border between the present and past?\u000a\u000aUncovering forgotten stories\u000a\u000aOnce an idea takes root in one's mind, it becomes difficult to retract. Soon I found myself visiting people who had crossed the border during Partition, and looking at the items that had gone with them.\u000a\u000aThis led me on my own journey. From my hometown, Delhi, I traveled to the crumbling city of Calcutta, the lush plains of Punjab, across the border into Lahore and, finally, to England.\u000a\u000aOver a period of four years, I have unearthed objects that are precious, treasured and cared for. I also encountered objects that had been locked away behind glass in cupboards and vitrines, and items so mundane that had been ignored and forgotten, despite their age, beauty and serendipitous survival.\u000a\u000aA string of Basra pearls owned by Azra Haq.\u000a\u000aAmong them are a string of exquisite Basra pearls and matching earrings owned by Azra Haq. In her early 20s at the time of the Partition, Haq was recovering from typhoid in Dalhousie when her family left in haste. They made their way through the mountainous terrain of Murree and finally settled in Lahore.\u000a\u000aThe family took few belongings with them. And much of what they had, like furniture and Persian rugs, was thrown from the truck to make space for stranded Muslims they encountered along the way. But Haq quietly tied the pearls and earrings within the folds of her baby-blue salwar kameez.\u000a\u000aDecades later, she still holds them close to her heart as reminders of a life of opulence and grandeur she had once lived. Her English upbringing and middle-class life of garden parties were reduced to penury after the divide.\u000a\u000aPainful memories, difficult journeys\u000a\u000aFor other migrants, like Sat Pal Kohli, the remnants of separation conjure even more troubling memories.\u000a\u000aBorn in Lahore in 1926 to a female moneylender, Kohli's house was one of ten Hindu homes in the predominantly Muslim neighborhood of Garhi Shahu. Due to the nature of his mother's work, the house was always filled with rings, bracelets and other precious items belonging to those unable to repay their debts.\u000a\u000aAs Partition riots broke out, the family was one of the first in the area to be targeted.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to me years later, Kohli recalled his mother scrambling around the house, packing bags and instructing him to find mortgaged items that were both precious and discreet enough to be hidden. Many of the items that accompanied Kohli and his mother to their adopted city of Delhi -- among them a silver soap dish and a cigarette case -- never belonged to them in the first place.\u000a\u000aExperiences of civil unrest also linger in the memory of Partha Mitter, a Calcutta-born professor now living in the UK. Sitting with me in his Oxford home, he unwrapped a pile of books and handed me the oldest codex: "The Book of Everlasting Things."\u000a\u000aBooks saved from the Great Calcutta Killings, 1946.\u000a\u000aMitter described how a mob of men entered his family's home during the Great Calcutta Killings of 1946 -- a day of rioting and violence between Hindus and Muslims. The men made their way through the mansion, destroying whatever they could find.\u000a\u000aThis included his father's grand library. And when the intruders couldn't destroy the books fast enough, they filled the bathtubs with water and dumped them in, causing most to disintegrate into pulp.\u000a\u000aAfter the mob left, the family collected what remained of their lives, including "The Book of Everlasting Things." Disfigured with water lines and tears, its every word is as readable as before. But for Mitter, it is forever imbued with the violence it witnessed.\u000a\u000aA window to the past\u000a\u000aPhotographs carried from Aligarh to Karachi.\u000a\u000aThe narratives bound within these objects, and many others, shine a light on incredible migratory journeys. Aside from the individuals themselves, they are also the only physical traces of a life before the divide.\u000a\u000aThe quantity and value of possessions that refugees could carry with them were often determined by the kind of life they had led, providing insight into the material culture of the time.\u000a\u000aBut memories of Partition are also especially pliable. Within them, the act of forgetting, either inevitably or purposefully, seems to play as much a part as remembering itself.\u000a\u000aPeople often recall Partition as the darker side of independence -- the price we had to pay. Recounting it continues to be a difficult and sensitive act.\u000a\u000aBut as memories deteriorate, these items and the stories they tell remain intact.

aVIf I leave my job now, I think I'll have enough money to live comfortably the rest of my life. So is there any reason I shouldn't stop working and retire? --J.Z.\u000a\u000aIf you think you've got the means and the inclination to call it a career, I say go for it. My only caveat is that, before you do, make absolutely sure that you're not only financially prepared to retire, but that you're also ready to make the social transition from the work-a-day world to retirement.\u000a\u000aThe last thing you want to do is hand in your notice at work only to later find that you don't actually have the money you'll need for a comfortable retirement or that you're unable to enjoy your newfound freedom because you haven't given enough thought to how you'll actually live once you no longer have the routine of a job to provide structure to your life.\u000a\u000aSo before you cut your ties to the workforce, I recommend that you answer the five questions below that make up my "Are You Really Ready To Retire?" Checklist.\u000a\u000a1. Do you have the financial resources you'll need to support you the rest of your life?\u000a\u000aThe question is straightforward, but coming up with an accurate answer can be more difficult than you think. For example, a recent study by the Boston College Center for Retirement Research found that more than 40% of working-age Americans had an unrealistic sense of whether they were on track to maintain their standard of living in retirement, with close to half of that group being overconfident about their prospects.\u000a\u000aSo how can you determine whether you've got the financial wherewithal to live a comfortable life once the paychecks stop? Start by getting an accurate sense of how much income you'll need to cover your living expenses after you retire. The best way to do that is by going to an online budgeting tool like BlackRock's Retirement Expense Worksheet. Be as accurate as possible, but remember that you can, and should, refine your estimates as you get a better handle on your expenses and spending.\u000a\u000aOnce you have a figure you're reasonably confident about, you can plug that number, as well as such information as your age, your retirement account balances, the amount you'll receive from Social Security, pension income, if any, and how long you expect to live in retirement (I'd say into your mid-90s is a decent estimate given today's longer lifespans) into a tool like T. Rowe Price's Retirement Income Calculator. The tool will estimate your chances of being able to get the income you need for as long as you'll need it.\u000a\u000aIf you're not comfortable going through this sort of exercise on your own or you'd just prefer having an assessment from a pro, you can always hire a financial adviser to do this analysis for you.\u000a\u000a2. Have you considered how you'll generate income for retirement?\u000a\u000aIt's not enough just to be sure that your resources can support you. You also want to have a comprehensive retirement income plan that spells out how you'll actually get the income you'll be relying on to support you throughout retirement.\u000a\u000aAmong the issues you'll need to consider as you create an income plan: How much you'll receive from Social Security and whether you should you consider delaying claiming your Social Security to boost the size of your check; how much of your nest egg's value can you withdraw each year without incurring too big a risk of running out of money before you run out of time; and whether you should devote a portion of your savings to an immediate annuity or a longevity annuity, so you'll have a another source of guaranteed lifetime income in addition to Social Security.\u000a\u000a3. Do you have health insurance squared away?\u000a\u000aAlong with housing, food and transportation, health care is one of the largest retirement expenses, accounting for up to 15% of spending on average depending on the retiree's age, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey.\u000a\u000aIf you're retiring at 65 or older, you'll most likely be relying largely on Medicare to deal with the medical expenses you'll incur during retirement. If you're leaving your job before that age and don't receive health insurance through your, or your spouse's, former employer, then you'll have to get it on your own. Either way, you want to know ahead of time the terms and conditions of coverage and have a good sense of what you'll pay not just in annual premiums, deductibles and co-pays but other out-of-pocket costs as well.\u000a\u000aYou can get good overview of Medicare -- the types of coverage available under the program; the various costs; what Medicare covers (and, just as important, what it doesn't); when you should sign up to avoid penalties -- by going to Medicare.gov, the official Medicare site.\u000a\u000aAs you're no doubt aware, things are, shall we say, kind of up in the air when it comes to private insurance these days, what with the (so far, at least, unsuccessful) attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare. But you can get an idea of what you might have to pay for coverage, at least for now, by going to sites such as Healthcare.gov, HealthPocket.com and eHealthInsurance.com. That said, you'll want to stay abreast of the ongoing health-care debate to see whether new developments affect the terms of your coverage as well as what you'll pay.\u000a\u000a4. Is your retirement portfolio in shape?\u000a\u000aIn 2007, just prior to the stocks losing more than half of their value during the financial crisis, more than four in ten 401(k) participants age 56 to 65 had in excess of 70% of their 401(k) account invested in stocks, according to an Employee Benefit Research Institute report. As a result, many older 401(k) participants saw substantial declines in the value of their nest egg.\u000a\u000aThere's no single correct stocks-bonds mix that's right for all retirees (although many tend to keep between 30% and 60% of their assets in stocks). But the idea is that you want to invest enough of your savings in stocks to provide the returns you'll need to maintain your purchasing power over the course of a long retirement, but also enough in bonds to provide some ballast during the market's inevitable periodic setbacks.\u000a\u000a5. Do you have a plan for how you'll actually spend your time after you retire?\u000a\u000aChances are you'll be spending upwards of 30 years in retirement. To make this phase of your life satisfying and meaningful rather than a period of just marking time, you'll need to some "lifestyle planning."\u000a\u000aThat means giving serious thought how you'll actually live after you do. Will you remain in your current home or downsize to something smaller? Stay in the same neighborhood or relocate to an area with lower living costs? Do you have a circle of friends and family that will keep you socially engaged? Have you lined up activities (part-time work, a workout regimen, a hobby or avocation, charitable work) that can help keep you physically fit and mentally alert?\u000a\u000aIdeally, you'll want to think about all these lifestyle issues before you actually retire. The same goes for answering the other questions on the checklist. After all, if you've been saving, investing and planning for a secure and rewarding retirement diligently throughout your career, it would be a shame to drop the ball just when your goal is within reach.

aV(CNN) "I've been on the low / I been taking my time / I feel like I'm out of my mind / It feel like my life ain't mine / Who can relate?"\u000a\u000aThe opening lines of Logic 's most successful song to date are, quite literally, a cry for help. The title of the track, " 1-800-273-8255 ," is the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\u000a\u000aIn a series of tweets the week the song was released, the 27-year-old rapper explained the motivation behind his music. "Over the years so many of you guys have told me that my music has helped you through so many tough times," he wrote. "Many of you have told me its even saved your life. I'm beyond humbled. But I felt I haven't done enough. ... I made this song for all of you who are in a dark place and can't seem to find the light."\u000a\u000aOver the years so many of you guys have told me that my music has helped you through so many tough times.\u000a\u000aMany of you have told me its even saved your life. I'm beyond humbled. But I felt I haven't done enough.\u000a\u000aI made this song for all of you who are in a dark place and can't seem to find the light.\u000a\u000aLogic found himself in his "dark place" in late 2015, according to an interview with the New York Post.\u000a\u000a"I was so scared because I was thought I had to work, work, work, because I thought I might only be around for five years," Logic said. "I thought I wasn't good enough to last."\u000a\u000aLogic found his proverbial "light" by learning the power of one word to deal with his anxiety: no.\u000a\u000a"I turn down really well-paid shows all over the world because I want to spend more time with my wife and myself," he told the Post. "I could sit here and think, 'I got all these people around me that I need to pay,' which is true ... but ain't nobody getting paid if I'm dead."\u000a\u000aLogic is scheduled to perform Sunday night on MTV's 2017 Video Music Awards.\u000a\u000aThe first verse of "1-800" is sung from the perspective of a person who has given up on their life and is ready to end it. The second verse, fronted by Alessia Cara , showcases the response of a suicide hotline crisis worker.\u000a\u000a"It's holding on though the road's long / And seeing light in the darkest things / And when you stare at your reflection / Finally knowing who it is / I know that you'll thank God you did"\u000a\u000aThe song ends with a verse featuring Khalid , again from the perspective of the suicidal caller but who now realizes the endless possibilities of the future.\u000a\u000a"I don't wanna cry anymore / I wanna feel alive / I don't even wanna die anymore / Oh I don't wanna / I don't wanna / I don't even wanna die anymore"\u000a\u000aAs part of a contest to be featured on the cover of Logic's album "Everybody," fans submitted videos detailing how much the the rapper's music means to them. He shared some of them on Twitter.\u000a\u000aI'm excited to partner with @800273Talk on the release tonight. pic.twitter.com/GZhaBvaCKY \u2014 Bobby Tarantino (@Logic301) April 27, 2017\u000a\u000a"When I was alone with myself, the stress was unlike any other time of the day," said Faith Martinez, 18, fighting back tears. "I'd put my headphones in, and it would all subside, because I knew that there was someone out there that cared for their fans so much that if I took away my life the way I had thought about, he would be hurt, and somebody would care that I was gone.\u000a\u000a"I put it on until the end, and I stood up, and I kept going," she said. "His music helps people keep going, and I'll forever be grateful for that."\u000a\u000aJohn Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, said, "The impact has been pretty extraordinary. On the day the song was released, we had the second-highest call volume in the history of our service." Overall, calls to the hotline are up roughly 33% from this time last year.\u000a\u000a"We can certainly attribute and have seen call increases relative to tragic events and alarming portrayals of suicide in the media -- anywhere from (musicians) Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington 's suicides, and (the Netflix show) ' 13 Reasons Why ,' " Draper said. "But here's what's really important: Logic is generating calls with a song about getting help and finding hope. It's not focusing on tragedy or suicide. In fact, he's starting conversations about suicide prevention, as opposed to suicide."\u000a\u000aThe video for "1-800," released last week by Def Jam Recordings and Visionary Music Group , has racked up more than 12 million views on YouTube. The seven-minute short film illustrates the story of a young man, beginning when he is just a baby.\u000a\u000aHis happy childhood is followed by difficulties in high school -- extreme bullying and struggling to come to terms with his sexual identity -- which cause serious strife with his friends and family. One day, he decides he's had enough, collapses in tears and raises a gun to his head, ready to pull the trigger -- but he doesn't. Instead, he calls the suicide hotline.\u000a\u000aThe story flashes forward to the man's wedding, where his father is standing by his side. The plot comes full circle, ending with the birth of his own son.\u000a\u000aThe message: It gets better. It always gets better.\u000a\u000a"In many ways, Logic's video and song completely embody this message that everybody can take an action to prevent suicide," Draper said. "A lot of people think that it requires a professional or even a hotline. But the fact is that while those are extremely helpful -- and I would always counsel somebody to consider those options -- what we also know is that most suicides are prevented by people being caring with one another.\u000a\u000a"How, when a person in your life is in crisis, can you help them get through it?"\u000a\u000aLogic is scheduled to perform his inspirational hit live Sunday night on MTV's 2017 Video Music Awards\u000a\u000aIf you suspect someone may be at risk: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any \ufb01rearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

"We want to do more than remember these artists. We want to remind people that suicide is preventable and that there are ways to get help and feel better if you're struggling emotionally.\u000a\u000a"Logic's song '1-800-273-8255' is not only a phenomenal track, but it has struck a chord with its inspiring message of hope, and we are honored to offer the VMA platform so it can reach even more young people."\u000a\u000aDraper said, "It's not just about the calls; it's about increasing awareness about suicide, and suicide prevention in particular. The calls don't even begin to count the number of people who, just by listening to the song and hearing the lyrics, feel more hopeful and less alone. There's really no measuring that impact."

aVHow A Checkpoint Inhibitor Works to Fight Metastatic Melanoma By Erin Azuse\u000a\u000aWas this helpful? ( 11 )\u000a\u000aYour immune system has an important job. Not only must it attack harmful cells to protect you from getting sick, it must also recognize your body\u2019s own cells so it leaves them alone. In some cases, however, cancer cells can trick the immune system, so they escape the attack and continue to grow.\u000a\u000aA newer method of cancer treatment called immunotherapy hopes to change that. Researchers are learning how to help the immune system fight against cancer cells. For patients with metastatic melanoma, a cancer that usually starts on the skin and spreads to other locations of the body, a type of immunotherapy known as a checkpoint inhibitor has demonstrated some exciting results.\u000a\u000a2017 Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. All rights reserved. May not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aT cells contain the on/off switch for your immune response.\u000a\u000aT cells, or T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell and an important part of your immune system. As they circulate throughout your body, they help differentiate between normal and abnormal cells. When the T cell comes across an abnormal cell, it \u201cturns on\u201d the immune response and attempts to destroy it. Conversely, when the T cell comes across a healthy cell, the immune response is suppressed or \u201cturned off\u201d. This is known as a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d and is how your body protects itself from harming its own cells and tissues.\u000a\u000aYet some cancer cells are able to evade destruction by hacking these same checkpoints to inactivate the T-cell. They disguise themselves so that the T cell sees them as normal cells. This turns off or lessens the immune system\u2019s response to the cancer cells, allowing them to thrive.\u000a\u000aCheckpoint inhibitors help keep the T cells from turning off.\u000a\u000aCheckpoint inhibitors, a class of medications used to treat cancer, do just what their name implies. They block the cancer cells from using the checkpoint to turn off the T cells. This allows the T cells to see the cancer cells for what they truly are and helps the immune system mount a full attack.\u000a\u000aRight now, two types of checkpoint inhibitors are used to fight metastatic melanoma, PD-1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Each class refers to the specific checkpoint protein that the medication targets. Researchers are currently studying other checkpoints and trying to develop new checkpoint inhibitors to boost the body\u2019s immune response to cancer.\u000a\u000aThey do so with good reason. Historically, metastatic melanoma has had a very poor prognosis. Yet with the development of checkpoint inhibitors, studies have shown improvements in overall survival rate and tumor regression for many individuals.\u000a\u000aEffects of treatment are usually not immediate.\u000a\u000aIt is not uncommon for it to take 6 to 12 weeks or longer for the checkpoint inhibitors to begin to work. Additionally, some patients may even see an increase in tumor size early on in treatment. This may be due to the larger number of activated T cells and immune cells that are present. After some time, however, the tumor may begin to shrink or even disappear.\u000a\u000aThe immune system boost can sometimes be too big.\u000a\u000aIn some cases, the use of checkpoint inhibitors can cause the body to attack its own tissues as well, known as an autoimmune response. Patients should be monitored carefully and instructed to contact their doctor if any side effects develop. Usually this can be reversed with a round of steroids or a temporary break in treatment, but for some patients it can lead to serious complications.\u000a\u000aThere is not one right way to treat metastatic melanoma, or any form of cancer for that matter, since individual responses to different forms of treatment will vary.

aV(CNN) Sometimes, you don't know the exact moment when your life has changed.\u000a\u000aFor Monica Schulman, 38, one of the first signs that her health -- her life -- had changed was so slight that it only began to bother her because it kept happening.\u000a\u000a"I was standing in the bathroom, and I kept noticing while I was brushing my teeth that my left side toes kept kind of curling under, and they were getting tense all of a sudden. And I really didn't think anything of it for months, but I kept doing this," said Schulman, of Atlanta, a part-time teacher and a mother of four. "And I was thinking: This is so weird. I don't know why I keep curling my toes under."\u000a\u000aThough it was unusual enough to make her pause, she did not go see a doctor. Schulman took that important step only after noticing another symptom.\u000a\u000aMonica Schulman, a mother of four, was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease when she was 37.\u000a\u000a"I was visiting my sister in New York, who at the time was going through chemo because she got diagnosed with breast cancer, and we would be walking a little bit through Manhattan," Schulman said. "And I kept telling her, 'My left arm is just not swaying!' "\u000a\u000aShe'd never thought about arm movements, but once she experienced it, she knew that something was off: "My arm was just kind of tight, and it was just laying there."\u000a\u000aShe also felt the barest shiver of a tremor that was unnoticeable to other people. She'd gone to the doctor some time ago about a tingling sensation, and he had run some tests -- "I think he was trying to see if I had (multiple sclerosis)" -- but he'd found nothing wrong. "You're fine, you're fine," he told her.\u000a\u000aAfter her trip to New York, she turned to Google before consulting a physician.\u000a\u000a"I pretty much diagnosed myself," Schulman said. "I typed my symptoms in, and everything that popped up that I read was Parkinson's-related."\u000a\u000aA neurological disorder, Parkinson's disease can bring tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, trouble balancing, problems walking and difficulty coordinating movement. These are the obvious symptoms and the reason why Parkinson's is sometimes referred to as a "movement disorder." Yet other symptoms are also common: Patients can experience depression, sleep problems, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\u000a\u000aAfter her Google search, Schulman turned to her family: "And everybody was like, 'You do not have Parkinson's. You're too young.' "\u000a\u000aMost Parkinson's patients are diagnosed around age 58.\u000a\u000a"They're like, 'You're crazy,' " said Schulman. "And I was like, 'I really think I do.' "\u000a\u000aAfter more research, she asked her husband, Jeremy, to help her get in to see In the face of disbelief, Schulman knew that she needed to find the best doctor to validate her self-diagnosis.After more research, she asked her husband, Jeremy, to help her get in to see Dr. Stewart Factor , a neurologist and director of the Movement Disorders Program at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. He is an expert in the field, and his appointment calendar is booked many months in advance.\u000a\u000aHer husband told office staff members, "she's really young; she's freaking out," and eventually they took pity and found a time for Schulman to see the doctor sooner rather than later.\u000a\u000aIn a waiting room filled with elderly people, Schulman gloomily observed the same symptoms she was experiencing: the rigidity, the tremors. Her name was called.\u000a\u000a"The first time Dr. Factor saw me, he was like, 'Wow, you're young,' " she said. Immediately, he explained that there's no "100% test" to tell somebody they have Parkinson's disease.\u000a\u000aStill, the news was grim. After a symptom check and neurological evaluation, he said he believed that Schulman had Parkinson's.\u000a\u000a"I was OK, but pretty hysterical," Schulman said.\u000a\u000aThe cause of Parkinson's\u000a\u000aPeople under the age of 40 make up about 15% of all Parkinson's cases, according to Factor.\u000a\u000a"We call that young-onset Parkinson's, while under the age of 20 is juvenile-onset of Parkinson's disease," Factor said. "That's much less common. The youngest person I've personally seen with Parkinson's had onset at age 18."\u000a\u000aWhy some patients develop Parkinson's at a very early age is not completely clear, explains Dr. Rebecca Gilbert, an associate professor of neurology at NYU Langone Medical Center. "But it does seem that patients who get it early tend to have a more prominent genetic component," added Gilbert, who is also a movement disorder specialist.\u000a\u000aMonica Schulman with her husband, Jeremy, recently enjoying a night out together.\u000a\u000aSchulman's genetic tests revealed a mutated LRRK2, one of the most prominent and researched Parkinson's disease genes.\u000a\u000aAccording to Factor, between 1% and 3% of all people with Parkinson's disease in the United States have this mutation. It's more common among some ethnicities, such as Ashkenazi Jews and North African Berbers.\u000a\u000aYet LRRK2 has only about a 30% "penetrance," Gilbert said: "If you inherit the abnormal gene, you have a 30% chance of developing Parkinson's."\u000a\u000aGilbert acknowledges that the genetics are "very complicated and getting more complicated every day." Oftentimes, she says, patients who develop the disorder at an older age have some genetic component.\u000a\u000aIn fact, a whole variety of genes either cause or are associated with or contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson's disease.\u000a\u000a"There are well over 20 genes that impact Parkinson's," Factor said. "There are five of them that are what we call causative -- in other words, the mutation causes the disease -- whereas the other genes just impact risk."\u000a\u000aAs he explains, the risk genes are teaching scientists about what systems (and symptoms) might be involved in Parkinson's. For instance, one risk gene regulates immune response, and it is well-known that inflammation in the brain is a symptom of the condition.\u000a\u000a"Some have thought that the progressive nature of the disease may be because of this ongoing inflammatory change in the brain," Factor said.\u000a\u000aHead Trauma\u000a\u000aSchulman, who has spent a good deal of time researching her illness, knows that a possible contributing factor -- or in some cases a cause -- is head trauma. (Sports legend Muhammad Ali's doctors believe that boxing-related brain injuries led to his Parkinson's diagnosis.)\u000a\u000a"There are some studies that have shown having a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness at some early time in your life can be associated with the development of Parkinson's later, but the impact it has on your risk is small," Factor said. "Muhammad Ali was a complex case."\u000a\u000aAli had young-onset Parkinson's diagnosed in his late 30s, Factor explains. Early in the course of his disease, some doctors said Ali looked like he had typical Parkinson's disease, with a tremor in one hand, but over time, his symptoms became compounded by effects from the trauma of his career.\u000a\u000a"People who were boxers that get pugilistic Parkinson's often don't respond to medications, and they have a different look," Factor said.\u000a\u000a"When I was 18 years old, I was in a really bad car accident in 1996 where I flipped my car seven times," Schulman said. "I broke high vertebra in my neck and had to wear a halo." She also began suffering from from anxiety and depression.\u000a\u000aToday, she wonders "if that impact is why what's happening now is happening."\u000a\u000aDopamine in the brain\u000a\u000aAt their first meeting, Factor recommended that Schulman get a DaTscan, a nuclear imaging test that looks at brain chemistry, specifically the integrity of dopamine cells.\u000a\u000aIf you have normal integrity of dopamine cells, you don't have Parkinson's, Factor explains, but if the test results are abnormal, "then you can have any one of these series of diseases that results in the death of dopamine cells, Parkinson's being the most common."\u000a\u000aThe scan showed "that I already had some dopamine loss on one side of the brain, on the right side, so that affects the left, and that's where my symptoms are," Schulman said.\u000a\u000aDespite the results, Schulman says, she "wasn't really convinced" and asked for recommendations for second opinions. Two other doctors reached the same diagnosis after they learned her symptoms and saw the DaTscan results.\u000a\u000a"So why do you have a lack of dopamine in your brain? You have a lack of dopamine in your brain because a certain cell that produces dopamine dies. There's degeneration of a specific type of neurons," Gilbert said.\u000a\u000aThough it's "more complicated than that" because the dopamine deficiency mainly accounts for motor symptoms of the disease, Parkinson's "affects a lot of different areas of functioning," including autonomic functions (such as blood pressure and breathing), cognition and urination.\u000a\u000aTreating Parkinson's, then, is a matter of producing dopamine in the brain.\u000a\u000aMedication\u000a\u000aA key of Parkinson's treatment is the drug levodopa , which is converted into dopamine in the brain and is "the cornerstone" of Parkinson's therapy, says Factor. Accordingly, he has prescribed it for Schulman along with a second drug, rotigotine.\u000a\u000aParkinson's patients experience "ons and offs," said Factor: motor fluctuations in response to the drug. These fluctuations appear as involuntary movements, known as dyskinesia. Actor and Parkinson's patient Michael J. Fox has this symptom and writes in his autobiography about overmedicating with levodopa early in his diagnosis to "cover" his symptoms and keep working.\u000a\u000aSome researchers believe dyskinesia is caused by medication flowing in waves or pulses in the brain. Some believe that taking too much levodopa causes dyskinesia.\u000a\u000aOne of the big discussions in the field is whether and when to start treatment with levodopa, Factor explained, since the drug contributes to dyskinesia. But it is not the only cause.\u000a\u000a"I personally believe that the progressive nature of each individual's disease predestines them to get it at some point," Factor said. "So if you delay the levodopa to try and prevent it, you're not going to prevent it, and you're going to lose a period of time when patients can have a really good response."\u000a\u000aHe tends to use it early, to give young patients the best opportunity to continue working. To limit the dose and delay fluctuations, he adds a second drug to the regimen.\u000a\u000aAnother reason for giving levodopa to young-onset patients is that they can undergo deep brain stimulation surgery once the fluctuations become troublesome.\u000a\u000a"Young people are the best candidates, because they are healthy and will have long-term benefits from the surgery," Factor said.\u000a\u000aAs Gilbert explains, delivery of medication is one of the most important areas of Parkinson's research right now. The goal is finding a way to deliver medication that stimulates the production of dopamine within the brain in a more continuous, sustained way. Among the new delivery systems, pharmaceutical researchers have developed infusion systems to pump medication directly into the small intestines.\u000a\u000aOne new class of drugs under development is chemically similar to caffeine, says Factor, because caffeine appears to lower the risk of getting Parkinson's disease in people with certain genes. Surprisingly, nicotine and other environmental toxicants may have a similar effect, lowering the risk for people with a certain genetic profile.\u000a\u000a"We very rarely see Parkinson's disease in active smokers," Factor said.\u000a\u000aFrom Schulman's perspective, all the research focused on medication is somewhat disappointing.\u000a\u000a"It's all symptom management," she said, adding that she doesn't expect a cure in her lifetime. Despite recent advances in neuroscience, a cure for this complex disease is not on the horizon.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, even though she knows "there's no reason to suffer and it's not necessarily going to get worse if you begin to take levodopa right now," she still has some worry about taking too much levodopa.\u000a\u000a"The tremor is annoying when I'm out at a restaurant with friends and my meds are wearing off," Schulman said. "I can feel myself moving, so I try to sit on my hand.\u000a\u000a"It's also hard taking all these meds regularly. It's like three times a day," she said. "But I'm dealing with it and functioning."\u000a\u000aPrognosis\u000a\u000a"Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick," Susan Sontag wrote in her book " Illness as Metaphor ," adding that sooner or later, each of us will count ourselves among the citizens in the country of sickness.\u000a\u000aBut not everyone in the kingdom of the sick believes the stamp on her passport.\u000a\u000a"There's still part of me that doesn't believe that I have Parkinson's," Schulman admitted. "I just have that percentage that still thinks they all got it wrong and maybe it's something else.\u000a\u000a"I'm trying to get over this denial phase, because I think I've been in it a little too long."\u000a\u000aIn January, she will leave her job as a preschool teacher and start focusing on "going to the gym every day and getting a trainer and start moving more and taking it a little more seriously."\u000a\u000aExercise is the best thing Parkinson's patients can do for themselves, according to Gilbert, who says, "lots and lots of things are improved when patients exercise." Many studies have showed that exercise improves symptoms of depression, helps with cognition and slows the progression of motor symptoms.\u000a\u000aAlthough Factor refers to her symptoms as mild, Schulman says, "to me, it's pretty not mild, because I feel them." She noticed that her tremor has worsened since her diagnosis in early 2015 and asked Factor if that meant she is progressing quickly.\u000a\u000a"It's slow and slower, that's what he said: People progress slow or slower," Schulman said. "They don't know how much I'll progress. They don't know if I'll stay this way and never get worse. They know to a point you do get worse, but everybody's different. Two years from now, I could be a lot worse or be where I'm at right now."\u000a\u000a"The hardest part for me is not even so much that I have Parkinson's disease, it's my kids," said Schulman, who has an 11-year-old son, a 10-year-old son, a 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son. Each knows in some way about their mother's disease.\u000a\u000a"My oldest is aware. I sat with him once, and I talked to him about it, and he started crying actually, and he asked me if I was gonna die, and I said 'no, I'm not gonna die,' " she said. "The other ones know, but they don't really know so much about it.\u000a\u000a"I cried a lot thinking now my kids are going to have a mom who is sick, someone who is not going to be able to do things they want me to do," she said. "I feel so bad for my husband. We've been married for 15 years, and now he has a wife with Parkinson's."\u000a\u000aMost people die with Parkinson's disease, not because of it, says Factor. Still, people with very long-term Parkinson's can develop dementia or lose their ability to walk and then may get complications of immobility, such as pneumonia or other infections.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"They say you don't die from Parkinson's, but ..." Schulman said with a laugh. "I sort of disagree."\u000a\u000aEverywhere on the groups she's joined -- a Facebook group and other chat rooms -- family members say their loved ones died from complications of the disease.\u000a\u000a"I just hope that I progress slowly enough that there will be better medicine to help," she said.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, she still finds it embarrassing to say she has Parkinson's, because "people envision an old person shaking and looking a little funny."\u000a\u000a"I want to be one of those personalities, those people who are like a fighter and gung ho and raising money and supporting the foundation and out there about it."\u000a\u000a"I want to be that way," Schulman said. "I'm just not there yet."

That\u2019s the lowest percentage since World War II, as you might have heard an Occupy Wall Street protester point out. (Not coincidentally, one in five young adults now lives below the poverty line.) Almost a quarter more people ages 25 to 34in other words, people who should be a few years into their independent livesare living with their parents than at the beginning of the recession.\u000a\u000aBeing young is supposed to mean you have the luxury of time. But in hard times, a few fallow years can become a lifetime drag on what you earn, sort of the opposite of compound interest. Because the average person grabs 70 percent of their total pay bumps during their first ten years in the workforce, according to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, having stagnant or nonexistent ­wages during that period means you hit that springboard at a crawl. Economist Lisa Kahn explained to The Atlantic in 2010 that those who graduate into a recession are still earning an average of 10 percent less nearly two decades into their careers. In hard, paycheck-shrinking numbers, the salary lost over that stretch totals around $100,000. That works out to $490 or so less a month, money that could go, say, toward repaying student loans, which for the class of 2009 average $24,000. Those student loans (the responsible borrowing option!) have reportedly passed credit cards as the nation\u2019s largest source of debt. This is not just a rotten moment to be young. It\u2019s a putrid, stinking, several-months-old-stringy-goat-meat moment to be young.\u000a\u000aEarlier generations have weathered recessions, of course; this stall we\u2019re in has the look of something nastier. Social Security and Medicare are going to be diminished, at best. Hours worked are up even as hiring staggers along: Blood from a stone looks to be the normal order of things going forward, to borrow the business-speak. Economists are warning that even when the economy recuperates, full employment will be lower and growth will be slowera sad little rhyme that adds up to something decidedly ­unpoetic. A majority of Americans say, for the first time ever, that this generation will not be better off than its parents.

aV(CNN) Jody Neal-Post has been reading about the health care law debate with worry these days.\u000a\u000aShe's worried about how the new health care law won't carry protections for all people with pre-existing conditions. She is relatively healthy, but before Obamacare, she had a hard time getting insurance because of what some companies considered a pre-existing condition: She is a domestic violence survivor.\u000a\u000aBefore Obamacare, some insurance companies used to consider medical treatment related to domestic violence and rape a pre-existing condition that would preclude survivors from getting insurance. Some states have banned that practice, but not all. Neal-Post worries that changes in the way insurance companies handle people with pre-existing conditions could hurt her fellow survivors.\u000a\u000a"I had really good counseling," Neal-Post said. "So the story of the abuse has now become a fact story for me, rather than an emotional one, but reading about this insurance debate prompted this memory of fighting for insurance that hadn't come to the forefront for me in a long while."\u000a\u000aIn 2002, Neal-Post's husband beat and tried to choke her. Her medical records at the time showed that he grabbed her so hard, there were fingerprints on her neck. The story of the abuse made the newspapers at the time. In 2006, when the Albuquerque lawyer tried to switch insurance plans, she ran into problems.\u000a\u000aThe insurance application asked for her medical history. She disclosed that she was the victim of a crime, had a severe concussion then and "was strangled momentarily to unconsciousness." She included that she got private counseling through a police department program for abuse survivors and, as part of treatment, was given a six-month prescription for Valium to help her sleep.\u000a\u000a"I would see his eyes when I was falling asleep, and I would see him choking me as if I was trying to get away from him again," Neal-Post said. "I couldn't sleep."\u000a\u000aThe insurance company rejected her application. By law, it didn't have say why, but she says she was otherwise healthy.\u000a\u000aShe did eventually get insurance, but under Obamacare, it would never have been a problem; currently, insurance companies cannot deny policies or charge people more based on any pre-existing conditions.\u000a\u000aNow, the bill under consideration in the House weakens the protections for those with pre-existing conditions. States would be allowed to get a waiver from the US Department of Health and Human Services to let insurance companies set premiums based on a person's medical background under certain circumstances. If the bill becomes law in its current form, that could mean survivors could face higher insurance bills.\u000a\u000aAt the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing to confirm Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania , asked Price about this issue. Would Price "commit to maintaining the protections that ensure victims of domestic violence will not be discriminated against when purchasing health insurance?"\u000a\u000aPrice responded said it's "absolutely vital" that such "victims" not be "priced out of the market."\u000a\u000a"I should have been more aggressive pinning him down on that," Casey said, in retrospect. "The nature of this is such that it would be a disaster for this administration to allow that policy to change," and if this "lapses into a 'Well, the states will take care of it,' that is wrong and wrong morally."\u000a\u000aInsurance industry changes\u000a\u000aThere has been movement in the insurance industry to prevent companies from making policy decisions based on someone's status as a survivor of abuse.\u000a\u000aThe NAIC Network Adequacy Model Act (PDF), revised and adopted in 2015, included a resolution passed by the professional association for state insurance regulators, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that prohibits "unfair discrimination by health carriers and insurance professionals on the basis of abuse status." This isn't a law like Obamacare, but it serves as guidance for states when they make insurance-related laws. Not all states, however, have adopted this policy.\u000a\u000aAmerican's Health Insurance Plans , the association that represents health insurance providers, said in an email that "of course survivors of domestic abuse and rape should be covered."\u000a\u000aSenior Vice President of Communications Kristine Grow pointed out that health plans follow the laws implemented by the ACA and the guidance set forth by the NAIC Model Act. And just because there isn't a law doesn't mean that's how insurance companies in those states operate.\u000a\u000aBut if the ACA is rolled back and states haven't adopted the NAIC Model Act, some survivors could be newly vulnerable again.\u000a\u000aShe said it's unknown how many survivors had been denied policies prior to Obamacare, because insurance companies didn't have to disclose why they turn someone down for a policy.\u000a\u000aIn 1994 , the House Judiciary Committee did an informal survey of 16 of the nation's largest insurers, representing about 50% of the market at the time. Eight of the 16 companies admitted using domestic violence as a factor to set premiums and to determine who should get a policy.\u000a\u000aMore questions for survivors\u000a\u000aThere are many other survivors' stories.\u000a\u000aWhen the National Women's Law Center launched a campaign to support its study called "Being a Woman is not a Pre-Existing Condition" in 2009, Borchelt said, it came across a story about Chris Turner.\u000a\u000aTurner was a health insurance agent who asked insurance underwriters she worked with whether rape survivors would get coverage. She said the underwriters told her no. Medical treatment associated with rape made the person too high a risk.\u000a\u000aThe question Turner asked was posed as a hypothetical, but it wasn't.\u000a\u000aTurner was a rape survivor. She'd been drugged and raped while on a business trip. Doctors put her on medication to prevent HIV as a precaution. When she had that general conversation with an underwriter, Turner had needed to switch insurance policies, but she now knew how difficult that would be.\u000a\u000aThe Affordable Care Act changed that. And it ensured that tests for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, plus domestic and interpersonal violence screening and counseling, would be completely covered by insurance companies.\u000a\u000aThat may not be the case in the future. Under the current bill, states could seek waivers that would let insurers sell plans that don't include all the essential health benefits mandated by the ACA.\u000a\u000a"We are really concerned that getting rid of the ACA will send us back to the day when insurance companies discriminated against women," said Borchelt, whose group opposes the repeal of Obamacare.\u000a\u000aNeal-Post also remains concerned, although she was eventually able to get health insurance, even before the Affordable Care Act. Her state, New Mexico, had a law that prohibited insurance companies from using domestic abuse as a criterion for denying someone health insurance.\u000a\u000a"Eventually, with the intervention of the (attorney general's) office and the consumer insurance division, I got insurance," she said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aShe knew, though, that she had a personal advantage in getting health insurance coverage, because she is a lawyer.\u000a\u000a"I had awareness and a skill set to push back to get myself covered, and I know a lot of women don't have that access," Neal-Post said. The recent Obamacare repeal efforts bother her.\u000a\u000a"For years, I had been freed from this angst" due to these legal protections. "Reading the votes in Congress made me think about this issue again, and I was immediately concerned for other women."

aV(CNN) More children and teens are likely to be categorized as having abnormal blood pressure during their annual wellness visits, based on new recommendations released Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\u000a\u000aHigh blood pressure is mostly a "silent" condition, with no visible symptoms. Yet it can have long-term health consequences, including cardiovascular disease. The new guidelines, aimed at prevention, were published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. They include new diagnosis tables based on normal-weight children.\u000a\u000aThe academy convened a 20-person committee to update the previous guidelines, issued in 2004 , and develop new evidence-based recommendations. As part of its work, the committee reviewed nearly 15,000 articles focused on diagnosis, evaluation and early management of abnormally high blood pressure in children and teens.\u000a\u000aObesity and family history\u000a\u000aAn estimated 3.5% of all children and teens in the United States have hypertension, according to the guidelines.\u000a\u000a"The prevalence of 3.5% is based on fairly recent large-scale screening studies," said Dr. Joseph T. Flynn, lead author of the guidelines and a professor of pediatrics at University of Washington. In the past, the percentage of children diagnosed with high blood pressure was lower, he said: "based on previous studies, maybe 1% to 2%."\u000a\u000aThe cause of hypertension depends on the age group.\u000a\u000a"In infants and very young children, we worry about an underlying cause like kidney disease," Flynn said. With older school-age children and teenagers, the cause is more likely to be primary hypertension, sometimes called essential hypertension, "where there's no specific problem," he said. "This is like adults."\u000a\u000a"Obesity does contribute to higher blood pressure," he said. Yet the physiological mechanisms causing high blood pressure are very complicated, and not all kids who are overweight or obese are hypertensive, while some normal-weight kids may be.\u000a\u000a"If, for example, a child is known to have kidney disease or heart disease, then they would be at higher risk for hypertension. Another group would be kids whose parents have hypertension," Flynn said.\u000a\u000aThe guidelines include updated blood pressure tables based on normal-weight children for more precise classifications of hypertension. As a result, more children will be categorized as needing treatment.\u000a\u000a"Untreated, we believe that high blood pressure in a child will lead to high blood pressure when that child becomes an adult, so that would potentially lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life," Flynn said, adding that untreated hypertension can also cause heart and kidney damage.\u000a\u000aThe new guidelines are aligned with those for adults according to Flynn.\u000a\u000a"The blood pressure levels that are concerning in adults would also be concerning in an older teenager," meaning those age 13 and older. "It simplifies things for doctors," he said.\u000a\u000aTakeaways for parents\u000a\u000aThe major thing parents need to know is that their children should have their blood pressure checked when they see a doctor, Flynn said. Also, know that hypertension can be managed with lifestyle change: for example, more exercise or changing the diet. Sometimes, though, the condition requires medication.\u000a\u000aAnother change in the new guidelines is an emphasis on confirmation of the diagnosis.\u000a\u000a"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a procedure in which the person wears a blood pressure cuff for 24 hours, and their blood pressure is measured periodically over 24 hours," Flynn said. "This is very important in children because there's a very high rate of what's called white coat hypertension, where blood pressure is high in the office (due to fear of doctors) but not at home."\u000a\u000aThe new recommendation is that ambulatory blood pressure should become standard practice in children after any abnormal in office reading, Flynn said.\u000a\u000aDr. Sophia Jan, director of general pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, said the rationale behind the new guidelines makes sense.\u000a\u000aWith evidence that there may be consequences for kids whose high blood pressure is not treated at lower thresholds, it makes sense to treat them earlier than in the past, said Jan, who was not involved in the new recommendations.\u000a\u000aWhat she would tell parents is that "we're not doing anything majorly different. We're still going to check your child's pressure when he or she comes for wellness child visits. That's what we've done always in the past." What's new is that "we may be quicker to recommend that you and your family help your child engage in lifestyle changes if your child's pressure is within a threshold that is lower than in the past.\u000a\u000a"Everyone's loath to put kids on medicines if you don't have to, but we may need to get there a little bit faster than we have traditionally in the past," Jan said.\u000a\u000aShe said that she understood how difficult it is for families to be able to have full control over what their kids eat and how much physical activity they get.\u000a\u000a"This is increasingly a public health problem," Jan said, since schools don't always have budgets that would allow for exercise programs and lots of veggies and fruits in school lunches.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"As doctors, we recommend these lifestyle changes, yet in reality, it requires partnership with schools and public health agencies," she said. "We in the pediatric community did not necessarily appreciate to what degree kids were starting to exhibit what is traditionally thought of as an adult condition. Kids can show early signs of organ damage and increased risk for cardiovascular disease despite the fact that they're young."

aVAlcanar, Spain (CNN) Nuria Gil had heard rumors of men squatting in a vacant property around the corner from her home, but she had never seen them herself.\u000a\u000aShe had little reason to be suspicious -- the quiet Spanish beach village where she has lived for almost 20 years is filled with holiday houses. People come and go all the time.\u000a\u000aBut on Wednesday night a deafening bang rocked Gil, 50, from her sleep. She ran outside to see smoke billowing from what remained of the property down the road.\u000a\u000aArmed police walk down a dirt road toward the scene of the explosion in Alcanar.\u000a\u000aThe powerful explosion had leveled the one-story house in the Montecarlo neighborhood of Alcanar, leaving one person dead and another seriously injured.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't until the following afternoon, when a van mowed down crowds of people in the heart of Barcelona , that authorities began to piece together the significance of the blast.\u000a\u000aCenter of investigation\u000a\u000ais now at the center of a The house in Alcanaris now at the center of a wide-ranging investigation into a previously unknown terror cell believed to be behind last week's attacks in the Catalan capital and in the coastal town of Cambrils.\u000a\u000aPolice suspect the property was being used as a base to make explosives that could have caused even greater devastation , had they not blown up in what investigators believe was a premature explosion.\u000a\u000aA secondary uncontrolled blast on Thursday afternoon blew out a window in Gil's house and left rocks strewn across her yard.\u000a\u000aStanding on her front porch, tape from a police cordon fluttering nearby in the wind, Gil says she was shocked to learn that the suspects had been hiding in plain sight just meters away.\u000a\u000aGil, standing under a palm tree in her front yard, says she can't imagine why the suspects chose her neighborhood as their home base.\u000a\u000aRocks lie on Gil's manicured lawn -- scattered debris from the explosion.\u000a\u000a"It was a surprise and we were very scared," says Gil.

Taking a few minutes to share their story with us could propel them to worldwide recognition.\u000a\u000aDestiny Bush nominated her mentor and "second mother," Tawanda Jones, whose drill team provides discipline and inspiration to thousands of children in the violent city of Camden, New Jersey. Jones was recognized as a Top 10 CNN Hero in 2013\u000a\u000a"It was important for the world to see this wonderful individual who commits herself effortlessly -- her heart, her body, her soul -- to our youth," said Bush, who now works in education.\u000a\u000aBut you don't have to personally know the individual you nominate.\u000a\u000aJohanna Robinette, for example, lives in the same small town as Dale Beatty, who helps build and modify homes for injured veterans . Robinette had heard about Beatty's organization, and she saw nominating him as a way to help draw attention to his efforts.\u000a\u000a"To be able to take that time to do that, I was thankful that I did and thankful that (he was) honored in that way," Robinette said.

aV"I have lots of family in Haiti and wanted to bring them to the United States, but I don't have residency," Frederic says. "I thought about them every day, my wife and kids."\u000a\u000aAt a dead end called Roxham Road, Frederic is crossing a narrow ditch that separates the United States and Canada.\u000a\u000aCanadian police wait patiently on the other side. They warn anyone who approaches that what they're about to do is illegal, that they'll be arrested.\u000a\u000aBut that's the first step. Once arrested, Frederic, and the thousands of others who have made this journey across to Quebec in the past few weeks, can apply for asylum in Canada. He hopes that would mean a chance at uniting with his family that remains in Haiti after 17 years apart. Then, he hopes, his family could apply to for asylum to become Canadian residents too.\u000a\u000aIn the past month, Greyhound and other bus lines have been packed with immigrants -- primarily Haitians -- making this exact trip from the United States into Canada. They have taken trains, buses, often multiple, to get to Plattsburgh, New York.\u000a\u000aFrom there, they hail a taxi to the border. On this day, Frederic is one of a stream of almost 300 crossing, dragging whatever belongings they can with them. Haitians flooded to the United States after a cholera outbreak in 2010, as well as after the devastating earthquake the same year.\u000a\u000aFrederic, like 59,000 other Haitians in the United States, has "temporary protected status," known as TPS, given to Haitians after the earthquake.\u000a\u000atwo months has been accelerated, infused with new urgency: But the gradual exodus from the U.S. over the pasttwo monthshas been accelerated, infused with new urgency: the Trump administration has warned it will not renew the TPS , which is currently set to expire in January 2018.\u000a\u000aFrederic is fearful that means he would be kicked out of the US.\u000a\u000a"I'm scared because every day I hear different news," Frederic says. "That's why I'm leaving the United States for Canada."\u000a\u000a. It has created bottleneck at the border with more than 1,000 people waiting to be processed in Red Cross tents, according to the RCMP. Canadian authorities have scrambled to manage an "unprecedented" surge of asylum seekers coming over the border into Quebec province. So many people have been fleeing in the past few months that Canadian police have set up tents for processing and background checksIt has created bottleneck at the border with more than 1,000 people waiting to be processed in Red Cross tents, according to the RCMP.\u000a\u000a"We've never seen those numbers," said Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) spokesman Claude Castonguay. "Even though our officers are patrolling 24 hours a day all year long, we've never seen such numbers coming in."\u000a\u000aRCMP intercepted almost 7,000 asylum seekers in the last six weeks in Quebec. 3,000 of those were in July, RCMP says, and almost 4,000 in just the first half of August.\u000a\u000aCrossings mount, driven by fear\u000a\u000a13-year-old Melissa Paul talks with Canadian officials at the border as she crosses with her mother.\u000a\u000aBroadly, asylum seekers point to their growing unease about the Trump administration's attitudes toward immigrants. They also point to the racism they say was unleashed after President Trump's election as motivation for driving them to pick up and head to Canada.\u000a\u000aMimose Joseph and her 13-year-old daughter, Melissa Paul, are trying to find their taxi for the ride from Plattsburgh to the border.\u000a\u000aThey had taken a series of trains and buses from their home in Belle Glade, Florida, a state Joseph has called home since 2002.\u000a\u000aJoseph does not speak any English, but her daughter Melissa was born in Florida and is a US citizen. The 13-year-old explains the pair made this trip to Canada, uprooting her adolescence, because of the growing pressure on her,\u000a\u000a"She's been through a lot and has stayed here for almost 15 years, and she doesn't want any stress anymore," Paul says.\u000a\u000aThey, too, hope Canada will take them in permanently and allow brothers and sisters to join her. But for Melissa, it means leaving the only country she has ever known.\u000a\u000a"It's kind of shocking and a little bit sad," she says.\u000a\u000aIt's not going to be an open door. Francine Dupuis, refugee assistance agency\u000a\u000aHundreds have been crossing the border each day in the last two months, according to PRAIDA, a provincial government agency that works under Quebec's Immigration Ministry and focuses on helping new arrivals resettle. Immigration officials say 250 people are coming across the border illegally each day.\u000a\u000a"Definitely, there is a movement. People are talking to one another and they are suggesting that it is very easy to cross the border and they think that they will automatically become Canadian," PRAIDA Associate CEO Francine Dupuis says.\u000a\u000aCanada has already done away with its version of TPS for Haitians, making it more difficult to claim asylum, Dupuis says.\u000a\u000aJust because some asylum seekers are poor, or come from poverty-stricken countries, she says, that does not automatically make them refugees nor guarantee asylum.\u000a\u000a"It's not going to be an open door," Dupuis says. "That's definitely not (the case) and it's sad because we do think that many of them believe that they are here to stay, which is not necessarily true."\u000a\u000aAn Olympic stadium becomes a refuge\u000a\u000aThe stadium that brought together countries in the 1976 Olympics is now temporary housing for asylum seekers.\u000a\u000aSo many asylum seekers now see Canada as a more welcoming country to find refuge and rebuild their lives that traditional sheltering options used during slower times are overflowing. 3,200 are in temporary housing in Montreal, Dupuis says.\u000a\u000aThe numbers have grown so much that Montreal's Olympic Stadium, which was home to the 1976 games, is now housing about 700 newcomers, Dupuis says.\u000a\u000aA ticket stub left behind shows a person took four buses to reach the Canadian border for asylum.\u000a\u000aThe idea, Dupuis says, is to get them comfortable temporary housing but move them through the system as quickly as possible into more permanent lodging.\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of asylum seekers these days are Haitian, officials say. There are others from Syria and Yemen, fleeing the wars in their countries.\u000a\u000a"What they want is a normal life, they want to study, they want to work, they want to have their families with a perspective of stability and this isn't something they seem to be getting now in the (United) States, unfortunately," Dupuis says. "They don't know what is going to happen and that creates anxiety, a lot of anxiety."\u000a\u000a'I still love the USA ... it's just the administration'\u000a\u000aNidal al-Yamani is among many who received temporary housing at the YMCA in Montreal.\u000a\u000aThe YMCA on Montreal's Tupper Street has long served as the first stop for asylum seekers coming from the United States, but these days it is bursting. Its 600 beds are all full.\u000a\u000aNidal al-Yamani, 26, is standing outside. The Yemeni was living in Alabama on a student visa before he crossed into Canada on July 4. Yemen is one of the six Muslim-majority countries on the Trump administration's travel ban.\u000a\u000a"After the ban, everybody knows Yemen. Only the bad things about Yemen," al-Yamani says.\u000a\u000aI don't think I'm welcome anymore. Nidal al-Yamani, asylum seeker\u000a\u000aHe says he no longer felt comfortable in America and experienced several racist incidents.\u000a\u000a"The mood changed and the new administration, they give the green light to the people who were racist (who weren't previously) showing it," al-Yamani says.\u000a\u000aAl-Yamani has since moved out of the YMCA into more permanent lodgings as his case is processed. He has a higher chance of succeeding than the Haitians, coming from a country wracked by war, immigration officials say. Already, he says, he feels more at home and accepted in Canada.\u000a\u000a"I still love USA. As a people, as a community, as everything. It's just the administration, and maybe the system, that affected me," he says. "Even if I try to go back to the United States I don't think I'm welcome anymore."\u000a\u000aCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government are bracing for more people like Al-Yamani to make their way into Canada. On Wednesday he met with a task force of federal and provincial officials charged with managing the influx of asylum seekers.\u000a\u000aThose from nine other countries besides Haiti may begin to make their way north too, as their TPS is currently set to expire in the next year. Among them, Honduras and Syria and Al-Yamani's home country of Yemen. It is unclear if the US will extend the TPS for the other countries.\u000a\u000aTrudeau said immigrants were a positive for Canada: "Being welcoming and opening is a source of strength," he told reporters.\u000a\u000aBut he stressed no one was getting a free pass by entering Canada, especially at unauthorized crossing points.\u000a\u000a"There are no advantages in terms of the immigration system to arrive irregularly versus arriving regularly," he says. "The same systems will be followed whether it's the very strong and rigorous immediate security checks or whether it's the careful evaluation of their file."

aVPittsburgh, Pennsylvania (CNN) For many Cambodians, a bar of soap is a luxury they cannot afford.\u000a\u000aYet children living in rural areas are vulnerable to disease simply because they are unable to wash their hands.\u000a\u000aAccording to UNICEF, diarrheal diseases alone account for one in five deaths of Cambodian children age 5 and younger, largely due to poor hygiene practices.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, as a college student, Samir Lakhani saw the issue firsthand while volunteering in a Cambodian village.\u000a\u000a"I remember quite vividly a mother bathing her newborn in a basin filled with laundry powder and water," said Lakhani, now 24. "It's an image I'll never get out of my mind."\u000a\u000aLakhani was staying in a hotel in Cambodia, and he realized that one solution to the problem was being thrown away: barely-used bars of soap.\u000a\u000aSo, he figured out a way to save this soap and give it a second life.\u000a\u000aWhile still attending the University of Pittsburgh, Lakhani started the Eco-Soap Bank. The nonprofit recycles discarded bars of soap from hotels in Cambodia and distributes it to people in need.\u000a\u000aWhile there are similar programs that recycle hotel soap, Lakhani's focus in Cambodia is unique.\u000a\u000aToday, the organization has four recycling centers across the country, providing jobs to 35 local women. The used bars are sanitized and remolded into new bars or melted down into liquid soap.\u000a\u000aSo far, more than 650,000 people have benefited from the group's soap and hygiene education.\u000a\u000a"What I love most is that we are killing three birds with one stone," Lakhani said. "We are keeping waste out of landfills, employing locals and spreading soap all over the country."\u000a\u000aCNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Lakhani about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: Why is it difficult for rural Cambodians to access soap?\u000a\u000aSamir Lakhani: First is affordability. If you're earning only $1.50 every single day, you're not going to spend $1 of your daily wage on an imported bar of luxury soap. They're going to prioritize feeding their families. And if they can afford soap, they will pick the least expensive option, which is usually detergent, which is so harmful and toxic on the skin.\u000a\u000aThe second reason is access. The demand is so low, shopkeepers and local markets have stopped stocking soap. The last reason is, very simply, because many Cambodians don't really understand where illness and disease come from, they don't really take the appropriate steps towards mitigating those effects. And that includes use of bar soap.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Heroes: From hotel soap to Eco-Soap Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Heroes: From hotel soap to Eco-Soap 01:48\u000a\u000aCNN: Eco-Soap Bank's work is based in Cambodia and largely run by Cambodians. What are the benefits of being in the same country you're serving?\u000a\u000aLakhani: (It) has a ton of benefits, the first one being able to very quickly respond to outbreaks, such a cholera and impetigo and other things like that. Almost immediately, we're able to use our stockpile of soap and critically address whatever crisis is present.\u000a\u000aAnother overlooked benefit is the opportunity to be able to hire local deserving employees who can immensely benefit from steady employment from our program.\u000a\u000aCNN: What's it like for the women you hire?\u000a\u000aLakhani: Our soap recyclers are all local women who were striving to find some source of reliable, predictable incomes. They face immense hardship. And unless someone is willing to invest in their future, it's hard to crawl out of that. The women that we employ currently have been able to provide for their entire families, pay down debt and resume education for their children.\u000a\u000aLakhani shares a light moment with staff at Eco-Soap Bank--which employs local women\u000a\u000aWe believe very firmly in the intellectual capabilities of our staff members. We provide them with free daily English classes and other business skills training.\u000a\u000aAnd the second type of employee can work from home or they can work from their own store. We give them a free supply of our soap to sell, generate incomes for them and their families, and also generally promote hygiene in the community.\u000a\u000aCNN: What does the future look like for Eco-Soap Bank?\u000a\u000aLakhani: Lack of hygiene is not something that's unique only to Cambodia. It's seen across the developing world. The developing world is also home to some of the busiest tourism centers in the world. We can assume that they're producing equally large amounts of used soap that should be redirected to the people who need it.\u000a\u000aWe're looking at seven countries to expand to. We've scratched the surface. Especially when you see it firsthand, you just realize you really have a lot to do.\u000a\u000aI did not expect to be so effective by such an early age, especially without the previous professional training (to run a nonprofit). If you have one part drive and maybe one part naivety or foolishness, you can do anything.\u000a\u000aWant to get involved?

aV(CNN) Lynn Sorrells started teaching 26 years ago because she loved seeing the light-bulb moment when a kid grasped a new concept.\u000a\u000aShe still does. But as principal of a high school in Dorchester County, Maryland, she is struggling to find an algebra and geometry teacher just weeks before her school year is set to begin.\u000a\u000aAs students head back to school, Sorrells' district is one of hundreds across the country grappling with a growing teacher shortage -- especially in key areas such as math and special ed.\u000a\u000a"Currently, there are not enough qualified teachers applying for teaching jobs to meet the demand in all locations and fields," said the Learning Policy Institute, a national education think tank, in a research brief in September\u000a\u000aSome schools, such as in New York City , are being forced to increase class sizes, which some studies show can reduce how much a student learns.\u000a\u000aThe institute estimated last year that if trends continue, there could be a nationwide shortfall of 112,000 teachers by 2018.\u000a\u000aWhat subjects are most affected?\u000a\u000aPublic schools in 48 states and the District of Columbia report teacher shortages in math for the 2017-18 school year, according to the US Department of Education . Forty-six states report shortages in special education, 43 in science and 41 in foreign languages.\u000a\u000aStatistics on shortages may be based on the percentage of unfilled teaching jobs, the number of emergency credentials given to those without traditional teaching certificates and the number of teachers hired after the school year starts, says Dan Goldhaber, director of the University of Washington's Center for Education Data and Research.\u000a\u000aIt's always been harder to fill teacher jobs in math, science and special education positions, Sorrells said. But the past five years have been worse than usual.\u000a\u000aIncreasingly, she said, teachers in areas like math and science are leaving for higher-paying private sector jobs after a few years.\u000a\u000aAs a result, many teachers who remain are being asked to do more. Some states, like California, are seeing classes with up to 35 students, says Linda Darling-Hammond, director of the Learning Policy Institute.\u000a\u000aAnd some schools are making do without certain subjects.\u000a\u000aIs there help on the way?\u000a\u000aProbably not soon. The supply of aspiring teachers has been dwindling.\u000a\u000aNationwide, teacher education enrollments dropped 35% between 2009 and 2014, the most recent year for which data are available, according to the Learning Policy Institute.\u000a\u000aA survey at UCLA found that freshmen's interest in teaching as a career has steadily declined over the past decade.\u000a\u000aAnd in Colorado , for example, the number of people becoming teachers and administrators fell more than 24% from the start of the 2010-11 school year to the end of the 2015-16 school year, according to the Department of Higher Education.\u000a\u000aSo what's causing this?\u000a\u000aGoldhaber, who studies educational trends at the University of Washington, sees two main reasons.\u000a\u000aMath and science teachers aren't paid enough. Salaries for US secondary school teachers have largely remained the same over the past two decades, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\u000a\u000aAnd students in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math) can make more in other professions than they would teaching.\u000a\u000aTeaching in the US is too demanding. About 8% of teachers leave teaching each year, with two-thirds quitting before retirement, according to the Learning Policy Institute. This is double the percentage of teachers leaving the profession in countries like Singapore and Finland.\u000a\u000aThis turnover is especially high in subjects such as special education, which can place additional demands on teachers.\u000a\u000a"I'm having more of those conversations where teachers are questioning, 'Do I want to put 30 years in public education?' " said Sorrells, the Maryland high school principal.\u000a\u000a"The reality of contemporary public education ... (is) that it's amazing; it's fulfilling; it's a calling." But it can also be exhausting, she says.\u000a\u000aHow do we fix it?\u000a\u000aGoldhaber cites some solutions:\u000a\u000a\u2022 Help students be more strategic about their teaching opportunities. When students enter teaching certification programs, let them know where the jobs are. In many parts of the country, they'll have an easier time finding jobs to teach math or science than English.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Partner school districts with local college and university programs. Though the teacher shortage is rooted partly in subject areas, it's also a matter of location. Schools in low-income areas struggle more to fill positions. "It is the kids that are oftentimes most at risk that are the ones who are likely to suffer the most," Goldhaber said.\u000a\u000aOne way to fix that would be to pull in students from local higher-ed programs to help teach in those areas. Many may stick around for a full-time job after graduation.\u000a\u000aSorrells says she also reaches out to private-sector employers to find people with expertise in certain fields who may be interested in teaching.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Make teacher certification national instead of state by state. Prospective teachers must pass an exam specific to the state they want to work in. But if a teacher wants to move from, say, Pennsylvania to California, they can't immediately apply for jobs there. By having a national certification exam, teachers would have more mobility to go where they're needed.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the day, Sorrells believes schools are there to give students the most rigorous education they can.\u000a\u000aWithout quality teachers, she says, they can't do that.\u000a\u000a"I think at the most fundamental level, that's most important," she said.

aVStory highlights Jennifer Miller: Louise Linton's Instagram comment shows she is out of touch with the Americans she claims to sacrifice for\u000a\u000aAs the wife of a public servant, it would behoove Linton to be sensitive to the struggles of everyday Americans, she writes.\u000a\u000aJennifer Miller is the mother of three boys. She graduated from the University of Oregon in 1994 and earned an MBA in 2003. Miller has a full-time career as a health care product manager and volunteers with her sons' Boy Scout troop. The views expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) My friends and family will tell you that I have a big heart and am very caring, but that I'm also snarky and unafraid to call things like I see them. I did that to Louise Linton on Instagram the other day, referring to her post about her designer labels as "deplorable."\u000a\u000aI stand by that sentiment. To see someone in her position -- married to a wealthy former Wall Street executive who is now secretary of the treasury and affects national economic policy -- hashtag her luxury purchases when so many Americans are suffering economically is, well, deplorable.\u000a\u000aJennifer Miller\u000a\u000aShe chose to respond in a way that only clarified her privilege by extolling her wealth and position. In a follow-up post on Instagram, she said I was out of touch, which I find incredibly laughable. I don't think she has any idea what everyday Americans deal with, especially when it comes to economic struggles. Since her husband is secretary of the treasury, it behooves her to find out.\u000a\u000aAnd while she has since apologized for her insensitive post, nothing she says now can negate the fact that her initial response to my frustration was to continue bragging about her wealth and to allege that her contributions to society have been more significant than mine.\u000a\u000aAmericans are hurting -- some even dying -- as they struggle with racism, poverty and health care costs. And yet the wealthy Linton defends her boasting and derides me, a hardworking, taxpaying American, in the process. Her husband serves in the executive branch of our government. At the very least, she owes the American people the appearance of compassion and, to use her own word, humanity.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVFew places in the world have felt the pain of low oil prices like Saudi Arabia.\u000a\u000aCuts to the bloated public sector have changed the economic prospects for many Saudis. But one local industry is emerging as a winner from the oil bust.\u000a\u000aThe oil crunch is proving a "blessing in disguise" for the country's young tech sector, said Abdulrahman Tarabzouni, a former regional manager for Google (GOOGL, Tech30).\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia is pumping tens of billions of dollars into technology in an attempt to diversify its economy and become less reliant on volatile oil prices.\u000a\u000a"Any individual has a shot now at creating something extremely valuable and accessible to the rest of the world," Tarabzouni told young entrepreneurs and business leaders at a recent forum in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\u000a\u000aMany local and national governments dream of imitating Silicon Valley's success, but the Saudis at least have the cash to make a serious attempt.\u000a\u000aThe kingdom's sovereign wealth fund has already announced plans to pour $45 billion into a tech fund with Japan's Softbank (SFTBF). In June, the Saudi fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia has also set up tech incubators and established venture capital funds with headquarters in Riyadh and offices in Menlo Park, California. Among them is Riyadh Taqnia Capital, which has committed to investing over $100 million in local tech firms.\u000a\u000aRelated: Saudi Arabia and Burj Khalifa developer launch Gulf answer to Amazon\u000a\u000aAmerican tech investor Christopher Schroeder said that what he sees happening in Saudi Arabia represents a deeper entrepreneurial streak running through the Middle East.\u000a\u000a"There are remarkable surprises," he said at the forum. "Over 25% of these startups are run by women. Some of the hardest working entrepreneurs I've met are women -- across the Arab world.\u000a\u000aFemale entrepreneurs are seizing the opportunity to assert themselves in Saudi Arabia's male-dominated culture.\u000a\u000aLateefa Alwaalan, CEO and founder of Yatooq, a startup disrupting the Arabic coffee market with hardware which cuts the time it takes to prepare a drink, says the restrictions on women - especially the Saudi ban on driving -- means being extra creative to help each other.\u000a\u000a"I knew I wanted to hire women. So when I was looking for factories, instead of looking on the outskirts, I got space inside the city so transportation would be easier for them," says the Seattle-educated Alwaalan. "I also include the cost of a driver in their salary."\u000a\u000aSilicon Valley entrepreneurs are watching closely. Jeff Martin helped developed iTunes and is now CEO of Tribal Planet. A frequent visitor to the Gulf countries, he believes governments in the region are paving the way for innovation by digitizing services for citizens.\u000a\u000aRelated: Saudis believe Trump will unleash America's economy\u000a\u000a"In the Gulf countries, and Saudi [Arabia] especially, the notion that citizens are consumers and consumer are citizens, is what I see governments here doing much more intelligently than in other parts of the world," he said.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia's leading entrepreneurs say their biggest challenge is finding talent. And the sector will have to live in the shadow of oil for a while longer.\u000a\u000a"My biggest [challenge] is still getting people to work for a startup instead of the big Saudi brands like [oil giant] Aramco," said Salman AlSuhaibani, CEO and founder of roadside assistance app Morni.

aV(CNN) Every 66 seconds this year, an American will develop Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association annual report , released Tuesday.\u000a\u000aBy the year 2050, that number is expected to double to one every 33 seconds.\u000a\u000aThose startling statistics are mirrored worldwide. In 2016, the World Alzheimer's Report estimated that 47 million people around the globe had dementia. To put that in perspective, it's a bit more than the current population of Spain.\u000a\u000aAnd because nine of 10 people with dementia in low- and middle-income countries and half of those in high-income countries are not diagnosed, the global number of people diagnosed is expected to triple by 2050.\u000a\u000a"What is driving these numbers is that there is no disease modifying treatment, no prevention and no cure," said Ruth Drew, director of family and information services for the Alzheimer's Association . "And while U.S. deaths from Alzheimer's have doubled in the last 15 years, an increase of 89%, deaths from other major diseases have been declining."\u000a\u000aFor example, said Drew, deaths from heart disease, the No. 1 killer of Americans, have declined by 14% over the same period while HIV deaths have dropped by 54%, stroke deaths by 21% and prostate cancer deaths by 9%.\u000a\u000a"Other diseases have declined because of significant investments in research that produce treatments and techniques to reduce risk, sometimes even a cure," Drew said.\u000a\u000a"The issue is mainly funding," agreed Rudy Tanzi , a Harvard professor of neurology who also heads up MassGeneral's Genetics and Aging Research Unit. "We are a knowledge-rich yet budget-constrained field. We have many clues about how to stop Alzheimer's, especially from recent genetic studies, but insufficient funds to explore how."\u000a\u000aThe cost to society\u000a\u000aExperts point out that without additional funding and a breakthrough, Alzheimer's could be the disease that breaks the nation's health care bank. In 2017, for the first time, total costs for caring for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias hit $259 billion -- over a quarter of a trillion dollars.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Toll of Alzheimer's Caregiving: Sandy's Story Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toll of Alzheimer's Caregiving: Sandy's Story 03:20\u000a\u000a"Already, Alzheimer's consumes one in every five Medicare/Medicaid dollars," Tanzi said. "With 71 million baby boomers headed toward risk age, this will go to one in three, perhaps in the next decade, at which point Alzheimer's will single-handedly collapse Medicare/Medicaid."\u000a\u000a"It will also impact the work force and our economy," Drew added. "Because every family affected will be making caregiving choices they will have at home. They will be absent more for doctor visits ... and other caregiving duties."\u000a\u000aThere's more. The association's report adds another startling statistic, the hidden cost of caregiving: In 2016, those who took care of loved ones with dementia provided an "estimated 18.2 billion hours of unpaid assistance, a contribution to the nation valued at $230.1 billion."\u000a\u000aAnd that's just the monetary impact of caregiving. Experts say no one can put a number on the emotional and health impact of caring for a loved one with dementia.\u000a\u000a"Alzheimer's is like a leaky boat in a hurricane," said Huntington Potter, director of the Rocky Mountain Alzheimer's Disease Center . "We have to both bail like mad and fix the leaks. Researchers are working hard to fix the leaks, but it will take time; for now, the main load is carried by the bailing caregivers. They are on the front lines in this war against Alzheimer's."\u000a\u000aToll of caregiving\u000a\u000aKristen Beatty is one of those fighting on the front lines. She and her brother, Doug Rider, are caring for their 78-year-old father, Ray, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about 10 years ago.\u000a\u000aRay and Susan Marie Rider at daughter Kristen's wedding in 2004.\u000a\u000a"My father was a lifer in the Air Force, a colonel, a fighter pilot and a Vietnam veteran," Beatty said. "My mom, Sue, was a proper military wife, and between them, they had a 'don't ask, don't tell' attitude about informing us kids about his illness."\u000a\u000aIt wasn't until they took over their dad's care that they learned just what their mother had been going through.\u000a\u000a"He developed a sense of paranoia and thought people were stealing from him and believed everyone was out to get him," Beatty said. "He would go to bed early but then get up and was up all night long, arguing with mom.\u000a\u000a"They would have conversations and arguments over and over again. She wasn't getting any sleep. She was exhausted with the constant care and pressure. But she never once complained. She didn't want us to be scared."\u000a\u000aBut in 2012, after five years of caregiving, Sue Rider dropped dead of a heart attack.\u000a\u000a"We say that she died of a broken heart," Beatty said. "Died from the stress of caring for him. She was eating super healthy, walking every day, taking very good care of herself. So I truly believe it was the stress.\u000a\u000a"It's awful, just awful," she said with a catch in her voice. "My brother and I feel so guilty, because we could have supported her, but she would not ask for help; she would not consider moving him into a facility; she would not go to support groups."\u000a\u000aDoug Rider with dad Ray, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 10 years ago.\u000a\u000aToday, Beatty works with the Alzheimer's Association to call attention to the burden of caregiving. She points people to the resources available to them online and stresses that no one should feel as if they are alone.\u000a\u000a"My mom was the glue of the family, a genuine sweet and amazing soul. It's painful, really painful. What I do today is all powered by supporting her, so that it wasn't in vain," Beatty said. "We collectively as a nation need to step up, because Alzheimer's is an epidemic, and our health care system is not set up to support caregivers."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe cost of Alzheimer's, including caregiving, is a reality that will soon affect everyone, say experts.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people think that 'Alzheimer's doesn't affect me because I'm not old' or 'I don't have it in my family, so it's really not my problem,' " Drew said. "What we've come to understand is, if you have a brain, you're at risk for Alzheimer's disease."\u000a\u000a"If we all live to age 85 -- and who doesn't hope to live at least that long? -- almost half of us will have Alzheimer's disease," Potter said, "and the other half will be caregivers. No one is immune."

He asked Susan for the names of the doctors who had treated her over the past eight years.\u000a\u000aSusan went through Hope's drawers and cabinets. Empty.\u000a\u000a"There had to be another explanation for why I couldn't find this stuff," Susan told CNN. Her family's story was first reported by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\u000a\u000aShe asked Hope's then-husband, Fabian, for their insurance information to check the medical claims.\u000a\u000a"I couldn't find charges on Hope. I'm not seeing CAT scans. I'm not seeing MRIs. I'm not seeing oncology visits," Susan said.\u000a\u000a"That was the moment our whole lives changed."\u000a\u000aQuestioning everything\u000a\u000aThe next day, she went to the hospital early to meet with Hope's doctor. She had a hunch about what was going on.\u000a\u000a"I believe she may have Munchausen's," Susan told the doctor.\u000a\u000aHope threw elaborate parties when she claimed to have beaten cancer. One involved skydiving.\u000a\u000aPeople with Munchausen syndrome will fake illnesses or make themselves sick to get medical care and capture the sympathy of others. They invent their illnesses to seek attention, not for financial or material gain.\u000a\u000aWhen Susan confronted her daughter in the hospital, Hope nodded in confession.\u000a\u000a"I was aware of the disorder; I'd just never seen it," Susan said.\u000a\u000aThe past eight years had been a lie. The parties they threw after Hope beat cancer, the balloons and the band, were all lies. The tattoo across Hope's back -- the wings she'd earned -- was a lie.\u000a\u000aSusan wondered what else had been a lie.\u000a\u000a"You really start to question everything you've been told. Every single thing you've been told," Susan said. "That includes medical conditions that surrounded my grandchildren. Then you start to wonder if any of that's true, too."\u000a\u000aAnother revelation\u000a\u000aBy that time, Hope and Fabian's youngest daughter had been treated for cystic fibrosis for about four years. Early photos show a smiling, cheerful girl with tubes of oxygen under her nose. Her parents adored her.\u000a\u000aHope's youngest daughter was treated for cystic fibrosis for years.\u000a\u000aCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that thickens mucus in the lungs and other organs. It can lead to breathing problems, infections and, ultimately, an early death.\u000a\u000aHope had been an active participant in cystic fibrosis message boards, Susan said. She was on committees at the hospital and took part in fundraising campaigns. To some, she was a paragon of devoted motherhood.\u000a\u000aAfter Hope's own battle with cancer unraveled, her daughter was brought in to be retested for cystic fibrosis. The test measures the amount of chloride in the sweat, which is abnormal in people with the disease.\u000a\u000aDuring the test, Hope tried to interfere. She began tampering with the bandage, but a nurse and a child life specialist blocked her, according to investigator Michael Weber with the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, who took on Hope's case.\u000a\u000aThe test came back negative. Hope's daughter did not have cystic fibrosis.\u000a\u000aWeber interviewed the child life specialist who was there. She had accompanied Hope and her daughter to a number of procedures, and "Hope had never cried." But that day, she cried.\u000a\u000a"The child life specialist felt that the tears Hope were crying was for herself," Weber said.\u000a\u000aPlaying the part\u000a\u000aWhat Hope did goes by several names, the most common being Munchausen syndrome by proxy or medical child abuse. Many experts use them interchangeably, toeing a controversial line between a psychiatric diagnosis and an act of premeditated violence.\u000a\u000aMunchausen by proxy parents will fake, exaggerate or even cause illnesses in their children. Children, often very young, will typically come to a doctor with a laundry list of medical problems that involve many organs.\u000a\u000aInvestigators found that Hope infected her daughter with harmful bacteria, which she obtained through her job in a laboratory. They also suspected that Hope removed blood from her daughter so that she would become anemic. On one occasion, Hope's false medical history led doctors to give her daughter an anemia treatment, which sent her into anaphylactic shock, Weber said. Doctors were able to stabilize her.\u000a\u000a"These moms are desperate to maintain their role as the desperate, knowledgeable parent," said Catherine Ayoub , a forensic psychologist at Harvard Medical School.\u000a\u000aAyoub has worked on cases similar to Hope's, and she has trained law enforcement to identify the patterns of what she calls "disorders of deception."\u000a\u000a"It's not a psychiatric disorder," said Dr. Jayme Coffman , a child abuse pediatrician at Cook Children's Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. Coffman was involved in evaluating Hope's case.\u000a\u000a"They're not crazy. They know what they're doing," she said. "And we don't accept that from any other type of abuse, so why do we want to excuse it?"\u000a\u000aThe American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual does, however, include a diagnosis of "factitious disorder imposed on another." There is little consensus on how to characterize it, with both mental health and pediatric doctors laying claim to the diagnosis.\u000a\u000aSome parents keep up the act for years, hopping from one doctor to another and extensively researching diseases to convince doctors and family members that their child is truly sick. It used to be that many of the parents had some sort of medical knowledge or even worked in the medical field, Coffman said.\u000a\u000a"But what we're finding now, because of the internet, is they really don't have to have as much prior medical training ... to fabricate those symptoms," she said.\u000a\u000aThe internet -- and social media in particular -- has also given perpetrators a new outlet for seeking attention and validation, experts say. Some stories have even caught the eye of celebrities, who visit what they believe to be a terminally ill child.\u000a\u000aNearly all known perpetrators are women -- moms like Hope. And many have fabricated their own illnesses, Ayoub said, just like Hope.\u000a\u000aBut few confess like she did.\u000a\u000aA jaundiced eye\u000a\u000a"I lied about that to get attention," Hope told CNN, wearing a white jumpsuit in the visitation area of a women's prison in Gatesville, Texas, where she has been since 2010 after pleading guilty to child abuse charges. Her children now live with her ex-husband.\u000a\u000aHope claims that she has a hard time remembering what she did to her family. "Some of it, I'm sure, I've blocked out," she said. She also claims that a diabetic coma was partly responsible for her foggy recollection.\u000a\u000aThis is a pattern among mothers who confess, said Dr. Marc Feldman , a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa, a way of admitting what they did without fully admitting their guilt.\u000a\u000a"It clashes with everything that we think we know about motherhood," Feldman said. "It's not just wrong to medically abuse a child, but it's immoral.\u000a\u000a"I have to admit I approach those kinds of confessions with a jaundiced eye."\u000a\u000aA lot of planning goes into duping doctors and keeping a child sick, Feldman said. Some moms have been caught checking hospital rooms for cameras or looking through doorways to make sure nobody was coming, he added.\u000a\u000a"It's hard to believe that they lapsed into some unknowing state of being," he said.\u000a\u000aStill, confessions are exceedingly rare. Ayoub has seen fewer confessions in her career than she can count on one hand, she said. Many mothers continue to deceive.\u000a\u000aDespite her confession, Hope said, she still lies about "all kinds of stuff." She claims to be deaf, even though she responds to questions when she can't see the speaker's lips.\u000a\u000a"Sure, I've lied today," Hope said. "You shouldn't believe anything I'm saying."\u000a\u000aHope, who pled guilty to charges of child abuse, had three children with her ex-husband.\u000a\u000aShadow of a doubt\u000a\u000aIt is difficult to say how common -- or uncommon -- Munchausen by proxy is. How it gets reported varies from place to place, and some cases are lumped in with other forms of child abuse, according to Maxine Eichner , a law professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has researched medical child abuse from a legal perspective.\u000a\u000aEichner has written about how she believes the diagnosis of medical child abuse may mistake some parents of medically complex children for abusive parents. Eichner herself has been accused by a doctor of "overmedicalizing" her own daughter, who had a constellation of symptoms that for years doctors couldn't diagnose, she said. She was not accused of Munchausen by proxy behavior.\u000a\u000a"We had an eight-year journey to get my daughter diagnosed" with mitochondrial disease , a type of rare disease that can cause a variety of puzzling symptoms.\u000a\u000aHad she and her husband not been well-known lawyers in their community, she said, she wonders whether someone might have made an accusation of Munchausen by proxy. Through rare disease advocacy organizations, she has contacted similar parents who had faced those accusations.\u000a\u000a"The folks that I have talked to -- and I have talked to many -- tell similar stories, but with different endings than us," Eichner said. "I went through this period of time when I woke up thinking about them.\u000a\u000a"Nobody disputes that this kind of behavior occurs," she said, but without more research on the Munchausen diagnoses, it's difficult to know how often Munchausen is misdiagnosed, as well.\u000a\u000aFeldman has pored over countless pages of medical records before testifying in cases -- some in which he believed abuse had occurred and some in which he believed the mother had been falsely accused. Still, he believes the latter happens very rarely.\u000a\u000a"Like a jigsaw puzzle, it all comes together," Feldman said, adding that he spends a great deal of time on each case he takes. He said this may differ from doctors, like some pediatricians or emergency physicians, whose duty it is to report something suspicious to child protective services, which the doctors may or may not have time to thoroughly investigate.\u000a\u000aHope claimed that she had stage 4 cancer, but her family found no evidence that that had ever happened.\u000a\u000a"It's one of those diseases du jour," Feldman said. "Some people get overexcited when they encounter it."\u000a\u000aEven so, he said, the idea of false positives is "overstated."\u000a\u000a"You don't want to falsely accuse somebody," Coffman said. "We do have parents that are just super anxious, who come in for every sniffle.\u000a\u000a"They're not fabricating symptoms in their child or lying about the symptoms. They're just very anxious parents," she added. "That's just a parent that needs more support and education."\u000a\u000aAyoub said that spotting Munchausen by proxy is not a matter of spotting a rare disease or a set of symptoms; it's about looking for a pattern.\u000a\u000aHope's pattern began, but didn't end, with herself: the appointments she wouldn't let Susan accompany her to, the hair and eyebrows she shaved when she told her family she was getting chemo, the tubes that delivered medicine, food and oxygen to her youngest child.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We still question things from our past as to what was real and what was not real," Susan said. "Not just the cancer. Other things.\u000a\u000a"We have thousands of questions. The only person that could answer those is Hope."\u000a\u000aHope will be released from prison in October 2019. She said the first thing she'll do is try to make peace with her parents, who haven't visited her in years.\u000a\u000aThen, she'll try to find her children.

aV(CNN) Canada is facing an "unprecedented" number of asylum seekers, who have crossed the border from the United States, officials said.\u000a\u000a"We've never seen those numbers," said Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) spokesman Claude Castonguay. "Even though our officers are patrolling 24 hours a day all year long, we've never seen such numbers coming in."\u000a\u000aRCMP intercepted almost 7,000 asylums seekers in the last six weeks in Quebec.\u000a\u000aOfficials stressed that the influx can be handled and at no time has the security of the country been compromised.\u000a\u000aBut they cautioned that while Canada remains an open, welcoming country, crossing into it is not "a ticket for permanent residence."\u000a\u000a"Coming to Canada, asking for asylum in Canada is not a guarantee for permanent residence in Canada," said Louis Dumas, spokesman for the immigration ministry in a Thursday press conference.\u000a\u000aAbout 80 to 85% of the asylum seekers are of Haitian descent, according to RCMP.\u000a\u000aThe number of people intercepted in Quebec has soared in recent months from 781 in June and 2,996 in July to 3,800 as of August 15, according to RCMP.\u000a\u000aDispelling misleading information\u000a\u000aOfficials also tried to clear up misinformation spreading through social media and WhatsApp that claimed Canada is inviting people to claim asylum, reported CNN's partner CBC.\u000a\u000a"It is not a message from the government of Canada," Dumas said. "Strict processes are in place for all people claiming asylum, regardless of how they enter into Canada."\u000a\u000aHe said 50% of Haitians who requested asylum in 2016 had their claims rejected.\u000a\u000a"It is unfortunate that these very vulnerable people were convinced that admission as a refugee in Canada and here in Quebec would be simple, even automatic. That's not the case at all. There is no guarantee that asylum applications will be accepted, given the strict rules that govern them."\u000a\u000aWhy Haitians are leaving the US\u000a\u000aMany Haitians have headed to Canada over concerns that they'll lose their temporary protected status or TPS, in the US.\u000a\u000aShortly after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the Obama administration granted Haitian immigrants -- who had already been living in the US -- with temporary protected status.\u000a\u000aThe program allowed them to work and shielded them from deportation. It also provided them temporary refuge considering that Haiti had suffered one of the deadliest earthquakes in history, and the country was seen as too unstable for people to return.\u000a\u000aThe program had since been repeatedly renewed. But earlier this year, Department of Homeland Security officials said conditions in Haiti were improving since the earthquake -- and that the program could be terminated next year.\u000a\u000aDHS officials urged Haitian recipients to prepare for the program's potential expiration in January 2018.\u000a\u000aThis has sent a wave of Haitians across the northern border. Many of them have expressed concerns they'll be deported if they stay in the US.\u000a\u000aBut Canada ended its version of a program that was similar to the TPS for Haitians last year, the CBC reported. This means Haitians without status can be deported from Canada.\u000a\u000aMany asylum seekers have headed for Quebec where Montreal has a large Haitian community.\u000a\u000aAmid the influx, asylum seekers are being sheltered at Olympic Stadium, where Montreal had hosted the summer games in 1976.\u000a\u000aTaking their chances\u000a\u000aExperts have cautioned that it's not so easy to meet government requirements under Canadian asylum laws. They have said the fear of deportation from the United States isn't enough to make an asylum case in Canada. The process of making a case through the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada can take months and end in rejection.\u000a\u000aBut hundreds of people are taking their chances.\u000a\u000aIn the border town of Champlain, New York, taxis arrive continuously as asylum seekers haul their belongings and help their children cross into Canada.\u000a\u000aJust footsteps away, the Canadian Border Services Agency have sent up tents where officers process the new arrivals, reported CNN affiliate WPTZ . The number of people arriving has created a bottleneck at the border with more than 1,000 people waiting to be processed, according to the RCMP.

aV(CNN) Radhika Kami lives with her family of six in a traditional mud-and-brick house in a rural village in Nepal's Kanchanpur district -- for most of the year.\u000a\u000aFor about five days each month, the 16-year-old is banished to a hut -- a windowless, ramshackle shed with a small door and poor sanitation and ventilation -- and is forbidden from touching other people, cattle, any fruits and vegetables that are growing, even books.\u000a\u000aIt is known as a menstruation hut, and Radhika must go there each time she has her period.\u000a\u000aThe family practices Chhaupadi, a centuries-old custom in the remote west of Nepal in which women, considered "impure" during menstruation, are sequestered for the extent of their periods.\u000a\u000a"I feel bad that I have to go sleep (in a separate hut) every month, but what can I do?" Radhika asked.\u000a\u000aShe is not even allowed to use the family toilet during menstruation, instead making a trip to a nearby river.\u000a\u000aBut she hopes this won't have to happen for much longer.\u000a\u000aOn August 9, Nepal's Parliament passed a bill that would criminalize the banishment of women during menstruation. Once the bill goes into effect, set for August 2018, anyone who forces a woman into a menstrual hut will be sentenced to three months in prison or fined US $30.\u000a\u000aSarswati Biswokarma, 13, sits inside a "Chhaupadi house" in the village of Achham.\u000a\u000a'It closes the door for us'\u000a\u000aAdvocates of the ban believe, however, that the real challenge will be enforcing it. If girls like Radhika continue to practice Chhaupadi or if they are forced to practice it by senior members of their family, will they report it to authorities?\u000a\u000a"Yes, criminalizing it validates the fact that the government of Nepal thinks it is a criminal offense, but it does not in any way ensure that people will stop doing it," said Pema Lakhi of the Nepal Fertility Care Center, one of the country's leading menstrual hygiene activists.\u000a\u000aMenstrual Hygiene activist Pema Lakhi interacting with a group of local women in Achham district of Nepal.\u000a\u000aActivists have long pressured lawmakers for a law to punish those who force women to practice Chhaupadi, a ritual rooted in Hindu taboos about menstruation. But campaigners beliepve that more awareness programs are needed to change behavior and mindsets, and they are not convinced that the law alone will solve the problem.\u000a\u000aLakhi is also concerned that criminalization will make people stop talking about the issue and may be counterproductive to the work she and other activists do.\u000a\u000a"We are currently working to destigmatize menstruation. ... We talk to girls about Chhaupadi and why they practice it. (Now) they are not going to come up and say 'yes, I (practice) Chhaupadi,' " Lakhi said. "It closes the door for us to actually understand strategic approaches."\u000a\u000aThrough conversations with women and girls who practice the tradition, Lakhi and her colleagues say, they have learned that many do it because they want to. "In many cases, the ritual is passed on the generation and not necessarily enforced," she said.\u000a\u000aAmar Sunar, a human rights and menstrual rights activist based in western Nepal's Dailekh district, is "delighted" that a law will punish Chhaupadi enforcers.\u000a\u000aAmar Sunar, a human rights activist in Nepal, is excited about the new law.\u000a\u000aSunar tried to file a police report in July after the death of 19-year-old Tulasi Shahi , who died from a snake bite while taking part in the Chhaupadi ritual. His case was against the girl's parents, but police refused to accept it because there was no law criminalizing the practice, he said.\u000a\u000a"Now, this law is going to make it easier for us to legally fight against the perpetrators," Sunar said.\u000a\u000aChallenges on the ground\u000a\u000aBut Sunar adds that he is not very optimistic about immediate change in the villages themselves.\u000a\u000a"People may demolish the menstrual huts, but then they will send the girls to some dark unused corners of the house during their menstrual period ... which would be difficult for authorities to monitor," he argued. "Laws don't change attitude."\u000a\u000aUnder Chhaupadi, women who are menstruating are not allowed to touch growing things.\u000a\u000aSome residents of these rural regions are not happy with the ruling, especially those who believe that violating the practice means angering the god or goddess and could bring bad luck to their homes.\u000a\u000a"This is absolute high-handedness. Government should have advocated for a safer way to practice Chhaupadi instead," said 69-year-old Laxman Shahi, who lives in a village in the Dailekh district.\u000a\u000aShahi says she will abide by the law but argues that the government is showing no respect for longstanding culture and tradition. "Will the government be responsible if our village is cursed with bad luck?" she asked.\u000a\u000aSunar thinks targeting religious leaders could be crucial to change attitudes among local residents. "What the government should also do is run awareness programs targeting local religious leaders and shamans. They are the ones promoting these superstitions in villages," he said.\u000a\u000aThe need for action\u000a\u000aThe parliamentary decision comes after several high-profile deaths.\u000a\u000aIn addition Tulasi Shahi's case in July, in the same district in May, 14-year-old Lalsara Bika died from a severe cold-related illness contracted during her time in isolation.\u000a\u000aLate last year, two girls lost their lives in similar circumstances in nearby Achham district.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aKrishna Bhakta Pokhrel, a Nepali lawmaker, said that while the issue of menstrual exile in huts is extreme in the rural areas of Nepal, there are also milder cases in big cities such as Kathmandu, the capital, where women may be restricted from entering certain rooms in the house during menstruation or even restricted from eating in some spaces within their homes. In many cases, women are also barred from entering kitchens and temples or attending religious function while on their period.\u000a\u000a"This (law) also puts psychological pressure on women, so we are trying to change the mentality of our society at every level by legally criminalizing these social crimes," said Pokhrel, who was part of the committee that drafted the bill.\u000a\u000aThough there is a long road ahead, Pokhrel believes that the bill is a step in the right direction.\u000a\u000a"The ruling is good, but what entails is the implementation of the ruling, in terms of what is the strategy that is going to be taken up in letting people know what it is," he said.

aV(CNN) The end is coming. A marvel of this sporting age is one championship away from retirement, 30 seconds or so from consigning himself to history.\u000a\u000aThe age of Usain Bolt is nearly over and so the present must be cherished.\u000a\u000aBolt, the fastest man in history, one of the greatest sportsmen to have ever lived, will run his last race at the World Athletics Championships in London.\u000a\u000aHe will retire having left his mark on history: the first man to win three 100m Olympic titles, the world record holder in both the 100m and 200m, a winner of 23 major gold medals.\u000a\u000aUsain Bolt of Jamaica salutes the crowd after winning 100m "Salute to a Legend " race during the Racers Grand Prix at the national stadium in Kingston\u000a\u000aHis legacy is assured. No man has run with such speed or enjoyed such longevity. The 30-year-old's extraordinary achievements will be looked back upon with wonder by future generations.\u000a\u000aThey will watch replays of the young Bolt of Beijing, hushing the crowd on the starting blocks before bang... history -- his arms raised, thumping his chest, clocking a barely believable 9.69 seconds to shatter the 100m world record.\u000a\u000aThe 21-year-old's speed was jaw-dropping, the other eight men in a distinguished field left trailing in his wake.\u000a\u000aThey were in a different race and this 6ft 5in newcomer was from another planet.\u000a\u000aTwo more gold medals followed on the Chinese capital's lightning-quick track, his 2008 coronation as sprint king complete.\u000a\u000aHearts and imaginations were captured and he has been loved ever since.\u000a\u000aBolt wins the 100m Olympic gold in Beijing\u000a\u000aThe irreplaceable joker-in-chief\u000a\u000aThere have been so many glorious moments.\u000a\u000aBerlin in 2009, when the Jamaican reduced his 100m and 200m world records further; London 2012 when all three of his Olympic sprint titles were retained.\u000a\u000aBack to Beijing in 2015, older, ailing, but managing to fend off the challenge of twice-banned Justin Gatlin to retain his grip on 100m and 200m world titles.\u000a\u000aThen there was Rio last summer, his Olympic farewell ending in further triumph.\u000a\u000aThose who will live in a Bolt-less sporting age will wish they had been there, just as we all want to be inside London's Olympic Stadium on Saturday when the history-maker lines up in the 100m final for his last competitive individual race.\u000a\u000aThe 4x100m relay on August 12 is likely to be his grand encore. The final act of this gilded athletic tale.\u000a\u000aThere is little point asking who will take over once he is gone. No-one can clown around on the start line and execute excellence like track and field's joker-in-chief.\u000a\u000aAs the eight-time Olympic champion himself said this week, it will take more than one athlete to fill his vibrant void.\u000a\u000aSavor him now because Bolt is irreplaceable.\u000a\u000aBolt of Jamaica celebrates winning the Men's 4 x 100m relay at the Rio Olympics\u000a\u000a"It's a simple formula that doesn't actually work," says Michael Johnson, whose 200m world record was thought unbreakable until Bolt broke it ... twice.\u000a\u000aWe asked him how his sport will cope without its showman.\u000a\u000a"The idea that you have an athlete who's the best there's ever been in the sport, who just happens to have an electric personality as well," explains Johnson, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, "you're not going to replace that.\u000a\u000a"That's not going to come around again. It would be ridiculous to look for it and, I think, the sport has made a mistake by relying on that for the last eight years because he was never going to last forever."\u000a\u000aBecoming a legend\u000a\u000aHoping that the show would go on and on is perhaps forgivable. It is easy to forget that even the seemingly superhuman age, just like the rest of us, no matter how effortless and enjoyable they make winning seem.\u000a\u000aA showman supreme, a magnetic personality, he has been likened to Muhammad Ali, though he has stayed away from politics.\u000a\u000aHe has continued to compete because he knew only sustained success would see him ranked alongside the three-time heavyweight champion and Pele, regarded as the greatest footballer of all time.\u000a\u000aHe wanted to be "among the greatest," he said before going on to achieve an unprecedented "triple-triple" of Olympic sprint golds in Rio, though he has lost the 4x100m relay gold he won in Beijing as a result of team-mate Nesta Carter's positive doping test.\u000a\u000a"I am a legend," Bolt has said a number of times, after winning three golds in London, and again in Rio.\u000a\u000aIt would be braggadocio from anyone else but, as he himself has explained, he has proved himself to be the best for nearly a decade.\u000a\u000a"I feel that if you have done something, it is not bragging," he has said.\u000a\u000aBut even Ali, like most in life, had to comeback from lows. It added to his legend. Bolt, however, has excelled at major championships no matter what his form or fitness. His only failure was a false start in the 2011 World Championships 100m final.\u000a\u000aYes, he has slowed over the years and the frequency of injuries have increased. At times, the country boy who began racing to buy his mother a washing machine has also struggled for motivation after achieving more than he ever dreamed.\u000a\u000aBut even Bolt beyond his peak has always managed to be better than the rest.\u000a\u000aThe iconic image of Bolt while competing in the men's 100m in Rio\u000a\u000a"He's just a phenomenally talented athlete," says Johnson.\u000a\u000a"He's absolutely been tested. I don't think that you could discount anything that he's done over the years. Some of the fastest times in the 100m and 200m have come about during his career."\u000a\u000a'You have blessed us with Usain Bolt'\u000a\u000aBolt salutes the crowd after running his final race in Jamaica\u000a\u000aThe sprint freak from a remote Jamaican village has already said his goodbyes to his own; a five-hour farewell in the national stadium in Kingston, a celebration which started with prayers from an ordained minister.\u000a\u000a"We thank you God, for you have truly been good to Jamaica," it began. "You have blessed us with doctor, the honorable Usain St Leo Bolt, the embodiment of sportsmanship, who remind us of the gumption and indomitable spirit of the Jamaican people."\u000a\u000aThirty-five thousand people watched their most famous son run his 84th and last race on home soil. Bolt, so those on the inside say, would have preferred for that to have been his farewell.\u000a\u000aHe is most comfortable at home, living as ordinary a life as a millionaire superstar can. He trains in a public gym, dances in nightclubs. There is no need for private security.\u000a\u000aIt is when he steps onto foreign soil that people become agog by his presence, which means life on the road is mostly spent in hotels.\u000a\u000a"In Jamaica you take it for granted that you can see him every day," says Colin Reid, a photographer who has followed Bolt's career with the Jamaican Observer.\u000a\u000a"In the international fraternity, they're awestruck. But he's just like one of us. He lives in Kingston. He's approachable, he's amiable, I see him around a lot."\u000a\u000aWhat you see is what you get, says Reid, something Bolt has also repeated in numerous reports. He enjoys partying, he is still the boy a teacher once described as being full of "tricks and stories."\u000a\u000aBolt the thinker, the intellectual\u000a\u000aHidden behind the tomfoolery on the track, however, is a thoughtfulness, a keen athletics brain and an intense competitive streak.\u000a\u000aHe is a smiling assassin. His desire to be the best is such that he no longer plays Call of Duty as he cannot cope with not being as good as he used to be.\u000a\u000a"He's much different when he's in a much closer setting," says Johnson.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, I don't think the world has been able to see that he is very thoughtful, highly intellectual about athletics, about sprinting.\u000a\u000a"Most people think that he goes out there and that it's easy and he doesn't really care if he wins or loses, that he's just having fun."\u000a\u000aBolt has said he allowed a film crew to follow him in the year leading up to Rio for the movie "I Am Bolt" so people could see how hard he worked; vomit-inducing track sessions, suffering in the gym, early-morning wake-up calls.\u000a\u000aEd Moses, a two-time Olympic champion who dominated the 400m hurdles in a 122-race unbeaten decade, calls Bolt a mathematician, though when later asked his agent Ricky Simms admits he has never heard his client described as such.\u000a\u000a"He's an intellectual guy," says Moses.\u000a\u000a"He's thought a lot about what it's going to take to get him through the first 40m. He had the tools and resources to put it together and that's why he's great."\u000a\u000aUnlike many of history's great talents, Bolt has been appreciated in his own time. For nearly a decade he has radiated in a sport darkened by doping.\u000a\u000aNine of the 30 fastest 100m times, including the top four, are Bolt's. The other 21 marks on that list have been run by athletes who have, at some point, tested positive for doping.\u000a\u000aQuestions have been raised about Bolt, especially when he first emerged in Beijing. After all, athletes as tall as him are not supposed to run that fast, but the man himself is not bothered by such talk.\u000a\u000aHe is different, a speedster whose long levers allow him to cover the 100m in just 41 strides when others need a few steps more and a little more time.\u000a\u000aAnd so, in under 30 seconds, or 132 steps, Bolt's career will be over. He will be out of sight, as he has been to his competitors for most of his career.\u000a\u000aThere will be no fooling around, no celebratory "To Da World," no electrifying nights under the floodlights.\u000a\u000aIt will never be the same again.

aV(CNN) With the June arrival of their twins , actor George Clooney, 55, and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, 39, reignited a conversation about what it means to be an older dad.\u000a\u000aDespite growing awareness of in-vitro fertilization and aging mothers -- such as Janet Jackson, who gave birth in January at 50 -- some of the science and social impacts of aging fathers are less clear. But that isn't deterring hopeful dads from growing their families.\u000a\u000a"It's very well-documented: Men are having children later into life," said Dr. Mary Samplaski , a male-fertility specialist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California. "It's become so much more mainstream."\u000a\u000aMen's fertility does not drop as sharply as women's as they age, said Samplaski; many can have biological children long after they're old and gray without the need for technology to intervene. But some of Samplaski's patients have questions about the risks of fathering later in life.\u000a\u000aIVF success and struggle\u000a\u000aOne risk for older would-be dads is the potential success of in vitro fertilization, a medical procedure where the woman's egg is fertilized by a man's sperm in a test tube and then introduced into her womb.\u000a\u000aAmong couples requiring IVF to conceive a baby, the likelihood of a live birth is reduced with a father's increasing age, according to a new study presented at a medical conference recently. This is the first study to show that the father's age is a factor in IVF success.\u000a\u000aHarvard researchers analyzed nearly 19,000 IVF cycles performed for 7,753 couples at a Boston area reproductive center between 2000 and 2014. After stratifying the female and male participants into age groups, they compared the ages to successful births.\u000a\u000aLive birth rates were lowest in couples where the female partner was between ages 40 and 42, the researchers discovered. In these circumstances, the male partner's age, whether old or young, did not impact the results. However, when the female was younger than 40, the likelihood of a live birth declined with the increasing age of the male partner.\u000a\u000aFor example, a woman under 30 partnered with a man between 40 and 42 years old suffered lower birth rates (46%) than same-aged women whose partners were between the ages of 30 and 35. Paired with a younger man, nearly three out of four of these young women successfully gave birth.\u000a\u000aThe same was true even among women in the next older age group, between 35 and 40. In these cases, women whose partners were under 30 experienced a nearly 30% improvement in their odds of a successful birth compared to women paired with men between age 30 and 35, the authors said.\u000a\u000aKnowing the risks\u000a\u000aSwedish study in 2014 added to the evidence that dads older than 45 are more likely to have children with schizophrenia, autism and other psychiatric disorders. Still, even for these fathers, the absolute risk was found to be very low -- well below 1% for certain conditions.\u000a\u000aFor one man who saw the study, the findings pushed him into action.\u000a\u000a"I reported on a big study that came out in 2014, and I thought a lot about it, and a few months later, I went and banked my own sperm," former CNN producer William Hudson said in August.\u000a\u000a"I banked my sperm because I wanted to have the option of using younger sperm later in life."\u000a\u000aTo explain the link between mental illness and paternal age, researchers have pointed to the mutations that accumulate in sperm DNA as men get older, which may be inherited by their sons and daughters.\u000a\u000aThere are no genetic tests for psychiatric illnesses such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, Samplaski said.\u000a\u000aHowever, last year, another study in Nature Genetics took an opposing view: Spontaneous mutations in sperm DNA were not largely to blame for the increased risk of psychiatric illness. The researchers found that genes might contribute to this risk, but only a small portion of it -- about 10% to 20%.\u000a\u000aA closer look at the data shows that mental illness isn't just linked to older fathers; there's a risk among younger fathers , too. Some researchers say the focus on mutations could be a red herring. According to the authors of the Nature Genetics study, fathers with a heritable mental illness may simply be more likely to have children at the extremes of age -- perhaps because they socialize or take risks differently.\u000a\u000aThough a similar trend has been found for IQ scores, other studies have refuted those results by taking into account paternal intelligence.\u000a\u000aA number of other conditions have been linked to late fatherhood. One of the most common is a type of dwarfism called achondroplasia, for which there is a genetic test. For men over 50, the risk of achondroplasia is only slightly more common than 1 in 2,000 births.\u000a\u000aHowever, no strong data exist to suggest that children of older parents actually live longer. Some doctors have proposed that aging sperm may come with a benefit: longer telomeres . Telomeres are the tips of chromosomes that protect DNA while it's being copied -- like the aglet at the end of a shoelace that prevents it from fraying. Many scientists believe that longer telomeres signify longevity.However, no strong data exist to suggest that children of older parents actually live longer.\u000a\u000aSamplaski said the risks that concern her patients are not always genetic. For many, it's a simple numbers game.\u000a\u000a"If you're 55 when you have this baby, you're going to be 65 when this kid is 10," she said, adding that people's numerical age may not always be the best predictor of their life expectancy.\u000a\u000a"Most of the couples that are having babies later in life are taking care of themselves."\u000a\u000aToo old for this?\u000a\u000a"I got tons of blowback about it," said freelance writer and television producer Philip Lerman, who has written about his decision to become a father at 46.\u000a\u000aAfter the Clooneys' news spread on social media, some on Twitter compared George Clooney to a grandfather. Lerman said the reactions he received mirrored that.\u000a\u000aIn one Humans of New York photo that drew more than 70,000 responses, a young woman with a 78-year-old father said that it's "hard to be this young and watch them go that way already."\u000a\u000aWhile some children of older parents commented about the difficulties caring for sick and aging parents, others spoke of the valuable lessons they had learned from parents with more life experience.\u000a\u000aAnother story that drew strong responses was a 2011 New York Magazine cover story featuring a white-haired model who was digitally altered to look pregnant placed next to the headline, "Is she just too old for this?" In response to the article, which addressed both men and women, some readers called out aging parents for being "selfish," lamented not having grandparents in the picture and expressed worry about older parents' mortality.\u000a\u000aLerman, now 61, has a 14-year-old son named Max, whom he and his wife conceived using a donor egg. People told Lerman he was "too old" to have a child for many of these reasons. Some suggested that he would have trouble keeping up with a kid and that he might put his future son at risk for genetic diseases.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I took a chance on having ... a child with problems," Lerman said, adding that it's important to think about the alternative.\u000a\u000a"What if I had listened to them?" he added. "What if ... Max didn't exist, and he didn't get to play Little League, and he didn't get to be the star in the school play last year?"\u000a\u000aLerman admits that he "can't do the things that a younger man can" but said children like Max benefit from parents who have taken time to become more emotionally and financially stable. Where some have criticized his age, Lerman believes that older parents are just one manifestation of the diverse American family.\u000a\u000a"Max has an older dad; his friend has two dads," Lerman said. "We've got adopted kids, multiracial kids. It's a beautiful, wonderful mix in our school."

aV(CNN) For the past two months, I have been a changed man. It is hard to fully describe, except to say my mood is mostly sunny and more patient than usual.\u000a\u000aIn the past, my family and friends would've typically described me as pleasant but hurried. My baseline restlessness and edginess, however, have now nearly vanished.\u000a\u000aWithout difficulty, I have sustained attention when my young children spend time with me. Instead of constant surveillance of my phone, there is an ability to quickly hyper-focus on the task is at hand and a corresponding joy of living in a distraction-less world.\u000a\u000aThis change seems to have started the end of last year, after I spent a morning meditating with the Dalai Lama.\u000a\u000aFirst off: Yes, I do feel a little ridiculous writing a line like that, and I didn't feel worthy of his invitation at the time. Even though I meditate, I've never been sure whether I was using proper technique or whether there was an acceptable way to meditate in the presence of His Holiness.\u000a\u000aIf he was looking forward to a good meditation partner, I worried he was unlikely to find it in me. Even my posture is terrible when sitting cross-legged on the floor. My back starts to hurt, followed by my knees. Thus, my breathing, which is supposed to drive my focus, sounds raspy and uneven. All this makes my mind race instead of slowing down and calming.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Mindful meditation with the Dalai Lama Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mindful meditation with the Dalai Lama 00:50\u000a\u000aJust thinking about meditating with His Holiness was making me anxious.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, who says "no" to a chance to meditate with the Dalai Lama? I agreed to join him early the next morning at his private residence.\u000a\u000aA practice that begins at 3 a.m.\u000a\u000aAt 81 years, old, the Dalai Lama keeps a very active schedule. I met him in Mundgod, India, at the Drepung Monastery, where he was overseeing a symposium bridging Buddhism and science.\u000a\u000aThe monastery itself is a dazzling bejeweled structure built 600 years ago. Inside, there are enormous golden Buddhas standing next to ornate walls. The discussion hall itself is grand but warm, with doors and windows open to the hot South Indian sun.\u000a\u000aFor three days, his Holiness moderated sessions on weighty metaphysical topics such as the criteria for valid reasoning, the fundamental constituents of the universe, origins of life and the subjective experience of the mind.\u000a\u000aIt was fascinating and mind-bending -- but also mentally exhausting. It was difficult to stay awake, let alone keep up with the rapid-fire debate between the Buddhists and the scientists. Yet his Holiness was mentally engaged and inquisitive throughout, even more remarkable given more than half the comments were being translated for him.\u000a\u000aThe Dalai Lama typically wakes about 2:40 a.m. and starts his daily meditation routine at 3 a.m., even as most of his staff is still snoozing.\u000a\u000aThis was the backdrop when one of his senior staff members picked me up outside the monastery early one morning. We drove in a three-car convoy to the gates outside his private residence.\u000a\u000aFrom there, several more staff members escorted us to a small conference room where his security detail was slowly waking and drinking their morning tea. Finally, his chief of staff walked me just outside the personal quarters of the Dalai Lama.\u000a\u000aMeditating is hard for him, too\u000a\u000aThere were a few minor instructions before we entered. Eye contact is not a problem, and shaking hands is acceptable if you use two hands, not just one. Try not to turn your back to him when leaving the room, and instead walk backward, as much as possible facing him. When sitting cross-legged on the floor, don't point your feet at the Dalai Lama. And the correct address is "your holiness."\u000a\u000aShortly after, the doors opened, and I nervously walked into a very modest room where the Dalai Lama was sitting on a raised platform, already deep in meditation. I slipped off my shoes, sat cross-legged at a slight angle on the floor to avoid my toes being pointed in his direction, closed my eyes and started to focus on my breathing.\u000a\u000aAll my meditation insecurities immediately started to kick in. After a few minutes, I heard his deep, distinctive baritone voice: "Any questions?"\u000a\u000aI looked up and saw his smiling face, starting to break into his characteristic head-bobbing laugh.\u000a\u000a"This is hard for me," I said.\u000a\u000a"Me, too!" he exclaimed. "After doing daily for 60 years, it is still hard."\u000a\u000aIt was at once surprising and reassuring to hear him say this. The Dalai Lama, Buddhist monk and spiritual leader of Tibet, also has trouble meditating.\u000a\u000a"I think you will like analytical meditation," he told me. Instead of focusing on a chosen object, as in single-point meditation, he suggested I think about a problem I was trying to solve, a topic I may have read about recently or one of the philosophical areas from the earlier sessions.\u000a\u000aHe wanted me to separate the problem or issue from everything else by placing it in a large, clear bubble. With my eyes closed, I thought of something nagging at me -- something I couldn't quite solve. As I placed the physical embodiment of this problem into the bubble, several things started to happen very naturally.\u000a\u000aThe problem was now directly in front of me, floating weightlessly. In my mind, I could rotate it, spin it or flip it upside-down. It was an exercise to develop hyper-focus.\u000a\u000aLess intuitively, as the bubble was rising, it was also disentangling itself from any other attachments, such as subjective emotional considerations. I could visualize it, as the problem isolated itself, and came into a clear-eyed view.\u000a\u000aToo often, we allow unrelated emotional factors to blur the elegant and practical solutions right in front of us. It can be dispiriting and frustrating. Through analytical meditation, His Holiness told me, we can use logic and reason to more clearly identify the question at hand, separate it from irrelevant considerations, erase doubt and brightly illuminate the answers. It was simple and sensible. Most important, for me -- it worked.\u000a\u000aMeditation for skeptics\u000a\u000aAs a neuroscientist, I never expected that a Buddhist monk, even the Dalai Lama, would teach me how to better incorporate deduction and critical thinking to my life -- but that is what happened.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIt changed me. And I am better for it. I practice analytical meditation every day, usually early in the morning. The first two minutes are still the hardest, as I create my thought bubble and let it float above me. After that, I reach what can best be described as a "flow" state, in which 20 to 30 minutes pass easily.\u000a\u000aI am more convinced than ever that even the most ardent skeptics could find success with analytical meditation.\u000a\u000aOver the holidays, I spent as much time as possible relaying the Dalai Lama's teachings to my family and friends and teaching them basic principles of analytical meditation. This was the gift I most wanted to share with them. And now with you.

According to the NRDC, Americans now consume 19 percent less beef than just over a decade ago, in 2005. This is equivalent to a reduction of 185 million metric tons of emissions, or the annual tailpipe pollution of 39 million cars.\u000a\u000aBut why is beef so bad? "The feed is largely produced using lots of pesticide and fertilizer, which requires fossil fuels," explains Sujatha Bergen, one of the authors of the study. "Also, the digestive system of the cows produces methane, which is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. And the manure emits additional greenhouse gases." Beef is widely recognized as the most climate-damaging of all foods. A new study by the Natural Resources Defense Council on food consumption in the US calculates that each kilogram of beef produces 26.5 kilograms of CO2 emissions -- the highest among all the foods observed in the study, and five times more than chicken or turkey meat.Animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5 percent of the world's greenhouse emissions, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, making it a significant contributor to climate change. Of those emissions, 65 percent come from beef and dairy cattle.Reducing beef consumption is an effective way of curbing global emissions.

"Also, the digestive system of the cows produces methane, which is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. And the manure emits additional greenhouse gases." Hide Caption 1 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Lamb \u2013 Another ruminant, lamb, comes at number two -- confirming that red meat is particularly resource-intensive and, as such, damaging to the environment. For each kilo of lamb meat consumed, there are 22.9 kilos of emissions, the NRDC study estimates.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMeat production also requires large amounts of animal feed, mainly the resource-intensive corn and soy. The synthetic fertilizer and the manure used to grow these also releases nitrous oxide, a climate-warming pollutant 298 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Hide Caption 2 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Butter \u2013 The third most damaging food, by some distance, is butter: one kilo of butter equals nearly 12 kilos of CO2 -- about half as many as beef. It belongs to the same supply chain, making dairy and beef cattle an environmentalist's nightmare.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile Americans have greatly reduced their consumption of red meat in recent years, the NRDC reports that butter and other dairy products such as cheese and yogurt actually enjoyed a surge in the observed period, from 2005 to 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aButter is the most climate damaging of all dairy products because there are several steps involved in producing it that are energy-intensive: "For example, butter production requires separating raw milk into low-fat milk and cream, pasteurizing the cream, cooling the cream, ripening and churning," Sujatha Bergen told CNN. Hide Caption 3 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Shelllfish \u2013 Shellfish costs the environment 11.7 kilos of CO2 for every kilo of food produced, just marginally less than butter. Along with milk, pork, and high-fructose corn syrup -- widely used as a sweetener in soft drinks -- shellfish is among the key foods that Americans are eating less of. Overall, changes in the American diet since 2005 have led to a 10 percent decrease in per-capita climate pollution related to food, according to the NRDC. Hide Caption 4 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Cheese \u2013 Another dairy product, cheese, comes in fifth place with 9.8 kg of emissions per kg produced. "Our list is a an average of several common cheeses," explains Sujatha Bergen, "Cheeses that require refrigerated transport or are flown in from abroad, however, tend to have higher climate impacts." Hide Caption 5 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Asparagus \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe problem is mostly in the The only vegetable on the list is also the most surprising entry. Asparagus creates 8.9 kilos of emissions per kilo produced, according to the NRDC. But how?The problem is mostly in the air miles . NRDC's Sujatha Bergen explains: "Much of the asparagus in the United States is flown in from Latin America, which results in greater climate emissions than foods that are transported by trucks. While it's not the only produce item that is flown into the country, a higher proportion of it is transported this way than most other common fruits and vegetables (many of which we import from Mexico). In general, if people are looking to minimize their climate impacts, they should avoid air freighted foods as much as possible." Hide Caption 6 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Pork \u2013 One kilo of pork creates 7.9 kilos of carbon emissions. The NRDC estimates that changes in the American diet\u000a\u000aavoided approximately 271 million tons of climate-warming\u000a\u000apollution between 2005 and 2014, roughly equivalent to the tailpipe\u000a\u000apollution of 57 million cars for one year. In the list of foods that contributed the most to this reduction, pork is third behind beef and orange juice. Hide Caption 7 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Veal \u2013 Another entry that belongs to the beef and dairy cattle supply chain, veal has a lower environmental impact than beef because the calves are slaughtered at a younger age, typically at around 20 weeks versus 18 months. Each kilo creates 7.8 kilos of carbon emission, according to the NRDC. Hide Caption 8 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Chicken \u2013 Eating less chicken meat is one of the contributing factors that have led to a reduction in per-capita emissions linked to food in the US, but poultry still ranks in the top 10, with just over 5 Kg of CO2 per kg of product.

"I came out to see what was happening. I saw water going down ... When I moved up to three meters, I saw this whole mountain coming."\u000a\u000aA massive mudslide, sparked by heavy rains and flooding in an area that has suffered years of deforestation, was speeding down the slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, towards his home in one of the makeshift shanty towns that dotted the hillside.\u000a\u000aManga survived, but an entire generation of his family was swept away in the devastation.\u000a\u000aGabriel Fattah Manga holds a poster showing the family members he lost in the mudslide that hit Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.\u000a\u000a"I lost my mother Kumba, who I love so much," he says.

Organizers of both events blamed inadequate security measures for their changed plans.\u000a\u000aThe founder of Patriot Prayer, the group behind the "Freedom Rally" planned for Crissy Field Saturday, announced Friday that the event had been called off due to safety concerns.\u000a\u000a"We have a lot of respect for the citizens in San Francisco and at the end of the day we want people to be safe," Gibson said, adding that Patriot Prayer had learned that security measures wouldn't have allowed for attendees to be searched on arrival at Crissy Field.\u000a\u000a"So anyone could've come in and there would've been mingling antifa or whatever and also white supremacists could've showed up -- they could've come in the park and we wouldn't have been able to filter them out," he said. "In our opinion it seems like it would've been a huge riot."\u000a\u000aGibson said the news conference at Alamo Square Park would question the rhetoric in the city in the buildup to this weekend, including comments by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, whose congressional district is in San Francisco, and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee:\u000a\u000a'Volatile, chaotic tinderbox'\u000a\u000aMayor Lee earlier said that "people with hate-filled messages" planned on coming to his city for the Crissy Field rally, while Pelosi described it as a "white supremacist rally in the middle of a park for families and children."\u000a\u000aAfter Gibson announced the switch to a news conference Friday, Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener said the Alamo Park event would be an "illegal unpermitted rally," which followed restrictions placed on Crissy Field event.\u000a\u000aOfficials had included weapons on a list of nearly 30 banned items from that rally and also planned to block cars, bikes and parking nearby.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, Wiener said the media conference at Alamo Square Park should not be allowed to take place "as a matter of public safety."\u000a\u000a"Patriot Prayer is not interested in simply exercising free speech. Rather, Patriot Prayer wants to create a volatile, chaotic tinderbox," the senator said. "This rally in Alamo Squre is illegal and in the heart of a residential neighborhood, and I am deeply concerned it will lead to violence, particularly given how close Alamo Square is to the counter-protest at Civic Center."\u000a\u000aGibson suggested in a tweet that Wiener arrest him.\u000a\u000aWhat's illegal is for you to move your violent rally - complete with armed militia - to a city park without getting a permit. pic.twitter.com/gvlZzuuXPR \u2014 Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) August 26, 2017\u000a\u000a'Let's not freak out'\u000a\u000aGibson has said in Facebook videos that he's been unfairly painted as a white supremacist by politicians when he is himself a person of color. He said the Crissy Fields event was for moderates and a way to bring together people who believe in free speech and a way "to build a healthy culture to stand against against antifa, Communists, white supremacists, Nazis."\u000a\u000a"It's not a white supremacist rally," Gibson said in a Facebook video.

God's Window along the Panorama Route is one of the best viewpoints in the 29,000-hectare reserve.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa's organic solar future\u000a\u000aSouth Africa was once the "darling of the renewable world" with a number of solar farms and an increasing amount of renewable energy being plugged into the national grid, energy analyst and director at QED Solutions Dirk de Vos tells CNN.\u000a\u000aHowever, state-owned electricity utility Eskom has held off on signing new deals to buy renewable energy from private firms, saying they are too expensive -- although Eskom maintains that renewables will remain part of the country's energy mix.\u000a\u000aBut smaller-scale developments, such as airports and shopping malls, have taken advantage of the country's well-developed solar sector.\u000a\u000a"That whole ecosystem and skills base is still operating and can be used for smaller commercial rooftop PV operations quite successfully," he says.\u000a\u000a"South Africa's solar future is going to be organic and done by companies to reduce their dependence on the grid and generate their own electricity."\u000a\u000aDe Vos considers solar power to be a competitive, cheap alternative to "electrify parts of South Africa" that might have otherwise been in the dark.\u000a\u000a"I think we're at the initial stages of a solar energy revolution," he says.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa is often considered the gateway to Africa and an important player in the continent's future.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa's big six\u000a\u000aLocated halfway between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, George airport boasts a 200-square-meter solar plant which currently delivers 750Kw power.\u000a\u000aKimberley Airport, situated in the capital of the Northern Cape Province, began operating its 1.7 acre solar power plant in May 2016, a month after George Airport.\u000a\u000aFurther north, Upington's solar plant, which opened in July 2016, delivers 1 million kilowatt hours of power per annum to the airport.\u000a\u000aPreparations are underway for Port Elizabeth International Airport, Bram Fischer International Airport and East London Airport to launch solar PV systems in October, November and December respectively.

aV(CNN) Editor's Note: Generation whining has become nearly a national pastime. Millennials say they have it the worst. Generation X feels neglected. Baby boomers are tired of being called narcissistic. In articles and cartoons everywhere -- from CNN to The New York Times to Gizmodo and beyond -- critics call out this generation's sense of entitlement, that generation's self-absorption . We invited writers, activists and CNN contributors from different generations to hash it out.\u000a\u000aJeff Yang: Generation X is bitter\u000a\u000aI belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We're the cohort everyone skips over \u2014 the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.\u000a\u000aYet, despite our generation's small size and overlooked status, we've nevertheless been handed the job of being America's cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we're raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution. In return, the world called us slackers. Is there any wonder we're bitter?\u000a\u000aJeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including PRI's "The Takeaway" and WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show." He is the co-author of "I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action."\u000a\u000aPaul Begala: Boomers, worst generation ever\u000a\u000aSixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire , "The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history."\u000a\u000aNearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I'd like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever\u000a\u000aPaul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.\u000a\u000aIn the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds -- in blood and treasure -- has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)\u000a\u000aI'm at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 60 iconic moments from the 1960s 60 iconic moments from the 1960s \u2013 Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll defined the 1960s.

We've seemingly made " changing the world " with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world -- we're upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).\u000a\u000aDasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000aBut in dismantling old models, we're also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It's harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won't necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.\u000a\u000aThis is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.\u000a\u000aOf course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.\u000a\u000aWe're faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.\u000a\u000aSo, take some pity on us when you're judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it's that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn't sit right.\u000a\u000aWe're the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.\u000a\u000aDasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global, a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.\u000a\u000aPepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation\u000a\u000aFor me, it's a tale of two cities.\u000a\u000aOne city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women's liberation.\u000a\u000aPepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.\u000a\u000aMost of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights -- we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.\u000a\u000aBut there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a "cocktail," general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.\u000a\u000aOur generation was mixed. But I've been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 70 historic moments from the 1970s Pop culture and politics collided on December 21, 1970, when the King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley, visited President Richard Nixon in the White House Oval Office.

I've been told I don't text back fast enough to be a millennial -- but I also don't have Kurt Cobain's death circled (in black) on my calendar, so maybe I'm not so gen X. I can quote "Reality Bites," a staple of the 30s to 40s set, but I also use Snapchat.\u000a\u000aI'm both and neither. Generation-adjacent.

Which is to say that we're not boomers -- or anything the boomers say about us. They're so en-TITLED, so NEEDY, so stuck in their little gadgets or whatever. You've heard that junk for years. It's almost trite to repeat. But since boomers run the media and the job market, there seems to be no shortage of "trend piece" drivel about the vapid millennials and our shoddy work ethic. If the boomers took 10 minutes to listen, they'd notice that young people today have it worse. The job market's better but still rough; part-timing's the norm. This is the age of inequality, climate change and anti-immigrant sentiment. We millennial-adjacents may seem wayward and indecisive -- but we're light years ahead on all those issues.\u000a\u000aIt's the boomers holding us back. I mean -- it is, right?\u000a\u000aJohn D.

Then someone hiccuped and historians went generic: gen X, gen Y and gen Z.\u000a\u000aIf I were a member of generations X, Y or Z, I'd be miffed. Candidly, it's a wonder they don't suffer from an identity crisis. On top of bearing names as sterile as a supercomputer lab, they have to hear how they're all "me, me, me," and (further) will be the first generations to do worse in America than their parents. All I can say is that I will take the blame for the world that generations X through Z inherited from us. But, please do remember, we have not only lived through the traumas of our times, but yours as well.\u000a\u000aFor all our faults, any generation that produced Dolly Parton, Elvis, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen -- not to mention Steve Jobs and Bill Gates \u2014 has to be considered the best.

Cable news and the Internet didn't exist. Most music came from static ridden AM radios.\u000a\u000aIn school sports, not everybody made the team. Parents didn't "helicopter" their kids. College students traveled between home and school by hitchhiking to save money. We didn't believe in haircuts or the Vietnam War. Everyone was afraid the Russians were going to nuke us. People under 25 feared getting drafted into the military if they didn't volunteer. A lot of my friends did and many got killed.\u000a\u000aPaul Callan, from his Boston College Law School ID in 1975, when he was 25 years old.\u000a\u000aIn 1975, the starting salary for district attorneys in New York was $11,500 per year. When I began my legal career at the Brooklyn DA's Office, I didn't get a paycheck for six months because of New York City's financial crisis. The crime rate was three times higher than it is now and was handled by one-third the number of assistant district attorneys. We often worked nights and weekends for no extra pay. Didn't matter since we weren't getting paid anyway.\u000a\u000aAt work, there were "typewriters," "carbon paper" for making copies and "white out" to correct errors. Spellcheck had not been invented. You had to get it right the first time or you would look like an idiot to the judge because of all the white out on your document. Public telephone calls were made from "phone booths": the place where Clark Kent changes into his Superman costume.\u000a\u000aCigarette smoke hung in the air everywhere as smoking was permitted in offices, bars, restaurants, buses, movie theaters, airplanes and even in courtrooms and hospitals.\u000a\u000aPeople who owned cars put "No Radio" signs on them because thieves smashed car windows and stole radios all the time. Replacing the glass was more expensive than the radio.\u000a\u000aIn 1977, New York's power system failed for over 24 hours and the city descended into a night of terror and looting. A serial killer called "Son of Sam" was still on the loose that night. But we survived.\u000a\u000aWe boomers are tough, resilient, hardworking and creative.

It's pretty clear, for instance, that every generation wishes it could claim Bob Dylan. Boomers win on that one. Debating which generation had it tougher, however, depends.\u000a\u000aMatthew Segal providing testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in 2009.\u000a\u000aTo a certain extent, there have always been throngs of poor youngsters who work for minimum wage, toil as unpaid interns, or slog through as chronically underemployed baristas. What's alarming these days is the acute degree of income inequality Americans face: the highest since 1928. The house you are born into is much more likely to dictate your socioeconomic status than just about anything else.\u000a\u000aThe cost of college also matters -- a lot. Since 1978, university tuition has ballooned over 1000%. The notion of higher education has shifted. Ben Franklin, for example, saw it as a public good. Now it's seen more as a private commodity, financed largely through student loans. These loans are holding America back: A $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis means houses, cars and goods are less affordable for young Americans, and that in turn drags down our entire economy.\u000a\u000aMaybe we should compare ourselves to other countries where college is virtually free, or our friendly neighbors up north where upward mobility is on the rise, rather than previous or future generations in America.\u000a\u000aMatthew Segal is the co-founder of Attn.com and OurTime.org , advocacy organizations for young Americans.\u000a\u000aSarah Burris: Well, we all dislike Congress\u000a\u000aThe real reality that bites is that every generation was screwed by the economic dip, but every generation has an opportunity to try to fix it.\u000a\u000aMillennials are lucky in that we have nothing like the Great Depression or the World Wars.\u000a\u000aSarah Burris, third from left, in Chinatown with her friends.\u000a\u000aWe are the most diverse generation in American history. We are also incredibly progressive.\u000a\u000aWe are creative and have used our ideas to make new things. Boomers invented the Internet, generation X improved it, and millennials found how to bring people closer through it. Even though we join all other generations in hating the nonsense that is the U.S. Congress, we remain optimistic that government can be used as a tool to help people, or, if you're a "Daily Show" fan, something to laugh at.\u000a\u000aLike those who came before us we're neither better nor worse, good nor bad. We're different, and we bring different experiences and understanding to the table. There's no competition. We're in the same boat trying to do what we can with what we've got to make a better world.\u000a\u000aSarah Burris is a former editor at Future Majority.

aVSister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of " Dead Man Walking ." The views expressed are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.\u000a\u000aAs I was writing "The Death of Innocents," I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was "taking him on" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, "And I'll be right back at ya!"\u000a\u000aIn "Innocents," I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams , whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the "machinery of death."\u000a\u000aScalia's experience of the "meaning" of capital punishment, as he described it in one of his dissenting opinions, couldn't have been more different from my own. In the marble confines of the court, he argued interpretation of Constitutional texts, while I, in state killing chambers, accompanied real human beings -- six of them -- to their deaths, which were a direct result of Scalia's interpretations.\u000a\u000aIn grasping the "meaning" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.\u000a\u000aOne thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his "originalist" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.\u000a\u000aAfter all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal "experts," every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?\u000a\u000aPhotos: Death row's nun Sister Helen Prejean has been on a mission to end the death penalty for three decades.

Hide Caption 13 of 13\u000a\u000aI have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.\u000a\u000aAs for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.\u000a\u000aGiven what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.\u000a\u000aIn 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.\u000a\u000aI say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in"The Death of Innocents," taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.\u000a\u000aThree years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented . In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on "cruel and unusual punishments."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes 02:04\u000a\u000aIn his dissent , Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of "idiot" as "such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is." According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's "idiot" test.\u000a\u000aMy second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.\u000a\u000aThese stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by "modern trends," as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Women of death row Kelly Renee Gissendaner was executed by lethal injection on Tuesday, September 29.

Statements such as these:\u000a\u000a-- "It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States."\u000a\u000a-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, "The powers that be are ordained of God," to mean: "Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy."\u000a\u000aDemocracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.\u000a\u000aWhere was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking "an eye for an eye," to pray for and forgive our enemies?\u000a\u000aIn Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.\u000a\u000aIn this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem "enemy."\u000a\u000aIt seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.\u000a\u000aI also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom "equal justice under law" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Shortly after Wednesday morning's attack on Republican members of Congress practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game, Congressman Rodney Davis, still in his baseball clothes, spoke to CNN's Brianna Keilar.\u000a\u000aIn addition to describing the events he witnessed, he spoke from the heart.\u000a\u000a"This hatefulness that we see in this country today over policy differences has got to stop ... Republicans and Democrats need to use this day today to stand together and say 'stop.' Let's work together. Let's get things done," he said. "We can have our differences, but let's not let it lead to such hate."\u000a\u000aDouglas Heye\u000a\u000aWe should all heed Congressman Davis' call, including our President. Since his announcement to run for office, Donald Trump has consistently yelled fire in a crowded political theater by castigating various segments of our population and encouraging his supporters to " knock the crap " out of protesters. And on and on.\u000a\u000aMany Donald Trump supporters have followed his lead, escalating the rhetoric against political opponents and the media. A reporter was choke-slammed in Montana. And before Trump, too many Republicans engaged in awful and, let's face it, racist attacks on President Obama. Perhaps even worse, too many Republicans watched this happen and remained silent.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) When Justin Thomas shot a historic nine-under 63 in the third round of this year's US Open, he finally looked poised to crack the big time.\u000a\u000aHeading into the final round at Erin Hills in June, the American was one shot off the lead but would eventually fade to finish in a tie for ninth.\u000a\u000aAt Quail Hollow on Sunday, Thomas made no mistake, conquering the notorious "Green Mile" with a final round of 68 to win the 99th PGA Championship by two shots.\u000a\u000aChants of "let's go JT!" rang around the spectators at the 18th green before Thomas' proud father emerged from the crowd to hug his son -- golf's newest major champion.\u000a\u000a"It was very special," Thomas told CNN Sport, reflecting on their warm embrace. "I'm not too much of an emotional person. I get excited, I get down, but in terms of crying it hasn't really happened to me in the past."\u000a\u000a"It was the probably as close I'm going to get sharing that with him."\u000a\u000aDad and son. \u2764\ufe0f\ufe0f\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDream come true. \U0001f3c6 pic.twitter.com/n6en0cwwEK \u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) August 13, 2017\u000a\u000aLike father, like son\u000a\u000aThomas, who took up the game at the age of two, grew up surrounded by golfing mentors\u000a\u000aHis father Mike has been head professional at Harmony Landing Golf Club in Kentucky since 1990, and his grandfather, Paul, was club pro at Zanesville Country Club in Ohio -- once playing alongside Arnold Palmer in a PGA Tour Champions event.\u000a\u000aThomas remembers attending the 2000 PGA Championship at the Valhalla Golf Club near his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.\u000a\u000aBack then, aged just seven, Thomas watched Tiger Woods secure his fifth major title, and also took home an autograph from Jack Nicklaus.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Golf's ultimate bromance Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Golf's ultimate bromance 01:40\u000a\u000aSeventeen years on, Thomas has now joined golf's elite.\u000a\u000a"I've just put so many hours of work in. So much of my life I've dedicated to golf, aspiring to win my first major championship. To be able to do so aged 24 is awesome."\u000a\u000aWinning the final major of 2017 caps a memorable season for Thomas who has now won four titles this year. In January, he also became the youngest-ever player to shoot 59 -- en route to victory at the Sony Open in Hawaii.\u000a\u000aThomas' father always keeps the ball as a memento when his son wins a tournament and, at this rate, he's going to have to get a bigger mantelpiece.\u000a\u000a"Any time he can put a ball on the rack it's great," Thomas said. "They don't come quite as frequent as they did when I was a junior golfer ... so to add the first major is great.\u000a\u000a"(Winning the PGA) almost deserves its own rack, being the first major. It's such a big win, not only for us and my team, but for my career. I'm just so happy we could all share it together."\u000a\u000aWith more that $7 million prize money banked this season and now ranked sixth in the world , Thomas is hoping his biggest win to date can launch his career into a new orbit in the years ahead.\u000a\u000a"I feel like the sky's the limit," he says. "I can do a lot of great things but none of them will happen if I don't continue to work hard.\u000a\u000a"You know, it's in my own hands. I want it badly, I've wanted it badly for a while, and I'm glad to add another stepping stone in my career. Hopefully it's a springboard to even better."

aVSome dread going to work, and some look forward to it, but how important is it to actually enjoy and feel satisfied with your job?\u000a\u000aNearly two-thirds of US workers experience some degree of mismatch between their desired and actual working conditions, according to a recent survey by RAND. To make things worse, a study conducted in the UK found that there were more physical markers of stress in people who went from being unemployed to working in a bad job than in those who remained unemployed.\u000a\u000aTogether, these studies provide insight into the struggles of the work force and the negative health impacts a poor work environment can have on employees.\u000a\u000aHow Americans really feel\u000a\u000aThe RAND report reflects the responses of more than 3,000 Americans ages 25 to 71 on a variety of questions regarding their jobs.\u000a\u000a"The thing that surprised me most was how many people experienced some kind of hostile social interaction in the workplace," said Nicole Maestas, co-author of the study and associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. The report found that one in five US workers had such experiences, with the interactions including verbal abuse and sexual harassment.\u000a\u000aA big factor in this statistic is the level of support that a boss provides in the work environment, Maestas said. A supportive boss can cut the amount of hostile interactions in the workplace in half, she said, and lower it even more than that for young women without a college degree.\u000a\u000a"The top of the organization sets the tone about what this culture values and tolerates as far as behavior and codes of conduct, which filters down to all of the supervisory levels," Maestas said. "So at every point, having a boss that will either not be disrespectful or intervene if you're being treated disrespectfully by someone else is really, really important."\u000a\u000aThe study also found that nearly three-fourths of Americans report intensive or repetitive physical exertion at least a quarter of the time while on the job. And more than half report exposure to potentially dangerous working conditions.\u000a\u000aOne in four American workers said they don't feel like they have enough time to do their jobs, and about half reported working during their free time in order to meet expectations. Women report having more difficulty arranging time off to take care of personal and family matters than men, as well as earning less money.\u000a\u000aA disparity is also seen in the complexity of jobs. Regardless of their level of education, younger and prime-age working women were significantly less likely to report having a job that requires solving complicated tasks and unforeseen issues in comparison with similarly aged men.\u000a\u000aAlthough 75% of workers received training to improve on or learned a skillset in the past year, only 38% reported that their job "offers good prospects for advancement."\u000a\u000aThis study provides important information for employers, Maestas said. Within work environments, there is an attitude that if an employee is happy, he or she will be more productive. In respectful places of work, there is less turnover, so these numbers could help influence employers to aim for a better code of conduct, she said.\u000a\u000aSeth Kaplan, an associate professor of psychology at George Mason University who was not involved in the study, said it generally corroborates what is already known about American work experiences. But the percentage of people who reported a hostile environment was higher than he suspected.\u000a\u000a"We focus a lot on very dramatic overt behaviors in the workplace, like workplace shootings, for example. Those are relatively rare," he said. "But it's usually the kind of harsh or mildly aggressive supervisor that's the chronic stressor that's there every day that doesn't get as much attention. And I think we kind of fail to realize how detrimental those types of stressors can be."\u000a\u000aOn the bright side, four out of five workers reported that their jobs were "meaningful" in at least one way, and 84% reported that they learn new things.\u000a\u000aIs a bad job better than no job?\u000a\u000a"Working in a bad job is not good for you. It's not good for your physical health, and it's not good for your mental health. And nearly everybody accepts that," said Tarani Chandola, lead author of the International Journal of Epidemiology study and professor of medical sociology at the University of Manchester.\u000a\u000a"But there is some backward 'Oh, at least you have a job. Any job has got to be better than not having a job -- so being unemployed must be the worst thing for your health there can be.' It's an assumption that people make, but not many people actually test this assumption."\u000a\u000aHe and co-author Nan Zhang, also of the University of Manchester, decided to test it. They surveyed 1,116 people in the UK aged 35 to 75 years and found that those who transitioned from unemployment to a poor-quality job had higher biological indicators of stress than people who remained unemployed.\u000a\u000aThese biological indicators are an issue because they show that the individual could develop metabolic- or cardiovascular-related diseases, according to the study.\u000a\u000aThe individuals who transitioned into good-quality jobs had the lowest amounts of stress indicators seen from measurements across the cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems, the study said.\u000a\u000aChandola said they did not find any mental health improvement in either the people who stayed unemployed or those who went on to poor-quality jobs, which also counters the assumption that a bad job is better than no job.\u000a\u000aGeorge Mason University's Kaplan said "it would be nice if they were able at some point to collect data on objective health outcomes." As the study suggests that the biological markers are indicators of eventual illness, a followup report on health outcomes would be advantageous, he said. But overall, he thought the study provided a clever new look at the effects of poor-quality employment.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWorkers who don't have flexibility in their schedules tend to have more biological stress indicators, Chandola said. In his next study, he wants to delve deeper into flexibility's impact on the work force.\u000a\u000a"You can't just look at whether an unemployment program is successful because someone has got a job. It has to be a good-quality job," he said. "I think that the flexibility dimension is really key because not many workplaces allow for flexibility and workers being able to schedule their own hours. But it is one of the ways in which people can reduce their stress levels at work."

aVStory highlights Vuelta a España starts August 19 in Nimes\u000a\u000aThird time the race has started outside Spain\u000a\u000aOrganizers hope to attract new fans\u000a\u000a(CNN) When the starting claxon sounds for this year's Vuelta a España, cyclists will be riding under the shadows of an ancient Roman landmark.\u000a\u000aAs race starts go, they don't come much more spectacular -- the iconic ampitheater stands proudly in the center of the French city of Nîmes amidst the buzz of people and traffic.\u000a\u000aBut that's not the only reason the race start for the 2017 edition is unique. For just the the third time in its 82-year history, the Vuelta will start outside Spanish borders.\u000a\u000a"We're trying to innovate," Vuelta race director Javier Guillen told CNN Sport. "In this case, we are starting by the arena of Nîmes, a Roman monument, which is going to be very spectacular.\u000a\u000a"This is what we are trying to do year by year -- to present something new to the fans."\u000a\u000aRead More

aVMINDEN, La. \u2014 A 7-year old boy fired a .22 caliber rifle four times according to the Webster Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, wounding his aunt with two bullets because he was \u201chungry.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat was the initial story told by family members at the home in Minden, says Sheriff\u2019s Lt. Scott Tucker. But Tucker says the family has not revealed all the details about what \u201cset the child off.\u201d\u000a\u000aUntil the truth comes out, Tucker says, several adults \u2014 but not the child \u2014 may face criminal charges.\u000a\u000aAccording to Lt. Tucker, the boy has a history of \u201canger issues\u201d but can\u2019t be charged with a crime because state law maintains that children under the age of 10 are too young to have criminal \u201cintent.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe investigation shows that the boy removed the rifle from a cabinet, and then fired it at least four times \u2014 cocking the lever-action rifle before each shot. One bullet struck his aunt under her right arm, and another struck her in the side.\u000a\u000aTucker says the shooting occurred August 18, and four days later the boy\u2019s grandfather, 79-year old Billy Gibson, was arrested on a felony charge of contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile by allowing \u201ceasy access to the gun.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot only that, but Tucker says the boy\u2019s grandfather, mother \u2014 and the aunt he shot \u2014 all face possible charges of obstruction of justice for allegedly trying to cover up the shooting.\u000a\u000aTucker says the family initially claimed the boy \u201cdropped\u201d the gun twice. Tucker doesn\u2019t buy it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI mean, hell, when you shoot me again, you\u2019re firing at somebody,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aTucker says the aunt, Amanda Gibson, was actually on the phone with the boy\u2019s mother when she was shot. But Tucker says neither woman reported the shooting for at least an hour, and the mother, 29-year old Angela Gibson, was arrested on August 23 on the obstruction of justice charge.\u000a\u000aTucker says the 7-year old is in state custody, the aunt is recovering, and the investigation is ongoing.

aVThe Rhinestone Cowboy reaches #1 in demo and total viewers during first broadcasts; Encores Saturday, July 4 at 9:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S.\u000a\u000aAmong the now 20 films within the CNN Films franchise, Glen Campbell\u2026I\u2019ll Be Me was the highest-rated in both adults 25 to 54 and total viewers, and the second highest-rated among adults 18 to 34 (after CNN Films Blackfish).\u000a\u000aGlen Campbell\u2026I\u2019ll Be Me easily won first place in cable news for its time period on Sunday night for all three demos. The broadcast had 2.76M total viewers and 510k viewers aged 25 to 54 for its 9:00pm to 10:45pm premiere.

aVPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Joan Rivers \u2013 To be a pioneer, you have to be willing to go where others haven't, or simply won't. In the case of Joan Rivers, seen here to the right of Brit actress Tina O'Brien, she was willing to say what nobody else would. Her stand-up was uninhibited from the start, and her wisecracks soon led her to late night in 1965. By 1986, Rivers became the first woman to host her own late-night talk show, helping to pave the way for a new generation of funny women. Here are 29 others who've done the same. Hide Caption 1 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Lucille Ball \u2013 Lucille Ball had already found success as a model and actress by the time "I Love Lucy" arrived in 1951, but the show's creation left a lasting mark on pop culture. Ball and husband Desi Arnaz founded their own production company and then created a sitcom that brought in history-making profits. What she produced set the scene for comedies like it to come and served as inspiration for other actresses to reap the benefits of their work. Hide Caption 2 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Mary Tyler Moore \u2013 Mary Tyler Moore did more than make us laugh throughout her career; she broke ground in the 1970s by portraying a single, 30-something working woman. That's all TV comedies were about in the '90s and 2000s, but at the dawn of the '70s, "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was an entirely new breed. If the "Girls" of today are going to raise their drinks to anyone, it should be in celebration of Moore. Hide Caption 3 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Elaine May \u2013 Before "Saturday Night Live," there was the comedic duo Nichols & May. Elaine May and Mike Nichols were renowned for both their social satire and their incredible improv ability, which they often brought right into American homes via programs like "The Jack Paar Show." Along with Nichols, May honed her talent at Chicago's Compass Players, the troupe that would later evolve into Second City. Hide Caption 4 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Moms Mabley \u2013 Considering the early trials Jackie "Moms" Mabley had to overcome, her enduring and groundbreaking career in comedy is all the more impressive. After starting off in vaudeville in 1920s New York, she expanded to the silver screen and became the first female comedian to perform at the Apollo Theater. Before Phyllis Diller put on her fright wig and sack dress, Mabley was making audiences double over with her bawdy sense of humor that included frank talk about race. Mabley's talent wasn't widely recognized until the '60s; she died in 1975. Hide Caption 5 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Carol Burnett \u2013 Can your favorite TV series claim a run of 11 years, with an average of 30 million people tuning in every week? "The Carol Burnett Show" can. The variety show is considered by Time magazine to be one of the 100 best TV shows ever, although when it aired in 1967, Burnett was just trying to bring together all her gifts -- for comedy, acting and song -- into one entertaining dish. The result was a TV classic. Hide Caption 6 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin \u2013 In 1975, "Saturday Night Live" debuted and introduced viewers to history-making comedians like Gilda Radner, left, and Jane Curtin, who were part of the original "SNL" cast. The duo put in place some of the most iconic sketches to date, from the Coneheads to Baba Wawa. Post-"SNL," both were poised for screen success, but Radner's career was cut short by her death in 1986. Curtin went on to star in sitcoms like "Kate & Allie" and "3rd Rock from the Sun." Hide Caption 7 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Phyllis Diller \u2013 Comedic actresses like Zooey Deschanel aren't exaggerating when they say they owe their careers to the great Phyllis Diller. She got her start in stand-up in the mid-'50s and could be considered one of the funniest members of the women's lib movement, breaking the housewife free from the home and giving her a full voice on stage. "She paved the way for everybody," talent agent Fred Wostbrock said on Diller's death in 2012. Hide Caption 8 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Elayne Boosler \u2013 When Elayne Boosler arrived on the stage in the '80s, it seemed she'd been sworn in to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. With a crystal-clear voice and a rapid-fire delivery, Boosler was an eviscerating cultural and political commentator who knew how to land a joke. Condoms, crime, Republicans -- you could get all of that and more in one sitting. In 1985, she pulled her own funds together to craft "Party of One," making her the first woman to get her own hour-long TV comedy special. Hide Caption 9 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Betty White, Bea Arthur \u2013 Bea Arthur, right, was in her 50s when she starred in the '70s sitcom "Maude." The groundbreaking show eagerly charged into new territory, including a pivotal episode in which Maude decides to have an abortion. Between that comedy, and what followed with Arthur's Dorothy Zbornak on "The Golden Girls," Arthur's death in 2009 was deeply felt. In Arthur's absence, her "Golden Girls" co-star Betty White has pushed forward, becoming the rare woman in entertainment who's successfully working well into her 90s. Hide Caption 10 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Rita Rudner \u2013 Some comics make the mistake of equating vulgarity with humor, but Rita Rudner is one of the prime examples that clean can also be funny. Born in Miami, Rudner moved to New York as a teen initially to work as a dancer but then moved over to comedy in her mid 20s. By 1990, when she produced her second TV comedy special, "Born to Be Mild," there was no denying Rudner had earned her place in comedy's canon -- and she didn't have to curse anyone out to do it. Hide Caption 11 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Lily Tomlin \u2013 Lily Tomlin's status as a comedic legend hasn't budged a bit. It all started with 1969's "Laugh-In," in which Tomlin gave us characters like the semi-creepy 6-year-old Edith Ann and the snippy phone operator Ernestine. Tomlin has done tons -- and won plenty of accolades for it, from the Emmys to the Tonys -- but we'll always have a special place in our heart for her 1980 workplace comedy, "Nine to Five." Hide Caption 12 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Roseanne Barr \u2013 In 1988, Roseanne Barr thought it was high time the TV mom got a makeover. Doing away with the pristine versions networks had handed out for years, Barr brought us Roseanne Conner, a sarcastic but loving mother whose blue-collar family was exactly what viewers wanted. With her stand-up background, Barr was 100% frank -- both in the fictional sitcom and behind the scenes. The show became No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings in its second season and stayed in the top spots for most of its nine-season run. Hide Caption 13 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Wanda Sykes \u2013 Wanda Sykes initially took a detour into government work before she found her voice in comedy. Sticking to her ethos of authenticity, Sykes has earned respect and admiration from comedians and the public alike for comedy that always features her distinctive point of view. While also being an accomplished writer (she's worked on quips for her own sitcoms and series like "The Chris Rock Show") and an actor (nod to "Curb Your Enthusiasm"), Sykes is also a stand-up natural. In 2009, she became the first openly gay comedian and the first African American woman to host the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Hide Caption 14 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Julia Louis-Dreyfus \u2013 Julia Louis-Dreyfus got her start on "Saturday Night Live," but it's her role as the sole lead female character on the iconic '90s comedy "Seinfeld" that stands out the most. Initially, Louis-Dreyfus' Elaine didn't exist, but it was decided that the show needed a woman's voice. "We had a very vague idea of Elaine," "Seinfeld" co-creator Jerry Seinfeld told The New York Times in 1993. "But once Julia walked in, we knew who Elaine was. We created her together." Louis-Dreyfus has since been in other hits, including HBO's "Veep." Hide Caption 15 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Whoopi Goldberg \u2013 Native New Yorker Whoopi Goldberg got her start on the opposite coast. With her young daughter in tow, Goldberg headed for San Francisco in the '70s, where she joined an improv group and conducted an award-winning one-woman show. In the mid-'80s, Goldberg returned to New York, where she created the incisive Broadway production "The Spook Show." The beauty of Goldberg's humor about American life is in its insight, a quality she also brought to the screen in a number of acting roles. Not limited to comedy, Goldberg is a member of the prestigious EGOT club , meaning she's won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. Hide Caption 16 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Ellen DeGeneres \u2013 Right from the beginning, Ellen DeGeneres had a way of taking the realities of life and filtering them through a snappy sense of humor. DeGeneres was bubbly and warm, and her brand of accessible comedy was a perfect fit for network television. It was there, while starring on her '90s sitcom "Ellen," that DeGeneres made a pioneering move: She became the first lead on a sitcom to come out as gay. Hide Caption 17 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Margaret Cho \u2013 Comedy has always been a tool for the politically frustrated and socially conscious, but few have wielded their humor like Margaret Cho. After a difficult childhood, Cho began performing as a stand-up comedian when she was just 16. By her 20s, her work had led to appearances on Arsenio Hall's late-night show and a sitcom of her own: ABC's short-lived "All-American Girl." That series didn't pan out, but the rough patch that followed only made Cho sharper and more insistent on keeping her perspective as a woman, and a Korean-American, intact. When she returned with the powerful one-woman show "I'm the One That I Want" in 1999, she'd established her voice as one of the most vital in the business, and she did it on her own terms. Hide Caption 18 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Janeane Garofalo \u2013 For some of you, the '90s is nothing without the image of a brunette Janeane Garofalo in specs and Doc Martens, sardonically commenting on the culture of the day. Although Garofalo began her stand-up career in the late '80s, it felt like she was born to wryly carry us through the decade that followed. With credits that include "The Ben Stiller Show," "Reality Bites," "The Larry Sanders Show" and "Saturday Night Live," Garofalo's comedy helped define a generation. Hide Caption 19 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Kathy Griffin \u2013 There are only three women who have won Grammy awards for solo comedy albums, and Kathy Griffin is one of them. (She's in great company; the other two are Whoopi Goldberg and Lily Tomlin.) From the stage to the screen, Griffin's voice has become one of the most recognizable of the past two decades. She has been adaptable in a changing industry, shifting from sitcom to reality TV with her award-winning "My Life on the D-List," and unapologetic about her sense of humor and her activism. Hide Caption 20 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Chelsea Handler \u2013 Chelsea Handler may have wanted to be an actress when she was younger, but we can't imagine this outsized personality pretending to be anyone else. Raunchy, outspoken and completely unbothered by others' opinions, Handler started out in stand-up but soon became appointment viewing during the notoriously male-dominated late night TV bloc with E!'s "Chelsea Lately." These days you'll find Handler on Netflix with the series "Chelsea." Hide Caption 21 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Tina Fey and Amy Poehler \u2013 Despite starting off with two incredibly funny women, "Saturday Night Live" has had its problems with cast diversity. But starting in the mid-'90s and leading right on up through the aughts, "SNL" was on fire. Thanks to creative minds like Tina Fey, left, and Amy Poehler, as well as Molly Shannon, Ana Gasteyer, Rachel Dratch, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig, this was an era when "SNL" was not to be missed. You want to talk about groundbreaking? See the work that Fey and Poehler pulled off during the 2008 presidential campaign; those clips are going in the vault for future generations. Hide Caption 22 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Tig Notaro \u2013 In August 2012, Tig Notaro did something that redefined what it means to be a woman in comedy. She took the stage at the Largo in Los Angeles for a stand-up set and opened with, "Good evening. Hello. I have cancer." Notaro had just been diagnosed with stage 2 cancer in both breasts, and, as she described to The New Yorker , "It felt so silly and irrelevant to think about ... observational jokes ... in light of what was going on with me." So instead, she turned her 30 minute set into a revolutionary performance on illness, pain and the human will -- showing in the process that sometimes the best comedy isn't the kind that makes you laugh, but connects you with others. Hide Caption 23 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Amy Schumer \u2013 Known for her smart, raunchy, no-holds-barred comedy, Amy Schumer is one of the newest reigning queens of American humor. After creating the popular Comedy Central series "Inside Amy Schumer," the blockbuster success "Trainwreck" and the best-seller "The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo," in 2016 Schumer became the first woman to ever make Forbes' highest-paid comedians list Hide Caption 24 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Sarah Silverman \u2013 The only thing guaranteed when Sarah Silverman does stand-up is that something outlandish, and probably offensive, will come flying out of her mouth. Silverman honed her talent in the writers' room of "Saturday Night Live" in the early '90s before landing some on-camera work of her own. Roles in movies like "Bulworth" and "There's Something About Mary" helped increase her visibility, but it was her 2005 one-woman show, "Jesus Is Magic," that cemented her place as a force to be reckoned with. Hide Caption 25 of 27\u000a\u000aPhotos: Groundbreaking women in American comedy Lena Dunham \u2013 If you're a casual observer of culture, you may mistake Lena Dunham as just the "Girls" star who seems to frequently -- and controversially -- find herself apologizing for verbal misfires. But Dunham's daring approach to authenticity is exactly what makes her groundbreaking. Her commitment to honest, unflinching truth and the humor that can be found there has most readily been seen in "Girls," the HBO series that Dunham created, co-produced and starred in that's ending its run this year. "Lena's unique lack of vanity or shame allows us to consider that we may also be able to accept and express ourselves fully," actress Claire Danes wrote of Dunham in Time magazine .

aVPresident Trump is one step closer to getting a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico.\u000a\u000aBut he has many, many more steps to go.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Trump's trade team officially begins renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, the three-nation pact that went into effect in 1994.\u000a\u000aA new NAFTA will probably take more than a year to enact, and possibly longer, depending on negotiations and political forces in the three countries.\u000a\u000aHere are the other milestones required by law, according to the Trade Benefits America Coalition, a group supported by dozens of large business associations and Fortune 500 firms, including Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) and Walmart. (WMT)\u000a\u000aThis is where we are now\u000a\u000a1. Talks begin Wednesday. The first round is in Washington, and future ones will be in Canada and Mexico. Talks are expected to go until about the end of the year or early 2018 -- assuming all three sides come to an agreement, which is not guaranteed.\u000a\u000aBefore Trump can sign the deal\u000a\u000a2. 180 days before signing the deal, Trump's team must submit a report to the congressional committees on the potential changes to U.S. trade law.\u000a\u000a3. 90 days before inking it, Trump must notify all of Congress about his intent to sign the deal. On the same day he must give the details of the agreement to the U.S. International Trade Committee, an independent panel of judges.\u000a\u000a4. 60 days before signing the deal, Trump's team must publish the text on the website of the U.S. Trade Representative.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump spells out his wish list for NAFTA\u000a\u000aBefore Congress gets the deal\u000a\u000a5.

Before introducing the bill to Congress, the administration is required to submit a review of the deal's impact on employment and the environment, and a plan for implementing and enforcing the agreement.\u000a\u000aRelated: Japan and the European Union ink a new free trade deal\u000a\u000aAfter new NAFTA is introduced to Congress\u000a\u000a10. 45 days after submission, the House Ways and Means Committee must report the bill, meaning it needs a majority vote in the committee to go to a full House vote. The committee could also suggest amendments or other tweaks to the trade deal.\u000a\u000a11. 15 days after that, the full House of Representatives must vote on the bill.\u000a\u000a12. 15 days after that, Senate Finance Committee must report the bill.\u000a\u000a13. 15 days after that, the full Senate votes on the trade deal.\u000a\u000a14. 30 days before officially entering into the agreement, Trump must send a letter to Congress saying he's determined that the United States has taken measures necessary to comply with the agreement.\u000a\u000aRelated: Spurned by Trump, Mexico and China talk up potential trade deal\u000a\u000aTake a breath, because even that timeline comes with caveats.\u000a\u000aAll those days Congress has to consider the new NAFTA are legislative days -- not real, calendar days. In total, Congress gets 90 legislative days, which could in reality stretch over several months.\u000a\u000aThere's more. The governments of Mexico and Canada must also ratify the agreement while this is going on. If they don't ratify it, there's no new deal.\u000a\u000aThat's important to remember because Mexico holds presidential elections in 11 months, and the leading candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a Trump critic, has threatened to get tough on U.S. trade. It's unclear what he plans to do, but if he gets elected, the official U.S. timeline for renegotiating NAFTA would likely get wrapped up in Lopez Obrador's presidency.

He rented the suit, used it for a time, and then dropped it in a heap in the corner, without a second thought about the cigarette burns and stains.\u000a\u000aJust ask Mitch McConnell. The Senate majority leader gave President Trump his one major success: the confirmation of Justice Neal Gorsuch. To do so, McConnell nearly broke the Senate, denying even a hearing to President Barack Obama's highly qualified, moderate choice to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland. It was a shocking breach of Senate tradition, unprecedented in American history. But it worked. Denying Garland a hearing, a vote, or a fair chance at confirmation allowed Trump to place Gorsuch on the high court for life.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump slams McConnell in new tweet Replay More Videos ...

aV(CNN) Cardiac stem cells derived from young hearts helped reverse the signs of aging when directly injected into the old hearts of elderly rats, a study published Monday in the European Heart Journal demonstrated.\u000a\u000aThe old rats appeared newly invigorated after receiving their injections. As hoped, the cardiac stem cells improved heart function yet also provided additional benefits. The rats' fur fur, shaved for surgery, grew back more quickly than expected, and their chromosomal telomeres, which commonly shrink with age, lengthened.\u000a\u000aThe old rats receiving the cardiac stem cells also had increased stamina overall, exercising more than before the infusion.\u000a\u000a"It's extremely exciting," said Dr. Eduardo Marbán, primary investigator on the research and director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute. Witnessing "the systemic rejuvenating effects," he said, "it's kind of like an unexpected fountain of youth."\u000a\u000a'Tilting the balance'\u000a\u000a"We've been studying new forms of cell therapy for the heart for some 12 years now," Marbán said.\u000a\u000aSome of this research has focused on cardiosphere-derived cells.\u000a\u000a"They're progenitor cells from the heart itself," Marbán said. Progenitor cells are generated from stem cells and share some, but not all, of the same properties. For instance, they can differentiate into more than one kind of cell like stem cells, but unlike stem cells, progenitor cells cannot divide and reproduce indefinitely.\u000a\u000aFrom his own previous research , Marbán discovered that cardiosphere-derived cells "promote the healing" of the heart after a condition known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which affects more than 50% of all heart failure patients.\u000a\u000aSince heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is similar to aging, Marbán decided to experiment on old rats, ones that suffered from a type of heart problem "that's very typical of what we find in older human beings: The heart's stiff, and it doesn't relax right, and it causes fluid to back up some," Marbán explained.\u000a\u000aHe and his team injected cardiosphere-derived cells from newborn rats into the hearts of 22-month-old rats -- that's elderly for a rat. Similar old rats received a placebo injection of saline solution. Then, Marbán and his team compared both groups to young rats that were 4 months old. After a month, they compared the rats again.\u000a\u000aEven though the cells were injected into the heart, their effects were noticeable throughout the body, Marbán said\u000a\u000a"The animals could exercise further than they could before by about 20%, and one of the most striking things, especially for me (because I'm kind of losing my hair) the animals ... regrew their fur a lot better after they'd gotten cells" compared with the placebo rats, Marbán said.\u000a\u000aThe rats that received cardiosphere-derived cells also experienced improved heart function and showed longer heart cell telomeres.\u000a\u000aWhy did it work?\u000a\u000aThe working hypothesis is that the cells secrete exosomes, tiny vesicles that "contain a lot of nucleic acids, things like RNA, that can change patterns of the way the tissue responds to injury and the way genes are expressed in the tissue," Marbán said.\u000a\u000aIt is the exosomes that act on the heart and make it better as well as mediating long-distance effects on exercise capacity and hair regrowth, he explained.\u000a\u000aLooking to the future, Marbán said he's begun to explore delivering the cardiac stem cells intravenously in a simple infusion -- instead of injecting them directly into the heart, which would be a complex procedure for a human patient -- and seeing whether the same beneficial effects occur.\u000a\u000aDr. Gary Gerstenblith, a professor of medicine in the cardiology division of Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the new study is "very comprehensive."\u000a\u000a"Striking benefits are demonstrated not only from a cardiac perspective but across multiple organ systems," said Gerstenblith, who did not contribute to the new research. "The results suggest that stem cell therapies should be studied as an additional therapeutic option in the treatment of cardiac and other diseases common in the elderly."\u000a\u000aTodd Herron, director of the University of Michigan Frankel Cardiovascular Center's Cardiovascular Regeneration Core Laboratory, said Marbán, with his previous work with cardiac stem cells, has "led the field in this area."\u000a\u000a"The novelty of this bit of work is, they started to look at more precise molecular mechanisms to explain the phenomenon they've seen in the past," said Herron, who played no role in the new research.\u000a\u000aOne strength of the approach here is that the researchers have taken cells "from the organ that they want to rejuvenate, so that makes it likely that the cells stay there in that tissue," Herron said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHe believes that more extensive study, beginning with larger animals and including long-term followup, is needed before this technique could be used in humans.\u000a\u000a"We need to make sure there's no harm being done," Herron said, adding that extending the lifetime and improving quality of life amounts to "a tradeoff between the potential risk and the potential good that can be done."\u000a\u000aCapicor , the company that grows these special cells, is focused solely on therapies for muscular dystrophy and heart failure with ongoing clinical trials involving human patients, Marbán said.\u000a\u000aCapicor hasn't announced any plans to do studies in aging, but the possibility exists.\u000a\u000aAfter all, the cells have been proven "completely safe" in "over 100 human patients," so it would be possible to fast-track them into the clinic, Marbán explained: "I can't tell you that there are any plans to do that, but it could easily be done from a safety viewpoint."

aV(CNN) Brace yourself for this story: Ten years after her orthodontic braces were removed, a piece of dental wire was found stuck inside an Australian woman's small intestine.\u000a\u000aDr. Talia Shepherd, one of the treating physicians, said the 30-year-old woman showed up at the emergency department of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Western Australia complaining of cramping and severe abdominal pain. The situation was reported in a study published Monday in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports.\u000a\u000aInitially, doctors thought the woman's pain was related to her gallbladder, and she was released once the pain alleviated. Two days later, she returned to the emergency department, again complaining of extreme pain.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't until Shepherd and the other doctors did a CT scan that they discovered an object had punctured several places in the woman's small intestine. The small intestine , between the stomach and large intestine, is responsible for absorbing nutrients and allowing non-absorbed food to pass to the large intestine.\u000a\u000a"After looking at the CT scan, at first we thought it was a fish bone, because that's a pretty common thing to find in the stomach," Shepherd said. "But when we went to ask the patient if she remembered swallowing anything, she had no recollection."\u000a\u000aBecause the intestine had been pierced in multiple spots, it had twisted around on itself, causing a condition known as volvulus . This, along with the extreme pain the woman was experiencing, led doctors to determine that emergency surgery was needed.\u000a\u000aThe woman had not worn orthodontic braces for 10 years, but after the surgery, the doctors found that what had perforated her bowel was actually a 7-centimeter piece of wire, presumably from her braces.\u000a\u000aShepherd said the case is so unusual because of the 10 years the wire went unnoticed.\u000a\u000a"I think it was probably just sitting there in her stomach the whole time, and then when the small bowel was punctured, that's when the pain started," she said.\u000a\u000aHowever, Shepherd also said those who have braces shouldn't be alarmed.\u000a\u000a"The chances of swallowing a wire from your braces is very low," she said. "There might be a higher chance if you're sedated and undergo a dental procedure. But this is a very unusual case."\u000a\u000aDr. Pat Raymond , a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical internal medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School, also thinks the case is unusual because the patient did not remember swallowing anything.\u000a\u000a"Usually, when people have an injury related to swallowing something, they remember accidentally swallowing it or intentionally swallowing it," said Raymond, who is also a spokeswoman for the American College of Gastroenterology . "But that she doesn't remember getting a relatively large piece of wire down there a decade before is strange."\u000a\u000aWhat other weird things have people swallowed?\u000a\u000aA dental wire isn't the only weird thing to be swallowed and recovered from people's bodies.\u000a\u000a"It's incredibly common in my profession to see people who have swallowed things," Raymond said. "The objects often vary based on whether things are swallowed intentionally or by mistake."\u000a\u000aCase studies published in recent years have reported unusual objects both purposely and accidentally swallowed, including a toothbrush , a fitness tracker , a lighter , an LED bulb and dentures\u000a\u000aOne report detailed the case of a woman who had an ink pen removed from her stomach 25 years after she accidentally swallowed it. The pen was still in working order.\u000a\u000aAnd last year a man purposely swallowed 110 cocaine packets in an attempt to smuggle the drugs across countries. Some of the drugs passed through his system, but another part had to be removed at the hospital.\u000a\u000aHowever, a recent study reported that the objects people swallow most often are chicken bones and fish bones. Raymond said accidental ingestions usually occur when people place things in their mouths to temporarily hold them, such as bobby pins or screws.\u000a\u000aShe's also seen unintentional swallowing of quarters after patients played the drinking game Quarters.\u000a\u000aAmerican Gastroenterological Association. Most often, doctors treat patients that have ingested foreign objects by allowing the swallowed object just to pass through the body, said Dr. J. Sumner Bell III , a gastroenterologist and member of theAmerican Gastroenterological Association.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"The general rule is that if it passes out of the esophagus, it's likely to pass through the rest of the intestine without incident," Bell said. "But if people swallow batteries, children swallow magnets, or sharp objects like razor blades or packages of cocaine, that's where we get involved to actively remove them."\u000a\u000aBell said doctors are concerned about these types of items because they can cause harm to the patient through perforation inside the body, just as in the dental wire case.\u000a\u000aIf the object cannot pass, doctors will usually use an endoscope to spot and remove the item from the esophagus or stomach. Surgery is usually needed only in cases with very sharp objects or when patients are in extreme pain.\u000a\u000aWhat about gum?\u000a\u000aSo if strange foreign objects can survive inside us for extended periods of time, what about the old wives' tale that gum lasts in our stomachs for seven years?\u000a\u000aRaymond said it's completely untrue.\u000a\u000a"Gum does not hang out for long in the stomach. Pretty much, the wad of gum is small enough to go from the stomach to the small intestine," Raymond said. "Then it travels downstream, and it comes out the bottom end.\u000a\u000a"The time range for gum is about the same as the time range for corn on the cob," she said. "I tell people if they want to know the average transit time for their GI tract, go eat some sweet corn. Then look for sweet corn. That's about how long gum will take to be digested, too."

aVMichael D'Antonio is the author of the book " Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success " (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Bill Clinton could be both Bubba on the front porch and the pastor who bound the nation's wounds after the Oklahoma City bombing. George W. Bush was able to gently declare Islam a religion of peace after the 9/11 terror attacks and, on the eve of war with Iraq, say: "We've got the force necessary to deal with the security situation."\u000a\u000aBarack Obama was comfortable rousing partisans with jabs at the GOP at a convention and singing "Amazing Grace" in Charleston, South Carolina.\u000a\u000aThink back to FDR and it's easy to recognize that modern presidents have often shown the world different sides depending on the moment, but always in the context of a steady personality.\u000a\u000aThen there is Donald Trump, who also has shown two sides, most dramatically in the past 10 days. After giving a measured statement last week condemning hatred and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, he struck a wildly different tone in an exchange with reporters the next day, drawing widespread condemnation by appearing to equate the far right protesters in that city with those rallying against bigotry.\u000a\u000aThen this Monday, he swung back to his earlier tone when, in a speech on his new Afghanistan policy, he condemned hatred and division.\u000a\u000aFinally, having apparently strained to act appropriately on Monday, Donald Trump returned from his bad boy timeout Tuesday to address a Phoenix crowd as the familiar, raging and erratic character who appears at his rallies.\u000a\u000aHe once again bashed the mainstream press and senators in his own party. Then he distorted his record on the racial tragedy in Charlottesville, reminding the world that he lacks the moral core that has allowed previous presidents to display strong personalities while keeping faith with a nation that needs a stable leader.\u000a\u000aHow is this playing across the country? Not well, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll Wednesday : 62% of respondents said President Trump is doing more to divide the country, and when it comes to the President's response to the violence in Charlottesville, 60% disapprove of his response to Charlottesville compared with 32% who approve.\u000a\u000aThe fact is, many presidents have been adept at showing different sides to different audiences, but all in the service of a sensible set of goals. Trump's wild tacking from one personality to the other is self-destructive.\u000a\u000aThe campaign that put Trump in the White House was a manic circus held in a hall of mirrors, and his presidency has brought more of the same. Rather than moderating, he has swung between two poles. On rare occasions he looks and sounds almost presidential as he proposes legislation and meets with diplomats. But more frequently he is the Andrew Dice Clay of chief executives: irresponsible and anxiety-provoking without much regard for the consequences.\u000a\u000aIf an instrument were devised to measure Trump's mood -- call it a Trumpometer -- it would generally register on the far right-hand side of the scale. This is where "Reckless Trump" muses about the "very fine people" who joined the recent march of the racists in Charlottesville, which culminated in a deadly vehicular attack on anti-hate demonstrators. Heather Heyer died, many more were injured.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the meter is "Scripted Trump," who we saw address the country on Monday with a call for healing the wounds he had helped open with his callous response to the events in Virginia.\u000a\u000aScripted Trump appears when the President is persuaded to accept a little discipline -- and a teleprompter.

Just hours before, however, Reckless Trump refused to accept the national security community's assessment that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, insisting instead that "I think it was probably other people and/or countries."\u000a\u000aBy denying the facts about Russia's effort to influence the election, Trump neglected his duty to defend American democracy and respect the intelligence services that help safeguard the nation. He did, however, soothe his concern that others might see his election as tainted, and his ego requires this comfort. When Reckless Trump is in the room, it is easy to see that ego is his main concern.\u000a\u000aIt was Reckless Trump who told Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that he had fired FBI Director James Comey, calling him a "nut job." The Trumpometer was also reading "Reckless" when Trump attacked Sen. Mitch McConnell, whom he needs to get legislation passed, and tried to bully Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who helped doom his health care proposal.\u000a\u000aAlthough Reckless Trump often sabotages his own agenda, he causes the greatest damage when he indulges himself on an issue that is vital to both public safety and national unity.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump: Does the 'alt-left' have any guilt? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Does the 'alt-left' have any guilt? 01:07\u000a\u000aThe train wreck of a press conference he conducted at Trump Tower after the Charlottesville tragedy is the most vivid example of this brand of Trump. Irritable and combative -- he often cut others off with "Excuse me!" and complained of "fake news" -- Trump refused to judge the white nationalists on a "moral plane" and repeated his argument that blame for the ugliness should be distributed among both the racists and anti-racists.\u000a\u000aThe Trump Tower performance was a wild swing away from the more reasonable statement he had made just the day before. It also fit a pattern. When Trump has chosen to moderate himself, to be more like other presidents, he has often snapped back almost immediately to his more combative identity.\u000a\u000aFor his Monday Afghanistan speech, he pulled himself together for the teleprompter session, which included a reminder that, "loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another. Love for America requires love for all of its people."\u000a\u000aAfter all, this is the man who likes to keep people in suspense, wondering which version of him will appear, which has the effect of casting doubt upon every statement. Indeed, as if to prove he's not to be trusted, Trump followed his Monday peacemaking remarks with a trip to Phoenix, where local officials had asked him to stay away because they feared violent protests.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED President Trump teases pardon of Joe Arpaio Replay More Videos ...

Well, Trump was reportedly considering a pardon for recently convicted ex-sheriff Joseph Arpaio, whose anti-immigrant demagoguery has made him a living symbol of prejudice for many Americans.\u000a\u000aTrump didn't announce an Arpaio pardon (although he essentially predicted it would happen) but his rally appearance marked a return of the performer who prefers ad-libbed assertions and insults to unifying leadership -- and discouraged anyone who'd hoped for better from the 45th president. Of course Trump has never made a secret of who he really is. He answered the question in 2016 when he said, on the subject of teleprompters:\u000a\u000a"I've started to use them a little bit. They're not bad. You never get yourself in trouble when you use a teleprompter. You know, the problem is, it's too easy. We have a president who uses teleprompters. It's too easy. We should have non-teleprompter speeches only when you're running for president. You find out about people. The other way you don't find out about anybody."

aVA new study from Harvard has found greater risk of breast cancer in women who live in neighborhoods that have higher levels of outdoor light during the night.\u000a\u000aThe findings are based on the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) , which has for decades been advancing our understanding of risks to women's health.\u000a\u000aFor this study, epidemiologist Peter James and colleagues followed nurses in the NHS for breast cancer occurrence from 1989 to 2013. The home of each of 109,672 nurses was geocoded, and the average light level in the immediate neighborhood at night was estimated from satellite images taken by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\u000a\u000aThese estimates were updated over the 15-year follow-up period. By 2013, a total of 3,549 new cases of breast cancer had been diagnosed, about what's expected among this number of women.\u000a\u000aThe study found a direct relationship between a woman's neighborhood nighttime light level before diagnosis and her later risk of developing breast cancer: The higher the light level, the higher the risk.\u000a\u000aThese findings held even when taking into account many other factors that may also affect risk such as age, number of children, weight, use of hormone medications and a long list of additional potential confounders.\u000a\u000aOf importance if confirmed in more studies, the relationship was strongest in young women diagnosed before menopause.\u000a\u000aThe study is significant because it adds a strong piece of evidence to the growing body of studies supporting the idea that excessive electric light exposure at night increases a woman's risk of breast cancer\u000a\u000aWhy was the study done?\u000a\u000aThe idea that electric light at night (LAN) might explain a portion of the breast cancer pandemic dates back to 1987 . It was pretty far-fetched at the time because light doesn't seem toxic in any way that could cause cancer. It can't break chemical bonds and damage DNA, and it's not a hormone like estrogen, which, in excess, can cause changes in the breast that can lead to cancer. Light is, by definition, the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and so it does not include X-rays or even ultraviolet radiation, which can burn skin.\u000a\u000aLight is an exposure that challenges the conventional definition of a toxic substance. If a little asbestos is bad for you, more is certainly worse. The same holds for ionizing radiation (like X-rays), dioxin and lead.\u000a\u000aThe difference is that the effects of exposure to light on human health depend crucially on timing. Over millions of years, we have evolved with a daily cycle of about 12 hours of bright light (the sun) and about 12 hours of dark. So during the day, our body expects light, whereas during the night it expects dark. There is a deep biology to this, and electric light is throwing it out of kilter.\u000a\u000aOne perplexing possible consequence of this light exposure is an increased risk of breast cancer in women. Researchers, including me, have been exploring this possible link in part because breast cancer has no single known major cause. This is unlike many of the other common cancers such as lung, liver, cervix and stomach, for which a major cause has been identified for each; these major causes are, respectively, smoking, hepatitis viruses, human papilloma virus and the bacterium Helicobacter pylori.\u000a\u000aSatellites\u000a\u000aBut how could the nighttime light level outside a woman's home in her neighborhood affect her risk of breast cancer?\u000a\u000aThe rationale for studying the outside light level is the assumption that communities that shine brightly to a satellite at night are composed of people who in general are bathed in LAN: They have greater exposure in their home , outside on the street, and for evening entertainment in the city. So, the satellite data are thought to be a surrogate, or a proxy, for this actual LAN exposure to each woman, particularly in the evening before sleep.\u000a\u000aToo much evening light can delay the normal transition to nighttime physiology that should begin at dusk. An important part of this transition is a substantial rise in the hormone melatonin in the blood. Melatonin has been shown to have strong anti-cancer effects in lab rats. The shorter the wavelength of the light -- that is, light that has more blue relative to other colors -- the greater impact on lowering melatonin and delaying transition to nighttime physiology.\u000a\u000aMy colleagues and I did a similar analysis using satellite data in the state of Connecticut. We also found a stronger effect in younger women, as did another study from 2014 conducted among teachers in California. The studies from Harvard and from California are superior to ours because they both had individual-level data on many more potential confounders than just age, which we did not. Yet all three studies do point in the same direction.\u000a\u000aTwo concerns\u000a\u000aThe estimate of elevated risk of breast cancer in the new Harvard study is modest, at only 14 percent for the most highly lit neighborhoods, compared to the least.\u000a\u000aIf true, it would still account for many cases. However, there are two concerns about this estimate's validity, which are actually opposites of each other.\u000a\u000aOn the one hand, the apparently elevated risk may be due to other factors that go along with more highly lit neighborhoods, and the LAN actually has no impact. This is called confounding. The Harvard study is one of the best-equipped studies ever conducted of women's health to deal with this possibility because it has individual-level data on so many characteristics recorded for each subject, such as age, weight, smoking, body mass index, income and on and on.\u000a\u000aThe researchers included these factors into their statistical models, and it did not change their estimate of the effect for LAN on breast cancer risk. However, the information on these other factors is not perfect, and there may still have been some of what is called "residual confounding."\u000a\u000aOn the other side, if evening and late-night electric light exposure actually does increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, then this estimate of 14 percent probably understates the true effect, and maybe by a lot.\u000a\u000aThe reason is that the estimate of LAN exposure from the satellite images is only a surrogate for the light that would actually matter, which is each woman's individual exposure to light in her eyes during the evening and night whether she is home or out and about.\u000a\u000aAnother limitation of epidemiological studies, like the Harvard one, is an effect known as exposure misclassification , which tends to underestimate the level of health risk when using a surrogate to measure the real exposure.\u000a\u000aIn this case, the satellite images act as a surrogate for actual nighttime light exposure to each woman. The poorer the surrogate (satellite images) is correlated with the actual exposure (light to eyes of women at night), the lower the estimate of risk will be from an epidemiological study that uses that surrogate. And it is unclear how accurate a stand-in these satellite images are for actual light exposure to each individual woman.\u000a\u000aA modern marvel turned urban blight\u000a\u000aThe Harvard study comes closely on the heels of a very public warning from the American Medical Association on potential health problems from "white" LED street lights. It is important to note that the nighttime light levels used in this new study were recorded before any widespread use of "white" LED street lighting.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIf the results from Harvard are real, and too much light at night from any and all sources does increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, then retrofitting street lighting all across America should be done in a way that does not further contribute to the problem. It would be best to select luminaires that are as dim as possible, and weak in the short wavelengths (e.g., blue), yet still consistent with accomplishing their intended purpose.

aVDonald Trump lashed out Wednesday at a female lawyer whom he had called "disgusting" several years ago for requesting a break to pump breast milk in the middle of a deposition, calling her a "vicious, horrible person."\u000a\u000aIn an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, the Republican presidential candidate claimed that the attorney, Elizabeth Beck, had wanted to pump breast milk in other people's presence. Trump alleged that Beck was now retaliating against him because she was unhappy about having lost that legal battle, and that she had fabricated a story about Trump losing his cool and storming out of the deposition room.\u000a\u000a"She wanted to breast pump in front of me and I may have said that's disgusting, I may have said something else. I thought it was terrible," Trump said. "She's a vicious, horrible person."\u000a\u000aElizabeth Beck described the 2011 encounter - first reported by the New York Times late Tuesday - as Trump having "an absolute meltdown" in an interview with CNN's "New Day" Wednesday morning.\u000a\u000a"He got up, his face got red, he shook his finger at me and he screamed, 'You're disgusting, you're disgusting,' and he ran out of there," Beck said.\u000a\u000aTrump strongly refuted this characterization in Wednesday's interview, saying Beck had distorted the events.\u000a\u000a"She made it up. She made it up," he said. "She's saying, 'Oh, he was so violent and he was so, so wild and she was afraid.' She was afraid of nobody. She's a tough killer in Miami everyone knows she's a killer. They all hate her."\u000a\u000aWell-known for his colorful language and imagery, Trump went on to compare Beck's interview with CNN earlier in the day to the way people who had never met Michael Jackson discussed the iconic pop star after his death.\u000a\u000a"So many people are on television that don't know me and they're like experts on me," Trump said. "You know when Michael Jackson died - I knew him very well - and everybody was talking about Michael Jackson. They didn't know him, they knew nothing. Some of them never even met him."\u000a\u000aPressed on how the 2011 incident reflects on how Trump would behave as president - and how he would react if challenged by a world leader like Russian President Vladmir Putin - Trump answered: "Believe me, I'd do very well with him. I get along with people."

Posted by CNN on Thursday, August 13, 2015\u000a\u000aBefore you vote, though, you should know some of the basics. In talking to people about climate change this year, I've found there is SO MUCH confusion about what's causing warming and why.\u000a\u000aI've met people -- smart people, reasonable people -- who think that climate change is caused by aerosols from hairspray (it isn't) or that it's just part of a natural warming cycle (it's not). Burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat, as well as chopping down rainforests, contributes to climate change.\u000a\u000aHere's a breakdown of global greenhouse gas emissions by sector, according to 2012 data synthesized by the World Resources Institute. This is kind of a "blame" chart.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, I asked people on Facebook to identify their preferred climate villains . Among the most interesting (and sometimes humorous) responses you submitted: dinosaurs ("they turned into the oil that we want to get at, right?"); millennials ("It is always millennials' fault for everything ..."); parents ("the process of procreation ... results in increases in demand of the earth's resources and is the driving force for most of our planet's woes"). I was mentioned by name ("John Sutter. I bet he's double secret super villain. No doubt."), as was Willis Carrier , the guy who commercialized the modern air conditioner, and James Watt, who invented an efficient steam engine\u000a\u000aYou also identified more nebulous bad guys, like apathy, greed, ignorance and consumerism. Geography found its way into the mix, too. China, America and the "3rd world" all made your list.\u000a\u000aSome countries are more to blame than others, sure. But it turns out that the most industrialized countries -- the United States, European countries and, increasingly, China and India -- are among the biggest contributors to climate change, because they burn the most fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aHere's a list of the top 10 countries in terms of their overall contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions. This list is measured from 1850, the start of the Industrial Revolution, to 2012, and it's based on data synthesized by the World Resources Institute\u000a\u000aUnited States China Russia Germany United Kingdom Japan India France Canada Ukraine\u000a\u000aThose are the countries most responsible for the warming we're already seeing, as well as for much of the warming that we will seen in coming years. According to the World Bank, the atmosphere already has warmed 0.8 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times , and about 1.5 degrees of warming is already "locked in" to the atmospheric system because of how much carbon we've burned.\u000a\u000aRemember, 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is the danger mark.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change Replay More Videos ...

Each of the four topics you suggested for this poll is a worthy candidate. Our diets, our reliance on fossil fuel reserves, our willingness to turn precious forests into farms and our addiction to gas-burning cars and other dirty modes of transit -- all of these contribute to climate change. And each is worth exploring in depth.\u000a\u000aI don't want to play the blame game forever. I agree with those of you who said we need to move past finger-pointing and toward solutions. I do think, however, that by exploring who and what's causing climate change, we'll have a better sense of how to solve this urgent problem.\u000a\u000aSo, please vote. Tell your friends. And thank you for helping decide where I'll focus my energy.

aVAllison Jaslow is executive director of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the leading nonprofit, nonpartisan organization representing post-9/11 veterans and their families. She is a former Army captain who served two combat deployments in Iraq, from 2004-05 and 2007-08. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) On Monday night, President Donald Trump spoke about the way forward in Afghanistan. I watched his remarks on TV, and then watched the reactions on the news and social media. I was shocked, not by what the President said, but by what everyone else did not say.\u000a\u000aThe discussion Monday night whizzed past the war and went straight to politics. Was this a win for H.R. McMaster? Will the President's decision prompt Steve Bannon to go nuclear? Was this a deliberate attempt to shift the conversation away from Charlottesville, Virginia?\u000a\u000aI know it's hard to resist the "Trump angle," but when it comes to discussion of what's at stake in Afghanistan, I wish we spent as much time talking about the human consequences of the President's strategic decisions as the political ramifications.\u000a\u000aAs a soldier there's only one question you have when your country asks you to go to war: Is the mission worth your life? But talk of troops was more about "numbers" and commentary on Afghanistan, colored by journalists and pundits, most of whom have never had to confront their own mortality the way soldiers must. Sitting in somber silence in front of a TV somewhere was a brother who was reminded of his sister's death by enemy fire, and a woman who's now convinced that the most recent time her husband came home from war is no longer the last time.\u000a\u000aToo quickly left out of the public debate these days are the lives impacted by our national security decisions. The soldiers asked to dodge bullets, their families forced to spend sleepless nights worrying, and their spouses who have to learn to be single parents. We owe it to them to have a substantive conversation about whether their sacrifice in Afghanistan is worth it, not just when we decide to go to war, but as conditions change and especially when we find ourselves in what is now being called " America's longest war.\u000a\u000aWhen I pledged an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, I knew war was a possibility. But I never expected that ultimately going to war would put me in a special and shrinking class of Americans. Nearly 16 years after 9/11, I'm still blown away that less than 1% of United States citizens have fought in Afghanistan and Iraq. And, while in a volunteer military, we certainly made a choice to serve, the fact that so few of us have, has over time had a devastating impact on our country.\u000a\u000aThe civilian-military divide means that most Americans, and most of the media, only have an abstract understanding of the human cost of policy decisions. But we can start to fix that. Troops have died in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria this year, but those headlines have become overlooked blurbs on news sites. We seldom learn about who they are, who they left behind and, most importantly, we rarely ask ourselves if the cause they were fighting was worth their life. I guarantee their families and friends are certainly asking that question. Their stories should be front page news.\u000a\u000aWe need to hear more from veterans who inventoried and packed up their buddy's belongings 24 hours after a car bomb blew him up, then picked up a ruck and continued on with the mission, like I did in Iraq. We need to hear from children of the fallen who know their mom loved her country, but struggle to articulate the mission she was fighting for. And we need to hear from the wife of the special forces soldier who is still alive but, after six deployments, is no longer the fun-loving guy she married a decade ago.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThis is an incredibly challenging time domestically, but our nation's wars overseas are not weighing on the public's consciousness as they should be. Even when we have a rare national opportunity to reconnect the American people with those who are fighting, as we did Monday night, we missed the mark and focused on politics. And the lack of public discussion about the lives affected not only dangerously desensitizes us to the cost of war, but it allows politicians to avoid their duty to debate and authorize the commander in chief's decision to wage it.\u000a\u000aThose who step up to serve and their families who sacrifice alongside them deserve to be considered more intentionally as we flex our might against terrorism, even if they are too humble to ask for recognition. As a nation that depends on a fraction of the population to sacrifice for all of us, let's push ourselves to do better next time.

aV(CNN) Men who took high doses of vitamin B6 and B12 supplements had a higher risk of lung cancer, and the association was highest among current smokers, according to a study published Tuesday .\u000a\u000aThe study found a 30% to 40% increased risk of lung cancer among men taking these vitamins from individual supplements -- not from multivitamins or diet alone. But the effect seemed to be driven by current smokers who far exceeded the recommended daily amounts of the vitamins, according to study author Theodore Brasky , an epidemiologist in the division of cancer prevention and control at the Ohio State University College of Medicine.\u000a\u000a"I think these results point to a synergism" between high-dose B vitamins, smoking and lung cancer risk among men, Brasky said.\u000a\u000aCurrent male smokers taking the highest levels of vitamin B6 had triple the risk of lung cancer over six years, compared with those who didn't take supplements. For vitamin B12, that risk nearly quadrupled. These levels were more than 11 times the recommended daily amount of B6 and 23 times that of B12.\u000a\u000a"If you look at B-vitamin supplement bottles ... they are anywhere between 50-fold the US recommended dietary allowance (to) upward of 2,100-fold," Brasky said. B12 injections have also become "in vogue" in recent years, he said.\u000a\u000aIn smaller quantities, these vitamins are involved in several vital processes in the body, including DNA replication. But many high-dose supplements, he said, claim to boost energy and provide other unproven benefits.\u000a\u000a"That's marketing. That's not science," he said.\u000a\u000aThe study was limited to roughly 77,000 Washington state adults, ages 50 to 76. This included 139 cases of lung cancer among more than 3,200 current male smokers. Over 93% of participants were white.\u000a\u000aThere were too few cases of lung cancer among nonsmokers to include them in the full analysis. An increased risk of lung cancer was not seen among women or with the vitamin B9, also known as folate.\u000a\u000aOther researchers have found different results. Some studies linked vitamin B6 with lower lung cancer risk , and another found that B12 had no impact on risk. The authors of the new study said that the discrepancy could be because some of these studies measure B vitamins in the blood and not through dietary surveys, like they did. Or it may be that lung cancer itself raises levels of these vitamins in the body.\u000a\u000a"I think it's hard to say" why these studies contradict each other, said Elizabeth Kantor , an epidemiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who has studied dietary supplements and cancer risk. She was not involved in the latest research. "Is it the disease process that affects the blood levels? I think that the door remains open on that."\u000a\u000aA focus on B vitamins may not be the most effective way to protect against lung cancer, experts warn.\u000a\u000a"Combustible tobacco smoke is the No. 1 most important factor, not just only in lung cancer but in many cancers," Brasky said.\u000a\u000aCigarette smoking is a factor in 80% to 90% of lung cancers in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from it than nonsmokers. Lung cancer kills more Americans than any other kind of cancer.\u000a\u000a"When we're talking about what to be concerned about most: If you're a male smoker and you want to take B vitamins, you can stop smoking," Brasky said.\u000a\u000a"Smoking is the most important thing here, and that's preventable."\u000a\u000aTo B or not to B?\u000a\u000a"In the average person in this country, it's tough to be deficient" in B vitamins, Brasky said.\u000a\u000aThose who are -- those with anemia or celiac disease, for example -- will feel tired and run down. For them, supplements might help.\u000a\u000aBut taking "megadoses" of these supplements doesn't do much for the average healthy person, Brasky said, nor does it cause immediate harm. The body tends to get rid of excess vitamin, he said.\u000a\u000a"There's always this black box between what people say they eat or take and what is actually absorbed," said Regan Bailey , an associate professor of nutrition science at Purdue University and a former nutritional epidemiologist with the National Institute of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements. She also was not involved in the new study.\u000a\u000aStomach acid and digestion, Bailey said, are able to "rip out" B12 from food so that the body can absorb it. Some synthetic supplements, however, may be more easily absorbed.\u000a\u000aVitamin B12 is found in animal products like meat, eggs and milk. Americans get most of their B6 from fortified cereals, beef, chicken, fruits and starchy vegetables.\u000a\u000aToo little of these vitamins is thought to carry cancer risk, too. Errors can happen when building new strands of DNA, causing them to break. And genes responsible for cell division may be thrown off by these changes, the study authors said.\u000a\u000aIn high concentrations, however, the exact relationship between the vitamins and lung cancer is unclear. If the vitamins are indeed responsible for increasing the lung cancer risk, Brasky said, another question would be whether B vitamins are hastening the development of a lung cancer that's already there or leading to new cancers.\u000a\u000aBailey warned that we are nowhere close to claiming that these high-dose supplements cause cancer.

aVAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of "The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President." Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him on Twitter @aarondmiller2 . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his alone.\u000a\u000a(CNN) President Donald Trump's son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner has landed in Israel , along with a senior delegation, for the purpose of trying to renew the all but defunct Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\u000a\u000aThere's no doubt that persistence in peacemaking is critical. Former Secretary of State James Baker took nine trips to the region to produce the 1991 Madrid peace conference.\u000a\u000aBut if Trump is expecting a breakthrough during this trip, he ought to lie down and wait patiently until that feeling passes. If Kushner can't get the two sides to agree on some general negotiating framework, he ought to at least make clear what the US approach is. His credibility -- and that of the United States -- depends on it.\u000a\u000aBottom line: The peace process isn't ready for prime time, and the President might have thought a moment or two before committing himself to an "ultimate deal" that he can't possibly produce.\u000a\u000aBad timing\u000a\u000aThe timing for this trip couldn't be worse. It may be that the recent terror and violence at Haram al-Sharif/the Temple Mount -- in which the United States played a minimal role -- has accelerated the administration's timetable and its desire to try to get something going before violence breaks out again. But right now there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that either Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the mood to compromise on the substance of the negotiations or the process itself.\u000a\u000aTalk of scandal and indictment is swirling around Netanyahu and is pushing him to circle the wagons and reach out to his right -- never a good omen for peace.\u000a\u000aAnd Abbas is viewed as weak: fighting rear-guard actions against Hamas and his Fatah rivals as well as key Arab states. He is also threatening to internationalize his approach to the peace process rather than enter into talks with Israel.\u000a\u000aIndeed, he's reportedly going to present Kushner with an ultimatum that unless progress is made within 45 days, the Palestinian Authority will turn away from the United States as a broker.\u000a\u000aNo plan\u000a\u000aIf you don't know where you're going, the old saying goes, any road will get you there. This will be Kushner's third trip to the region, and the administration has still not decided on a framework or an end state for negotiations.\u000a\u000aIndeed, Trump has neither endorsed nor rejected the two-state solution -- the mainstay of his three predecessors' approach to the peace process.\u000a\u000aIn a recent off-the-record briefing , Kushner admitted the challenges in identifying an end game and wondered what -- new or unique -- he and the administration were bringing to the problem.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED One-state solution explained Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH One-state solution explained 00:52\u000a\u000aNo matter who had won the 2016 US election, getting to a two-state solution would have been a real stretch. So is the Trump administration considering another option? And what ideas might Kushner be bringing to the region on this visit?\u000a\u000aIs he going to propose a bottom-up approach of interim steps: economic cooperation, turning over more responsibility to Palestinians in parts of the West Bank, and deepening now fraught Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation?\u000a\u000aOr will he propose a top-down policy? One that develops a framework on the big issues, such as borders and Jerusalem that the two sides will negotiate with US help?\u000a\u000aWhichever direction Kushner and the administration decide to takes, they need to make their plans known soon.\u000a\u000aThe Kushner trip might actually be considered something of a success if the United States managed to identify an approach that Abbas and Netanyahu didn't blow out of the water immediately.\u000a\u000aAn Arab fantasy\u000a\u000aThe new ingredient in this administration's attempts to bring peace to the region is the willingness of Arab states to work with Israel -- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in particular.\u000a\u000aAnd it's no coincidence that the Kushner mission began with a swing through the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan.\u000a\u000aGiven the Trump administration's penchant for huge events, it wouldn't surprise me if it was aiming to produce some kind of peace conference as a way to jump-start the process. One Arab analyst speculated -- somewhat fantastically -- that the Saudis might host such a happening in Jeddah\u000a\u000aHow much the Arab states will give, however, is going to depend on how forthcoming the Israelis will be vis-à-vis the Palestinians and whether the Trump administration will support Palestinian goals, particularly on statehood.\u000a\u000aIndeed, it's magical thinking to believe that if the United States wants the Arabs involved in a meaningful way, either Jerusalem or Washington (most likely both) won't have to pay for it.\u000a\u000aCredibility on the line\u000a\u000aIn 20 years of working on the peace process, I wish I had a nickel for every unproductive trip we took to try to start or save negotiations.\u000a\u000aPersistence is critical. But so is keeping your powder dry when it's clear that the parties really aren't all that interested in helping out a US envoy. And as part of the President's family, Kushner is no ordinary envoy.\u000a\u000aMoreover, he's traveling with deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, the immensely talented, Egyptian-born fluent Arabic speaker who will provide real substance, heft and hopefully some much-needed reality.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Abbas: With Trump's wisdom, peace is possible Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Abbas: With Trump's wisdom, peace is possible 00:46\u000a\u000aStill, another trip or two without producing a visible sign of progress -- let alone a direction or concept that the Arabs and Israelis can embrace -- will erode what remains of Kushner's credibility on this issue. And the parties will grow accustomed to his visits and weary of his talking points. And while they may humor him because of his closeness to the President, they won't take him seriously.\u000a\u000aHad Trump not come out of the gate pushing big breakthroughs and ultimate deals, he might not have put his and US credibility so publicly on the line. No one looking at Abbas and Netanyahu realistically would ever have believed that they -- even with US help -- could produce a final peace agreement on the big issues.\u000a\u000aAnd the President's political travails at home, particularly the self-inflicted wounds in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, have raised serious questions about Trump's capacity and focus to deliver on the peace process -- or any other issue.\u000a\u000aRight now the emperor has no clothes. And where Kushner and his team will find them is anybody's guess.

aVRebecca Wallwork, CNN \u2022 Updated 18th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 The world-famous Ocean Drive is one of the most photographed stretches of Miami Beach.\u000a\u000aBut, with its neon lights and sidewalk cafes serving beer-garitas for two, it's not known for being a high-end destination.\u000a\u000aThe exception, nestled amid low-rise Art Deco hotels, with streams of tourists strolling past, is the Villa Casa Casuarina -- better known as the Versace Mansion.\u000a\u000aWhat many of those selfie-snapping tourists outside may not realize is that the former home of late fashion designer Gianni Versace isn't a museum or private home, but a hotel.\u000a\u000aAnd it's a hotel where guests can sleep in what was Versace's bedroom. Or in the bedroom of his sister Donatella. Or perhaps the suite where Madonna used to stay when she visited Versace in the '90s and helped put the Miami Beach neighborhood of South Beach on the national scene.\u000a\u000aIf a $1,000-plus-a-night hotel room is out of reach, members of the public can indulge in the villa's Baroque grandeur with a dinner reservation at Gianni's, and an aperitif in the intimate, clubby Onyx Bar, in the space that used to be Versace's kitchen.\u000a\u000aSince Versace's death -- he was shot dead on the steps of his mansion in 1997, thus the camera-wielding tourists outside -- the property has changed management a couple of times.\u000a\u000aHowever even now, 20 years later, under the ownership of Jordache Enterprises, it retains the designer's over-the-top splendor. (Donatella auctioned off some of the home's contents in 2001, but what remains are the richly decorated walls, floors, ceilings and windows, plus the pool, garden and southern wing.)\u000a\u000aThe best-known property on Ocean Drive\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 9 House-turned-hotel: The former home of late fashion designer Gianni Versace has been transformed into one of Miami's most opulent hotels.\u000a\u000aThe unapologetic opulence of Casa Casuarina made it an obvious location for filming the upcoming TV series "The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story", which will air on FX in early 2018.\u000a\u000aThis May, tourists along Ocean Drive were treated to in-costume sightings of the show's stars, including Penelope Cruz as Donatella, Ricky Martin as Versace's longtime partner Antonio D'Amico, and Edgar Ramirez as the designer -- who appeared on the balcony of Versace's former bedroom clad in a pink bathrobe.\u000a\u000aThe room is now known as The Villa Suite, and, like the rest of the mansion's interiors, it's as over-the-top on glitz as Versace's collections. The most arresting feature, also available in Donatella's bedroom, the Venus Suite, is a custom-made double-king-size bed.\u000a\u000aNo longer on show is Versace's $10,000 marble toilet with 24-karat gold-plated seat -- one of the items auctioned off by Donatella after her brother's death.\u000a\u000aFrom flashy home to over-the-top hotel\u000a\u000aItalian fashion designer Gianni Versace was murdered on the steps of the Miami mansion in July 1997.\u000a\u000aToday, Casa Casuarina has 10 hotel suites, plus a restaurant and bar, a lounge that can be used for meetings, a rooftop and an elaborate Mediterranean-style Mosaic Garden, with tiles picturing icons of Greek mythology, chief among them Medusa -- who has a place of honor on the Versace brand's logo.\u000a\u000aThe most elaborate Medusa can be found in the Villa's 54-foot-long pool, inspired by Versace's "Marine Vanuras" collection and said to be made from more than one million mosaic tiles, thousands of them 24-karat gold.\u000a\u000aThe Medusa mosaic was crafted in Versace's home town, Reggio Calabria, Italy, and then taken apart and shipped to Miami Beach in pieces, where it was painstakingly reassembled.\u000a\u000aAdjacent to the garden, in the "new wing" that Versace built when he acquired the mansion, is The Moroccan Lounge, which used to be his gym, and still houses his eight-person hamam Turkish steam room and shower.\u000a\u000aThe room where Madonna would stay, the Mosaic Suite, is located upstairs, where the singer apparently enjoyed the bathroom's acoustics and the bird's-eye view of the pool.\u000a\u000aThe history of Casa Casuarina\u000a\u000aVersace purchased Casa Casuarina in 1992, after falling under the spell of the Magic City and the Spanish architecture of the grand house.\u000a\u000aNext door was an Art Deco Hotel called the Hotel Revere, which Versace also snapped up, and demolished to make way for his garden, pool and the south wing, which used to house one of his libraries.\u000a\u000aAn estimated $32 million in renovations over three years transformed the historic property into a manse fit for a style king.\u000a\u000aBut even before his tenure, Casa Casuarina had a flashy history.\u000a\u000aIt was built in 1930 by Alden Freeman, whose father worked for The Standard Oil Trust and left him a fortune which allowed him to retire at 27 and build his dream house, inspired by the historic Alcazar De Colon in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\u000a\u000aFreeman lived in a top-floor suite and either housed his friends or rented the 23 remaining apartments.\u000a\u000aMany of the architectural details of the house, including the key lime coral floors, the pillars surrounding the courtyard, and the decorative medallions of famous personalities (Cleopatra, Gandhi, Rockefeller and -- more dissonantly -- Mussolini and Lenin) date to Freeman's time, which ended with his death in 1937, when the house was sold and run as an apartment complex.\u000a\u000aBy the 1980s, the building fell into disrepair, although most of the original fittings and artworks survived.\u000a\u000aMansion mysteries\u000a\u000aAs with many famous buildings, Casa Casuarina has its share of mystery: There are rumored to be secret doors and passageways throughout the mansion, although a door that used to lead from Versace's bedroom to an entertainment den has since been closed off.\u000a\u000aIt's also said that Versace maintained a pigeon coop beneath the rooftop observatory, and would use the messenger pigeons to send notes to friends. Details are scant on these rumors, but what's certain is that The Villa will continue to intrigue visitors, no doubt even more so when the TV series hits screens next year.

For the sake of his long-term health, Hargreaves took the decision to retire from the game aged 30.\u000a\u000aOn the touchline of a quiet, North London sports pitch, it was hardly the ending any athlete dreams of.\u000a\u000a"It was a strange one because you don't see your career ending on the side of a field on a Monday afternoon," Hargreaves, who won four caps for the Springboks before joining English Premiership side Saracens, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"A pass came and we were both looking at the ball, and just bang -- a clash of heads, a bit of dizziness.\u000a\u000a"I got home that evening and was straight out for the count at about five o'clock.

Doctors believe this causes nerve cells to become stretched, releasing chemicals that can alter, among other things, consciousness, memory, mood, or sleep.\u000a\u000aIn rugby terms, it can result from a big tackle, a heavy fall to the ground, or simply -- as Hargreaves found -- an accidental blow to the head. The symptoms vary from case to case, something that the former Saracens captain readily acknowledges.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes it's very obvious -- you're dizzy and you've got a headache for three or four days; you feel like you've got vertigo every time you get up off the couch," he says.\u000a\u000a"For me there's a lot of things that occurred, like when I was defending I felt that my peripheral vision just wasn't there. Guys would just be running past me.\u000a\u000a"Other times it's just a lingering feeling that you're a little bit off, 5% off. Like being in a fog.

He now runs a craft beer business -- Wolfpack lager -- alongside former teammate Chris Wyles.\u000a\u000aHis concussion story is by no means unusual. Like Hargreaves, Wales international George North suffered his fifth concussion in two years earlier this season. In a decision that has been criticized by leading doctors, the winger was allowed to play on despite being knocked unconscious -- reason to remove a player permanently from the game.\u000a\u000aAll Blacks great Richie McCaw, who suffered six bouts of concussion, has admitted that he was "lucky" to end his career unscathed from long-term damage.\u000a\u000aA five-year law suit between the NFL and retired players concluded at the end of last year after ex-players claimed that the NFL had hidden the risks of brain injuries.\u000a\u000aAs of January 7, former players are eligible to claim settlements to help treat debilitating brain injuries -- which in some instances include Alzheimer's and the degenerative brain disease ALS.

The science around head injury and particularly around concussion in sport is relatively immature and evolving very rapidly."\u000a\u000aIn 2012, World Rugby introduced the Head Injury Assessment, an in-game protocol intended to help identify and manage concussion as soon as a knock to the head occurs.\u000a\u000a"The average assessment of a player in the 2015 World Cup was 64 seconds and done on-pitch where the player couldn't engage in the assessment," Kemp says.

Hargreaves, however, praises the protocol, having experienced it first-hand.\u000a\u000a"It's a good system," he says. "I think they could probably improve what it actually entails, what questions you get asked in the changing room, how you deal with this, what's the prognosis for coming back to play, for recovery -- all those kind of things could be tweaked.\u000a\u000a"But it's a great starting point, and I'm really glad to see that they're taking this seriously."\u000a\u000aBreathalysers, proteins, and head gear\u000a\u000aThe science surrounding concussion is still evolving, and how it is applied to rugby is likely to shape how the game is perceived in the public eye.

He also knows of companies working to develop a breathalyser that measures chemical levels in a player's brain to assess whether they've sustained any damage.\u000a\u000aBut the problem won't go away anytime soon, and Kemp admits that officials will "still be looking at this problem in five, 10, 15 years."\u000a\u000aAs for Hargreaves, his experience won't stop him sharing his love for the game with his son -- who was an important factor in his decision to retire. But the former second-row forward does accept that work still needs to be done.\u000a\u000a"I don't want to be in a position in five years' time where I have to turn around and say to my kid, 'Actually, I think it's safer for you not to play,'" he says.

aVA blind high school student in Dubuque says joining the cross country team has always been her dream. She's not letting her inability to see, get in the way of her ability to run.\u000a\u000aThere's really no explanation needed. At least that's the way Dubuque Senior cross country runner Wendy Flores sees it.\u000a\u000a"I am the same person, I am just blind. I like to run. Those are one of my hobbies that I want to do," said Flores.\u000a\u000aThe high school senior decided now is the time to do the things she really wants to do.\u000a\u000a"When I have children I could say, 'oh you should go out for cross country, because that's what I did.\u2019" said Flores.\u000a\u000aSo she laced up her running shoes and joined the team.\u000a\u000a"She can run, just as much as any of the other girls can," said Assistant Cross Country Coach Keith Weber.\u000a\u000aTo accommodate her needs, Coach Corrie DeMuth, is now her running partner. The two stay connected with a guide rope.\u000a\u000aDeMuth acts as Wendy's eyes, but Wendy is doing just as much work as the rest of her teammates.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes I'm like, oh I got this. Sometimes I just want to give up, but I still run," said Flores.\u000a\u000aShe keeps going. Why wouldn't she? It's what she loves to do.\u000a\u000a"I imagine myself in a cloud.

aVJohn D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook .\u000a\u000aArcola, Louisiana (CNN) Rain pounded on the roof of the mobile home as the phone rang. The call was about Mark, Carolyn Ruffin's oldest son. He'd been hospitalized in a nearby town. The mother of four, who normally has an unflappable air about her, knew she had to rush to her boy -- no matter that a storm was brewing, the likes of which her corner of Louisiana never had seen.\u000a\u000aThis was August 12, 2016. In the next week, about 7 trillion gallons of water would fall on Louisiana, more than during Hurricane Katrina, according to meteorologist Ryan Maue. The nameless storm would shatter records, flood homes and kill 13 people.\u000a\u000aThat morning, though, Carolyn's thoughts weren't focused on the weather. They were with her son. So, at about 7 a.m., she hopped in the front seat of a friend's pickup truck.\u000a\u000aTwo people would join her. One was Alfred Waxter, the truck's owner, a close family friend visiting from Mississippi. The other was Carolyn's daughter Stacy.\u000a\u000aAt 44, Stacy Ruffin was the youngest of Carolyn's four children. Family members speak of the two as inseparable, and they mean it literally. Stacy lived with her mother in the mobile home, raising a daughter and son of her own there. She managed the deli counter at the Walmart in a neighboring town. Otherwise, she was at her mother's side, helping run errands, pay bills, check on neighbors. Stacy's eight aunties and uncles -- and their children -- all were part of her flock.\u000a\u000aShe was the family caretaker. The responsible one. The one you turned to.\u000a\u000aSo it's no surprise she went with her mother to check on her brother.\u000a\u000aAnd it's no surprise that, one year after the storm, no one has filled her void.\u000a\u000a'Natural' disaster\u000a\u000aHundreds of miles away, the email landed in the scientists' inboxes.\u000a\u000aIt was four days later, August 16. The request: Would Karin van der Wiel, Sarah Kapnick and Gabriel Vecchi -- three researchers from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's lab in Princeton, New Jersey -- help assess the extreme rainfall in Louisiana?\u000a\u000aThe floods in Louisiana had caught the attention of the World Weather Attribution team coordinated by Climate Central, a nonprofit that focuses on climate change science and journalism. And they wanted help.\u000a\u000aThe team would be assessing the Louisiana storm for any signs of climate change. Was this storm more likely because humans are polluting the atmosphere with heat-trapping gases? Did climate change have any likely influence on the extreme rainfall totals? Or was this a truly "natural" disaster?\u000a\u000aKarin and Sarah considered the proposal.\u000a\u000aThe result of their inquiry would be published no matter what they found, but they had to work fast. Scientific studies typically play out over months, if not years. Could this massively complicated work be done -- and quickly enough to capture the public's attention?\u000a\u000aThe researchers knew they'd have to drop everything else to focus on this project. But they had the expertise, and they had the climate models at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.\u000a\u000aPlus, there was something about this flood.\u000a\u000aIt seemed to have the drenching power of a tropical storm, yet it stalled on land, dumping trillions of gallons of water on southeastern Louisiana, day after day. All three scientists had seen the news coverage: the floating cars, the submerged homes, the people trapped on their roofs. Many rescues were taking place by boat, since cars couldn't travel the streets in the disaster zone. A "Cajun Navy," made up of volunteers , aimed to make up some of the gaps left by authorities. Some 60,000 homes were damaged. Financial losses were estimated at $30 million.\u000a\u000aThe scientists took the news to heart. They felt for the people on the ground. Sarah and Gabriel have children of their own. What if their own family members had been put at risk?\u000a\u000aThey agreed to discuss the matter further on Skype with the Climate Central team. The three of them crowded behind a laptop webcam at the lab.\u000a\u000aWhat would it take to pull this off?\u000a\u000a'On her way home'\u000a\u000aStacy and Carolyn Ruffin reached St. Helena Parish Hospital safely.\u000a\u000aNot that the drive was easy.\u000a\u000aFirst, they tried to go west on Highway 10 but had to turn back. An 18-wheeler was stuck in the ankle-deep floodwater. So they tried another route: Highway 1045, a winding backcountry road that's elevated above the bogs and gullies overgrown with oak, pine and ivy.\u000a\u000aIt's not a road the Ruffins normally take, but that morning, it seemed to be the only safe route.\u000a\u000aThe family arrived to tragic news, however.\u000a\u000aMark already was gone.\u000a\u000aDoctors believed that Mark Wilson suffered a heart attack on the job at an industrial site, said Brad Graves, chief of St. Helena Parish Fire District No. 4, which handles emergency services.\u000a\u000aCarolyn Ruffin lives with her grandchildren in Arcola, Louisiana.\u000a\u000aCarolyn wailed at the loss of her son.\u000a\u000aStacy phoned her children. Courtney, 23, and Corey, 13, needed to hear the news of their uncle's death from their mom. They needed her voice to console them.\u000a\u000a"She said she loved us and she was on her way home," Courtney recalled.\u000a\u000aThe words didn't land quite right. There was something about her mother's tone.\u000a\u000aSoon, Stacy and her mom were back in the truck, with Alfred behind the wheel. Stacy sat in the passenger's seat, her mother in the middle. Again, they headed down Highway 1045.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't safe anymore.\u000a\u000aThe flood came in a flash -- water rushing in from everywhere and nowhere all at once.\u000a\u000a"It was like if you had opened a floodgate," Carolyn told me.\u000a\u000aThe driver tried to turn back, threw the truck in reverse.\u000a\u000aA jolt. The truck shook. The water took hold, pulling the vehicle into the abyss.\u000a\u000aCarolyn and Alfred managed to get out of the driver's side window.\u000a\u000aCarolyn surfaced. Floodwaters rushed and swirled around her so swiftly, it felt like it was gushing from a fire hydrant. Carolyn gasped for air and flailed against the current.\u000a\u000aShe scanned the surface for her youngest daughter.\u000a\u000aStacy was nowhere to be seen.\u000a\u000aClimate detectives\u000a\u000aWas that climate change?\u000a\u000aKarin, Sarah and Gabriel, the researchers at NOAA, were used to being asked that question. Until recently, however, they were able to answer in only the most sweeping of generalities.\u000a\u000aThere's a great deal of scientific certainty that humans are polluting the atmosphere with heat-trapping gases, causing the Earth to warm. Already, researchers have observed about 1 degree Celsius of warming to average surface temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, when people started burning coal. Burning that fossil fuel, along with natural gas and oil, contributes to a build-up of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. Those gases traps heat, warming the planet.\u000a\u000aThese conclusions may be controversial with the Trump administration in the United States and with the 47% of Americans who say that global warming is natural or that they're unsure what's causing it , but they're not -- at all -- with scientists. They've been researching this for decades.\u000a\u000aThe consequences of global warming also are well-known and observable now: Ice is melting in the Arctic, sea levels are rising, and coral reefs are struggling to survive. Broadly, rainfall events are expected to become more intense in some parts of the world as a warmer atmosphere helps clouds hold more moisture; worsening droughts are expected elsewhere.\u000a\u000aThat's the global picture, though.\u000a\u000aAttributing one storm, in one place, on one day, to climate change?\u000a\u000aThat's difficult. And that's new.\u000a\u000aPeter Stott, who now leads the climate monitoring and attribution team at the Met Office, the United Kingdom's national weather service, was the first scientist to try it.\u000a\u000aThe idea came to him on vacation in Tuscany in 2003, he told me. It was the middle of a massively deadly heat wave in Europe.\u000a\u000aTemperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius -- 104 Fahrenheit -- "which I'd never experienced before," he said. One night, sitting on a balcony overlooking a valley in Italy, it hit him: This heat wave covered such a wide area of Europe, and lasted for so long, that there would be a wealth of data about it. Could there finally be enough information, he wondered, to see how climate change had affected this heat wave?\u000a\u000aThat hunch resulted in a 2004 paper in the journal Nature , which is widely regarded as the first "climate attribution" study in the world. You can think of Stott almost like a climate change detective, looking for humanity's fingerprints on a disaster that, to many, seemed natural.\u000a\u000aBut was it?\u000a\u000aStott and his collaborators used climate models -- computer programs that approximate weather and temperatures over time -- to compare observations from the 2003 heat wave with a computer-assisted approximation of the climate without human greenhouse gas pollution. In essence, this data helped them compare the likelihood of that heat wave in 2003 versus the likelihood of the same heat wave occurring in a climate before all of the pollution.\u000a\u000a"The chances of it had more than doubled," Stott told me.\u000a\u000aThe 2003 heat wave was more than twice as likely because of global warming.\u000a\u000aThere was intense public interest in that finding, especially in Europe.\u000a\u000a'Praying up a storm'\u000a\u000aThe water rose around their necks. The truck was underwater.\u000a\u000aCarolyn and the driver clutched a shrub together, fighting the current and hoping to be rescued. Carolyn had screamed so much that her voice was hoarse, but she doubted it could be heard above the water's roar.\u000a\u000aAnd neither of them had seen Stacy.\u000a\u000aHours passed.\u000a\u000a"I'm going to help you get up on this little limb," Alfred told Carolyn, pushing her onto the branch of a pecan tree. The water, which had been up to her throat, now hit her armpits.\u000a\u000a"Hold on here some kind of way," he told her. He was going to go for help.\u000a\u000a"Can you swim?" Carolyn asked.\u000a\u000a"A very little bit."\u000a\u000aNeither Carolyn nor Stacy could swim at all.\u000a\u000aCarolyn watched her friend float into the distance.\u000a\u000a"Maybe someone will find me," she thought.\u000a\u000aAnd maybe they'll find Stacy.\u000a\u000aEvacuees take advantage of the shelter setup in the The Baton Rouge River Center arena.\u000a\u000aSoon, night began to fall over Louisiana. Crickets and frogs added their screeching chorus to the roar of the flood. Sticks slammed into Carolyn's back. Logs hurtled past. Mosquitoes nipped at her shoulders and face, covering her skin with pockmarks. Her mind began to race.\u000a\u000a"Stacy! Stacy!" she screamed.\u000a\u000aShe thought of her son Mark, who'd died that morning. It felt like an eternity ago. Mark loved football, graduated from high school and played ball for a year at junior college. He'd grown into a devoted husband and father of three. A guy who could fix anything. What would become of Mark's wife? His children? That loss was so fresh, it stung.\u000a\u000aAnd she thought of Stacy. Was her daughter alive? She had to believe so. Downriver, perhaps, hanging onto another tree. Or maybe she had been swept ashore. Maybe she was safe.\u000a\u000aThe more time she spent in the water, though, the more Carolyn let herself consider the unthinkable. She couldn't stomach it. "Stacy!" She had to keep up hope. Yet her mind drifted back to the crash, to the moment the truck flipped off the road and listed into the water. Where did all that water come from? she wondered. It didn't make sense -- all this water, so fast.\u000a\u000aShe'd lived in the same location since the 1960s. It was like nothing she'd ever seen.\u000a\u000aShe played the accident over and over in her mind.\u000a\u000aShe heard her daughter's last words.\u000a\u000a"We gonna die," Stacy had said just before the crash.\u000a\u000a"We gonna die."\u000a\u000aTheir families had reported them missing. But no one knew their precise locations. Six feet of water covered the pavement of Highway 1045, the local fire chief said, perhaps 12 feet of water where Carolyn was stranded, making the area nearly inaccessible.\u000a\u000aCarolyn didn't know whether anyone was looking for her.\u000a\u000aThey ain't gonna find me. I'll end up dying out here. Carolyn Ruffin\u000a\u000aAs the sun set, she began to have visions. She saw a family outside a mobile home, just across the way, through some trees. "Help!" They couldn't hear her over the roar of the flood.\u000a\u000a"Help!"\u000a\u000aOne person appeared to be tacking a blue tarp onto the roof, trying to prevent the thumping rain from entering the home. Carolyn hollered and hollered, hoping to get their attention.\u000a\u000aThe family looked so real, she told me.\u000a\u000aNow, she thinks they were a hallucination.\u000a\u000a"They ain't gonna find me," she thought. "I'll end up dying out here."\u000a\u000aShe shivered in the cool water, still clutching the branch of the pecan tree.\u000a\u000a"I sat there all night long -- all night," Carolyn told me. "Praying up a storm."\u000a\u000a'Keep track of it'\u000a\u000aIt would be the first such rapid assessment of a storm in the United States.\u000a\u000aKarin and Sarah -- known in their Princeton lab for being problem-solvers who never give up -- would apply their relentless drive to answer big questions about how the Earth works.\u000a\u000aKarin, in particular, long had been fascinated by weather and water.\u000a\u000aShe grew up in The Netherlands, a country known for mastering the sea. Before climate change started raising ocean levels around the world, the Dutch were building intricate systems of dikes and canals so people could live in and around the water. That was necessary because much of the Northern European country was -- and is -- well below sea level.\u000a\u000aCarolyn Ruffin is raising her grandchildren -- Corey, 13; and Courtney, 23 -- after their mother's death in the August 2016 flood.\u000a\u000aAs a teenager, Karin started making observations of her own, taking detailed notes about weather patterns in the family garden. She noted, for example, the daily minimum and maximum temperatures at that one location for three consecutive years. "I would write it down and make graphs," she told me, laughing at how "nerdy" that sounds in retrospect. "You could see winter is colder than summer. You didn't really learn spectacular things about this.\u000a\u000a"But I learned you could keep track of it."\u000a\u000aKeeping track would become her calling.\u000a\u000aAt NOAA, she worked on climate models, evaluating these massive computer datasets to see how closely they tracked with observed weather patterns in the real world. In particular, she focused on rain patterns in the United States and how they'd shifted over time. Were the models good enough to approximate the way rain fell in the real world? Two models -- FLOR, for Forecast-Oriented Low Ocean Resolution model, and HiFLOR, the higher-resolution version -- were good at tracking with reality, Karin and Sarah wrote in a 2016 study published in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate . This was a big deal in the scientific community, since so many factors contribute to where it rains and when and how.\u000a\u000aThese models were "state of the art," Sarah told me.\u000a\u000aAnd they might enable researchers to do the kind of analysis Peter Stott had on the 2003 European heat wave. Extreme rainstorms are more complex, scientifically, than heat.\u000a\u000aTheir work was creating new possibilities.\u000a\u000aBut Karin and Sarah's article on climate and rainfall published to little public fanfare.\u000a\u000aUntil the flood.\u000a\u000aSoon, the New York Times was quoting their work, and they were embarking on the biggest scientific quest of their young careers.\u000a\u000a'I'm right here!'\u000a\u000aThe moonlight kept Carolyn alive through the night.\u000a\u000aShe'd been in the water nearly 16 hours. She'd survived this long, she started to believe that God was protecting her. Maybe God wanted her to find Stacy. Maybe she needed to take care of her daughter's children, if Stacy had drowned. Either way, God showed her a sign that night, she told me. A beam of moonlight shined right down on her, giving her comfort. That light -- and her belief that perhaps someone was looking out for her -- helped her fight off sleep and survive.\u000a\u000aStill, she was stuck on the limb of a pecan tree, unable to swim.\u000a\u000aAs the sun rose, she decided to make a push for shore.\u000a\u000aShe shoved off of the branch and into the water, expecting that she'd be able to stand.\u000a\u000aShe couldn't. And her foot was stuck in a fork in the branch. The rush of water yanked her down and under, stealing her breath. She pulled and pulled, but her foot wouldn't come loose. The water pulled her under once. Twice. The third time she went under, worrying that she might never surface again, she told me, she yanked again. Her ankle slipped out.\u000a\u000aShe was free. But she couldn't swim to safety.\u000a\u000aSo she managed to grab another shrub and hold tight.\u000a\u000aIt turned out to be enough. That morning, she told me, a man -- a real man, not a vision -- drove down Highway 1045. Carolyn screamed and screamed. At first, it seemed he couldn't hear her. The man continued down the road and out of Carolyn's vision. But he stopped and turned around, drove the other way. She screamed again, and this time he pulled over.\u000a\u000aShe was so far down in the water, he couldn't see where the voice was coming from.\u000a\u000a"I'm right here!" she yelled, water up to her neck.\u000a\u000aThe man told her to hang on, disappeared from view and returned not five or 10 minutes later, with rescuers and a boat. Carolyn was rescued at 8:41 a.m., according to local fire department records.\u000a\u000aHer survival was "the grace of God," said Graves, the fire chief.\u000a\u000aRescuers wrapped Carolyn in blankets and took her to safety.\u000a\u000aLater that day, she learned of her friend's fate -- and Stacy's.\u000a\u000aAlfred, the truck's driver, was found more than two miles away -- alive.\u000a\u000aStacy's body was found near the crash site.\u000a\u000aShe escaped the car but died in the flood.\u000a\u000aHer certificate of death lists her fate as an "accidental" drowning.\u000a\u000a'One-in-70-year storm'\u000a\u000aOn September 6, after days of intense research on the nature of the deadly floods in Louisiana, Karin gave seven interviews. She'd never even talked to a journalist before.\u000a\u000aA press release about her study on the Louisiana rainfall and climate change was due to be published online the next day, a collaboration with eight other researchers around the world from New Jersey to Nairobi. The bulk of the work had been done in just two weeks, with Karin and Sarah taking the lead on the writing. They met daily in front of the webcam with the global team, hammering out the analysis. A supercomputer at a US government lab in Tennessee had run the massive calculations as part Karin's previous research. And those data now proved invaluable.\u000a\u000aWhat would have been a one-in-100(-year) storm (in 1900) would be a one-in-70-year storm (now). That's quite an increase. Karin van der Wiel\u000a\u000aDays were long, often keeping the researchers working until midnight or later.\u000a\u000aBut they had the results, and they knew they needed to communicate them widely.\u000a\u000aThe first interview of the day was with Amy Wold, a newspaper reporter in Baton Rouge, the epicenter of the storm. "What would have been a one-in-100(-year) storm (in 1900) would be a one-in-70-year storm (now)," Karin told the Advocate reporter. "That's quite an increase."\u000a\u000aPut another way: The storm was at least 40% more likely, and perhaps much more, because of climate change , the study found. And it could be expected to be 12% to 35% more intense because of human greenhouse gas pollution.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Louisiana flooding is 'major disaster,' governor says Baron Leblanc, left, and George Snyder move a refrigerator out of George's flooded home in St. Amant on Thursday, August 18.

They tested how likely this storm -- with its extreme rainfall -- would have been in 1900, before most man-made global warming. And they compared those results with how likely this particular storm was to occur in 2016. This built on Karin's previous work.\u000a\u000aThe results don't say definitively that climate change caused the extreme rainfall. But they do say that the storms were made more likely -- and possibly more severe -- because of global warming.\u000a\u000aThese findings mirror what climate scientists understand about global warming and rainfall, generally. Because of pollution, extreme storms are becoming more of the norm.\u000a\u000aThese results raise yet another question that goes beyond the science.\u000a\u000aIf climate change made the storm more likely, who -- or what -- killed Stacy Ruffin?\u000a\u000a'The records were shattered'\u000a\u000aI visited Stacy Ruffin's family earlier this summer. Her mother offered me a seat in the shade of their front lawn and, not long after I arrived, handed me a stack of papers tied with a blue ribbon.\u000a\u000a"A loving farewell. Mark Wilson. Stacy Ruffin."\u000a\u000a"You have some really nice photos of her in here," I told Carolyn, awkwardly, not sure what to say about the funeral program for her two children who died the same day.\u000a\u000aOn the cover, Stacy's hair is piled high on her head, a stylish ringlet dipping down beside her eye. Inside, she's wearing hoop earrings and a striped turtleneck. Only later would I learn that the family's house burned down years ago, and they lost nearly all of their family photos.\u000a\u000aThese were their only surviving memories.\u000a\u000aSo much about the storm doesn't make sense. Some people say you have to accept the mystery. The storm "was an act of God," and sad as it may be, it must have been Stacy's time to go. That's what Stacy's coworker Rose Franklin told me at the Walmart deli counter.\u000a\u000aOthers are searching for answers.\u000a\u000aDeloris Wilson blames herself for her niece's death. She had suggested that morning that Carolyn and Stacy take Alfred's truck to the hospital, thinking its height would rise above the water. If they hadn't, she says, maybe they never would have tried to drive on Highway 1045. She knows it might have made no difference, but the guilt has weight.\u000a\u000aCourtney, Stacy's oldest child, blames herself, too. She'd wanted to go with her mother that morning, but there wasn't room in the truck, and they'd wanted to keep tools in the back. What if Courtney had insisted? She'd taken swimming lessons. Could she have saved her mother's life?\u000a\u000aLikewise, Carolyn does not accept the death as natural.\u000a\u000aCourtney Ruffin visits the site of her mother's drowning in St. Helena Parish, Louisiana.\u000a\u000aAs she clung to the pecan tree, floodwaters rushing past, she fixated for a time on one thought, she told me: "Where did all this water come from?"\u000a\u000aSo much water. It had to have come from somewhere.\u000a\u000aCarolyn told me she believed that a dam had malfunctioned north of the crash site, in Mississippi. Perhaps it had cracked and then given way?\u000a\u000aThis wasn't just a little above the record. The records were shattered. Ken Graham, National Weather Service\u000a\u000aIt no doubt seemed that way, said Ken Graham, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service office that covers the New Orleans and Baton Rouge region. But there were no infrastructure failures of that type, he said. What Carolyn witnessed was a "historic" flood.\u000a\u000aGraham pointed to river gauges near Denham Springs, Louisiana. The previous record height for the Amite River was 41.5 feet, in 1983 , he said. Last August, the river crested at 46.2 feet.\u000a\u000a"This wasn't just a little above the record," he said. "The records were shattered."\u000a\u000aNear the end of my visit, I presented some of this information to Carolyn and Courtney.\u000a\u000aWe were sitting at the kitchen table, the only remaining photos of Stacy scattered about. One of her at a pizza parlor, years ago, a warm smile on her face. That smile was Stacy's essential quality, her mother told me. Even as a baby, Stacy always seemed to be grinning about something.\u000a\u000aI pulled up an article about Karin's climate attribution study on my phone. And I told them the gist, which is that global warming made this storm more likely and may have strengthened it.\u000a\u000aThey paused, taking it in.\u000a\u000aI wondered what conclusions Carolyn drew from that information. But I was afraid to ask.\u000a\u000aDoes this information change the way she feels about her daughter's death?\u000a\u000aWho -- or what -- killed Stacy Ruffin?\u000a\u000aScientists, of course, don't feel comfortable answering that question. They want to stick to observations, to the measurable facts of the atmosphere and other Earth systems. That's fine. But some attorneys and ethicists are beginning to explore the murky moral questions posed by the science of climate attribution, by an era when many disasters no longer are "natural."\u000a\u000aIf science can tell us that a certain storm was more likely, or more severe, because of climate change, couldn't someone -- somewhere -- be held liable for the pollution that contributed to the deaths and property damage associated with that storm?\u000a\u000aI called five climate law experts to ask that question.\u000a\u000aAll said no. At least, not yet.\u000a\u000aThe reason for the disconnect, said Dale Jamieson, a professor of environmental studies and philosophy and an affiliated professor of law at New York University, is that our moral compasses aren't built to take climate change seriously.\u000a\u000aConsider the typical Jack-and-Jill crime, he told me. Jack steals Jill's bike on purpose. It's clear, in this scenario, that Jack is to blame, and Jill is the victim. Jack meant to harm Jill.\u000a\u000aNow, consider a climate-change scenario. Jack drives to work in a high-polluting Hummer, which does contribute somewhat to global greenhouse-gas emissions. Maybe he buys electricity from a utility that gets its energy from a coal-fired power plant. That contributes, too.\u000a\u000aNow, Jill dies in a flood that scientists say was made much more likely by global warming.\u000a\u000aIs Jill a climate-change victim?\u000a\u000aIt would be difficult to say so definitively. What local conditions contributed to the flood that killed her? Were local governments promoting development in flood-prone areas? Were the streets graded safely? Did she choose to drive out into the flood; if so, does she share some blame?\u000a\u000aIn the case of Stacy Ruffin, you could criticize the family's decision to drive into a flood. You also could criticize local and state governments for rubber-stamping development in flood-prone areas and for planning but not building infrastructure designed to lessen the rush of floodwaters, said Craig Colten, professor of geography at Louisiana State University.\u000a\u000aColten pointed to a canal diversion project that was proposed after a 1983 flood; it would have helped drain water from a part of Louisiana devastated last year, Colten said. "They've only dug one part of it," he said. "It's far from being complete."\u000a\u000aNext, is Jack a climate-change perp?\u000a\u000aYes, but so are all other fossil fuel users around the globe. Perhaps you could blame Jack for only the percentage of global-warming emissions he contributed? That was the approach a Peruvian farmer, Saul Lliuya, took when he sued a German electric company over its alleged contribution to the melting of glaciers near his farm. The farmer tried to hold the power company, RWE, liable for some of the damage and asked the court to determine the company's percent contribution to global emissions, according to a report from the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. A judge threw out the case, saying there was no "linear causal chain" between the German company and the Peruvian glacier, the Columbia report says.\u000a\u000aMaybe that doesn't feel quite right? Try blaming the government.\u000a\u000aA group of 21 young people are suing the Trump administration in federal court in Eugene, Oregon , for allegedly violating their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property by supporting the development of fossil fuels when science shows those fuels are harmful. Some major questions plague that case, however, including: Why is the United States liable and not China, which now is the biggest climate polluter annually? And does the US government really control all aspects of energy policy, or do consumers and fossil fuel companies share in this, too?\u000a\u000aThe resulting quagmire is a situation in which harm is clearly being caused -- the World Health Organization expects climate change to cause an extra 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 , with those coming from increased cases of malaria, malnutrition, diarrhea and heat stress -- but everyone seems to be to blame.\u000a\u000aAnd therefore no one is to blame, as well.\u000a\u000a"Part of the problem, I think, with the whole climate change issue ... is, it is really different from other kinds of issues that humanity has faced," said Jamieson, from NYU. "And that creates two problems: Because it's different, we really don't know what the hell we're doing in trying to think about it. And the other is, we always try to domesticate it and make it conform to some other model we do understand."\u000a\u000aIn this case, he said, we should throw out the Jack-and-Jill crime model entirely.\u000a\u000aClimate change is different. It requires different thinking.\u000a\u000aI asked Jamieson: Did we all kill Stacy Ruffin?\u000a\u000aYes and no, he said.\u000a\u000aThe real point is to figure out how to avoid causing climate-related deaths. Perhaps the most effective and simplest way to start, he said (and many economists would agree), is to create a carbon tax\u000a\u000a"What that says is, 'OK, you're going to emit (greenhouse gas pollution), and that's going to increase the probability of screwing up the world,' " he said. "But you're going to pay for that. And we're going to take that money, and we're going to use that money to try to compensate the (people harmed or killed by climate change) and to help people adapt."\u000a\u000aThe other thing that's critical, Jamieson said, is understanding that just because you -- or your country -- didn't cause all of global warming, that doesn't mean you're not part of it.\u000a\u000aAnd just because it may be impossible to prove, in court, that climate change killed a particular person or flooded a particular house, that doesn't mean real losses aren't occurring.\u000a\u000a"You have to put a face on the victims."\u000a\u000a'I can never see her face'\u000a\u000aThe year after the storm has not been easy for Stacy's family.\u000a\u000aHer daughter, Courtney, left a nursing program at Southeastern Louisiana University and quit a job at a local hospital after the storm, she told me, because both reminded her too much of death.\u000a\u000aShe hopes to continue studying nursing but needed to step away.\u000a\u000aStacy's mother has become consumed by the mystery of the water.\u000a\u000aI finally got up the courage to ask Carolyn about global warming and the flood -- about the role of climate change in making freakish storms more likely.\u000a\u000aCarolyn told me it made sense that global warming probably supercharged the storm. And she told me that everyone who burns fossil fuels -- beyond what they absolutely need -- contributes.\u000a\u000a"Really, I would like to know myself" if global warming contributed to Stacy's death, said Carolyn. "I'm 69 years old, and I've never been in nothing like this.\u000a\u000a"I've never seen water like that."\u000a\u000aAre people who contribute to global warming to blame for Stacy's death?\u000a\u000aYes, she told me, if they're polluting more than they need to.\u000a\u000aCarolyn Ruffin was stranded in floodwater for about 22 hours before she was rescued.\u000a\u000aBut we all use electricity, she cautioned. How do you get around that? Carolyn told me she doesn't have enough money for solar panels, for instance, even though she'd like to have them.\u000a\u000aI was surprised by the frankness of her response.\u000a\u000aSitting there, looking a grieving mother in the eyes, I felt complicit in Stacy's death. I fly. I drive. I have an air conditioner. I felt guilty hopping a plane back home to Atlanta. It's true that individual actions -- eating beef instead of chicken, driving instead of biking, etc. -- do matter. There are ways you and I can reduce our carbon footprints and global-warming complicity.\u000a\u000aIt would be wrongheaded, however, to blame only individuals for this crisis -- and for Stacy's death. Governments and fossil fuel companies hold the power to change.\u000a\u000aIn many parts of the United States, it would be difficult -- and expensive -- to choose clean, renewable energy over polluting fuels like coal and natural gas. There's little reason for this. Iowa gets nearly 37% of its electricity from the wind . Carbon taxes and other policy tools would go further still, creating economic incentives for companies and citizens to do the right thing. It's a common misconception there's no solution to the climate crisis.\u000a\u000aWe know what to do. We lack the political will to do it.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration continues to deny basic facts about the climate change crisis. In May, President Donald Trump threw a middle finger to the planet -- and the future -- by pledging to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to limit dangerous warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Yet few of the countries participating in that agreement are doing enough, either. To avoid the worst of global warming, the world needs to be carbon neutral -- no net carbon pollution -- by midcentury, according to the latest research.\u000a\u000aWe often fail to reckon with the scale of change that's required.\u000a\u000aAnd we don't face the full consequences of inaction.\u000a\u000aWe pretend global warming is no big deal, a distant threat.\u000a\u000aWe don't look grieving mothers in the face.\u000a\u000aCarolyn has dreamed about Stacy often this year. In her dreams, she and Stacy are doing the things they always did together : shopping, playing Bingo, talking about football, which was Stacy's favorite sport. "Some people thought we were sisters," Carolyn told me. "If you see me, you see her. If you see her, you see me. We were together" all the time.\u000a\u000aBut in the dreams, one detail has changed.\u000a\u000a"I see her body," Carolyn said, "but I can never see her face."\u000a\u000aShe doesn't quite know what it means.\u000a\u000aWhy isn't Stacy all there?\u000a\u000aWhere did that vital part of her go?\u000a\u000aNo answer is enough to bring her daughter back.

aVWashington (CNN) The mysterious sonic attack on US diplomats stationed in Cuba is raising questions about weapons that sound more like something out of James Bond than reality.\u000a\u000aThe US believes sophisticated devices that operated outside the range of audible sound were deployed either inside or outside diplomats' residences in Havana, injuring at least 16 Americans, several senior State Department officials have told CNN.\u000a\u000aThe attacks, which began in November and ended this spring, left some with mild traumatic brain injury; two might have permanent hearing loss. And the invisible assaults may be continuing against other targets, with Canadian diplomats and their family members reporting similar symptoms in June.\u000a\u000aExperts say the question isn't just what kind of weapon might have been used, but whether the damage was caused by a weapon at all.\u000a\u000aWhile a multi-agency investigation is underway, publicly available information is largely anecdotal, and not a good basis for drawing conclusions, these experts warn. They point to a number of factors that raise doubts, including the fact that sonic weapons don't produce consistent results.\u000a\u000aOthers point to the political circumstances -- the attacks happened at a time when the US and Cuba were working to improve relations in the wake of the Obama administration's decision to end the decades-long US embargo against the island nation. Why choose that moment to engage in a particularly damaging harassment campaign?\u000a\u000aThere are other possibilities, including environmental factors, said experts like Sharon Weinberger, a journalist, and the author of "The Imagineers of War: The Untold Story of DARPA." Others, such as former Foreign Service Officer James Lewis, point to the possibility of human error, in particular a surveillance operation gone wrong.\u000a\u000a"Yes, some sort of badly working, nonlethal weapon could be the cause, but a) I doubt it, and b) I don't see the evidence for it yet," Weinberger said. "It's certainly possible, but I think it's too soon to jump to conclusions. You have to look across the board in some organized way what was being reported, what environmental causes could cause that."\u000a\u000a"Why would one want to use a weapon that causes inconsistent" harm, she asks.\u000a\u000aCuban surveillance\u000a\u000aLewis likes the odds on his theory.\u000a\u000a"There's 100% certainty that American diplomats were under Cuban surveillance," said Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "There's nowhere near that certainty that the Cubans were aiming sonic weapons at American diplomats. It could be harassment, but it's kind of weird."\u000a\u000aLewis says the use sound-based devices to conduct surveillance is common, and that Russia uses the method as well.\u000a\u000aIndeed, US investigators are probing whether a third country was involved as "payback" for actions the US has taken elsewhere and to "drive a wedge between the US and Cuba," a US official told CNN.\u000a\u000aLewis outlined the basics. "I bounce a signal off your window and it's affected by sound vibrations, typing on a keyboard or your voice," Lewis explained. "The signal comes back to me and I can use software to read it -- it will say, 'this disruption is caused by the letter Q.'" That allows listeners to piece together what's being said.\u000a\u000aLewis said that if the surveillance equipment was "misconfigured, (it) could produce inaudible noise." His theory: Cuban intelligence agents had set up surveillance on American communications "and it screwed up," Lewis said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED US: More victims of sonic weapon in Cuba Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US: More victims of sonic weapon in Cuba 02:07\u000a\u000aThe idea of using sound as a weapon "goes back almost to biblical times," said Weinberger. And indeed, it's used by militaries and police departments, as well as private companies.\u000a\u000aThe Israeli army has a device known as "the Screamer" that causes nausea and dizziness, according to NPR. American law enforcement officials have used sound cannons to control crowds in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and during the G20 meetings in Pittsburgh.\u000a\u000aThe BBC has reported about cruise ships that use a military-grade sonic weapon to repel Somali pirates. Malls in the UK have used high-frequency sound -- inaudible to most people over the age of 20 -- to discourage teenagers intent on loitering.\u000a\u000aBut repeatedly, studies have found "these weapons don't work across the board," Weinberger said. "What you see is that sound affects different people differently, and so it's not an effective weapon in that sense."\u000a\u000aWhatever injured the US diplomats stationed in Havana clearly had an effect. "We can confirm that at least 16 US government employees, members of our embassy community, have experienced some kind of symptoms," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe speed of infrasound\u000a\u000aThe fact that the mystery weapon was inaudible means it was either low frequency sound -- below audible range, also known as infrasound -- or it was high frequency, above audible range, and known as ultrasound.\u000a\u000aDr. Hung Jeffrey Kim, a neurotologist at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, said whatever happened in Havana more likely involved low frequency sound because it can travel much farther than ultrasound.\u000a\u000aDr. Scott Masten, a toxicologist at the National Institutes of Health, told CNN that, "At certain amplitude infrasound can cause physiological effects -- it can change heart rate, respiratory rates, blood pressure."\u000a\u000aA 2001 survey by the NIH found reports that low frequency sound could cause vertigo, imbalance, "intolerable sensations," incapacitation, disorientation, nausea, vomiting, bowel spasms and "resonances in inner organs, such as the heart."\u000a\u000aLow frequency sound can permanently affect balance and hearing, and can travel deep into your brain, causing nerve injury and potentially microhemorrhage, affecting cognitive function and memory if there's long-term exposure, Kim said.\u000a\u000aGlue and slashed tires\u000a\u000a"Most of us know that if you are exposed to a loud noise like a blast, you may experience hearing loss from it," said Kim. "However, if you have the low pitch sound or high pitch sound, like low frequency/high frequency sound, then you cannot really perceive these sounds."\u000a\u000aEven though low frequency sound can lead to "permanent damage to your ear, as well as in your brain," Kim said, "you don't know how long you've been hearing it or how loud these noises are."\u000a\u000aBoth Lewis and Weinberger point to that fact, and say that if the goal was to harass Americans, a silent, invisible attack wouldn't be psychologically effective because the victims wouldn't know they were being harassed.\u000a\u000aLewis said the Cubans have more effective and obvious ways to harass foreign diplomats. "They'll super glue your car -- the key -- that's a popular one," he said. "Or they'll pop your tires. If you're going to harass people, there are a lot more fun ways to do it."

aV(CNN) Nearly two years ago Abby Holmes and her husband Jeremiah left their home and jobs in Brooklyn for Columbus, Ohio.\u000a\u000aBetween 45% rent hikes and hyper-competitive hunts for a preschool for their son, the couple were ready to leave behind the big city life.\u000a\u000aIn Columbus they had extended family, affordable rent and, they hoped, the promise of an easier life. But a little over a year after moving, the couple has struggled to find full-time work. Last year, they made about $26,000, which was hardly enough to support the family of four.\u000a\u000aAbby Holmes, her husband Jeremiah and their two sons, Harry, 4 and Eli, 6 months. The Ohio family counted on Medicaid to make ends meet last year.\u000a\u000aThey've counted on government-funded Medicaid to cover doctor's visits, medications and the birth of their second child, Eli. Her family hasn't needed it yet, but Abby knows they could also turn to food assistance and other benefit programs.\u000a\u000aTheir situation isn't the only thing that's changed in the last year.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration and Congress have signaled sweeping plans to remake programs that affect the Holmes' and millions of other families. Medicaid, food stamps and rental assistance are among them. These families could find themselves losing the help they depend on to visit doctors, stay in their homes or put healthy food on the table.\u000a\u000a"We would have to regroup in an entire new way," Abby Holmes said of losing Medicaid. "I would be forced to look for full-time work. My kids would see me less ... and our take-home pay would not change because all of that new money would have to go for healthcare, so it is kind of a lose-lose. ... We're living paycheck to paycheck as it is."\u000a\u000aWhile Republican leaders failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in March, President Trump's administration has vowed to cut billions in federal poverty and health care programs and his secretary of Health and Human Services has promised to give states more control over social programs, which typically means budget cuts and diminished regulation.\u000a\u000aHow successful the Republican party will be in reshaping decades of social safety net programs is unclear as the party is deeply divided. President Trump promised during the campaign to "save" programs such as Medicaid "without cuts," but has since changed his position since the election.\u000a\u000aA Republican-led Congress and the White House now appear aligned and eager to make the most drastic changes in generations to federal entitlement programs that help those in need.\u000a\u000aWhere are safety net cuts most likely?\u000a\u000aThe programs most likely to face cuts are Medicaid and SNAP, a nutrition program that provides healthy food for families, housing vouchers and home energy assistance. Changing these programs from federal to state control could create a patchwork of programs that can be confusing and hard to access because of changing eligibility requirements.\u000a\u000aSome estimate the changes could eventually cut as much as 30% to 40% from the multi-billion-dollar budget for Medicaid, while changes to food stamp programs and the health insurance rules might make it harder for families to afford groceries or visits to the doctor.\u000a\u000aMedicaid covers 70 million low-income children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and people with disabilities, and SNAP helps 43 million people put food on the table.\u000a\u000aBut the GOP has signaled its intention to shift them from being open-ended entitlements to more-restricted block, or per capita, grants.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED In 2015, Trump promised not to cut Medicaid Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH In 2015, Trump promised not to cut Medicaid 01:13\u000a\u000aEntitlements are unlimited reimbursements to states that expand to cover anyone eligible for help during times of need, such as a recession or disaster.

If there's more demand for social services, states must make up the difference or cut benefits.\u000a\u000aCongressional Republicans proposed block grant plans in their budgets last year and Trump discussed them during the campaign. In a March letter to state governors (PDF), Tom Price, head of the Department of Health and Human Services, promised to give states "more freedom to design programs that meet the spectrum of diverse needs."\u000a\u000aBlock grant reforms "end the misguided one-size-fits-all approach that has tied the hands of so many state governments," said House Speaker Paul Ryan in a statement on his website . "States will no longer be shackled by federally determined program requirements and enrollment criteria."\u000a\u000aBeyond just state budgets, block grants can also change the way the programs work. Government leaders could, for example, institute requirements that Medicaid recipients have jobs, end federal rules that states pay for programs to help pregnant mothers quit smoking, or create a wait list for insurance.\u000a\u000a"We would go from a scenario where the government helps to guarantee access to certain levels of benefits to support kids and families, to a 'you're on your own, first-come-first-served' scenario," said Kelly Hardy, senior managing director for health policy at Children Now, a California advocacy group.\u000a\u000aPushing for change\u000a\u000aRepublican and conservative thinkers have pushed to turn entitlement programs into block grants for decades. Ryan, 47, famously said in March that he'd been "dreaming" of cutting Medicaid since he was " drinking out of a keg ."\u000a\u000aThey argue that the free-spending entitlement approach to poverty and social services hasn't succeeded. The nation's poverty rate hasn't changed dramatically since the 1970s, when programs like SNAP and Medicaid were first introduced and the percentage of children in poverty hasn't declined since 1970 , five years after Medicaid and other "War on Poverty" welfare programs were first signed into law.\u000a\u000a"We don't know what works best," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute. "But we know what we're doing isn't working. Experimentation seems like a good idea."\u000a\u000aThat flexibility of block grants could let states tailor social service programs to the needs of their residents, supporters argue.\u000a\u000aFor example, under block grants, states could combine nutritional benefit money with healthcare funds to offer people at risk of obesity intense nutritional counseling early in life, before they require expensive treatment for diabetes or heart disease, said Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank that has pushed block-grant programs.\u000a\u000a"We tend to put things in silos," Miller said of the social safety net. "If your focus is on improving people's health you would think about what could be rearranged. How do we best assist the person in front of us, if you could reshape it and bundle together what the government is offering? Maybe housing is the thing that is going to make them healthy, not another doctor visit."\u000a\u000aMiller pointed to a 2015 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that gave disabled people on Medicaid cash allowances to spend money on in-home health services they thought they needed instead of trying to file for benefit programs. The study found that issuing cash allowances cost the government slightly more, but only because people more easily accessed the help they were entitled to in the first place.\u000a\u000a"States are the 50 experiments, the labs of democracy," said Tanner of the Cato Institute. "Right now we treat everything as an identical cookie cutter, but maybe a state wants to focus on housing, or the universal basic income, or increasing work requirements."\u000a\u000aDoing more with less\u000a\u000aBut critics say the talk of innovation distracts from the fact that block grants reduce federal spending.\u000a\u000a"Having looked at these proposals, it seems easy to determine that the decision that will be left to the states will be how to deal with less federal money," said Matt Broaddus, a research analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think-tank that specializes in welfare policy.\u000a\u000astudy by the nonpartisfan Urban Institute found. In West Virginia, where 53% of children are covered by Medicaid, a shift to per capita or lump sum block grants could leave state leaders with a $4 to $7 billion shortfall in federal spending over 10 years, astudy by the nonpartisfan Urban Institute found.\u000a\u000a"If that happens, then we have to figure out where to cut," said Renate Pore, interim executive director of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care. "Are they going to cut services, like dental care? Are they going to reduce the number of people eligible? People will have coverage that is less affordable, especially children."\u000a\u000a"These are all bad choices," Pore added.b\u000a\u000aDr. Lynda Young, a primary care pediatrician in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that if Medicaid funding was reduced, fewer doctors might treat Medicaid patients and parents could find it harder and more expensive to bring their children to the doctor.\u000a\u000a"When the money is gone, what is going to happen to the kids?" she asked. "They don't come for routine care, so we're talking about their general development and health. We look at lead when they come in, we look at anemia, we look at making sure they have enough to eat."\u000a\u000aIn Ohio, parents like Abby Holmes might find themselves without coverage while their children have less Medicaid coverage than they did before. Under Republican plans, Ohio could lose $22 to $40 billion in federal health funding from 2019 to 2028, according to the Urban Institute\u000a\u000aAnd while block grants may promise states a reasonable amount of money when first implemented, studies have shown that over time other social safety net block grants for housing and health insurance don't grow to account for inflation, rising costs or population changes, leaving states with less spending power each year.\u000a\u000aThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities studied 13 federal block grants for programs like child care, substance abuse and maternal health and found that between 2000 and 2016, federal funding fell an average of 26%. Few states could make up the shortfalls and instead reduced benefits or cut people from the programs.\u000a\u000aIn California, where 42% of children are covered by the state's Medi-Cal program, families could be forced to spend months on waiting lists before they get coverage.\u000a\u000a"We've done this before," said Hardy of Children Now, referring to of earlier California budget cuts. "At one point we had 90,000 kids on a waitlist for a program that overall had a million kids in it."\u000a\u000aCutting additional programs\u000a\u000aWhile cuts to Medicaid would be the largest and most dramatic changes to federal entitlements under the new Republican plans, they would also potentially cut millions of dollars for the federal government's food stamp entitlement program, which covers 43 million low-income Americans, almost 70% of whom are families with children.\u000a\u000aThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, called SNAP, functions much the same way a Medicaid entitlement does: Anyone eligible for the benefit will be covered and the federal government will reimburse states. But the program could be shifted to block grants, providing a fixed amount of money to states for those who need help buying food.\u000a\u000a"Let's assume the block-grant funding" stays flat, said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "That means that SNAP can't expand to meet needs if a state or even a community experiences a downturn, say if a plant closes."\u000a\u000aLike Medicaid, cuts to SNAP could mean fewer people would be eligible for benefits or might have to wait longer to receive them.\u000a\u000a"It becomes a real tension when benefits are cut, because SNAP is part of the household budget" Dean said. "At some point you're going to give up your house rather than allow your kids to go hungry."\u000a\u000aAnother program that could be changed to a block grant is Social Security Income, which provides as much as $733 a month in cash assistance to 8.4 million poor and disabled people, including 1.3 million disabled or blind children. Many of the children who receive SSI live with a single parent and receive special education.\u000a\u000aUnder block grants, states could make it harder for parents with disabled children to receive benefits or could cut the monthly amount of money they receive.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump and Ryan have made clear they hope to reduce federal spending by reforming Medicaid and rolling back the expansion of other programs that support children, the cost savings now could lead to higher expenses a few decades from now, advocates said. Children who have grown up without healthy food or easy access to doctors struggle with chronic, expensive health problems for the rest of their lives.\u000a\u000a"As people grow up without adequate medical care, that really is a big problem," said Marcia Lowry, head of A Better Childhood, which advocates for abused and neglected children. "It is going to have a big impact on the population, especially the poor population, as they grow up."

aVBut despite popular health claims about coconut oil, a report from the American Heart Association recently advised against its use , stating that it increases LDL cholesterol (a cause of cardiovascular disease) and has no known offsetting effects.\u000a\u000a"There are many claims being made about coconut oil being wonderful for lots of different things, but we really don't have any evidence of long-term health benefits," said Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\u000a\u000aHow exactly, then, does coconut oil rank among oils?\u000a\u000a"Coconut oil is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum in terms of types of fats. It's probably better than partially hydrogenated oils (which are) high in trans fats but not as good as the more unsaturated plant oils that have proven health benefits, like olive and canola oil," Willett said.\u000a\u000a"It's probably not quite as 'bad' as butter but not as good as extra virgin olive oil," agreed Kevin Klatt, a molecular nutrition researcher at Cornell University who is studying the metabolic effects of coconut oil.\u000a\u000aKlatt cautions that we should not develop too strong of an opinion about coconut oil without more data. "But at the same time, you have to be evidence-based ... and (currently), the evidence reflects benefits for olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds -- so that should be the focus in the diet."\u000a\u000aWhat's in coconut oil?\u000a\u000aCoconut oil is extracted from the meat of the fruit. It contains mostly saturated fat, which is also found in large quantities in butter and red meat. Like other saturated fats, coconut oil increases LDL cholesterol, the "bad" cholesterol associated with increased risk of heart disease. In fact, coconut oil has more saturated fat and raises LDL more than butter, according to Willett.\u000a\u000aBut coconut oil does a particularly nice job of raising HDL, the "good" cholesterol, especially when replacing carbohydrates in the diet. This may be due to its high content of a fatty acid known as lauric acid.\u000a\u000a"Coconut oil is half lauric acid, which is a little bit unique," Klatt said, as the acid seems to raise HDL more than other saturated fats and is rarely found in such high amounts in foods.\u000a\u000aStill, though the increase in HDL seen with consumption of coconut oil may offset some of the disease risk, it's still not as good as consuming unsaturated oils, which not only raise HDL but lower LDL, according to Willett.\u000a\u000aComplicating matters is the fact that we still don't know for sure what exactly a high HDL translates to in terms of health risk. "There's been debate about the role of HDL," Willett cautioned. "Partly because there are many forms of HDL which have different health consequences ... which has made the water murky."\u000a\u000aFor example, there are different forms of HDL that do different things. One role is to help take LDL cholesterol out of the bloodstream. "But some forms of HDL don't do that," Willett said, "so we don't know for sure that higher HDL is better."\u000a\u000aAnd while it's true that an elevated LDL level is only a risk factor for heart disease and doesn't always translate to heart attacks, it's still cause for concern. "High LDL is a risk factor, but it strongly predicts negative health events," Willett said.\u000a\u000aThere is extremely preliminary evidence that the increase in LDL may not be as pronounced if one consumes extra virgin coconut oil instead of refined coconut oil, according to Klatt. For example, polyphenols present in unrefined oils may help to blunt the effects on LDL. But "the effects of extra virgin compared to refined coconut oil and other common oils require further study," he cautioned.\u000a\u000aCoconut oil and weight loss\u000a\u000aSome research suggests that coconut oil may be helpful in reducing belly fat, at least in the short term. One study found that coconut oil was associated with reduced waist circumference (belly fat) compared with soybean oil. Participants also consumed a lot more fiber, followed a low-calorie diet and walked for about an hour each day.\u000a\u000a"Even if coconut oil does help reduce belly fat, it doesn't necessarily outweigh the concern about its effect on lipids, specifically LDL," Klatt said.\u000a\u000aOther research has touted benefits such as increased metabolism, reduced appetite or improved cognitive function associated with fats known as MCTs, or medium chain triglycerides, which are present in coconut oil.\u000a\u000a"You can't infer from ... studies what coconut oil will and will not do. We need better controlled trials," Klatt said. "Right now, the internet is jumping the gun and going way beyond the evidence."\u000a\u000aCoco-calories\u000a\u000aLike other oils, coconut oil is calorie-dense, which means consuming large amounts without reducing other calorie sources can lead to weight gain. Just one tablespoon has 120 calories, about the same as a large apple or four cups of air-popped popcorn.\u000a\u000a"Oil is a really easy way to increase the energy density of a food. Things like almonds have a lot of fat, but it's easier to overeat pure oil than overeat pure almonds," Klatt said.\u000a\u000aIn small amounts, however, coconut oil can have a place in one's diet.\u000a\u000a"It's not that you have to absolutely avoid coconut oil but rather limit coconut oil to where you really need that special flavor, like for Thai food or for baking a special dessert," Willett said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"If you love using butter and need a hard fat, coconut oil may be a better choice and is certainly fine to consume occasionally, when a recipe calls for it," Klatt added.\u000a\u000aBut for day-to-day use, vegetable oils such as olive, canola or soybean oil, along with nuts and seeds, should be your primary fats. "These have better effects on blood cholesterol and long-term studies showing reduced risk of heart disease," Willett said.

aV(CNN) It is one of the most popular sports in the world, practiced by 28 million people in more than 200 countries.\u000a\u000aThis month, Budapest is hosting the 2017 World Judo Championships where nearly 800 judokas will be hoping to pin down a gold medal and enter the sport's pantheon of greats.\u000a\u000aWith the competition kicking off on August 28, we take a look at Judo's rules, history, its guiding principles, and some of the stars to watch at this year's showpiece.\u000a\u000a'The gentle way'\u000a\u000aJudo was founded back in Japan in 1882 by Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d who envisaged not just a martial art (bujutsu) but a way of life.\u000a\u000aThe Japanese word means "gentle way" in English and its defining technical principle is to use the strength of an opponent against them.\u000a\u000aIn a competitive setting, judoka aim to throw, pin or force their rival into a submission which is signaled by saying the word "maitta," or by tapping the mat or the opponent at least twice.\u000a\u000aKey Terms Judoka - Practitioner of judo Judogi - Judo uniform Tatami - Judo mat Sensei - Judo teacher\u000a\u000aHolding techniques include applying pressure to an opponent's neck or manipulating the elbow joint, but thrusts and strikes -- common in martial arts like karate -- are only permitted in pre-arranged forms, or "kata," of the sport.\u000a\u000aAfter taking to the mat, called the tatami, regulation bouts last four minutes for both males and females.\u000a\u000aCompetitors wear either blue or white, with the universal judo uniform known as the judogi.

aVPresident Trump's two business advisory groups have fallen apart because of his remarks on Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aAs one CEO after another quit one of the two councils, Trump said on Wednesday that he was disbanding both of them.\u000a\u000aHe tweeted: "Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!"\u000a\u000aTrump had hoped the two councils would help him achieve a major goal of his administration -- creating jobs, especially in manufacturing. The idea was to hear advice from top CEOs.\u000a\u000aBut those executives began walking away after Trump insisted that violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville was perpetrated by many sides.\u000a\u000aEight members of the manufacturing council quit this week, starting with Ken Frazier, CEO of Merck, early Monday morning.\u000a\u000aThe second group, the Strategic and Policy Forum, was led by Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman. It included some of the biggest players in finance and business: JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, PepsiCo (PEP) CEO Indra Nooyi, General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra, and Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon. It had met several times since it was established shortly after the election.\u000a\u000aIn a statement Wednesday, members of the Strategic and Policy Forum said that "intolerance, racism and violence have absolutely no place in this country and are an affront to core American values."\u000a\u000a"We believe the debate over Forum participation has become a distraction from our well-intentioned and sincere desire to aid vital policy discussions on how to improve the lives of everyday Americans. As such, the President and we are disbanding the Forum," the group said.\u000a\u000aSome top executives sought to make clear that they resigned from the advisory councils before Trump stepped in to dissolve them.\u000a\u000a"Alex Gorsky had made his decision to resign from the council earlier today before the president's tweet. As we said in our previous statement, the president's remarks yesterday equating those who are motivated by race-based hate with those who stand up against hatred were unacceptable," Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.\u000a\u000aDimon also put out a statement to show that he "personally supported" breaking up the Strategic and Policy Forum.\u000a\u000a"I strongly disagree with President Trump's reaction to the events that took place in Charlottesville over the past several days," Dimon said.\u000a\u000aAnd General Electric (GE) chairman Jeff Immelt said he notified members of the manufacturing council this morning that he "could no longer serve."\u000a\u000aThe flurry of resignations from the manufacturing council, which Trump established in January, began Monday after Merck's Frazier abruptly quit the council. He said that "America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy."\u000a\u000aTrump fired back an hour after Frazier's announcement. He tweeted that the Merck CEO "will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!"\u000a\u000a"The council itself is totally ineffective. It's never met," Richard Trumka, the AFL-CIO head who quit the manufacturing council on Tuesday, told "CBS This Morning." "It's a subterfuge to be able to deregulate industry."\u000a\u000aHe continued: "But it's the symbolism of being associated with it that we rejected yesterday."\u000a\u000aBy Wednesday, Frazier was followed by Kevin Plank, CEO of Under Armour; Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel; Scott Paul, president of Alliance for American Manufacturing; Thea Lee, economist at AFL-CIO; Richard Trumka, President of AFL-CIO; Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M; and Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Co.\u000a\u000aIn June, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who advocates clean energy, resigned from the manufacturing initiative and a separate economic advisory group. Musk was protesting Trump's decision to withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

aV(CNN) A new secret society has taken over London's Somerset House.\u000a\u000aThe neoclassical building's terrace rooms have been converted to an exhibition hall and headquarters -- complete with gin bar -- for the Learned Society of Extra Ordinary Objects, a fictional society based on the private societies that were residents of Somerset House during the 18th and 19th centuries.\u000a\u000aAccording to a placard at the entrance, the Learned Society was founded in 1717 and closed in 1973 "due to the Society's crippling debts," but has now been revived by a group of 30 designers, artists and makers. Together they have furnished the space with everyday objects with compelling origins.\u000a\u000aMost objects -- rubber bands, playing cards, a framed blonde mustache -- have been borrowed from members' personal collections and are accompanied by explanatory text from their owners.

aVStory highlights Mark O'Mara: Marcellus Williams, convicted of murdering Felicia Gayle in 1998, has been granted a stay of execution\u000a\u000aA lack of DNA evidence on the murder weapon suggests Williams may be innocent, writes O'Mara\u000a\u000aMark O'Mara is a CNN legal analyst and a criminal defense attorney. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Marcellus Williams was convicted 16 years ago for the 1998 murder of Felicia Gayle, a former reporter in St. Louis, Missouri. She had been stabbed dozens of times and left to die with the murder weapon, a knife, still embedded in her.\u000a\u000aA jury of 12 people looked at the evidence, listened to witnesses and decided beyond a reasonable doubt that Williams was guilty. The problem is that the system may have failed in several significant ways.\u000a\u000aI don't know yet if he's guilty or innocent. There's simply not sufficient time to review it all and come to an opinion, but it's time to take time. Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, who just hours before Williams' scheduled execution on Tuesday granted a stay and empaneled a "board of inquiry" to look into the case, should be congratulated on taking a common sense, "let's be certain" approach to a difficult issue.\u000a\u000aMark O'Mara\u000a\u000aWe also know two facts that should lead to an immediate stay of execution and a complete review of the case. Gayle was savagely stabbed to death with a knife that was left in her chest and Williams' DNA was simply not on that knife.\u000a\u000aThe prosecutors of the state of Missouri, in opposing a stay of Williams' execution, made a mistake. We should simply pause to make sure we do it right, particularly when there is compelling evidence that Williams may be factually innocent. We've known for decades that DNA evidence is very precise and, although not completely infallible, can by its existence damn a person or exonerate one.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Tunisia is still counting the cost of the worst terror attacks in its modern history.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, ISIS attacks in Sousse and Tunis killed 60 people. The majority of the victims were European tourists.\u000a\u000aThe attacks took a heavy toll on the country's tourism sector, which accounts for around one-sixth of GDP and provides employment for more than 200,000 people.\u000a\u000aVisitor numbers fell by 25% to 5.4 million in 2015, and revenue from tourists dropped by 35% to $1.1 billion. Mass unemployment and business closures ravaged the resorts.\u000a\u000aBut after two barren years there are signs the industry is finally coming back to life.\u000a\u000aA tourist on a sunbed on the Tunisian resort island of Djerba. Visitor numbers fell by 25% in 2015 after ISIS attacks on tourist sites.\u000a\u000aBouncing back\u000a\u000aThere is growing confidence among tourism professionals that the storm has passed.\u000a\u000a"The biggest tour operators are back," says Mohamed Ali Toumi, president of the Tunisian Federation of Travel Agencies. "All the hotels located on the seafront are full this summer."\u000a\u000aAlternative tour operator Autre Tunisie is seeing greater demand.\u000a\u000a"We have experienced a slight recovery in activity since the fourth quarter of 2016," says manager Hubert Henaff. "This return has been confirmed since the beginning of the year and is accelerating during this summer period."\u000a\u000aOptimism is borne out by statistics. The latest figures from the National Office of Tunisian Tourism (ONTT) show 3.6 million visitors to July 31 this year, a 27% increase year-on-year. Visitors from Europe increased by 15% over the same period.\u000a\u000aThe latter figure will be boosted further by the British government's withdrawal of an advisory against travel to Tunisia, following France and Germany, which had already relaxed restrictions. Britain was one of Tunisia's most valuable markets before the 2015 attacks, and operators are keen to rebuild ties.\u000a\u000a"We would like to go back as soon as possible," says Can Deniz, managing director of Just Sunshine, a travel agent specializing in UK-Tunisia travel. "We are in talks to provide a daily service to Tunis from London so that we can sell packages as early as next week. There is strong demand from the public."\u000a\u000aTourists on a beach in Sousse a year after the attacks. Recent statistics show a recovery of visitor numbers.\u000a\u000aAdapting to terror\u000a\u000aThe Tunisian government has taken a series of steps to support the tourism industry through its crisis.\u000a\u000aA package of " exceptional measures " were introduced after the attack in Sousse, including financial support for tourist institutions, reduced taxes, and relaxed visa requirements.\u000a\u000aExtra security has been deployed around tourist sites, a factor cited by the British government in its decision to change travel advice.\u000a\u000a"The Tunisians deserve credit for implementing extra security and training to make sure it is a safe destination" says Rochelle Turner, research director at the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). "Tunisia is actually more peaceful than many countries we wouldn't hesitate to visit...but they have helped the recovery by addressing any weaknesses there may have been."\u000a\u000aThe WTTC has studied the impact of terror attacks on tourist destinations and found that tourism typically suffers for 13 to 21 months. But Turner believes that Tunisia may have sustained more serious damage as it experienced two high-profile attacks in quick succession, and suggests a new approach may be necessary to continue the recovery.\u000a\u000a"One way is to lower prices," she says, as well as marketing "new experiences, and (to) new groups of people."\u000a\u000aA member of the Tunisian security forces stands guard at the National Bardo Museum in Tunis after an attack on foreign tourists. Security has been bolstered at tourist sites across the country.\u000a\u000aChallenges remain\u000a\u000aTunisian tourism authorities recognize that recovery will not be a quick fix.\u000a\u000a"The threat of terrorism always causes medium to long term damage, and Tunisia is no exception," says Mounira Derbel Ben Cherifa, UK director of the ONTT.\u000a\u000aThe industry pivoted towards domestic tourists while Europeans stayed away, says Ben Charifa, and new markets such as China.\u000a\u000aBut so far new arrivals have not provided the same value. In 2016, the numbers of tourists rose slightly but overall revenue fell.\u000a\u000aThe pattern has continued this year with revenue lagging behind visitor numbers, and is not expected to reach the 2014 total of around $1.7 billion.\u000a\u000aChebel is counting on returning Europeans to make up the shortfall, which would allow Tunisia to "regain our normal position lost in the last two years."\u000a\u000aHer optimism is widely shared within the industry, but there is also recognition that the recovery is far from complete -- and vulnerable to sudden shocks.\u000a\u000a"We are confident in the resumption of Tunisian tourism and in the return of foreign visitors," says Henaff of Autre Tunisie. "Provided that no serious fact disrupts this."

Well, guess what? Now over 150 countries have announced their targets for emissions reductions, including India. Now, they're not enough yet and - for - by anybody - we've all got to move more\u2026.\u000a\u000aTRANSCRIPT\u000a\u000aTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\u000a\u000aFAREED ZAKARIA, HOST: Let me ask you about climate change, Mr. Secretary. You are embarking on a big push for the Paris summit. You gave a speech this week. In that speech, you were very eloquent in criticizing critics in the United States who are still skeptical about climate change.\u000a\u000aBut what do you say to those who say, look, that's all well and good, but the real skeptics, in a sense, are countries like India and Indonesia and, to an extent, even China, despite some changes, that still continue to use massive amounts of coal, emit huge amounts of carbon dioxide; and that whatever the United States or Western - or Europe may do, that's the real problem; and in those countries, they want to develop, they're not going to stop themselves from developing; the Paris treaty is not legally binding; so we will just cripple ourselves without doing much for climate change?\u000a\u000aJOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, Fareed, that's the challenge. And it doesn't make a lot of sense to develop and kill yourself as you do it. It - you know, we've learned lessons about the downsides of the way in which we have produced energy - electricity and power and transportation and so forth - over centuries now. And we have to move to a low-carbon economy, all of us.\u000a\u000aIf the United States, all by itself, tomorrow, were to drive, you know, carpool to work and bicycle to work and plant a bunch of trees and lower our emissions to zero, we can't solve the problem alone. India, China, every country in the world has to be part of it.\u000a\u000aNow that's why President Obama reached an agreement with President Xi - a ground-breaking, historic agreement - to join together to announce the intended emissions reductions that both countries would make as part of the Paris negotiations in hopes of inspiring other countries to do the same.\u000a\u000aWell, guess what? Now over 150 countries have announced their targets for emissions reductions, including India.\u000a\u000aNow, they're not enough yet and - for - by anybody - we've all got to move more. But if we come together in Paris - and I believe we can and hopefully will - to have an ambitious set of targets that we will all try to reach - not, you know - that we all agree to voluntarily try to reach - that will be an incredible signal to the marketplace, which already is seeing investment move into clean, alternative renewable different kinds of energy production. The solution to climate change is energy policy.\u000a\u000aSo it's a question of what choices we need to make in order to preserve our ability on this planet to produce food, to have water, to live where people live today without massive dislocations of human beings, without massive damage from intensified storms and wildfires and droughts, and all of the downsides that we're already beginning to measure.\u000a\u000aSo this is actually opportunity, not downside. And I think Paris will help define the full breadth of that opportunity.

aVRepublicans in Congress have long vowed that they can make health care more affordable and accessible. Americans will now see if they can keep that promise.\u000a\u000aLawmakers have spent hours upon hours debating the GOP's Obamacare repeal bill, deflecting Democrats' attempt to delay the plan's advancement. Two House committees approved the bill on Thursday after marathon hearings.\u000a\u000aWhile the bill will likely change a lot before it lands on President Trump's desk, it's already possible to identify some winners and losers in the individual market and Medicaid.\u000a\u000aRelated: Republicans unveil bill to repeal and replace Obamacare\u000a\u000aTitled the American Health Care Act, the legislation calls for providing refundable tax credits based on a person's age and income. It keeps the Obamacare protections for those with pre-existing conditions, but it allows insurers to levy a 30% surcharge for a year on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse. It lifts the taxes that Obamacare had imposed on the wealthy, insurers and prescription drug manufacturers. And it loosens one of the law's strict insurance reforms so that carriers can offer a wider array of policies that pick up less of the tab for getting care.\u000a\u000aThe bill also eliminates the enhanced federal match for Medicaid expansion starting in 2020 and revamps the funding for the entire Medicaid program.\u000a\u000aRepublican lawmakers have repeatedly skirted criticisms that the bill will likely leave millions uninsured, but reviews of preliminary drafts by the Congressional Budget Office confirmed the problem, sources said. Also, a recent S&P Global report estimated that up to 10 million people could lose their coverage.\u000a\u000a"With Medicaid reductions and smaller tax credits, this bill would clearly result in fewer people insured than under the ACA," said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "The House GOP proposal seeks to reduce what the federal government spends on health care, and that inevitably means more people uninsured."\u000a\u000aExperts remain divided over the impact on the individual market. Some say insurers would flee or jack up their rates if millions of people drop out. Others contend that the Republican bill would stabilize the market and premiums because the reforms would give insurers more flexibility and entice more younger enrollees to sign up for coverage.\u000a\u000a"If we let the ACA continue on its current trajectory, people really will lose coverage," said Doug Badger, senior fellow at the Galen Institute, a free-market, health-care think tank.\u000a\u000aHere's who would likely lose under the Republican plan:\u000a\u000aLower-income folks could be left uninsured\u000a\u000aObamacare contains many provisions to help poor and lower-income Americans. It expanded Medicaid to cover adults who earn up to $16,400 a year -- some 11 million people in 31 states and the District of Columbia are now insured as a result.\u000a\u000aAlso, those with incomes just under $30,000 receive generous subsidies to lower their premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs on the individual market.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would reverse much of this. It would end the enhanced federal Medicaid funding for new enrollees starting in 2020. Those already in the program could stay as long as they remain continuously insured. But since up to half have a break in coverage each year, it's likely participation would fall off quickly, said Jocelyn Guyer, managing director at Manatt Health, a consulting firm.\u000a\u000aBut the Republican bill would go beyond just eliminating Medicaid expansion. It would overhaul the whole program, which covers more than 70 million people, by sending states a fixed amount of money per enrollee, known as a per-capita cap. This would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. However, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments.\u000a\u000aRelated: Higher-income Americans win under Republican plan to repeal Obamacare\u000a\u000aAll this could hurt not only poor adults, but also low-income children, women, senior citizens and the disabled.\u000a\u000aThe legislation also would eliminate the subsidies that reduce deductibles and co-pays for moderate-income policyholders on the individual market. And the tax credits it would provide would not go as far Obamacare's subsidies.\u000a\u000aFolks making $20,000 a year take the biggest hit at any age under the GOP plan, a recent Kaiser study found. A 27-year-old would get only $2,000, instead of $3,225 under Obamacare, on average, while a 40-year-old would get $3,000 versus nearly $4,150.\u000a\u000aHowever, the biggest loser would be a 60-year-old, who would receive only $4,000, instead of nearly $9,900 under Obamacare.\u000a\u000aOlder Americans could have to pay more\u000a\u000aEnrollees in their 50s and early 60s benefited from Obamacare because insurers could only charge them three times more than younger policy holders. The bill would widen that band to five-to-one.\u000a\u000aThat would mean that adults ages 60 to 64 would see their annual premiums soar 22%, or nearly $3,200, to nearly $18,000, according to a study by the Milliman actuarial firm on behalf of the AARP Public Policy Institute. Those in their 50s would be hit with a 13% increase, or just over $1,500, and pay an annual premium of $12,800.\u000a\u000aAlso, the GOP bill doesn't provide them as generous tax credits as Obamacare. A 60-year-old making $40,000 would get only $4,000 from the Republican plan, instead of an average subsidy of $6,750 from the Affordable Care Act, according the Kaiser study.\u000a\u000aThe sick could get coverage, but it could be more limited\u000a\u000aThe GOP plan actually provides stronger protections for those with pre-existing conditions than some prior Republican proposals. Like Obamacare, it requires insurers cover these folks and prevents carriers from charging them more because of their health.\u000a\u000aBut the Republican plan would lift the requirement that insurers cover a certain share of the cost of getting care. This change would allow carriers to offer a wider selection of policies, including more with higher deductibles and co-pays. That could make it more difficult to find plans with low deductibles that the sick often want.\u000a\u000a(However, the bill does not lift the Obamacare provision that limits how much enrollees have to pay out of pocket each year. For this year, the maximum is $7,150.)\u000a\u000aHere's who would likely win:\u000a\u000aYounger Americans could get cheaper plans\u000a\u000aObamacare was designed so that younger policyholders would help subsidize older ones. That would change under the Republican bill because it would allow insurers to charge older folks more.\u000a\u000aThis means that younger Americans would likely see their annual premiums go down. Enrollees age 20 to 29 would save about $700 a year to $4,000, on average, according to the Milliman study for the AARP.\u000a\u000aRelated: Full text: GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare\u000a\u000aThose under age 30 would also get a refundable tax credit of up to $2,000 to offset the cost of their premiums, as long as their income doesn't exceed $215,000 for an individual. It's more likely that younger folks who are earlier in their careers would fall under this cap.\u000a\u000aThe GOP tax credits would also likely be more generous than Obamacare's subsidies for these folks. For example, a 27-year-old making $40,000 a year would receive $2,000 under the GOP plan, but only gets a $103 subsidy from Obamacare, on average, a Kaiser analysis found.\u000a\u000aAlso, the bill keeps the Obamacare provision that lets young adults up to age 26 stay on their parents' insurance plan.\u000a\u000aThe healthy could buy less expensive policies\u000a\u000aUnder Obamacare, only enrollees under age 30 and certain other people could buy catastrophic plans, which had lower monthly premiums but higher deductibles. In 2017, catastrophic plans came with $7,150 deductibles, but Obamacare enrollees couldn't use subsides to pay the premiums.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would open up such policies to everyone and allow enrollees to use tax credits.\u000a\u000aThis change, however, may not have as big an impact since insurers already offer plans with high deductibles that are eligible for Obamacare subsidies. Republicans dropped a provision from a prior draft that would have allowed carriers to sell policies that covered fewer benefits, such as maternity and prescription drugs. That would have made more of a difference for healthy consumers because they could opt for skimpier plans with lower premiums.\u000a\u000aHigher-income Americans could get tax breaks and perks\u000a\u000aThe legislation would eliminate two taxes that Obamacare levied on the wealthy to help pay for the law. Nearly everyone in the Top 1%, who earn more than $774,000 a year, would enjoy a hefty tax cut, averaging $33,000, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. Those in the Top 0.1% would get an average tax cut of about $197,000.\u000a\u000aAnd the bill would allow folks to contribute more to Health Savings Accounts, which are primarily used by better-off Americans who can afford to sock money away for health care expenses.\u000a\u000aAlso, the Republicans would enable people higher on the income scale to claim the tax credit to help pay their premiums. Under Obamacare, an enrollee who makes more than $47,500 is no longer eligible for a subsidy. The GOP plan would let a policyholder making up to $75,000 claim the full tax credit. The benefit would phase out slowly until the enrollee hits $215,000 in income.\u000a\u000aInsurance companies could get a big tax break\u000a\u000aObamacare allowed insurance companies to deduct only $500,000 of their executives' pay as a business expense. The GOP bill would repeal that limitation, starting in 2018.\u000a\u000aTop insurers pay their leaders millions in compensation every year so this provision could mean a nice tax savings for the companies.\u000a\u000aCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated that the bill would allow insurers to sell plans without Obamacare's required health benefits, such as maternity and prescription drugs.

aVRebecca Wallwork, CNN \u2022 Updated 18th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 The world-famous Ocean Drive is one of the most photographed stretches of Miami Beach.\u000a\u000aBut, with its neon lights and sidewalk cafes serving beer-garitas for two, it's not known for being a high-end destination.\u000a\u000aThe exception, nestled amid low-rise Art Deco hotels, with streams of tourists strolling past, is the Villa Casa Casuarina -- better known as the Versace Mansion.\u000a\u000aWhat many of those selfie-snapping tourists outside may not realize is that the former home of late fashion designer Gianni Versace isn't a museum or private home, but a hotel.\u000a\u000aAnd it's a hotel where guests can sleep in what was Versace's bedroom. Or in the bedroom of his sister Donatella. Or perhaps the suite where Madonna used to stay when she visited Versace in the '90s and helped put the Miami Beach neighborhood of South Beach on the national scene.\u000a\u000aIf a $1,000-plus-a-night hotel room is out of reach, members of the public can indulge in the villa's Baroque grandeur with a dinner reservation at Gianni's, and an aperitif in the intimate, clubby Onyx Bar, in the space that used to be Versace's kitchen.\u000a\u000aSince Versace's death -- he was shot dead on the steps of his mansion in 1997, thus the camera-wielding tourists outside -- the property has changed management a couple of times.\u000a\u000aHowever even now, 20 years later, under the ownership of Jordache Enterprises, it retains the designer's over-the-top splendor. (Donatella auctioned off some of the home's contents in 2001, but what remains are the richly decorated walls, floors, ceilings and windows, plus the pool, garden and southern wing.)\u000a\u000aThe best-known property on Ocean Drive\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 9 House-turned-hotel: The former home of late fashion designer Gianni Versace has been transformed into one of Miami's most opulent hotels.\u000a\u000aThe unapologetic opulence of Casa Casuarina made it an obvious location for filming the upcoming TV series "The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story", which will air on FX in early 2018.\u000a\u000aThis May, tourists along Ocean Drive were treated to in-costume sightings of the show's stars, including Penelope Cruz as Donatella, Ricky Martin as Versace's longtime partner Antonio D'Amico, and Edgar Ramirez as the designer -- who appeared on the balcony of Versace's former bedroom clad in a pink bathrobe.\u000a\u000aThe room is now known as The Villa Suite, and, like the rest of the mansion's interiors, it's as over-the-top on glitz as Versace's collections. The most arresting feature, also available in Donatella's bedroom, the Venus Suite, is a custom-made double-king-size bed.\u000a\u000aNo longer on show is Versace's $10,000 marble toilet with 24-karat gold-plated seat -- one of the items auctioned off by Donatella after her brother's death.\u000a\u000aFrom flashy home to over-the-top hotel\u000a\u000aItalian fashion designer Gianni Versace was murdered on the steps of the Miami mansion in July 1997.\u000a\u000aToday, Casa Casuarina has 10 hotel suites, plus a restaurant and bar, a lounge that can be used for meetings, a rooftop and an elaborate Mediterranean-style Mosaic Garden, with tiles picturing icons of Greek mythology, chief among them Medusa -- who has a place of honor on the Versace brand's logo.\u000a\u000aThe most elaborate Medusa can be found in the Villa's 54-foot-long pool, inspired by Versace's "Marine Vanuras" collection and said to be made from more than one million mosaic tiles, thousands of them 24-karat gold.\u000a\u000aThe Medusa mosaic was crafted in Versace's home town, Reggio Calabria, Italy, and then taken apart and shipped to Miami Beach in pieces, where it was painstakingly reassembled.\u000a\u000aAdjacent to the garden, in the "new wing" that Versace built when he acquired the mansion, is The Moroccan Lounge, which used to be his gym, and still houses his eight-person hamam Turkish steam room and shower.\u000a\u000aThe room where Madonna would stay, the Mosaic Suite, is located upstairs, where the singer apparently enjoyed the bathroom's acoustics and the bird's-eye view of the pool.\u000a\u000aThe history of Casa Casuarina\u000a\u000aVersace purchased Casa Casuarina in 1992, after falling under the spell of the Magic City and the Spanish architecture of the grand house.\u000a\u000aNext door was an Art Deco Hotel called the Hotel Revere, which Versace also snapped up, and demolished to make way for his garden, pool and the south wing, which used to house one of his libraries.\u000a\u000aAn estimated $32 million in renovations over three years transformed the historic property into a manse fit for a style king.\u000a\u000aBut even before his tenure, Casa Casuarina had a flashy history.\u000a\u000aIt was built in 1930 by Alden Freeman, whose father worked for The Standard Oil Trust and left him a fortune which allowed him to retire at 27 and build his dream house, inspired by the historic Alcazar De Colon in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\u000a\u000aFreeman lived in a top-floor suite and either housed his friends or rented the 23 remaining apartments.\u000a\u000aMany of the architectural details of the house, including the key lime coral floors, the pillars surrounding the courtyard, and the decorative medallions of famous personalities (Cleopatra, Gandhi, Rockefeller and -- more dissonantly -- Mussolini and Lenin) date to Freeman's time, which ended with his death in 1937, when the house was sold and run as an apartment complex.\u000a\u000aBy the 1980s, the building fell into disrepair, although most of the original fittings and artworks survived.\u000a\u000aMansion mysteries\u000a\u000aAs with many famous buildings, Casa Casuarina has its share of mystery: There are rumored to be secret doors and passageways throughout the mansion, although a door that used to lead from Versace's bedroom to an entertainment den has since been closed off.\u000a\u000aIt's also said that Versace maintained a pigeon coop beneath the rooftop observatory, and would use the messenger pigeons to send notes to friends. Details are scant on these rumors, but what's certain is that The Villa will continue to intrigue visitors, no doubt even more so when the TV series hits screens next year.

aVKathmandu, Nepal (CNN) On the streets of Kathmandu, the sight of people begging for kidney treatment has become common.\u000a\u000aThe capital of Nepal is no different from many places in the world where aging populations, poor diets and no health insurance systems mean increased organ disease.\u000a\u000aThe organ in highest demand is the kidney and black market traffickers are meeting that demand. Up to 7,000 kidneys are obtained illegally every year, according to a report by Global Financial Integrity\u000a\u000aOrgan trafficking is an illegal, yet thriving trade around the globe.\u000a\u000aThat same report shows the illegal organ trade generates profits between $514 million to $1 billion a year.\u000a\u000aIn Kathmandu, we spotted a couple begging on the street for their son's kidney treatment.\u000a\u000aJeet Bahadur Magar and his wife spent their entire savings to treat their son's kidney disease.\u000a\u000aOut of money and options, they are now out on the street hoping to raise enough funds to cover the medical bills.\u000a\u000a"I pray to God that no one has to ever go through kidney failure problems," Jeet Bahadur said.\u000a\u000aBut many Nepalis do.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Watch the full documentary: Nepal's Organ Trail Replay More Videos ...

But now the numbers are being tracked.\u000a\u000aIn the last five years more than 300 people have been reported to be victims of kidney traffickers in this district alone, according to Forum for Protection of People's Rights , a Kathmandu-based non-profit human rights organization. Some activists say the number is much higher.\u000a\u000a"Social stigma and threats from traffickers keep many victims from coming forward," said Rajendra Ghimire, a human rights lawyer, and director of Forum for Protection of People's Rights.\u000a\u000a'The meat will grow back'\u000a\u000aNawaraj Pariyar is one of the many victims of kidney traffickers.\u000a\u000aLike many in Kavre, Pariyar makes a living from selling cattle milk and doing seasonal labor jobs on nearby farms.

aVSarah Hassan, CNN \u2022 Updated 21st July 2017\u000a\u000aDubai, UAE (CNN) \u2014 Big and blingy is not always best in Dubai\u000a\u000aWhile the glitz thrusts further skyward or deeper into the Arabian Gulf, one humble fish restaurant in the shadow of the luxury Burj Al Arab skyscraper hotel bucks the trend.\u000a\u000aBu Qtair peddles simple seafood and fresh fish cooked in its famous "secret recipe," attracting some of the city's highest rollers to its modest surroundings.\u000a\u000a"Some of the tourists who visit us stay in the Burj Al Arab," says owner Matar Al Tayer. "But they tell me they prefer the taste of the fish here over anywhere else in the city. It is the flavor that has remained the same for 30 years."\u000a\u000a'Lightbulb moment'\u000a\u000aBu Qtair's simple fare has been attracting expats, tourists and Dubai residents for 30 years.\u000a\u000aAl Tayer opened his first fish shack overlooking Jumeirah beach in the 1980s to cater for the growing expat population flooding in from South Asia and the Middle East when oil boom money was starting to transform the UAE.\u000a\u000aHis prominent Emirati family once made a tough living through fishing and pearl diving, living alongside fellow fishermen on the then-undeveloped stretch of coast. As the outsiders poured in, the local Bedouin and fishermen who've always been the masters of this arid land, found themselves sharing it with others.\u000a\u000aThat's when Al Tayer had his "lightbulb" entrepreneurial moment.\u000a\u000a"There was not a single café or restaurant dedicated to those fishermen, so I thought to fill that gap by opening a small shop in which I serve Indian chai karak and paratha," he says.\u000a\u000a'Sweet water'\u000a\u000aThe young Al Tayer opened a small kitchen serving special Indian tea and bread on an empty yard overlooking the beach near the fishermen's dormitory.\u000a\u000aHe named it "Bu Qtair," a local term Emirati pearl divers used to name the spots where sweet water gathered naturally along the coast, and where they used to wash themselves after a rigorous day of diving. Al Tayer's venture, however, proved to be an utter failure.\u000a\u000a"For four years, I did not attract any customers. Fishermen were used to preparing their food themselves," he says.\u000a\u000aIt all changed one day when he asked his part-time Indian cook Mousa to prepare food for his family's fishermen after a long day at work. Mousa, who worked in the kitchen of another local family, took some of their fresh catch and served it to the hungry fishermen.\u000a\u000aNeither of the men would have guessed that would be the start of Bu Qtair's journey to stardom, firstly among Indian expats, and later among all of Dubai's residents.\u000a\u000aUnpretentious location\u000a\u000aFish or prawns? It's that simple.\u000a\u000aDespite its growing reputation, the restaurant remained in its unpretentious location for more than three decades as the entire area around it was swallowed up by the desert megalopolis.\u000a\u000aThe fishermen's dormitory was rebuilt, the fishing boats started sharing their docks with luxurious yachts, and Jumeirah became home to luxurious landmarks, such as the opulent sail-shaped Burj Al Arab, the man-made island Palm Jumeirah, Dubai's only Four Seasons Resort, and myriad other exclusive hotels and boutique cafés and restaurants.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, Bu Qtair was able to keep and expand its fan base, becoming a tourist destination with dedicated pages on websites such as Zomato and TripAdvisor\u000a\u000aIn the area around the restaurant, it was not uncommon to see Range Rovers, Mercedes and other sparkly SUVs parked up while their owners sat on plastic chairs on the sandy lot out front to enjoy the same few menu items it's been serving since 1986.\u000a\u000aDiverse crowd\u000a\u000aA few years ago, Bu Qtair moved to a bigger premises, with a lit and air-conditioned indoor area.\u000a\u000aIt remains, however, close to the fishermen in Jumeirah, who are now only a fraction of the diverse crowd that goes there to enjoy the fried fish or prawns dish, with a side of paratha bread or rice and curry sauce. Its reputation has garnered extensive coverage by local and international media, including American TV chef Anthony Bourdain, who featured it in one of his gastronomic trips.\u000a\u000aThe only real change today is that the fish does not come straight off the boats.\u000a\u000a"Today we cannot buy fish straight from fishermen," says Haroun Rasheed, Mousa's 36-year-old nephew, who joined his uncle in the UAE in the early 2000s and has been managing the restaurant for the past 15 years.\u000a\u000a"The municipality requests from us buying it from the fish market in Deira (in old Dubai)."\u000a\u000aThe restaurant, however, remains true to its origins, unmoved by the city's transformation around it and still fiercely protective of the "secret recipe."

When you destroy economies, when you are able to impose censorship on the world and especially the United States of America it's more than vandalism. It's a new form of warfare that we're involved in and we need to react and react vigorously, including reimposing sanctions that were lifted under the Bush administration, including other actions and that will squeeze them more economically and - but most of all, we have to really work together with the president and the Congress to come up with counters and abilities to respond, but more importantly to prevent.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain on President Obama\u2019s comments regarding Vladimir Putin: \u201cI think that it's bizarre to think that any action on the part of the President of the United States has proved any deterrence to Vladimir Putin. We won't even give defensive weapons to the Ukrainians. We - President Obama - and we should be thanking the Saudis, who have allowed the value of a barrel of oil to go to the point where it's affecting dramatically Vladimir Putin's economy. It has nothing to do with any action taken by the President of the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain on normalizing relations with Cuba: \u201cWell, because we would be rewarding the failure that they haven't done anything. If they had shown some progress, I think maybe that it would be what we are doing is endorsing their 50 years of oppression and repression in Cuba.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain on Guantanamo Bay: \u201cI always wanted to close Guantanamo, but I wanted to transfer those prisoners to maximum security prisons, prisons in the United States of America that the president has never had a plan for that. And he didn't mention to you that some 27 percent or 30 percent of these people we have released have reentered the fight. It's outrageous to release people that are going to reenter the fight and try to kill Americans and attack America.

aVFreetown, Sierra Leone (CNN) Sierra Leone is facing significant health challenges after this week's devastating mudslides claimed nearly 500 lives, a government official said, with the number of dead expected to rise.\u000a\u000aEighteen bodies were discovered Saturday, bringing the death toll to 499 people, according to Sidie Yahya Tunis, the tourism and cultural affairs minister. More than 150 children were among the dead, he said.\u000a\u000aThe death toll includes those killed in mudslides on the outskirts of the West African nation's capital, Freetown, and fatalities from flash floods in other provinces, Deputy Health Minister Madina Rahman told CNN earlier.\u000a\u000aAbout 20,000 people have been displaced by the mudslides, including 5,000 children, presidential spokesman Abdulai Bayraytay said.\u000a\u000aThe country also must battle cholera and malaria, Rahman said, in the wake of one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Africa in recent years.\u000a\u000aA satellite image from DigitalGlobe shows the mudslide that has devastated the Freetown area.\u000a\u000aSome residents have gotten skin infections from the water they have been washing in, and officials are putting in place plans for cholera preparedness and prevention, she said. "We are equipped to a point. We can't do it alone," she added.\u000a\u000aThe crisis began Monday when heavy rains caused mudslides from the denuded slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, about 5 miles from Freetown. Houses that hugged the slopes, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\u000a\u000aRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris, with hundreds of people still unaccounted for. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\u000a\u000aThe city morgue at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has been overwhelmed by the influx of bodies.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, 413 people were laid to rest in a mass burial in the nearby town of Waterloo, said Tunis, the tourism and cultural affairs minister.\u000a\u000aThe deadly mudslides have left many survivors shell-shocked in Sierra Leone.\u000a\u000aRahman, the health official, appealed for international support, saying the country can't do it alone.\u000a\u000a"The number of people dead is changing every day," she said. "We have just done a census recently, and we are working with the statistics office to see how many people are on that site and how many people are unaccounted for and how many people were dead and buried."\u000a\u000aElhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, also told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that other countries must step up, saying that Sierra Leone was facing a crisis "way beyond (its) capacity."\u000a\u000aMany appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family, including a sister who was heavily pregnant.\u000a\u000aAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was also looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, "I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished."\u000a\u000aMore rain expected\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, authorities are preparing to evacuate other hillside areas amid concern more landslides could take place.\u000a\u000aMembers of a burial team head out from the Freetown morgue.\u000a\u000a"Evacuation is being discussed. Some have been happening but not on a large scale," Tunis said. "We have to plan, and we are working at looking at the numbers involved."\u000a\u000aMore rain is expected over the next few days, increasing the threat of a new landslide, Tunis said Thursday.\u000a\u000a"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge, and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist," he said.\u000a\u000aBritain steps in with $6.4 million in aid\u000a\u000aThe United Kingdom is offering an initial $6.4 million in emergency support to provide clean drinking water food and medicines, UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced. The money will go to UNICEF, the UN children's agency that's also responsible for water and nongovernmental organizations.\u000a\u000aJust installed clean water storage (6,000l) and hand washing area at the Regent registration site for those affected by the deadly mudslide. pic.twitter.com/XlDRQPYWFr \u2014 UNICEF Sierra Leone (@UNICEFSL) August 18, 2017\u000a\u000a"This tragedy comes shortly after the Ebola crisis , which Sierra Leone has worked so hard to recover from," Patel said. "Britain was at the forefront in tackling that deadly disease, and we remain shoulder to shoulder with Sierra Leone today after these devastating events."\u000a\u000aIn 2000, the UK, a former colonial power of Sierra Leone, sent troops to end the bitter civil war there. More recently Sierra Leone was one of the country's worst hit from the Ebola crisis, with nearly 4,000 dying from the disease.\u000a\u000a"Our new support will provide basic life-saving supplies like food, water, shelter and clothing to people who have lost everything," Patel said. "The international community must follow our lead and step up to the plate."\u000a\u000aMass burial\u000a\u000aA team of around 100 men gathered to dig graves under the burning sun.\u000a\u000a"I'm happy to do this for my fellow countrymen. It's a sad time, but we have to pull together," Momodu Bah told CNN.\u000a\u000aHundreds started to line the perimeters of the cemetery in Waterloo in the afternoon, eager to pay their last respects. Some climbed trees to get a better look.\u000a\u000aMuslim and Christian prayers were offered during the short interfaith ceremony. The imam's voice trembled as he read prayers for the dead, and Koroma laid a wreath to commemorate the deaths.\u000a\u000a'Another grim episode in our nation's history'\u000a\u000aIn an address, Koroma said: "We have come here to pay our last respects to our loved ones ... our friends ... and to our community. We've come to comfort the bereaved and reassure them that they are not alone.\u000a\u000a"This is another grim episode in our nation's history. They had their hopes and aspirations for a bright future."\u000a\u000aA relative of a mudslide victim receives comfort Wednesday at the Freetown morgue.\u000a\u000aHe said a group of students studying together were among the victims in an house that was crushed.\u000a\u000aThe President also spoke of a man who had saved for years to move his family into the area affected by the mudslide and another who was due to marry Friday.\u000a\u000a"These heartbreaking stories are so painful," he said. "We have buried them, but we will not bury our hopes. Sierra Leone will rise again."\u000a\u000aPrivate donations\u000a\u000aPrivate citizens have been turning up at the disaster site with food donations, clothing and other items to help the displaced. Others are donating money, and a group of around 100 young people held a candle-lit vigil Thursday to mourn friends who had died.\u000a\u000aOrganized by a local nongovernmental organization called the Family, some carried a banner of one of their friends, a woman who was just 26. Some marchers wept openly.\u000a\u000aAs they gathered under the famous Freetown Cotton Tree, they said a Christian prayer, and an organizer called for a member of the crowd to offer up a Muslim one, too, in a symbol of religious unity and tolerance.\u000a\u000aA search-and-rescue team and soldiers operate at the disaster site this week in Freetown.\u000a\u000aFlooding is not unusual in the region, which is experiencing its rainy season.\u000a\u000aBut this year has been particularly wet, with Freetown receiving more than 27 inches of rain between July 1 and August 13 -- more than double the average of 11.8 inches, according to the US National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.

aV(CNN) As the head of jewelry in Asia for British auction house Bonhams, Graeme Thompson is used to handling beautiful diamonds on a daily basis. Yet he's only ever held a red diamond once, about five years ago. "Red diamonds are the rarest of them all and whoever gets to hold one in his hand is very lucky indeed," he said.\u000a\u000aMining company Rio Tinto has been showcasing stones from its Argyle mine in Western Australia for the past 33 years -- and during that time, less than 20 carats of Fancy Red certified diamonds have been sold.\u000a\u000aFancy Red diamonds are on the pink diamond color spectrum and is a grading from the Gemological Institute of America\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday in New York, Rio Tinto unveiled its largest Fancy Red diamond yet to a select group of collectors, alongside other gemstones in its annual tender of pink diamonds. Known as the Argyle Everglow, the polished radiant cut diamond weighs 2.11 carats.\u000a\u000aIt represents "rarity within rarity, and will drive global demand from collectors and connoisseurs in search of the incomparable," said Argyle Pink Diamonds Manager Josephine Johnson.\u000a\u000aThe stone is "half the size of a one cent coin, but I expect it to sell for over $10 million," said Tobias Kormind, Managing Director of 77Diamonds.com , Europe's largest online diamond jeweler.\u000a\u000aThompson said he was not comfortable making a more definitive prediction on price without having seen the stone, but that the determining factors will be "the carat weight, the strength of the color, how red it is, and the clarity. The difference in value between a stone that is very clean and one that has inclusions is huge."\u000a\u000aFetching high prices\u000a\u000aThe largest red diamond in the world, the 5.11 carat Moussaieff Red, was discovered in Brazil in the 1990s and is currently owned by jeweler Moussaieff.\u000a\u000aSignificant red diamonds rarely appear at auctions. In 2013, a 1.92-carat Fancy Red rectangular-cut diamond, sold for CHF3.15 million at Christie's , while the auction house also sold a 2.09-carat heart-shaped Fancy Red diamond ring by Moussaieff for HKD39.32 million in 2014.\u000a\u000aThe 2.42 carat Fancy Purple-Pink Argyle Avaline and the 1.14 carat Fancy Red Argyle Isla.\u000a\u000a"The color red is essentially a highly, highly saturated vivid pink, where the body color goes beyond the pink color range -- and there can be modifying color to that red, like pinkish red, orangey red, brownish red -- and all of these contributing factors will then determine the value of the diamond," Thompson explained. "A Fancy Red is the rarest of all diamonds."\u000a\u000a"To hold a red diamond in your hand and look at it and say it's a truly a red stone without any modifying colors, very few people on this planet will ever be able to do that," Thompson added, noting such red diamond will appeal to Chinese buyers "as it is the most auspicious of colors in China."\u000a\u000aMine to close soon\u000a\u000aThe Argyle Diamond Mine produces 90% of the world's rare pink diamonds and is set to close by 2021, according to Robyn Ellison, communications manager for Rio Tinto.\u000a\u000a"It is unlikely that a diamond as rare as this will come out of the mine again," Ellison said.\u000a\u000aAt Rio Tinto's annual tender this year, buyers will have a choice of 58 diamonds weighing a total of 49.39 carats. They include five "hero" diamonds selected for their unique beauty and named to ensure there is a permanent record of their contribution to the history of the world's most important diamonds.\u000a\u000aThe collection will be showcased in Hong Kong and Perth with bids closing on October 11.

aVJen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. She also was a consultant for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Follow her: @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers\u000a\u000aThey typically include scripted remarks, and they last for about 24 hours -- or less. Just a few minutes into his speech at a rally in Phoenix Tuesday evening , the clock ran out. And it quickly went off the rails.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't just a speech lacking structure, or focus, or message. It was an unhinged rant from someone who is supposed to be leading our country and bringing us back together after one of the toughest weeks of his presidency\u000a\u000aIf the goal was to fire up his base and throw red meat -- ranging from attacks on the media to a threat to shut down the government over building a transparent border wall to a wink and a nod about pardoning the divisive ex-Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, a man who was still a birther even after Trump had stopped making the claim -- well, they got that job done. But for what?\u000a\u000aEven with a slight dip among Republicans in some recent polls , President Trump's biggest challenge is not to fire up his base or to worry about his re-election campaign in 2020.\u000a\u000aHe has no legislative legacy-building accomplishments under his belt -- beyond his former friend Sen. Mitch McConnell successfully pushing through Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court . And for the first time in modern American history, there are legitimate questions, prompted by no one other than Donald Trump himself, about whether the President of the United States sympathizes with white supremacists.\u000a\u000aThe words President Trump used in his Afghanistan speech on Monday night were a dramatic improvement from last week (putting aside the fact that no President in modern history has ever felt the need to begin a prime-time address by disavowing racism because the country he leads had doubts.) Still, at Fort Myer on Monday, Trump appealed to the country to be unified.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump: Our movement is built on love Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Our movement is built on love 00:51\u000a\u000aThat was never going to mend the hurt and anger from the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, because words alone rarely do, and they didn't even calm the fears many people in the country have about the sitting President's racial bias -- because we know Trump well enough now to know that a one-off set of scripted remarks rarely represents his overall point of view and thinking. But it was a small step in the right direction.\u000a\u000aNo surprise he took a flying leap in the other direction in Phoenix on Tuesday night, and delivered a speech that was all about division.\u000a\u000aHe spent several excruciating minutes reading from his own statements of last week and defending them. It was the media's fault -- not Donald Trump's, he said. It was as if he was not aware that there is a record, a well documented one, of what was said last week, when he suggested that there was fault on "many sides" for the violence and that there were "very fine people" associated with the white supremacists as well as the counter-protesters.\u000a\u000aAnd because that wasn't enough -- and because alienating the African-American community last week was not enough -- he decided to raise the possibility of pardoning former Sheriff Arpaio, a man who has been accused of racially profiling Latinos.\u000a\u000aI am not a Trump supporter. But I found myself rooting for him at the beginning of the speech to read the teleprompter, to stick with the message of unity, to swallow his bile and recognize as a human being that this moment required something bigger than he typically was capable of delivering.\u000a\u000aInstead, my jaw was on the floor, like many people watching. I guess I should stop being so surprised.

aV(CNN) Callan Kott's parents knew that something was wrong with their child when the 3-year-old looked pale and suddenly stopped singing karaoke at a Christmas party in December 2015. The New Orleans boy was usually the "life of the party" who loved to dance.\u000a\u000aConcerned that the pneumonia he had experienced around Thanksgiving had returned, they took him to the ER for a chest X-ray. Dr. James Hanley at Ochsner Medical Center in Jefferson, Louisiana, ordered some tests. A little while later, he sat down with Ross and Lisa Kott to break the news: Their son had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer.\u000a\u000a"We had no clue that he was as sick as he was, really no warning at all," Lisa Kott said. "It just came out of nowhere, just days before Christmas."\u000a\u000aCallan started chemotherapy treatment immediately. He responded well to it, and the staff at Ochsner worked to make sure the Kott family would be able to go home by Christmas.\u000a\u000aAlthough Callan handled those rough few days well, he was also too young to understand why the nurses had to keep poking him with needles and taking blood samples. He would cry and get upset.\u000a\u000aDesperate to keep him calm, his parents tried to distract him with videos. Before the nurses walked in with more needles, Ross Kott pulled up the trailer for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."\u000a\u000a"When Ross showed him that preview, he composed himself," Lisa Kott said. "It was the oddest thing. And I think we probably watched it a hundred times after that."\u000a\u000aAlthough Ross loved the "Star Wars" films as a kid, he had never shown them to his son or even mentioned the series. He was amazed to see Callan connect so strongly with a two-minute trailer. The boy's favorite characters became Kylo Ren and the rolling droid BB-8.\u000a\u000aCallan poses in a Chewbacca jacket with a poster of his favorite character, Kylo Ren.\u000a\u000aOver those four days in the hospital, his parents kept showing Callan the trailer every time needles were involved.\u000a\u000a"Then, his love of 'Star Wars' took on a life of its own," Ross said.\u000a\u000aCallan fell in love with "Star Wars" Legos and the "Clone Wars" animated series. "The Force Awakens" is the only film in the saga he has watched; his parents have tried to show him the others, but he lets them know when it gets too scary to continue.\u000a\u000aWanting to be sure the Kotts felt like they were in the right place, the staff at Ochsner played along, calling him "Star Wars Callan." At first, when he would show up for treatment, the Kotts would make sure that his room was full of "Star Wars" decorations. Then, the nurses surprised them with their own decorations.\u000a\u000aEvery time the boy had one of his 18 or so spinal taps, they brought him a "Star Wars" balloon.\u000a\u000aCallan's treatment was like a roller coaster: bouts of intense chemo followed by lighter weeks, inpatient one week and outpatient the next. The hardest part for the very social kid was not being able to be in school, play with his friends or be around other family members due to his depleted immune system.\u000a\u000aBut during the ups and downs, he would "train" with his light saber in the hallway, wear the masks of his favorite "Star Wars" characters, sing the "Imperial March" and hold out his hands to "use the Force" in fighting his cancer. He told other patients that they could use the Force to help their cancer, too.\u000a\u000aCallan practicing with his lightsaber.\u000a\u000aWhen Callan had to shave his head, Ross Kott did it too, telling him it was part of training to become a Jedi. Callan also shares his love of Star Wars with his 2-year-old brother Ari. Photos on the family's Facebook page show the two brothers wearing BB-8 beanies and playing with lightsabers.\u000a\u000a"It's a great outlet, it's wonderful for a kid with such a serious diagnosis to relate to that level of imagination," Lisa Kott said. "It's almost like you need that to get through it. You can't get through something so severe without really making it lighthearted for them."\u000a\u000aCallan received a door that is covered with the poster from his favorite movie, "The Force Awakens."\u000a\u000aRoss said the "Star Wars" theme has been a great distraction, bringing everyone at the hospital together and boosting morale, including their own. Even though the couple has struggled with the diagnosis, they remain positive and upbeat around Callan and encourage his love of the sci-fi/fantasy series.\u000a\u000aCallan started to improve without setbacks in August, and his hair grew back a couple months later. He was also able to return to school and be around other people. Now, he's in remission and maintenance phase. His treatment and observation will last through 2019.\u000a\u000aCallan's story is helping inspire other children and families through the St. Baldrick's Foundation , a charity that funds childhood cancer research and hosts events that bring together families affected by childhood cancer.\u000a\u000aAbout one in 285 children in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer before age 20, according to the foundation , and acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type . According to the American Cancer Society, more than 90% of children diagnosed with the disease survive.\u000a\u000asurrounded by his favorite costumed characters at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans. Callan will spend Thursday, "Star Wars" Day , at a May the 4th Be With You eventsurrounded by his favorite costumed characters at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans.\u000a\u000aHe's still fighting cancer every day, even though he looks like a normal kid, Ross Kott said. If his temperature ever appears higher than normal, they may have to take him to the ER.\u000a\u000aThe family looks forward, rather than back. They're grateful to the community that has supported them in every way throughout these difficult two years.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Watching your child suffering when you're helpless is one of the worst things you can experience in life," Lisa Kott said.\u000a\u000a"I know that death is on the doorstop. I'm not going to let him in, and he's going to be waiting there for a very long time. The difference between us and any other family is that they don't see him at the doorstep. I see him, and in true Southern fashion, I will give him a glass of iced tea while he waits. Because we're still going to dance and have fun in the presence of all that. It's not going to be doom and gloom in our house."

So Riner instead opted to pursue judo, where he was solely responsible for the end result.\u000a\u000a"I tried a lot of sports, judo, football, basketball, tennis and swimming," he recalls. "But I love judo because of the spirit of the sport, I love to fight.\u000a\u000a"In this sport, you search for the ippon (winning throw) and I like this because it's difficult, it's not an easy sport.\u000a\u000a"You search for a beautiful technique, for a beautiful ippon."\u000a\u000aThough he dropped all other sports to focus on judo some years earlier, it wasn't until Riner was 16 that he believed becoming a champion was possible.\u000a\u000aRemarkably, the Frenchman has only lost eight fights in his entire top-level career, something he attributes to a defeat -- his "biggest lesson" -- against his older brother in the final of a club tournament.\u000a\u000aRiner would get the better of his sibling every day in training, so entered the fight showboating and thinking "it's cool, I'll win against my brother," he recalls.\u000a\u000aWhile Riner was busy jumping around and waving to his family, his brother remained focused.\u000a\u000a"Five seconds, just five seconds my brother attacks very fast and I lose this fight," he says.

In my life everything is like this."\u000a\u000aRiner acknowledges judo is an aggressive sport, but is keen to stress it is important to remember it's a martial art and does not mean he is an aggressive person.\u000a\u000a"Aggressive on the tatami (judo mat), a gentleman off it" is his mantra.\u000a\u000a"When you go on the tatami, this is the fight, when you exit off the tatami you are back to being a gentleman," he explains. "Focus on the tatami, normal in life.\u000a\u000a"Because I practice a martial art and I have aggression doesn't mean I am not a gentle man in my life.\u000a\u000a"It's important that you are aggressive on the tatami but when I am back in my life I am very gentle. It's very different."\u000a\u000aHaving won everything there is to win -- and then some -- Riner says his next aim is to help judo break through into the mainstream.\u000a\u000a"I want to see on every TV channel judo," he says. "I want my sport in the top five world sports, I want just this, because this is a beautiful sport with a beautiful athletes."

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Published 30th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Off the coast of Xiamen, in southeast China, Kulangsu (also known as Gulangyu) is not exactly your average Chinese village.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the tiny island, with just 4,000 households, is completely free of cars and bikes, aside from the occasional tourist trolley.\u000a\u000aThen there's the 19th-century European mansions, leafy seaside promenades, white-sandy beaches and a legacy of classical music.\u000a\u000aAnd as of July, China's "Piano Island" -- so named for its piano music and musical prodigies -- is also a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site , chosen in the committee's 41st session.\u000a\u000aFrom the world's largest piano museum to peaceful colonial mansions, knobby banyan trees and cobbled alleyways, Kulangsu offers a unique journey through China's past.\u000a\u000aThe car-free Kulangsu is packed with leafy streets and 19th-century colonial buildings.\u000a\u000aAn international affair\u000a\u000aWhy the colonial architecture? Xiamen was, and still is, an important port for Sino-European trade.\u000a\u000a"During the Qing Dynasty, Amoy (now known as Xiamen) was one of the first great trading harbors of China. Along with Shanghai, it was one of the first points of contact between East and West," Robin Goldstein, tourism spokesperson for Kulangsu Island , tells CNN Travel.\u000a\u000a"Because of its natural beauty and positioning right in Amoy's protected main harbor, Kulangsu became the ideal destination in Amoy to live and set up trading business and became the location for customs."\u000a\u000aThroughout the early 19th century, this romantic settlement drew merchants, missionaries and diplomatic representatives from many European countries, including the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese.\u000a\u000aBy the mid-1800s the 0.75-square-mile island was dotted with consulate buildings, schools, community centers and music studios.\u000a\u000aPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the elite neighborhood, it was "the richest square mile on earth" by the 1920s.\u000a\u000aWhile Kulangsu lacks the glamor of its heyday, the island still holds vestiges of its international past, visible in the island's 13 foreign consulates and more than 600 heritage buildings.\u000a\u000aWith the world's largest piano museum and a popular organ museum (pictured here), it's no exaggeration to call Kulangsu China's music capital.\u000a\u000aMusic Island\u000a\u000aThe island might be small, but it's home to many a big-name musician -- not to mention the highest per capita ownership of pianos in China.\u000a\u000a"Western classical instruments, including pianos, barely existed in China before the end of the mid-1800s when this contact between East and West began," explains Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Kulangsu, as the home of many diplomats and former officials, became a place where Westerners lived and worked and thus they brought many elements of their culture from Europe."\u000a\u000a"As a result, Kulangsu became the first places in all of China where Western classical music could be played and heard."\u000a\u000aA haven for the arts and sciences, the little island practically bred prodigies, among them pianist Xu Feiping and violinist Jing Yang.\u000a\u000aAmbling around the winding tree-lined alleyways, travelers will discover the remnants of centuries-old music schools and a well-known piano museum.\u000a\u000aThe largest in the world -- and the only one in China -- the Gulangyu Piano Museum (45 Huang Yan Road, Kulangsu) is hard to miss, thanks to an eye-catching facade that resembles piano keys.\u000a\u000aInside, more than 100 gleaming pianos -- including a gold-plated number and an antique hand piano -- provide insight into the island's musical heritage.\u000a\u000aKulangsu is blessed with a scenic coastline dotted with white sandy beaches.\u000a\u000aSandy stretches\u000a\u000aXiamen stays relatively warm all year round, with a mild winter and 80-degree summers.\u000a\u000aThe beaches of Kulangsu might not quite rival the Philippines, but they're relatively clean -- with white sand and swaying palm trees.\u000a\u000aThanks to a walking trail that circles the island, you can easily reach the less frequented stretches on the northern coast, facing the Xiamen west port and a series of islets.\u000a\u000a"I love the secluded beach by Zhao He Shan Park in Nei Cuo Ao Village, on the northern edge of Kulangsu," says Goldstein. "Guanhai beach is another pretty spot on the southwest corner of the island next to a beautiful former ferry port, Guanhai Harbor."\u000a\u000a"Kulangsu is one of the most popular places in China for couples to take wedding pictures, and every day you'll see the island -- especially Guanhai beach -- full of brides and grooms in full romantic regalia for their photo shoots."\u000a\u000aThe best views\u000a\u000aThe hilly island seems to be all cobbled alleys and pretty gardens -- that is, until you climb up the 302-foot-tall Sunlight Rock.\u000a\u000aThe golden mound is the highest point on the island, offering views of the island's red rooftops and of Xiamen across the strait.\u000a\u000a"Climbing to its summit, past Sunlight Rock temple, is great in the evening because the crowds are thinner, and you can watch the sunset and skyline of Xiamen begin to twinkle," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Sunsets are also beautiful from beaches all over the island, but my favorite spot of all for sunsets is a quiet spot perched atop the northeast corner of Kulangsu, the site of the old Yanwei Hill Time Cannon -- now a newly landscaped public park that's well off the beaten tourist track."\u000a\u000aGreat views and thinner crowds: Evening is the best time to climb up Sunlight Rock.\u000a\u000aFresh seafood\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to local cuisine, the tropical seaside surrounds may give you a hint as to what's for dinner.\u000a\u000a"The island's signature foods all revolve around fresh seafood, fresh local produce, and fresh fruit," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Preparations are simple, healthy, and usually have a bit of a spicy kick. The island is famous for its oyster omelets, which are made with eggs, scallions, sweet potato flour and fresh local oysters, cooked on a flat cast-iron griddle into a perfect ring and served with bright red Xiamen hot sauce."\u000a\u000aGoldstein points to a personal favorite, Blessed Paradise (95 Quanzhou Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000a"It's run by a Kulangsu native who's also a wine expert and one of the island's most cosmopolitan restaurateurs," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"His kitchen turns out a terrific Kulangsu-style spicy mixed seafood grill of fresh whole fish, clams, squid, abalone, mushrooms, and local vegetables -- all of which come swimming in a deeply flavored chili sauce."\u000a\u000aElsewhere on the island, you can usually recognize the most authentic spots, thanks to a line out the door.\u000a\u000aAt Fu Lin Chun Canting (109 Longtou Rd, Kulangsu), for example, travelers will find a no-frills dining room and menus depicting an ocean of fresh seafood.\u000a\u000aHave it deep-fried, steamed with garlic and shallots, or grilled with a sprinkle of salt -- but if you don't speak Chinese we recommend coming prepared with some key phrases or pictures to which you can point.\u000a\u000aHeroic heights\u000a\u000aThe towering statue of Zheng Chenggong -- a 17th-century Ming general and cultural hero -- is impossible to miss.\u000a\u000aThis figure, part of a larger sculpture park, rests, like a beacon in a storm, atop of the island's southeastern point.\u000a\u000aElsewhere in the park, you'll find an ancient well, the grounds of the former emperor's palace, and a series of bronze, steel and stone statues.\u000a\u000aWith dramatic Chinese-style gardens and the piano museum, Shuzhuang Garden is worth a visit.\u000a\u000aA walk in the garden\u000a\u000aThe piano museum is one of several sights inside the larger Shuzhuang Garden.\u000a\u000aDating back to 1913, the green oasis was once a private estate. Now it's a seaside park, featuring dramatic Chinese-style pavilions, over-water walkways and colorful painted columns.\u000a\u000aA long walkway meanders toward the ocean, while on the hillside, Twelve Grotto Heaven provides an eccentric little maze of sandstone formations -- not to mention a few carved monkey sculptures.\u000a\u000aQuiet nights\u000a\u000aThe most peaceful time on Kulangsu is early morning and late evening, after the crowds have been ferried back to the mainland.\u000a\u000aYou can take advantage of the empty streets by staying overnight in a boutique hotel, such the Lee Inn & Coffee House (38-40 Zhangzhou Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000aBuilt in a 100-year-old colonial building, the quaint guesthouse offers 17 rooms and a pretty garden.\u000a\u000aFor a slightly larger address, Goldstein recommends the 26-room Yang Tao Hotel (13 Fuxing Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000aTucked inside Fuxing Castle, the hotel showcases arched doorways and quiet terraces, as well as a popular restaurant and two garden bars.\u000a\u000aGetting there\u000a\u000aRegular ferries ply the seven-minute route between Kulangsu and Xiamen 24 hours a day.\u000a\u000aIn an effort to curb crowds and protect the island's heritage, Kulangsu has recently capped the number of tourist ferries per day.

aVIt's the lunar event of the century -- and some companies are cashing in.\u000a\u000aAugust 21 will mark the first total solar eclipse that will be visible coast-to-coast from the mainland United States since 1918.\u000a\u000aAs people prepare for the main event, U.S. businesses -- from national chains to mom-and-pop shops -- are starting to hawk special eclipse-themed merchandise.\u000a\u000aHere are some of the commemorative eclipse products and promotions out there now.\u000a\u000aKrispy Kreme's Chocolate Glazer\u000a\u000aKrispy Kreme will sell its first-ever chocolate glazed doughnut during the eclipse.\u000a\u000aThe donut shop lists participating stores on its website. It will also sell the treats on August 19 and 20 during special hours.\u000a\u000a"The solar eclipse is a rare occasion -- providing a total sensory experience for viewers across the continental U.S.," Jackie Woodward, Krispy Kreme's marketing chief, said in a statement. "Chocolate will have the same effect as we introduce a first-time chocolate glazing of our iconic Original Glazed Doughnut."\u000a\u000aJackson Hole's Eclipse-themed booze and coffee\u000a\u000aThe eclipse will be in perfect view for anyone in the Jackson Hole valley area of western Wyoming.\u000a\u000aOne local brewery there has come up with a fun concoction dubbed "Eclipse" beer, and it's is also hosting a party at its Jackson Hole venue.\u000a\u000aDrinking an Eclipse Ale by @snakeriverbrew @ Beer Bar \u2014 https://t.co/VUyNyMH1sG #photo \u2014 Craftybeercouple (@Crftybeercouple) August 12, 2017\u000a\u000aSnake River Roasting Co. also has a special product on the market: eclipse coffee.\u000a\u000aRuth Ann, a spokesperson for the coffee house, told CNNMoney that the coffee has been "selling like mad."\u000a\u000aPortland's pot tribute\u000a\u000aCannabis dispensaries in Oregon are not shying away from eclipse promotions.\u000a\u000aA pot shop in Portland called Oregon's Finest has started selling a strain of weed it's named "moon puppies."\u000a\u000aThe state is one of only seven (plus D.C.) that has legalized recreational marijuana use. And it's the only state in the path of totality that that allows legal weed.\u000a\u000aViewing glasses made in Knoxville\u000a\u000aTennessee-based Paper Optics usually sells 3D glasses.\u000a\u000aBut the company has been making some special eyewear in preparation for the eclipse.\u000a\u000aSpecial ultra-dark sunglasses are needed to safely view the event. And Paper Optics has been producing millions of pairs over the past couple of years to prepare for the demand, according to the Associated Press.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of the demand, there have been some reports of unsafe bogus eclipse glasses that may not be dark enough to protect your eyes.\u000a\u000aBut the American Astronomical Society lists the glasses made by Paper Optics as having met international safety standards.\u000a\u000aReputable Vendor List for eclipse glasses: https://t.co/QGWjURH2BK pic.twitter.com/wB3OMjt77Q \u2014 EclipseGlasses.com (@EclipseGuys) August 2, 2017\u000a\u000aThe "Total Eclipse Cruise"\u000a\u000aYou won't even have to be on land to watch this eclipse. One cruise liner is advertising the chance to see the sky show by sea.\u000a\u000aRoyal Caribbean is offering a "Total Eclipse Cruise" that it calls an "out-of-this-world" weeklong trip. The cruise will sail to "the optimal spot at sea for guests to witness the total solar eclipse," the company said in a press release.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the cruise line also announced that Bonnie Tyler would be a special guest aboard the trip -- and she would perform her smash hit song, "Total Eclipse of the Heart" during the celestial event.\u000a\u000aAs if #Eclipse2017 wasn't going to be legendary enough, Bonnie Tyler is joining the fun with @DNCE onboard #OasisoftheSeas. https://t.co/PwLFVYv4yW \u2014 Royal Caribbean (@RoyalCaribbean) August 16, 2017\u000a\u000aThe the ship will set sail on August 20 from Orlando, Florida and stop by several other destinations -- including Phillipsburg, St. Maarten; Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas; and Nassau, Bahamas -- on the week long adventure.

But because it lies in the path of totality, Philomath is expecting a flood of visitors August 21.\u000a\u000aA local handcrafted shoe company, Softstar Shoes, is trying to capitalize on the attention with a special edition eclipse slipper.\u000a\u000a"These moccasins are handcrafted in-house and are made of smooth, buttery soft leather and luxurious sheepskin," the company said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"The Banana Sun"\u000a\u000aChiquita -- yes, the banana company -- has claimed to have created the "ultimate eclipse-themed (marketing) phenomenon."\u000a\u000aThe company has cheekily claimed for weeks that they will be responsible for the eclipse. But Chiquita claims the special moment to watch for is just before and after totality.\u000a\u000aFor "two glorious moments" before and after the the moon fully blocks the sun, it will "turn the burning ball of gas in the center of our solar system into a giant banana," the company said.\u000a\u000aIf it sounds crazy, Chiquita is owning that fact. It named its new marketing strategy "We Are Bananas."\u000a\u000aChiquita is partnering with the comedy team at Funny or Die for a live stream event the morning of the eclipse. It kicks off at 9:15 am PT.

I know, I know, you're thinking it's a little early to be showing a preview of the Victoria's Secret fashion show, but this is a bit different.\u000a\u000a"The guys are kind of getting ready for their big day," says Plano Fire-Rescue Fire Chief Sam Greif. "October 25 they're going to be sporting the bras and walking the runway."\u000a\u000aPlano Fire-Rescue and Plano Firefighters Association are the gorgeous models at the Women Rock's Battle of the Bras event, hosted by the Women`s Council of Realtors, Collin County.\u000a\u000a"The bras are going to be auctioned off, and all the proceeds go to Women`s Rock Collin County," says Plano Firefighters Association Board Member, Brad McCutcheon. "and that money goes to support patients and women in Collin County who are battling breast cancer."\u000a\u000a"We have seen a little growth in Collin County, so this is a way that helps us make sure we're always able to help those who ask for help," says Luann Daniel, who founded Women's Rock seven years ago, after losing a friend to breast cancer. Unfortunately, her story is one of many.\u000a\u000a"My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was in college; she is a breast cancer survivor," says McCutcheon. "Knowing someone personally who's gone through breast cancer, that's no big deal. For me just to be able to help, just a little bit, that's something that I'm very very happy that our organization is able to do."\u000a\u000a"It's a very serious cause, but even the survivors there that night are gonna be in a celebratory mood and they're gonna try to have as much fun as possible -- and so we just ask for public support," says Chief Greif.\u000a\u000aSupport will definitely be out there in full force, whether you're wearing it, or just cheering.

aVTwo-hour special premieres Sunday, August 27 at 9pm ET/PT on CNN and CNN International\u000a\u000aLove, loss, fairytale and tragedy. Princess Diana lived a life in the public eye, with every move photographed and scrutinized. But two decades after the tragic car crash that took her life, there are still compelling questions about how she lived and how she died.\u000a\u000aCNN explores the majesty, misery and mystery of Diana\u2019s life and shocking death in a new two-hour special, Diana: Chasing a Fairytale. Reported by CNN's award-winning senior international correspondent Clarissa Ward, Diana: Chasing a Fairytale will air Sunday, August 27 at 9pm ET/PT on CNN and CNN International, and Thursday, August 31 at 9pm ET on HLN.\u000a\u000aFrom London to the French Riviera and Paris to the U.S., Ward explores little known moments on Diana\u2019s lonely journey to the palace and reveals intimate details about the last days of the life of a woman whose vibrant legacy lives on.\u000a\u000aDiana: Chasing a Fairytale features revealing interviews with many of Diana\u2019s closest friends and people around her that fateful night in Paris \u2013 some who have never spoken before \u2013 including Xavier Gourmelon, fireman and first responder to Diana\u2019s car crash; Sir Scott Baker, coroner who led the British inquest into Diana and Dodi Al Fayed\u2019s deaths; Patrick Jephson, Diana\u2019s former personal secretary; Dr. James Colthurst, childhood friend of Diana\u2019s; Paul Burrell, Diana\u2019s former butler and close confidant; Roberto Devorik, fashion designer and close friend of Diana\u2019s; Pierre Suu, photographer who was outside the Ritz hotel and took some of the last pictures of Diana and Dodi before they died; Ken Wharfe, Diana\u2019s longtime bodyguard; Lord John Stevens, former Metropolitan Police Commissioner who led Scotland Yard\u2019s three-year investigation into how Diana and Dodi died; and many more.\u000a\u000aTwenty years on from her death, what more do we know about the crash that also killed her companion, Dodi Al Fayed, and Henri Paul, acting head of security at the Ritz who was driving when the car crashed? Investigations in both France and Britain concluded it was an accident caused by high speeds and an intoxicated driver, yet conspiracy theories continued to surface for years.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe truth is that the Paris paparazzi didn\u2019t kill Diana. Incompetent travel arrangements killed Diana. And the paparazzi only became an actual nuisance or a threat to Diana after she had chosen to get rid of her bodyguards,\u201d said Jephson. \u201cIf Charles Spencer or anybody else wanted to see the cause of Diana\u2019s unhappiness or ultimately the circumstances in which she died, they should look at the royal organization which had taken responsibility for her at a very, very young age.\u201d\u000a\u000aDiana: Chasing a Fairytale will replay on CNN International on Thursday, August 31 at 8am and 2pm ET, and on both CNN and CNN International on Friday, September 1 at 9pm ET.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the TV airings, Diana: Chasing a Fairytale will also stream live for subscribers on Sunday, August 27 via CNNgo (at CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android.

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000aSix degrees Celsius of warming may not sound like much -- probably because "temperatures can swing by 6 degrees within an hour if a warm front passes, and it doesn't mean the end of the world," said Mark Lynas, author of a book called "Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet."\u000a\u000aBut if we raise global average surface temperatures by just 6 degrees above pre-industrial levels, Lynas told me, we'll create "a scenario which is so extreme it's almost unimaginable."\u000a\u000a"Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable," he said. "Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and sub-polar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. It's difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. There's a certain level above which plants just can't survive.\u000a\u000a"There's a certain level where humans biologically can't survive outside as well ... The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen-deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well -- which would then release gases and affect land. So it's pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts."\u000a\u000aI chatted with Lynas, a science writer in the UK, about how to avoid a 6-degree world, the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees -- and how to talk to kids about climate change.\u000a\u000aThe following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\u000a\u000aMark Lynas\u000a\u000aSutter: I've gotten a lot of questions from readers about what 2 degrees of warming means. What does it mean for sea levels? What does it mean for hurricanes? Extinctions? Those sorts of things. Could I run through a couple of those and get your take on it, as someone who's read through just mountains of this research?\u000a\u000aLynas: Sure, sure. I'll do my best.\u000a\u000aSutter: OK. Could we start with extinctions? What will we see around the 2-degree mark?\u000a\u000aIn the marine environment, I think the most threatened ecosystems are coral reefs. (They're) threatened both by coral bleaching, due to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, plus the general degradation of everyday, general human activity. It's very tough to imagine that the world's coral reefs will continue to exist in their present day form in a 2-degree warmer world.\u000a\u000aThe other most-threatened environments probably are the mountain ecosystems -- where species will be left marooned in shrinking islands of habitat. As temperature rises, you can imagine biomes rising up the sides of the mountains, and species which are dependent on a certain level of temperature and humidity will get left with nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aSutter: What about hurricanes and severe weather?\u000a\u000aThere's really a lot of uncertainty about this. It's possible to imagine hurricanes will become less frequent but more intense, and possibly (form) over new areas.\u000a\u000aSutter: What about droughts? I get a lot of California questions.\u000a\u000aLynas: The overall global picture is kind of, 'unto them that have with be given more and unto them have not shall be taken away' -- if you want to get biblical. That maps out as the subtropics, which are already the drier parts of the globe, will become more water-deficient. The deep tropics will actually get more rainfall, as well as some of the mid-latitudes. But the subtropics -- which is the southwest of the U.S. -- would expect to see less rainfall, which indeed seems to be what's happening. That does call into question, really, the development model that large areas of the southwestern U.S. have adopted -- expecting a large amount of freshwater to be available to urban areas and agriculture, which are already in a pretty arid location.\u000a\u000aSo I do think it's going to be hard to adapt to that change.\u000a\u000aSutter: I've also gotten questions about the low-lying Pacific Island nations. At 2 degrees, what is their fate?\u000a\u000aLynas: I used to be adviser to president of the Maldives, who is, by the way, now in jail due to there having been a coup. But his challenge, and his main agenda, when he was president, was to bring to attention the fate of the small island states -- especially those that are coral atolls. For the Maldives, the entire country exists at a meter or less above sea level, and little more. It's difficult to imagine the survival of coral atoll nations at 2 degrees, it has to be said. Although the extinction process depends on the rate of sea level rise. It might take decades, it might take centuries, it's not clear at the moment. But I don't think they have a very long term future.\u000a\u000aSutter: Moving up the degree ladder, you describe a 6-degree world as a "sixth circle of hell." What do you mean by that -- and can you describe some of what we know about that world?\u000a\u000aLynas: It's a scenario which is so extreme it's almost unimaginable. Not many studies have addressed this because it's so far off the scale of what can be envisaged. I found myself looking back at the really serious traumatic events in the Earth's geological history, which have led to mass extinctions, such as the one at the end of the Permian period, 250 million years ago, which wiped out nearly 90% of life on Earth. Actually, a lot of the mass extinctions seem to have been associated with very rapid global warming events. Humans are releasing carbon more rapidly even than took place during mass extinctions. We haven't gotten there in terms of the overall amount, but we're certainly moving in that direction. So it's not a planet that I think any of us would want to live in, and it doesn't have to happen. While I think it's important to try to visualize what a 6-degree world would look like, it's also important to remember that we don't have to go there.\u000a\u000aSutter: What else do we know about a 6-degree world?\u000a\u000aLynas: Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable. Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and subpolar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. It's difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. There's a certain level above which plants just can't survive. There's a certain level where humans biologically can't survive outside, as well. We get close enough already in the Arabian Peninsula and some other parts of the world. Remember, 6 degrees is a global average. It would be probably twice that over land and somewhat less than that over the oceans. The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well -- which would then release gases and affect land. So it's pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts.\u000a\u000aSutter: I'm wondering why you took this approach -- looking at climate change by degrees?\u000a\u000aLynas: A lot of people want to know what warming we get with what emissions path, or what warming we might get by what date. That's pretty fundamentally uncertain because they depend on different factors which aren't very well quantified. I felt that looking at it degree by degree was much more robust. If the temperature rises by X amount then what will be Y impacts? There are three major sources of information about that. One is the observational changes we're already seeing in terms of impacts in temperature rise. The second is computer models showing different ecosystem changes or whatever. And the third is paleoclimate sources -- so looking at how the climate was different in earlier hotter periods in geologic time. So piecing those together and mapping them onto a degree by degree picture seemed to me to be a way to try to convey this in a visual and intuitive -- but also highly scientifically appropriate -- way.\u000a\u000aSutter: What do you think about the world's focus on the 2-degree mark? One activist said to me that 2 degrees is the only thing the international community agrees upon for climate change.\u000a\u000aLynas: I think it's important to have a target -- because it focuses policy and it focuses people's efforts. And it makes sense also to have a target based on the temperature. But it's not something we can meet, by definition. We don't have a simple thermostat where we can decide exactly how much carbon to emit and have an exact temperature result dependent on that. So, there's uncertainty, really, about what level of emissions will lead to what temperature outcomes, by when. However, I think that 2 degrees is really the absolute upper limit of what's tolerable in terms of ecosystems and, probably, adaptive capacities of human societies. A 2-degree world is a world without coral reefs, and with much less snow and ice and with fairly dramatic heatwaves -- and other impacts. So, I would like to see a global warming future in which warming actually is lower than that, personally.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you think that's possible?\u000a\u000aLynas: I think it's possible. It's not very likely. If our current understanding of climate sensitivity is broadly correct then we're probably going to come in between 2 and 3 degrees, somewhere, by the end of the century. I guess the good news is the absolutely calamitous 5 and 6 degree outcomes are particularly unlikely, too, although still possible. And certainly, the risk of them happening is higher than the risk of an airplane crashing when we get onto it.\u000a\u000aSutter: Wait, so you're saying the risk of 5 or 6 degrees of warming -- a doomsday scenario -- is higher than an airplane crashing?\u000a\u000aLynas: Well, the likelihood of an airplane crashing is, I don't know, one in 1 million -- or something on that order of magnitude. Whereas the likelihood of coming within 5 or 6 degrees of warming is probably more than 1 in 100. It's the sort of risk that one would not tolerate at a personal level. But, perhaps because we can diffuse responsibility, we feel that it's tolerable for our species to take that gamble with the whole planet. Maybe it's because we just think there's nothing we can do about it. And we have an in-built optimism bias, myself included, where we like to think that things will just turn out all right, because they often tend to. And meantime we'll go on with our lives as normal. It's a big ask, I guess, to make society as a whole forgo the main energy source we all enjoy, which is fossil fuels, in order to forestall uncertain impacts decades into the future.\u000a\u000aSutter: One of the things that struck me from your book is that you were surprised people are depressed by climate change. Isn't this a pretty depressing subject?\u000a\u000aIt doesn't really matter whether you find it depressing or not, it's the scientific reality. We have to deal with it. A thing like climate change is known as a 'wicked problem.' It's seen differently by different people, according to their psychological, political and cultural biases. You can frame it as just a technology challenge: Let's get off of fossil fuels and let's get onto renewables and nuclear -- easy. Or you can frame it as a moral challenge: We're trespassing on the rights of future generations and how dare we do that. Or you can see it as a political challenge -- that somehow these big fossil fuel corporations are transgressing democracy and forcing us to stay hooked on oil and coal and gas. Different people, according to their politics, will see climate change fundamentally in this way. It's not a simple problem to understand.\u000a\u000aSutter: So how do you look at it? Do you ever find climate change overwhelming or depressing, personally?\u000a\u000aWell, I'm a pragmatist. I think it's a solvable problem. I don't think we need to abandon capitalism or change our entire political system in order to tackle this challenge. Other people do, and I disagree with them on that. And we have debates late into the night. But I think with next-generation nuclear technologies, and particularly with the way solar power is developing so rapidly, and how rapidly it's coming down in cost, and how quickly the technology is improving, there are zero-carbon options now becoming much more widely available, which will bring down our emissions much more rapidly than people think -- or than people thought just a few years ago. I don't think there's any point being pessimistic about that. Pessimistic people don't achieve anything. It's important to do what's possible -- and to do it quickly.\u000a\u000aSutter: What do you make of the way the world's responding?\u000a\u000aLynas: We are now inhabiting a human-dominated planet. We are in a new epoch known as the Anthropocene. The Holocene is now considered to be over. And I don't think there's really been another species that has had that effect on the planet before -- maybe the first bacteria that emitted oxygen, or photosynthesizing microorganisms. But we really are into terra incognita looking forward. That gives our species a serious level of responsibility for planetary management that people just don't really appreciate at any kind of fundamental physiological or political level. We are in charge. It's up to us. We actually do have an overall effect on the earth's temp. It's not up to Mother Nature anymore to run the show.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you have children?\u000a\u000aLynas: Yeah. The reason I was distracted just a minute ago was my kids just came back from school.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you talk to them about this? What do you say?\u000a\u000aLynas: I talk to them a bit. They know what I do. Younger generations have grown up with this specter. It's a bit like how those of us who are older grew up with the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation ... So they're not entirely in a different situation, I suppose, from previous generations. You could feel bad for future generations, but on the other hand I'm not sure their future is any worse than the future for somebody born in, say, 1900, who in all likelihood, in Europe, would have killed in one of the world wars. It's a manageable problem. We're beginning to get the grips of it. There are some positive signs already -- China and the U.S. agreeing to peak emissions, and things like that. So it's not a counsel of despair. And I think it's important to talk to kids at that level -- not to make them think that somehow they're fundamentally doomed.\u000a\u000aThat isn't the case and doesn't have to be the case.\u000a\u000aSutter: What needs to happen to ensure things do improve? What are the benchmarks you're looking to to say, 'OK, we're managing this problem. We're doing what's needed'?\u000a\u000aLynas: Well, I'm a Well, I'm a ecomodernist , which is a new label a lot of environmental thinkers are beginning to attach to themselves -- because it's a bit different from more traditional environmentalism, which thought we were somehow doomed or we were fundamentally a destructive species. We can turn this around -- this and other problems as well, if we have a more pragmatic approach to politics, economist -- and especially technology. We need to have a price on carbon, so that emitting carbon dioxide isn't cheaper than other energy sources. We need to invest heavily in research and development in zero-carbon sources, including next-generation nuclear renewable energies, especially solar. And we need to deploy them on an ever wider scale, with increased financing. We also need to have a political agreement -- so there's a sense the whole world is moving in the right direction. All of those things are not just possible, but I think they're fundamentally achievable, and likely. But we need to keep the pressure up on politicians and on everyone else.\u000a\u000aEmail questions to: climate [at] cnn.com.\u000a\u000aFollow the project on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram

He formerly was a foreign correspondent for The New York Times in Asia and Europe, and Paris correspondent for CBS News. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Forget about putting the nuclear genie back in any bottle in Pyongyang. North Korea will have -- and will not be dissuaded from possessing -- a deliverable nuclear weapon.\u000a\u000aSo now it's up to President Donald Trump to exercise a degree of verbal restraint -- which many fear he could be lacking -- that would allow historic forces to hold off Armageddon.\u000a\u000aA gesture, however slim -- like an early end to the war games -- could pay enormous dividends, while costing the United States little.\u000a\u000aAt the moment, we have a couple of things to be thankful for. First, Trump hasn't ripped up the Iran nuclear treaty as he promised throughout his campaign. If he had, we'd currently be looking at two rogue states with nukes.\u000a\u000aSecond, the role of China -- North Korea's neighbor and principal guarantor of its existence -- which has its own nuclear weapons, not to mention millions of citizens within an immediate blast or fallout radius of any nuclear retaliation by the United States, should Kim be so inclined as to provoke nuclear war.\u000a\u000aWith these two "blessings" in place, how do we cope with the reality of a nuclearized North Korea?\u000a\u000aQuite simply, we must find a diplomatic route to a mutually assured destruction, or MAD, regime that can serve to monitor and contain North Korea. Mutually assured destruction is a concept that helped keep nuclear war at bay throughout the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union -- each with by far the largest and most easily deployed nuclear arsenals -- recognized that the launch of nuclear weapons by one against the other would lead to certain destruction of its own nation and people. As the nuclear club multiplied, this meta-stability was somehow maintained. India and Pakistan cancel each other out under their MAD regime. When China came on board, Beijing recognized that if it used its nukes, the United States would obliterate it.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED North Korea makes threat about annual exercise Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korea makes threat about annual exercise 01:21\u000a\u000aThis began to break down when that the madman dictator Moammar Gadhafi seemed on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon of his own in the late 1990s. After the American invasion of Iraq, Gadhafi recognized what might be in store for him if he didn't dismantle his nuclear weapons program, which he agreed to do, shipping abroad 25 tons of equipment and documentation, including enrichment centrifuge components.\u000a\u000aThe problem today is that Kim is said to have paid close attention to what eventually happened to Gadhafi when , mortally wounded, he was found hiding in a drain in the late days of the Libyan Revolution.\u000a\u000aKim does not in any sense want to commit what he would see as the ultimate in existential foolhardiness -- giving up his nuclear ambitions prematurely.\u000a\u000aStill, the principle of mutually assured destruction has held for more than a half-century. But there are elements that are essential if it is to continue to hold Armageddon at bay with the arrival of North Korea.\u000a\u000ahas been accused by South Korea in the killing of his One key element of MAD is that no nation can needlessly, or mindlessly, provoke another. Under such a rule, it would be essential to prevent our President from further antagonizing the one head of state who may have a hair trigger and even thinner skin -- Kim. He's less than half Trump's age, with even less self-control, or at least constraints on his behavior. It should never be forgotten that Kim ordered the assassination of his uncle andhas been accused by South Korea in the killing of his half-brother for offenses that would barely have gotten them fired from Trump's White House or even "The Apprentice."\u000a\u000aWe may also now find that Japan and even South Korea feel a need for their own nuclear arsenals. Already, the Japanese government is considering authorizing development of its own offensive military capability for the first time since it lost World War II. And South Korea's President has asked the United States for permission to build more powerful ballistic missiles. Monitoring and containing Kim's nuclear arsenal is essential if we are to restrain a proliferation of nuclear arsenals across the Pacific Rim that will truly rock the foundations of MAD.\u000a\u000aBut how long must we exercise such restraint or live in such a potentially unstable universe? Quite possibly for a while -- at least in political or diplomatic terms. We could see 20 to 30 years before there is real regime change in North Korea that holds any promise of reigning in its nuclear ambitions or restoring some balance to its diplomatic and military priorities.\u000a\u000aSuch a change is far from impossible. Remember we never thought regime change would arrive in the Soviet Union or Libya, yet both occurred in the blink of an historian's eye. This time, the wait may be more fraught and will likely mean some fairly dramatic shifts in our perspective and especially that of Trump.\u000a\u000aWe must begin to find some means of demonstrating to Kim a modicum of the respect, which he clearly craves as a future member of the nuclear club -- the same "respect," incidentally, that we gave Gadhafi up to the moment he was deposed. It was also the same respect Ronald Reagan afforded Mikhail Gorbachev until the very moment when communism collapsed of its own weight nearly three decades ago.\u000a\u000aOne option might be not to cancel the bi-annual military maneuvers, which have been held twice a year for four decades, since a cancellation would looking like a sign of weakness. But scaling back their duration and pitching it as a good-faith gesture could stop Kim from feeling he has to issue threats as a response.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, we must devote all our energies to making sure that none of Kim's nukes fall into the hands of individuals or groups that no one can contain and who will have no restraints on their use.

aVGeneration X has a gripe with pulse takers, zeitgeist keepers and population counters. We keep squeezing them out of the frame.\u000a\u000aThis overlooked generation currently ranges in age from 34 to 49, which may be one reason they\u2019re so often missing from stories about demographic, social and political change. They\u2019re smack in the middle innings of life, which tend to be short on drama and scant of theme.\u000a\u000aBut there are other explanations that have nothing to do with their stage of the life cycle.\u000a\u000aGen Xers are bookended by two much larger generations \u2013 the Baby Boomers ahead and the Millennials behind \u2013 that are strikingly different from one another. And in most of the ways we take stock of generations \u2013 their racial and ethnic makeup; their political, social and religious values; their economic and educational circumstances; their technology usage \u2013 Gen Xers are a low-slung, straight-line bridge between two noisy behemoths.\u000a\u000aThe charts below tell the tale.\u000a\u000aTo be fair, there are a few metrics that don\u2019t fit this straightforward pattern of generational evolution. For example, over the course of their voting lives, older Gen Xers have tended to be more Republican than both older Boomers and younger Millennials. Also, Xers are more pessimistic than both of those larger generations that they\u2019ll have enough money for their retirement \u2013 though some of that negativity is doubtless tied to the economic stresses of middle age.\u000a\u000aGen Xers also stand out in another way. In 2010 when Pew Research asked adults of all ages if they thought their own generation was unique, about six-in-ten Boomers and Millennials said yes. But only about half of Gen Xers said the same. And even among those who did, there was very little consensus about why they are distinctive.\u000a\u000aOne reason Xers have trouble defining their own generational persona could be that they\u2019ve rarely been doted on by the media. By contrast, Baby Boomers have been a source of media fascination from the get-go (witness their name). And Millennials, the \u201ceverybody-gets-a-trophy\u201d generation, have been the subject of endless stories about their racial diversity, their political and social liberalism, their voracious technology use, and their grim economic circumstances.\u000a\u000aGen Xers have also gotten the short end of basic generational arithmetic. Due partly to their parents\u2019 relatively low fertility rates, there are fewer of them (65 million) than Boomers (77 million) or Millennials (an estimated 83 million assuming a roughly 20-year age span and including those who have yet to reach adulthood).\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s another reason that Xers are a small generation: They\u2019ve been deemed to span just 16 years, while most generations are credited with lasting for about 20 years. How come? No one really knows. Generational boundaries are fuzzy, arbitrary and culture-driven. Once fixed by the mysterious forces of the zeitgeist, they tend to firm up over time.\u000a\u000aOne final slight: Even their name is a retread. World War II photographer Robert Capa first coined the term Generation X in a photo essay about the young adults of the 1950s, but the label didn\u2019t stick the first time around. It was revived thirty years later by Canadian author Douglas Coupland, whose coming of age novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, was set in Southern California.\u000a\u000aFor Xers, there\u2019s one silver lining in all this. From everything we know about them, they\u2019re savvy, skeptical and self-reliant; they\u2019re not into preening or pampering, and they just might not give much of a hoot what others think of them. Or whether others think of them at all.\u000a\u000aPaul Taylor, executive vice president for special projects at the Pew Research Center, is the author of The Next America: Boomers, Millennials and the Looming Generational Showdown (Public Affairs, 2014). In other words, he\u2019s part of the problem.\u000a\u000aTopics: Demographics, Political Attitudes and Values, Generations and Age

aVFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It's too bad Superman is not running for president of the United States; this would have been his year. Americans, as we have discovered, are angry, frustrated, disillusioned -- and yearning for a savior.\u000a\u000aThis happened before, almost a century ago in Europe. It was a time of despair; a time when the old models didn't seem to be working, when the world was changing in confusing ways, and hyperconfident individuals proposed a way out by blaming scapegoats and promising exciting, almost miraculous change. The results proved catastrophic.\u000a\u000aNo, America is not 1930s Germany, not by a long shot. But the images of Europe after World War I keep coming to mind. The parallels are not precise, but we hear the echoes, see the shadows. We should heed the warnings.\u000a\u000aWho would have thought that in the 21st century, American voters would be seriously considering as presidential candidates a neofascist and a neosocialist -- throwbacks to the old, failed utopias? Talk about fashionably retro!\u000a\u000aLooking at Donald Trump stoking his supporters into a frenzy, attacking "them" -- whoever "they" happen to be at the moment -- vowing to return American to greatness and then flashing his self-satisfied smile, the mind harks back to those grainy newsreel images of Benito Mussolini , the theatrical Italian "Duce," the leader, who became the central figure of fascist Italy a century ago.\u000a\u000aIs Trump a fascist? No, not quite. In fact, Trump doesn't propose anything close to a coherent ideology. He's a Trumpist. And we're only learning what that means, along with him, as he makes it up.\u000a\u000aFascists viewed the nation as an organism superseding the needs of the individual. That does not match Trump's rhetoric. But fascists also ridiculed and suppressed the opposition, and they embraced a level of authoritarianism that we can only hope Trump would reject. But who knows?\u000a\u000aCult of personality\u000a\u000aOne distinct similarity between Trump and the populist politicians of the 1930s is his ability to create and draw power from a cult of personality. The Republican front-runner's main campaign platform is that he will make everything OK. Trump will fix it. Trump will make America great again. How? That's not clear. He will do it by the power of his Trumpness. And we know it will work because look at him; look at how successful he is. Look how strong and fearless he is. There's very little in the way of substance. There's just a lot of Trump.\u000a\u000aAnd to prove how much America needs him, he reminds voters that America is in deep, deep trouble. He hints at nefarious conspiracies; he highlights every problem and every threat, making it sound as ominous as possible. And then he vows to tackle it without mercy, even if it means committing war crimes, violating the Constitution , and expelling millions of people from the country. That, incidentally, would create the digital color version of those 1930s deportations : armed U.S. security forces (very armed) leading frightened people to the trains. (Or would he make them walk across the border?)\u000a\u000aCharisma is a dangerous power in the wrong hands. When combined with popular discontent and disorienting change it can make a travesty of democracy and it can disfigure a society.\u000a\u000aValidating prejudices\u000a\u000aTrump has an uncanny ability to bring out the worst instincts in people. He validates the prejudices that people try to erase from their hearts. Trump seems alarmingly reluctant to distance himself from support from the KKK. Instead of debating ideas and policies, Trump insults and mocks people. He routinely appears to advocate violence against protesters, another disturbing throwback to the 1930s, and he draws a sharp distinction between "us" and "them."\u000a\u000aWe don't know what kind of a president he would be. It's hard to imagine he would continue to speak of punching people in the face, or that he would continue to mock people with disabilities, or follow through with any of his illegal or nonsensical proposals as a head of state. But there's no telling. He has already defied all predictions.\u000a\u000aIn a new turn of events since Thursday's GOP debate, Trump's opponents, who had seemed intimidated by Trump's savaging of Jeb Bush, have finally decided to take him on. It's good to see them challenging his empty offerings, but it's unsettling to see Sen. Marco Rubio also resorting to personality-driven attacks, eliciting uproarious laughter from his supporters. Despite the laughs, it's a sad sight.\u000a\u000aSanders found a scapegoat\u000a\u000aThen there's the other end of the political spectrum: Sen.

In the manner of a demagogue, he declared , "Fraud is the business model of Wall Street."\u000a\u000aSanders proposes social programs containing the seed of potentially useful ideas, and he undoubtedly points to very real flaws in the system.

aVStory highlights Scott Jennings: Politicians wanting to stall policymaking until Trump improves\u000a\u000aBut grinding policymaking to a halt fails to hold Trump accountable, he says\u000a\u000aScott Jennings is a CNN contributor and former special assistant to President George W. Bush. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I am no fan of President Donald Trump's reaction to the Charlottesville violence, which left one woman dead and many others injured. I said so Saturday on CNN and then again Tuesday night, after he unraveled Monday's wonderfully crafted statement in his press conference and reverted to his earlier misbegotten remarks.\u000a\u000aBut I am extremely concerned by the overreactions to his admittedly head-spinning response.\u000a\u000aThe first popular overreaction has come from some #neverTrump Republicans and goes something like this: "There's no tax cut, no road project, no (regulatory) relief worth enacting to justify being silent while Trump's actions emboldens hate, divides USA."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Corker: Trump hasn't demonstrated stability Replay More Videos ...

Essentially, the argument is that because Trump mishandled his response to Charlottesville ( "shredding" decency, Weaver said) the Republican Party should hold him accountable by ceasing to pursue any and all core conservative objectives that make up the heart of the GOP policy agenda.\u000a\u000aHow does grinding policymaking to a halt hold Trump accountable? The public already hates Washington, in large part because of the glacial pace of policy progress. Bringing it to a dead stop would make it worse.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVNikolaj Coster-Waldau is an actor and activist. In addition to starring on "Game of Thrones," he is a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Development Programme, which is an executive partner of UNLEASH Lab . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In "Game of Thrones" -- the television show in which I play fictional knight Jaime Lannister -- one of the many stunning visual images on regular display is an overwhelmingly massive wall of ice. I know all too well that, were "Game of Thrones" a nonfiction world, that wall of ice would be seriously imperiled by climate change.\u000a\u000aI know this because my second home is in the similarly ice-rich territory of Greenland. My wife is from Uummannaq in the northwest of Greenland, and my two daughters are half Greenlandic. In the considerable time I have spent there, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of rising temperatures on the delicate ecosystem of the world's largest island.\u000a\u000aWhat happens in Greenland is not usually of primary interest to Americans -- nor anyone else outside of the North Atlantic, for that matter. But it should be. If the Greenland ice sheet -- which covers 80% of Greenland -- melts, the results for the rest of the planet will be monumental. And not in a good way. Experts predict that, if the Greenland ice sheet does indeed melt, sea levels would rise 20 feet (6 meters).\u000a\u000aThe risks of climate change do not end at simply rising sea levels, which alone should be of concern to residents of New York, Miami, New Orleans and scores of other major metropolitan areas in the United States. The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -- which set a road map for tackling the planet's most pressing problems -- are delicately intertwined, so that failing to act on one, such as climate change, can have enormous negative consequences on another, such as hunger, poverty, ocean life, energy and even education.\u000a\u000aClimate change also adds an element of unpredictability to weather patterns , leading to an increase in the number and intensity of natural disasters.\u000a\u000aThat is why I am trying to call attention to the dangerous consequences of ignoring climate change. I have happily accepted an appointment as a goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), via which I am championing their work implementing the 17 SDGs -- including fighting climate change. UNDP's portfolio includes helping countries reduce greenhouse gases and their carbon footprints. It is also advocating disaster resilience (minimizing the risk of disasters and helping design effective disaster-recovery plans).\u000a\u000aWe are already seeing a surge in renewable energy investment in countries like China and India ; Honduras and others are committed to protecting and expanding forest coverage; while across Africa and small islands , more accessible and affordable off-grid energy systems are providing clean energy to millions. And mayors from cities like New York , Lima, Rotterdam, Seoul, Amman, and Cape Town have reaffirmed their commitment to implement the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau teamed up with Google Maps to shine a spotlight on climate change effects in Greenland.\u000a\u000aThat is why I also applaud the work of UNLEASH Lab, which for the past eight days has convened 1,000 millennial thought leaders from 129 countries to come up with innovative solutions that can help achieve the SDGs.\u000a\u000aThe event -- which has taken place in my home country of Denmark, but which will continue for the next 13 years in a rotating cast of cities, until the year 2030, when the Sustainable Development Goals are hopefully realized -- is a noteworthy example of much-needed youth engagement, cross-cultural collaboration, and disruptive thinking. UNLEASH concludes on Monday night in Aarhus when 12 out of the 200 proposed ideas will receive awards and potential future funding.\u000a\u000aLike any parent, I want a safe and secure world for my children, their children and the generations to come. We must not bury our heads in the sand when it comes to climate change -- we must instead have the courage to make other changes to preserve the stability and safety of our planet.

aV(CNN) Tina Fey shoveled sheet cake into her mouth on a "Saturday Night Live" skit while ranting about the politics surrounding violent rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia. She urged viewers to not attend the dangerous marches and to eat cake instead.\u000a\u000a"I know a lot of us are feeling anxious, and we're asking ourselves, like, what can I do? I'm just one person; what can I do?" Fey says.\u000a\u000aOK, so everyone has different ways of managing stress. Wouldn't it be nice if those coping mechanisms were always healthy? But most of us have, at some point, come home from a rough day at work and scarfed down a personal pizza, or a pint of ice cream, or maybe even a sheet cake.\u000a\u000aKatie Rosso, a junior at the University of Missouri, said her most intense stress-eating experiences came when she was the manager of her student newspaper. Every Tuesday, the staff would stay up until 4 a.m. getting the paper ready for production, giving her only a few hours to spare before a 9 a.m. class.\u000a\u000a"Just to take the edge off, I would eat so much. And then I'd go home at the end of the night and be like, 'OK, I had two sodas, a Propel, one package of Starbursts, chips,' " Rosso said. "Just because I needed something to do while doing the work, to kind of keep my brain occupied on something more positive."\u000a\u000aWhile Rosso was eating, she felt good and more relaxed, but afterward, she would lie in bed and "feel disgusting," she said.\u000a\u000aThis year, she's trying to eat healthier. She packs watermelon and popcorn to snack on at work, and she tries to have smaller portions.\u000a\u000a"I think I still definitely eat when I'm stressed. But now it's more controlled, so I control it more than it controls me," she said.\u000a\u000aGaining control\u000a\u000aThe type of impulsivity that prompts you to stuff yourself with sugary cereal after a stressful day is a result of emotional hunger, said Rachel Goldman, a psychologist specializing in health and disordered eating. We can experience emotional hunger when we're stressed, sad or angry, often leading to eating because of those emotions.\u000a\u000aGoldman conducted a study in which she showed photos of comfort foods to patients who had bariatric surgery. Those who were less successful with weight loss after surgery had parts of their brain light up when they looked at the food, while those who were more successful did not. This result shows that food could have potentially addictive qualities, she said.\u000a\u000aThere is a distinction between stress eating and binge eating, she said. Binge eating is when someone quickly eats an abnormally large amount of food in a short amount of time and feels out of control while doing it, such as downing an entire package of Oreos in a half-hour and then feeling guilty. Stress eating may be impulsive, but it's not always followed by guilt.\u000a\u000a"If you can go into eating ice cream and cookies with the conscious decision that 'I wanted this' and can accept that you're going to eat it, no big deal, no harm done, then the thought that happens after the behavior is most likely not going to be feeling guilty," Goldman said.\u000a\u000aThe issue is when someone acts impulsively and eats without thinking about whether they actually want it, she said. If stress eating gets out of control, it could lead to binge eating. The key to gaining control is taking a moment to think before you eat something that may be unnecessary.\u000a\u000a"They're going to feel guilty, feel bad about it," Goldman said. "Then that negative thought will turn into perhaps another negative behavior, perhaps a negative emotion. And our thoughts, emotions and behaviors are all linked. So that can turn into a downward spiral."\u000a\u000aBeware: Even thinking of food as a reward after doing something tough is considered to be emotional eating, she said. And any type of eating because of emotion, not because of physiological hunger, is an unhealthy coping mechanism.\u000a\u000a"It's not exactly solving the problem," she said. Someone trying to combat stress eating should be prepared with a handful of alternative options. Those who are tempted by junk food at work should pack a protein bar, an apple or another nutritious snack so that they know they have a healthy option if the office orders pizza.\u000a\u000aTo avoid eating in general, going for a walk, cleaning up or calling a friend are all good choices, Goldman said. If 10 minutes pass and you're not hungry anymore, it might be emotional hunger. If you're still hungry, your body probably does need food.\u000a\u000aCan stress eating ever be healthy?\u000a\u000aSo is there a healthy side to stress eating? Not quite, according to Goldman.\u000a\u000a"If we think of eating, we really should only be eating to survive," she said. "When it comes to eating out of a stress or comfort, really there are other ways to cope with those problems. So eating really shouldn't be those."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aBut cleaning your house probably doesn't sound as appealing as a bowl of hot mac and cheese after a fight with your partner. Lisa Drayer, a registered dietician who writes about nutrition for CNN, says that eating to quell your stress once in a while is fine.\u000a\u000a"I think there's a spectrum. It could start out as, you're enjoying a scoop of ice cream. Or you just really need a piece of chocolate. And you savor it and love it. That's fine," said Drayer. "But when the portions become out of hand, that's when it becomes a problem, because then it could really lead to weight gain."\u000a\u000aA reward pizza here and or stress candy bar there can add up. Eating 500 extra calories a day could lead to a pound of weight gain per week, she said. However, there's no need to be hard on yourself after one rough night.\u000a\u000a"Don't feel badly," Drayer said. "Just get back on track the next day."

We are the tip of the sphere of a new face of music," said Miyashiro. "The reason for that is we are the first label that actually is making impact in the West and East."\u000a\u000aJapanese-Korean Brooklynite Sean Miyashiro\u000a\u000aStraight outta China\u000a\u000aBut 88 Rising acts are not the first Asian faces to make inroads in America.\u000a\u000aIn 2004, Chinese American rapper MC Jin made headlines after winning numerous freestyle battles, before later signing to the well-known hip-hop label Ruff Ryders.\u000a\u000a"It was good that Jin and people like that existed to trailblaze the way, but it's a completely different era now," said Miyashiro. "I think with social media, people are used to seeing Asian people in general ... and the world is more open."\u000a\u000aCompared with MC Jin's debut single "Learn Chinese," Higher Brothers' online hit "Made in China" offers more of a nuanced take on modern Asian identity. Both songs mix English and Chinese lyrics, but the Higher Brothers go deeper, poking fun at themselves. (Sample lyric: "My chains, new gold watch, made in China. We play ping-pong ball, made in China.") In the video, which has so far racked up more than 3 million hits on YouTube, they don China Olympics track suits and Chun Li-style buns, all the while rapping in a slow Dirty South-like drawl.\u000a\u000aUnlike themes common in US hip-hop, the Higher Brothers rap about their everyday lives, with songs about 7-11 convenience stores and the social media platform WeChat. Their lyrics alternate between the profane and the profound. One of their emcees, Melo, even got in trouble with China's notorious censors over a viral song about Uber that featured the lines, "I don't write political hip-hop. But if any politicians try to shut me up, I'll cut off their heads and lay them at their corpses' feet."\u000a\u000aWe're "straight outta China!" said band member MasiWei of the band's unique style and attitude, adding that "nothing" is off limits to the group.\u000a\u000aHigher Brothers, who have four singles off their latest album "Black Cab," attribute their new-found popularity with American audiences to 88 Rising.\u000a\u000a"It's so exciting. We're all Asian, but we have a different culture and style," said MasiWei, of working with the label.\u000a\u000aThe 24-year-old added that while language can sometimes be a barrier, their goals are "the same."\u000a\u000aChengdu rap crew HIgher Brothers\u000a\u000a"Generally, people are very supportive," said Rich Chigga, who is ethnically Chinese. "When I came to America [for his summer five-city tour] and I met with all these rappers I talked to online, they showed a lot of love ... There was probably just a few racist YouTube comments, but that was really it."\u000a\u000aBrian Imanuel, better known as "Rich Chigga," in Miami\u000a\u000aIn some ways, their paths seem to be easier than their Asian-American counterparts'.\u000a\u000a"We grow up in America, getting slotted into a lane and having to follow the American societal norms, political norms, etc., but these guys are free from all that," said Andrew Fung, half of Fung Bros ., a Chinese-American duo popular on YouTube, who collaborated with Higher Brothers. "They're Asian from Asian countries, so there's cultural space for them to be more fluid. They get to be who they want to be, say what they want to say and it's refreshing."\u000a\u000aUp next for 88 Rising are more tours and more artists, as well as maybe adding a female artist to the lineup. Rich Chigga just finished a summer tour and is going on a wider US tour in the fall. Higher Brothers is playing a China-wide tour, with a sold-out concert in Hong Kong in August and a November appearance at Clockenflap , Hong Kong's massive music festival, whose lineup includes Massive Attack, Feist and The Dandy Warhols.\u000a\u000aJoji, Keith Ape and Rich Chigga\u000a\u000a88 Rising is also bringing American artists to Asia.\u000a\u000a"People are coming to us to collaborate now. We're the tastemakers," said Miyashiro. "They want to be big in Asia and appreciate our freshness and unique point of view."

aVNot many banks have a cult following. Monzo is a rare exception.\u000a\u000aMore than 100,000 Brits have signed up for the smartphone bank that claims it will revolutionize banking.\u000a\u000aSeveral mobile-only banks have been launched in the U.K., including Atom and Tandem, but Monzo has quickly become the most popular.\u000a\u000aMonzo was founded two years ago by Tom Blomfield, a former Oxford law student who had previously co-founded GoCardless, a direct debit provider.\u000a\u000aDeeply frustrated with traditional banks, he decided he could do better.\u000a\u000aBlomfield said his cards would be blocked when he made payments abroad -- even though he had told his bank he was going on holiday. Fees were charged for cash withdrawals overseas, or for overdrafts he knew nothing about. And when his bank was suffering problems with its systems, there was a lack of communication.\u000a\u000a"It's just amazing that there's literally so much control and power at our fingertips and banking hasn't really adopted any of that," he said.\u000a\u000aMonzo offers something rather different to main street banks and their digital offshoots. It sends you a notification every time you make a purchase, and won't charge you when you travel.\u000a\u000aExchanged £90 at the post office and got \u20ac90.\u000a\u000aPaid for a \u20ac93 @Deliveroo whilst in Berlin and @monzo charged £79.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYES, MONZO LAD \U0001f91c\U0001f3fc \u2014 Emma Ware (@EmmaCWare) February 13, 2017\u000a\u000aIt allows you to track purchases in real time, temporarily freeze your card if you've lost it and help you stick to a strict monthly budget.\u000a\u000aEverything Monzo does seems like a no-brainer. Blomfield says that's because he had no experience in traditional banking.\u000a\u000a"Having the baggage of experience sometimes is a hindrance because you have this fairly rigid view of the status quo. (Monzo) started from scratch, so there's almost a value in that naivity and not having any preconceptions," he said.\u000a\u000aFor now, Monzo's limited banking license (granted in August 2016) only allows it to support pre-paid Mastercards that you have to top up using Apple pay or a bank transfer.\u000a\u000aBut Blomfield expects the restrictions to be lifted "very shortly." This would allow Monzo to offer classic checking accounts, starting in the next few months.\u000a\u000aDespite the limited services, Monzo is generating an enthusiastic following on social media.\u000a\u000aRecently signed up with challenger bank @Monzo - loving the simplicity and UX already \u2014 Francesca Russell (@FranRussel1) February 24, 2017\u000a\u000aFirst month using @monzo and I'm far too excited to manage my banking #amianadultyet ?\U0001f4b3 \u2014 Alice Wells (@wellsalice) February 23, 2017\u000a\u000aBy being open about how it develops its product, Blomfield says Monzo has been able to create a product people actually enjoy using and find valuable enough to tell their friends about it.\u000a\u000a"It's a virtuous cycle of reinforcement," he said.\u000a\u000aTo avoid being overwhelmed, the startup makes new customers wait a week for their hot coral debit cards.\u000a\u000aMonzo has yet to make a profit. But Blomfield says he expects that will change when it's able to offer full bank accounts -- particularly from overdrafts.\u000a\u000a"Monzo will tell you up front even before you've overdrawn that you're running out of cash. It'll tell you: Here's how much it'll cost you if you borrow -- you'll never be charged more than X pounds. Do you want to take this, yes or no?"\u000a\u000a@ianjamescox The second @monzo current accounts become available I'm switching. App, customer support is light years ahead of current banks \u2014 Callum Strong (@csscallum) February 23, 2017\u000a\u000aBlomfield's plan doesn't end with checking accounts. Ultimately he wants Monzo to allow users to file expense reports to their employers, split bills with their partner or roommates, and even check whether they're getting the best deal on gas and electricity -- all within one app.

aVYou use an inhaler to breathe medication directly into your lungs, and these inhalers come in dry-powder or metered-dose forms. While asthma inhalers typically work in more or less the same way, they can be just different enough that you might have to use a slightly different inhalation technique with each one. You might find that you\u2019re just not comfortable with a particular asthma inhaler. If you have trouble using it, you\u2019re less likely to use it\u2014so it\u2019s important to find the right one for you to keep your asthma controlled. If you\u2019re concerned about your inhaler technique, talk to your healthcare provider about finding an alternative that\u2019s better suited to you.

aV(CNN) Bruce Lee, a beer parlor in Lagos and a triumphant dance on mud -- sometimes the strangest of combinations can help produce the most spectacular of results.\u000a\u000aBack in 1973, Lemi Ghariokwu was straight out of secondary school, spending his ample free time giving himself drawing assignments and making portraits for people in his neighborhood. Martial arts action film "Enter the Dragon," starring Bruce Lee, was a big hit at the time, and Ghariokwu was asked by a local bar owner to draw a poster of the movie for his pub.\u000a\u000aThe self-taught designer did so, and a few days later a journalist called Babatunde Harrison entered the parlor, saw the poster hanging on the wall and quickly asked to see the person who'd created it. When he met Ghariokwu, who was living next door with his parents, Harrison requested to see more of his drawings. Amongst them was an illustration of Nigerian afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti dancing on mud -- Ghariokwu had previously bought an album by Kuti called "Roforofo Fight" (roforofo means mud in Yoruba) and had given himself the task of creating his own version of the album cover.\u000a\u000aImpressed by Ghariokwu's work, Harrison, who was a friend of Kuti, asked Ghariokwu whether he could design album covers. The teen artist reluctantly said yes and then Harrison brought him a picture of Kuti to do a portrait as a test.\u000a\u000a"I did the portrait and lo and behold he took me to Fela just like that," says Ghariokwu, recalling his first meeting with Kuti at his house, the infamous Kalakuta Republic. "When he saw the portrait, Fela said, 'wow, God damn it,'" he recalls, laughing. "It was the first time I heard these words. Fela loved the portrait so much and wrote me a check for 120 naira -- I used to earn 30 naira for my portrait work -- but I rejected it. I said 'I don't want money, I give you the work from the bottom of my heart.'\u000a\u000a"He was very surprised so he tore up the check, took a sheet of paper and wrote 'please admit bearer to any show free of charge,'" continues Ghariokwu. "That was my ticket to Kalakuta; that was the beginning [of the journey]."\u000a\u000aThat journey would last for nearly 20 years, as Ghariokwu would come to be Kuti's main cover artist, becoming the man behind the iconic images synonymous with identifying the blistering afrobeat sound. Overall, Ghariokwu designed 26 album covers for Kuti, who died on August 2, 1997. To mark the anniversary of Kuti's death, we reached out to Ghariokwu to find the story behind some of the iconic album covers he'd designed for him. Read below to see what he had to say.\u000a\u000a'Alagbon Close'\u000a\u000a"That was my first cover for Fela. A few weeks after I'd met him, his commune was attacked by the police; Fela was really brutalized and was taken to hospital with skull injuries. This was all over the news and Harrison took me to see him at the hospital. Badly injured, Fela was talking about he was going to write a song to lampoon the police.\u000a\u000a"After getting out, he started performing 'Alagbon Close' (that was the name of the street where the police headquarters were) at the Shrine and I became a regular there on Sundays -- he eventually recorded the song and the next thing he said to me was 'Lemi, let me see what you have to do about this cover.'\u000a\u000a"In my spirit I saw Fela working for the forces of good and I saw the police working for the forces of evil in society. So I came up with that illustration showing Alagbon Close as a decrepit jail house in flames, while on the other side of the cover, Fela's house, the Kalakuta Republic, stands on a rocky, solid foundation. A triumphant Fela has broken the chain and dances over a capsized police patrol boat. Actually that image of Fela was the same image I did on my version of the "Roforofo Fight" cover -- if you look at the artwork very closely, you see that it's like a collage; I cut out Fela's image and pasted it so it was like getting it fulfilled because when I was drawing it I'd never dreamed -- not in my wildest imagination -- that I was ever going to meet Fela."\u000a\u000a'No Bread'\u000a\u000a"'No Bread' was my second cover. By 1975, I'd became very close to Fela. Like Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, Fela smoked marijuana copiously -- nearly everyone in the community did. I was born a teetotaler -- I don't smoke, I don't drink -- but Fela said that smoking would help my creativity. I held Fela in so high esteem, he was like a demi-God, so I took up this challenge because he'd said so. So I tried some marijuana and got high -- but I became edgy, confused and thought I was going crazy!\u000a\u000aTony Allen on Fela Kuti "With me and Fela, it's a question of telepathy. That is why I was able to stick around this guy for 15 years -- you know, I never did that with anyone before; the maximum time I stayed in a band was one year. Since I met him I knew that this guy had something, this is the type of challenge I needed ... I just believed that I am meeting a genius and it's great to work with a genius."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNigerian drummer Tony Allen is famous for helping create Afrobeat as member of Fela Kuti's "Africa 70" band.\u000a\u000a"Fela saw I was uncomfortable and drove me home himself. He said, 'Lemi don't say anything to your parents, just say goodnight and go to bed and meditate, think about your new cover.' I slept for like 12 hours and when I woke up I started thinking about the artwork, like he'd suggested. So I took out my notebook and put all of my ideas down. In the end, I had too many completed for that square of the album cover space so I tried to include as many as possible.\u000a\u000a"'No Bread' was an oil painting on a canvas board and it took about two weeks to complete. When I took it to Fela he freaked out; he said, "Wow, see, I told you!" but I know I have a light brain, I can't be intoxicated at all so eventually I just withdrew. I didn't bother to use marijuana any more. I realized I could use meditation -- Fela and I were also meditating together when we studied metaphysics -- to get up to that degree of focus."\u000a\u000a'Kalakuta Show'\u000a\u000a"This illustration is straightforward; it's just the attack on Kalakuta shown in a graphic way, a direct illustration of that event -- like the song is directly talking about it.\u000a\u000a"The cover describes how the police came with their batons, their guns and their axes. If you look at it, Fela has a plaster on his forehead; I also put the date of the attack near there: November 23rd 1974.\u000a\u000a"You can also see Fela's lawyer Kanmi Osobu -- I included him because Fela mentions him in the song; I also wanted to pay tribute to him because he was known as 'the people's lawyer' and he was always helping Fela to fight the government."\u000a\u000a'Yellow Fever'\u000a\u000a"Fela came up with this song called 'Yellow Fever' -- this is a slang term describing women who bleach their skin -- to lampoon the practice. Because of the colonial education we've gone through, the brainwashing, many Africans feel inferior to white people. African women love to bleach because our men love fair-skinned women more, so this makes a lot of women to want to bleach their skin. Also, because of the inferiority complex, the vast majority of our women straighten their hair and they put on wigs.\u000a\u000a"When I heard the song, I loved it; Fela was caustic and very direct, so I felt I also needed to be very graphic about the bleaching of the skin and the bad effects it has on parts of the body.\u000a\u000a"I actually used a real model for the cover, a Kalakuta girl named Kokor -- she had fair skin and didn't bleach so I put all the blemishing just to underline my illustration's strong points."\u000a\u000a'Zombie'\u000a\u000a"'Zombie' is a tricky one, a troublesome cover. The song itself is trouble, big trouble, and was part of what led to the banning of Fela's house.\u000a\u000a"It took me a while to make the cover -- I wanted to illustrate but my spirit wasn't following and I couldn't come up with a direction to give my illustration. But one afternoon I got to Fela's place and there was Tunde Kuboye, the photographer and cinematographer husband of Fela's niece. He had with him a box of pictures, hundreds of photographs taken at the military parade for Nigeria's Independence Day on October 1. He just placed them on the ground for Fela to see. As I was looking at the pictures my spirit said to me this is album cover material!\u000a\u000a"I chose about a dozen pictures from the collection. I remember as I was editing a number of pictures to fit my album cover square size, those three pictures fell within my drawn square like in an Ifa priest's divination. I quickly used masking tape to hold them down in that divine movement, applied my Cow Gum adhesive and cut out the overlaps! I then finished up with a thick brush lettering for the title 'Zombie' and 'Fela and Africa 70.' Fait accompli!"\u000a\u000a'Beasts of No Nation'\u000a\u000a"By the time I did 'Beasts of No Nation' I had parted ways with Fela -- we had just a business relationship after "Sorrow Tears and Blood." Even though I wasn't close to Fela anymore, I knew his ideology so I could still do my work. I listened to the music over and over and I got the key points. I loved the song, the lyrics, I totally agreed with everything so I came up with that illustration.\u000a\u000a"I had enough material because Fela mentioned names in the song: people like Ronald Reagan of the U.S., Margaret Thatcher of the UK, and P.W. Botha of South Africa. He also lampooned the military government in Nigeria that had sent him to jail -- General Buhari, who interestingly is now the new president of Nigeria for the second time, and General Idiagbon.\u000a\u000a"I put Fela in Black Power salute; he was free from the jailhouse and right in front of him the man paying obedience was the chief judge that actually condemned him to five years of imprisonment. I also added President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and I put some rodents in military uniform with the insignia of the Nigerian army. So it was a dangerous cover but I've been lucky because the powers that be don't take visual art too seriously; they don't know the power that it has so that's why I escaped getting arrested."

aVJillian Peterson, Ph.D., is an assistant professor of criminal justice at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. She is a psychologist who studies violence. James Densley, Ph.D., is an associate professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University in St Paul. He is the author of " How Gangs Work " (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013). The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Efforts to " Unite the Right " in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12 were first mobilized via social media .\u000a\u000aSo, are social media platforms partly responsible for the organization of hundreds of young, white men in polo shirts around Nazi propaganda and the gut-wrenching violence that followed?\u000a\u000aTo answer this question, we first need to look at what the journey into extremism looks like at its core, even without social media. Studies show it typically starts with an individual who has a grievance with the world. Maybe it's poverty. Or abuse. The factory closing. Or the loss of a loved one. This grieved individual is looking for who or what to blame, and runs into someone who gives them a target for their anger.\u000a\u000aThrough conversation and rhetoric, this target becomes a caricature, thinking becomes black and white, and a mission for revenge is accepted. At some point, a decision is made to cross over from talk to action \u2014 often through symbolic violence, designed to attract attention and spark outrage. The response to this violence further fuels and intensifies the rhetoric, attracting new followers, beginning the cycle again.\u000a\u000aIt would be a stretch to say social media causes extremism. However, it has sent this process into overdrive. Social media enables antisocial people to become social. It lets lost souls "friend" one another and helps lone wolves find the pack. More than a means to perform socially deviant roles collectively, social media offers a platform to do it anonymously. And this is important if you don't want to be held accountable for your abhorrent, racist views.\u000a\u000aFrom KKK chapters to skinhead groups, anti-government militias to Christian identity collectives , right-wing extremism was always there, but before social media it lived a half-life on the fringes of society. Social media was its resurrection stone. No longer do you need to don the hood to know a Ku Klux Klan member or fly to Syria to learn more about ISIS: You can do it all from your cellphone.\u000a\u000aRight-wing extremism is not as much an ideological movement, as advertised, as it is a social one. Their ideology can be written in 140 characters or less. Groups have coalesced around shared individual deficits and, under the swastika hashtag, found a sense of collective identity and belonging that previously did not exist.\u000a\u000aBy accident or (algorithmic) design, social media has transformed stories that might have been dismissed as conspiracy theories into what some tout as conventional wisdom. Like teenagers and sex, right-wing extremists talk about violence far more than they engage in it, but all that talk dials up the expectation that "everyone is doing it."\u000a\u000aThe real perpetrators of extremist violence, in turn, are celebrated on social media, thereby encouraging status-seeking violence. Indeed, right-wing extremists have benefited from social media's capacity to turn everyday lives into dramatic performances. If the ability to become an instant celebrity from one viral act can inspire livestreamed rape torture , even murder on Facebook Live, it certainly can inspire violence in the name of hate.\u000a\u000aFor the once anonymous extremist, the appeal of quantifiable social status \u2014 measured in terms of the number of views, likes, retweets and followers you earn \u2014 s too great. Hence why the Pulse Nightclub shooter checked his Facebook account during the massacre to ensure he was going viral (he was). And why jihadists post violent beheadings online to ensure we all look before we look away.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Protester: White supremacist pointed gun at me Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Protester: White supremacist pointed gun at me 01:12\u000a\u000aWe have just watched the latest performance and, as planned, it was a horrific show.\u000a\u000aOur collective, unavoidable, justifiable outrage fuels the fire of right-wing extremism. Twitter campaigns to "out" Unite the Right rally attendees and get them fired feels productive, cathartic even, but it also reinforces the rhetoric\u000a\u000aRight-wing extremists who speak to the mainstream media seem almost giddy by our collective response to Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aWe, the audience, have as much of a role in this process, in this violence, as the "performers" themselves. Our President has chosen to reinforce the rhetoric when he goes off script. The onus is on us to break the cycle.\u000a\u000aThese days, we are more at risk from attacks by right-wing extremists in this country than by radical Islamic terrorists. We devote millions of dollars and entire departments to identifying, tracking, and preventing the recruitment of home-grown jihadists. Twitter accounts are removed and websites are taken down. Communities are mobilized to recognize radicalization warning signs and taught prevention strategies. Now we must devote the same resources and strategies to combating right-wing extremism.\u000a\u000aWe need to do more to recognize the racist history of the United States that persists today. But we don't have to hunt down right-wing extremism to find it. From discriminatory hiring practices to mass incarceration to school policies that disproportionally impact children of color, there is racism built into many of our institutions and policies.\u000a\u000aSo, let's take our outrage offline and stop feeding the beast. Let's examine our own biases. Have coffee with our neighbor or family member whose views or experience differs from ours. Let's make sure our children are in diverse, compassionate environments. Stand up for kids who don't get stood up for. Challenge the employment policies at our own offices. Examine our local laws. Run for office.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aLet's stop being the audience the extremists want. If we walk out of the show, the extremists might be forced to close the curtain.

aVMichael D'Antonio is the author of the book " Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success " (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In the 1976 TV movie "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble," the main character, played by John Travolta, is a kid who lacks an immune system to protect him from infection. He suffers from the isolation of life inside a sealed environment. Based on a true story, the tragic elements of the tale were heightened by the fact that all he knew of the outside world came to him via television.\u000a\u000aFor much of his life, Donald Trump has suffered from his own form of isolation, protected from the challenges of life as most people know it, in a bubble of his own. It was one of private schools and great wealth, and a lavish gilded lifestyle with armed guards who kept the world at bay. Of course all that was valuable could be had inside the Trump empire.\u000a\u000aIn the Trump calculus, this close circle only makes sense: As Donald Trump Jr. told me, the family believes in the "race horse theory" of human development, which holds that they are superior to others by virtue of genetics.\u000a\u000aThus endowed, our President has had little reason to study issues or the world at large. He was, at birth, better than those whose ideas or backgrounds caused him any discomfort. Why bother to know any more? Now that he is President, the answer to this is obvious. He leads a vast and diverse country challenged by the most complex problems imaginable. But if his long history of detachment from the lived reality of America is an indication, none of this is obvious to him.\u000a\u000aThe President's biography -- which is a story of utter isolation from those who walk the sidewalks, drive their own cars, and wash their own dishes -- helps explain the astounding worldview laid before us in his bizarre response to the racist rallies in Charlottesville last weekend, one he continues to punctuate with inflammatory Tweets on the incident.\u000a\u000aThe protests culminated in a deadly vehicular attack on anti-hate demonstrators. Heather Heyer died, many more were injured. But in the aftermath, Trump seemed guided not by empathy for the victims or the needs of the nation, but by his desire to maintain connection with the extreme elements of his base.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Two GOP senators speak out against Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Two GOP senators speak out against Trump 01:35\u000a\u000aAfter two false starts, on Saturday and Monday, a President who believes he is never wrong threw aside the advice he had been given and, in a combative appearance before reporters, blamed almost everyone involved, excusing hate groups and those in his base who are partial to them. "But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides," Trump added.\u000a\u000aHe appeared to parrot a line from Fox News, one of the few cable news stations permitted in his bubble, as he complained about efforts to remove Confederate statues. "I wonder, is it George Washington next week?" he said. "And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"\u000a\u000aAs Buzzfeed noted , Fox host Martha MacCallum had raised a strikingly similar point the night before. "You could make an argument for Thomas Jefferson or George Washington," she said. "Are you going to change the name of the Washington Monument?"\u000a\u000aAs the relationship between the comment on Fox and the President's words suggests, Trump tries to limit what enters his echo chamber to praise and affirmation. He assumed this practice as a young businessman, when he began each day with a stack of positive press clippings, gathered by his assistants, who had circled his name.\u000a\u000aAs he told me, he has never been a reader of books, and his favorite method for gathering information involves quizzing the people whom he might see in a day. For much of his life, nearly all of these folks have depended on him for a paycheck or business deals, so you can imagine the kind of feedback he has received.\u000a\u000aIn the White House, Trump has held onto his avid TV watching habits, gleaning talking points from the same outlets who backed him as a candidate -- and sometimes repeating them , via Twitter, almost instantaneously.\u000a\u000aBut long before Fox News was around to supply his prompts, Trump was surrounding himself with familiar and agreeable faces who validated his perspective -- including on issues of race, which would rear up in Trump's response to Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED GOP rep tweets Trump a reminder Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH GOP rep tweets Trump a reminder 01:26\u000a\u000aIndeed Trump's suggestion that some who marched to Nazi and anti-Semitic chants -- "blood and soil!" and "Jews will not replace us!" -- could also be "fine people" was consistent with the kind of racial insensitivity he first expressed at a young age.\u000a\u000aIn his debut as a public figure, Trump announced he would fight federal fair housing laws, which, from his entitled perch, he resented as "reverse discrimination." His lawyer, Roy Cohn , likened the Justice Department to a bunch of Nazi thugs. A Jew who expressed both anti-Semitic and racist ideas, Cohn lived inside Trump's bubble, becoming his political mentor. Cohn's currency was gossip and threats. He relished his reputation as a shadowy figure who represented mob figures and always seemed to be just one step ahead of the law himself.\u000a\u000aUpon Cohn's death, this duty of offering political advice to Trump was assumed by a similarly notorious character named Roger Stone , who has had Trump's ear since the 1980s. Stone's rules, which he freely explains to anyone who asks, begin with "attack, attack, attack -- never defend." And "admit nothing, deny everything, launch counterattack."\u000a\u000aThe Stone method was a fit for Trump, who has always preferred pugnacity to nuance -- prosecuted, of course, from within a protective cordon of lawyers. Stone was an adviser when Trump complained in the 80s (from his view above Trump Tower, overlooking Central Park) that young black men are specially advantaged due to affirmative action. He was there, too, when Trump paid for full page advertisements in four New York papers demanding -- long before any trials -- that five teenagers arrested in the famous Central Park jogger assault be given the death penalty.\u000a\u000aWhen DNA evidence cleared the accused and they were released after serving years in prison, an echo of Roger Stone's modus operandi could be heard in Trump's complaint about the millions in compensation they received from New York City. "The police doing the original investigation said they were guilty," said Trump. "The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous."\u000a\u000aMore outrageous, of course, was Trump's perverse "birther" crusade, which found him questioning the legitimacy of America's first black president by suggesting he was foreign-born and thus ineligible for the office he held. Long after others abandoned this notion, Trump remained impervious to the racial animus it encouraged.\u000a\u000aAs it is with ideas in his bubble, so it is with human contacts. In his business life, Trump hired with an eye to loyalty first and experience second. Those who challenged him were soon dismissed; those who joined the amen chorus thrived.\u000a\u000aTrump has had only two executive assistants for his entire business career, and when he went to Washington he brought with him a security man he has employed for decades. Noticed by Trump when he was a guard at a tennis match in 1981, Matthew Calamari has been with Trump ever since and is now chief operating office for his business organization.\u000a\u000aCan you imagine that any of these denizens of the Trump Bubble have made it a habit to counter his assumptions?\u000a\u000aAs President, Trump has rarely traveled outside of the states he considers part of his political base, ignoring his responsibility to hear and serve all Americans. His need for the comforting cocoon seems to be greater in moments of stress.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aAnd despite Trump's much reported penchant for telephone chats, there are few he gets on the line with; friends like Tom Barrack and Chris Ruddy get much attention. Senators who might be useful new allies, but not necessarily yes-men and -women? Not so much.\u000a\u000aOthers who have occupied the White House have complained of the bubble it creates around them. Trump (who is, incidentally, a self-described germaphobe ) seems to enjoy it.\u000a\u000aBut this isolation is a big problem. As President, Trump continues to play with the fire of bigotry, as he always has. The Bubble allows him to do this with little apparent regard for how it affects the lives of the people he now governs.\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of Charlotteseville, the President has shown he would rather frighten his fellow Americans -- possibly, as his now ex-chief strategist Steve Bannon has said, for political advantage -- and degrade the nation's standing in the world than admit he is mistaken and serve the country he has sworn to lead.\u000a\u000aHe seems oblivious to the pain felt by others, as if he has spent so much time away from or ignoring those with different points of view that he is no longer aware that they exist.

aVBritish unemployment is the lowest it has been in 42 years -- but many workers won't be celebrating.\u000a\u000aUnemployment fell slightly to 4.4% in the three months to June, according to official data published Wednesday. The jobless rate hasn't been that low since 1975. And the number of people in work is at a record high.\u000a\u000aGreat news, right? Not so fast. Here's why some economists are sounding the alarm:\u000a\u000aReal wages are still falling\u000a\u000aThe very low rate of unemployment rate is not translating into higher pay. Prices are still rising much faster than wages, meaning people's finances are being squeezed.\u000a\u000aThe latest data show wages grew 2.1% year on year in the three months to June. Inflation was 2.6%. That means real incomes are down 0.5% compared to the same time last year.\u000a\u000a"The continued fall in real earnings will put further pressure on households and risks upsetting the resilience of the U.K. economy," said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG U.K.\u000a\u000aHiring rather than investing\u000a\u000aOn its own, Britain's record high employment paints a rosy picture of the U.K. economy.\u000a\u000aBut given the sharp slowdown in growth, the robust jobs market may prove to be a mirage.\u000a\u000aWorried about the uncertain outcome of the Brexit negotiations, companies are hiring more people, rather than spending on new technology and equipment.\u000a\u000aRelated: Brexit jobs tracker\u000a\u000a"Business investment is expensive so if they can get away with meeting extra work through more labor rather than splash out on investment in uncertain economic and political times, this could be a factor," said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.\u000a\u000aWorkers are becoming less productive\u000a\u000aThat lack of investment could exacerbate an existing problem. British workers are becoming less efficient -- they lag way behind their counterparts in France, Germany and other developed economies.\u000a\u000aU.K. productivity fell for the second quarter in a row, official data showed. That means companies need to hire more people just to stand still, leaving less room for them to pay more.\u000a\u000aRelated: Brexit Britain has too many jobs and not enough workers\u000a\u000a"Productivity has been falling throughout 2017 -- this matters as rising productivity is the only sustainable route to higher wages and better living standards," said Matthew Percival, head of employment at the Confederation of British Industry, which represents 190,000 businesses.\u000a\u000aFirms fear a Brexit brain drain\u000a\u000aBrexit could have another nasty side effect.\u000a\u000aThe uncertainty surrounding the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. is making the country less attractive to foreign workers.\u000a\u000a"The fall in net migration since the EU referendum has already put some pressure on the labor market as it heats up and this will intensify as the U.K. leaves the EU," Selfin said.\u000a\u000aRelated: Americans are going to find it much harder to get a job in Britain\u000a\u000aRoughly 2.4 million EU-born workers are employed in the U.K. They play a vital role across the economy, from farming and construction to healthcare, financial services and technology.\u000a\u000aIndustry organizations have urged the government to ensure employers will be able to keep hiring EU workers after Brexit.\u000a\u000aA report by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation showed the number of open permanent jobs grew at the fastest rate in 27 months in July, while the availability of both permanent and temporary workers fell sharply.\u000a\u000aMorgan McKinley, a financial services recruitment company, said last week that its data on the number of job seekers show the industry is "haemorrhaging talent because of Brexit."

aVJames Fallows is no doctor, but his prognosis on America is rosy.\u000a\u000a"The country as a whole, fundamentally, is in better shape than most other countries," Fallows told Brian Stelter in this week's Reliable Sources podcast.\u000a\u000aFallows, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, knows from first-hand experience. He has spent the past four years piloting his propeller airplane with his wife and traveling to more than two dozen cities in the United States. They are now working on a book chronicling their adventures, to be published next year.\u000a\u000a"The gimmick is that we are going to places that have smaller airports, but no other forms of connection." Their travels took them to Sioux Falls, to Central Oregon, to Fresno, and to Fallows' own hometown of Redlands, California.\u000a\u000aFallows told Stelter that by traveling across America, he learned that notwithstanding known issues such as the opioid epidemic and growing economic dislocation, "people in most parts of the country feel as if they are moving forward, rather than backwards."\u000a\u000a"America is a basically functioning country with a non-functioning national political system," Fallows said.\u000a\u000aThe toxicity of American national politics concerns Fallows. With the two parties presenting two dramatically opposed worldviews, even asking people about their preference between Clinton and Trump can spark "irreconcilable religious feuds."\u000a\u000aListen to the whole podcast here:\u000a\u000aThat conflict was on full display during President Trump's latest rally in Phoenix, Arizona, where he doubled down on his attacks against the press by calling journalists "sick," "bad people," unpatriotic people who wish for America to fail.\u000a\u000a"No president has said things like that in public before," said Fallows. Even President Nixon, who was not a fan of journalists, "paid some lip service to the idea that there was a civic function in criticism from the press" back in his day, Fallows observed.\u000a\u000aThe rally was the inspiration behind Fallows' Wednesday column. In it, he called out the GOP for "looking the other way as [Trump] debases his office and divides his country."\u000a\u000aThe "nakedness" of Trump's attack on the press is worrisome to Fallows. He believes that Trump has failed to understand that "an American president, every second of the day, with everything he says, is representing the weight of the office."\u000a\u000aFallows thinks that concern alone is reason enough to question Trump's fitness for office without having to assess his mental health, something that only trained medical professionals can do.\u000a\u000a"It doesn't matter if we give a specific medical name to whatever it is that Donald Trump is doing," Fallows told Stelter. "Just the fact that he does things that we don't think of as normal, sober practices, for somebody who is the most powerful person on Earth" raises questions about his ability to lead the country.\u000a\u000aIf America has "a real challenge" to its national system right now "in the form of Donald Trump," Fallows is hopeful about the resilience of the "American organism" as a whole, since the judicial system and the press are still upholding their standards.\u000a\u000aStelter and Fallows tapped into this and many more topics, including a discussion on the best craft beers in the United States.

aVStory highlights A study estimates that millions have been exposed to high levels of arsenic in their water supply\u000a\u000aRegularly drinking contaminated water can have serious health consequences\u000a\u000a(CNN) Up to 60 million people living in Pakistan's Indus Plain are at risk of being affected by high levels of arsenic in the region's groundwater supply, according to a new study in the journal Science Advances.\u000a\u000aAn international team of scientists created a "hazard map" of locations at risk using water samples collected from almost 1,200 sites across the country, the majority of them from hand and motor pumps.\u000a\u000aUsing statistical modeling, the team also assessed environmental factors that may affect the movement of arsenic and calculated the size of populations at risk of exposure. They concluded that there was widespread arsenic contamination in the Indus Plain, from where 50 million to 60 million people get their groundwater.\u000a\u000a"This alarmingly high number of people likely affected demonstrates an urgent need to test all drinking water wells in the Indus Plain," the team said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe researchers have urged authorities to treat affected wells accordingly. Arsenic does not have a smell or a taste, and there are no short-term symptoms after consuming it. However, drinking contaminated water regularly could lead to serious illnesses including lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases, the team said.\u000a\u000aRead More

The disparity of wealth between the richest and the poorest is, in my opinion, the most concerning issue. This problem is what I'm trying to highlight in my photograph. These two figures, although in my eyes represent that of my motherly figures, in the eyes of the country (they) take on two very different roles and narratives. Although a similar age to my mother, my domestic worker was previously marginalized by the government, leaving her with no access to education and a low standard of living while my mother had access to a high standard of education and grew up in a quiet suburb.

aV(CNN) Todd Vance was serving in the US Army when the September 11 attacks occurred.\u000a\u000a"I decided to re-enlist for another three years," he said. "And I asked to be part of the first deployed unit to Iraq."\u000a\u000aVance served as a squad leader and ran more than 250 combat missions before returning to San Diego in 2005.\u000a\u000a"At first, it was all elation. I was just happy to be alive and happy to be out of the military," he said. "Slowly but surely, reality was setting in about what I had seen and what I had done."\u000a\u000aFacing his own battle\u000a\u000aAbout six months after returning home, Vance began encountering his own personal issues.\u000a\u000aTodd Vance joined the Army his junior year of high school and served as a squad leader in Iraq.\u000a\u000a"I turned into a recluse. I was drinking too much. Basically anything that would either produce an extreme adrenaline rush or numb my adrenaline rush and the hypervigilance and anxiety I was having," he said.\u000a\u000aVance went to the Veterans Affairs center for counseling. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and sent home with a shopping bag of medications, including mood enhancers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety meds.\u000a\u000aAlong with drinking, he started abusing the prescriptions he had been given.\u000a\u000a"I'm glad my family ended up telling me I needed to seek professional help," Vance said.\u000a\u000aHe went to therapy and decided to go back to school. But it wasn't until he got involved with mixed martial arts that his life began to change.\u000a\u000a"Martial arts 100% saved my life," he said.\u000a\u000aFighting for veterans at home\u000a\u000aVance, who had been a professional Muay Thai fighter in high school, started training at the local MMA gym.\u000a\u000a"It gave me the structure, the discipline, the camaraderie, the routine that I needed to have in my life that I was missing so much from the military," he said. "Before training, I had no reason not to drink until 3 in the morning. I was training six days a week, often two times a day, and eating clean."\u000a\u000aVance, bottom right, re-enlisted in the Army after the attacks on 9/11.\u000a\u000aVance finished community college and enrolled at Point Loma Nazarene University, where he earned a degree in social work.\u000a\u000a"I realized I had a passion for working with and for military veterans," he said.\u000a\u000aHe decided to pay it forward and start an organization that uses mixed martial arts to help veterans overcome PTSD and other challenges adapting back to civilian life.\u000a\u000a"If a veteran is happy and content with their daily life, they may or may not be drawn to a program like this. But somebody who is facing anxiety and post-traumatic stress and all those different issues, they'll probably be here," he said.\u000a\u000a'Focused on technique and fitness'\u000a\u000aThe program started off as a veteran competition team and became a nonprofit in 2012. Vance called it P.O.W. , short for Pugilistic Offensive Warrior Tactics.\u000a\u000a"It plays on (the term) prisoner of war because when you come home from combat, you're a prisoner of your own personal war," he said.\u000a\u000aIt may seem counterintuitive that a "violent" sport like MMA is helping people cope from the violence of war. Vance disagrees.\u000a\u000a"Martial arts is focused on technique and fitness. ... We have served more than 275 veterans, and all the success stories we have is a testament to the effectiveness of the program," he said. "We see people get right out of the military, they're young, they're a mess, they don't have any employment or social skills. Two or three years later, they are working on their master's degree."\u000a\u000aThe program offers free mixed martial arts classes for veterans three times a week at the Undisputed Downtown gym in San Diego. But it's also group therapy disguised as MMA.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We offer peer-to-peer coaching, support and counseling," he said. "We're doing a lot of exposure and vulnerability sharing to where they can start to feel normal around a group of people."\u000a\u000aMMA helps veterans stay calm, think critically in stressful situations and move on, Vance said.\u000a\u000a"It helps people that have anxiety and depression and who are dealing with trauma to be present in the moment," he said.\u000a\u000aAt the end of each class, he also incorporates yoga to help the veterans clear their mind and leave with a clean slate.\u000a\u000aVance recently conducted a study of 30 participants over a one-year period. The results showed a 90% improvement in physical health; 80% improvement in coping with stress and symptoms of PTSD; and a 100% improvement in reducing the feelings of isolation.\u000a\u000a'They want to help you do better'\u000a\u000aJoshua Tanida, who takes the martial arts classes, served as an engineer in the US Navy for four years. About six months before he was discharged, he began suffering from depression, low self-esteem and low self-worth.\u000a\u000a"I started losing a lot of drive to do anything," he said. "I just felt distant from everyone. Like nothing really mattered."\u000a\u000aTanida went to the VA for counseling in 2014 and joined the program a year later.\u000a\u000a"They help build you up as a person and build your self-esteem," he said. "They know how you feel firsthand, and they want to help you do better. ... I'm a whole different person than I used to be."\u000a\u000aVance said it's the best feeling to know that he's helping others.\u000a\u000a"It's so therapeutic for me to be able to revisit things that bothered me in the past and to help a younger veteran process that stuff and to get them on track."

aV(CNN) Probiotic supplements may be a growing trend among health-conscious consumers, but the tiny bacteria that have been stuffed into capsules and stacked on pharmacy shelves coexisted with us before we were even aware of them.\u000a\u000aThese live microorganisms are akin to the valuable microorganisms already residing in our bodies, a vast ecosystem of microbial species, including bacteria and yeast.\u000a\u000aNow that products containing probiotics are sold as yogurt, drinks and dietary supplements, there seems to be some confusion around how to define probiotics and how beneficial they really are.\u000a\u000a"It's taken a while for the scientific community to actually form a consensus of what we mean when we say probiotics, because people might mean different things," said Lynne McFarland, an associate professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle.\u000a\u000aShe wrote a paper on the history, development and current use of probiotics, which was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2015.\u000a\u000a"The most recent recommendation and consensus is that they have to be alive. They can be a bacteria or a yeast. They have to be used in an adequate dose, and they have to have some proven beneficial health effect," McFarland said of probiotics.\u000a\u000a"Probiotics have been around for a long time," she said. "It took a while for science to catch up with what's going on."\u000a\u000aHow has our understanding of probiotics changed over time? Here's a look at probiotics' steady rise in popularity, from Europe to America, and where health experts now stand on their benefits.\u000a\u000aPrehistory: Storing sushi in the early days of fermentation\u000a\u000aAbout the time our hunter-gatherer ancestors took up farming , 11,000 years ago, they started to consume probiotics without even realizing it, said Dr. Cate Shanahan, a Newtown, Connecticut-based family physician who also consults as a nutritionist with the Los Angeles Lakers.\u000a\u000aAs farmers settled into communities, they developed the habit of storing more of their food. "With anything that you store, microbes are just going to start growing in it," Shanahan said. This sometimes resulted in the fermentation of foods.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Fermentation: A new food trend Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Fermentation: A new food trend 01:20\u000a\u000aFermentation , when microorganisms grow on and break down food, can make that food item rich with probiotics. The process also may increase the shelf life of a food and make some foods more digestible, Shanahan said.\u000a\u000aFor instance, in Asia, sushi was originally a fermented food, Shanahan said.\u000a\u000a"They had so much fish that they'd catch all at once. ... So they would store it, and they discovered that packing it in rice would help store the fish so that it would basically rot, but in a way that wasn't disgusting and more controlled," she said. "We now know it was because there was special bacteria, called Bacillus bacteria , in the rice that was helping out."\u000a\u000aIn other words, the bacteria in the rice helped store the fish.\u000a\u000atheir beverages through complex brewing methods. Around the same time, many other examples of fermentation were emerging in other parts of the world. Some research suggests that ancient Egyptians fermented\u000a\u000a"They have the hieroglyphics of the pharaoh being served something in a bowl, and people who have translated those have gone, 'OK, this is sort of a fermented milk product,' " McFarland said.\u000a\u000aAs agriculture expanded, so did our relationship with probiotics.\u000a\u000a13th century: Did Marco Polo drink kefir?\u000a\u000aMarco Polo, the Venetian merchant traveler who ventured across Asia, was known to speak of probiotic-rich fermented beverages such as kefir in his travels.\u000a\u000aIt is believed that when nomadic shepherds and travelers journeyed with raw milk carried in leather , the milk would accidentally ferment over time.\u000a\u000aSome studies suggest that this process led to the creation of kefir , a fermented milk drink that originated in the Caucasus Mountains\u000a\u000aIt's believed that the word kefir derives from the Turkish word keyif, meaning "pleasure" or "feeling good" after its ingestion. The beneficial health properties of kefir and other dairy products were a part of folklore until the idea of probiotics arose.\u000a\u000a19th-20th centuries: The 'father of probiotics'\u000a\u000aIn the late 1800s, French biologist Louis Pasteur identified the bacteria and yeasts responsible for the process of fermentation, but it was Russian biologist Elie Metchnikoff who linked those microorganisms to health outcomes.\u000a\u000aMetchnikoff had long theorized that the microorganisms in our guts could have beneficial or adverse effects on our health.\u000a\u000aIn 1905, Metchnikoff studied how many residents of poor communities in Eastern Europe were centenarians, living to be 100 or older. He associated their longevity with the type of bacteria used to ferment the yogurt they would eat, and he became known as the " father of probiotics ."\u000a\u000a"He's the first one who published a book looking at Bulgarians and saying, 'Gosh, they live longer,' and it wasn't due to their diet. It wasn't due to the yogurt that they consumed but actually the bacteria that was used to ferment the yogurt," McFarland said. "That clever Russian. ... He's the one who kind of went, 'You know, bacteria aren't all bad.' "\u000a\u000aMany other scientists followed Metchnikoff's research efforts into the bizarre micro-world of bacteria, including Henry Tissier, a French pediatrician who discovered "good" bacteria called Bifidobacterium in the guts of infants. He proposed that the bacteria could be used to treat patients with diarrhea.\u000a\u000aHowever, the concept of probiotics quietly drifted to the background of medical focus until it re-emerged in the mid-1950s in Europe.\u000a\u000a"They were always more popular in Scandinavia and Europe," McFarland said.\u000a\u000a1950s-1980s: Making a name for probiotics in Europe\u000a\u000aIn 1953, German bacteriologist Werner Kollath first used "probiotic" to describe various supplements believed to restore the health of malnourished patients. The term was derived from Latin and Greek, meaning "for life."\u000a\u000aIn the next year, German scientist Ferdinand Vergin used the term to describe " active substances " beneficial for health.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Are we overusing antibiotics? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Are we overusing antibiotics? 02:31\u000a\u000aThen, in 1965, a paper in the journal Science used the term probiotics to describe substances produced by one microorganism that stimulate the growth of another.\u000a\u000aIn 1974, a paper published in the journal Animal Nutrition Health used the term probiotics in the context in which we use it today, to "contribute to intestinal microbial balance."\u000a\u000aThen, in 1989, Roy Fuller, a researcher of gut microbial ecology, redefined probiotics as "a live microbial feed supplement , which beneficially affects the host animal."\u000a\u000aIn the United States, however, there was less attention on probiotics and more attention on antibiotics.\u000a\u000a"Antibiotics were seen as only beneficial. In the '70s, actually, doctors would just treat people with anything with a shot, like they didn't have any clue about resistance or any clue about side effects," Shanahan said.\u000a\u000a"About the late '80s, early '90s, we started to understand antibiotics had a downside," she said, such as leading to antibiotic resistance and killing off beneficial bacteria. Meanwhile, Americans started to understand probiotics.\u000a\u000a1990s: Probiotic popularity spreads across US\u000a\u000a"I started doing this research back in the 1990s, and it was very infrequent that somebody in the US would know what we were talking about when we would talk about probiotics," McFarland said.\u000a\u000a"It really wasn't until 1994, when the dietary health and supplement law was enacted, that allowed these kinds of products to be sold over the counter," she said. "Suddenly ... people became very aware of what it is. It's truly amazing how quickly the popularity of this spread."\u000a\u000aIn 1994, the US Food and Drug Administration implemented the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which allowed dietary supplements to be regulated under a different set of rules than prescription drugs, foods and beverages.\u000a\u000a"What changed is that before that law became enacted, probiotics were considered an investigational drug. So it was going through the FDA process, and we had to go through ... very long and expensive drug pathway development through the FDA," McFarland said.\u000a\u000a"Then, when the dietary supplement law got enacted ... it opened a floodgate of quote-unquote probiotic products that weren't really probiotic, and the quality of the products were not as regulated as they should have been, having not gone through the ordinary FDA process," she said. "I think that's still the situation today."\u000a\u000a2000s: Health officials crack down on probiotics\u000a\u000aIn 2002, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization drafted guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics in food in a joint consultation (PDF).\u000a\u000aThe guidelines recommended that the definition of probiotics be "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host."\u000a\u000aemerged, McFarland said. Around this time, various ways to administer probiotics and prebiotics, which promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut,emerged, McFarland said.\u000a\u000a"There's now probiotics that come in chocolate; probiotics come in cheese; there's bread. Little sprinkles you can put on ice cream," she said.\u000a\u000aNext, scientists started to research how probiotics may benefit your health, specifically your gut.\u000a\u000a2010: A spotlight on the gut\u000a\u000aStudies suggest that some probiotics might help with symptoms of certain chronic gastrointestinal tract conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome. However, such benefits have not been conclusively demonstrated, and not all probiotics have the same effects, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health\u000a\u000aIn 2010, a systematic review paper in the journal Gut found that probiotics were helpful in treating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, compared with a placebo or no treatment. Yet the magnitude of benefit and most effective species of probiotic remained uncertain.\u000a\u000aFor the paper, 18 randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of probiotics as an irritable bowel syndrome treatment were analyzed. The trials, published between 1950 and 2008, involved 1,650 patients total.\u000a\u000a"This systematic review indicates that probiotics have a therapeutic benefit in improving IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) symptoms," the researchers wrote. "Future studies need to establish which species, strain and dose of probiotics are most efficacious in IBS."\u000a\u000a2010s: His and hers probiotics emerge\u000a\u000aAmong American adults, probiotics ranked as the third most commonly used dietary supplement behind fish oil, and glucosamine and chondroitin, according to a 2015 National Health Statistics Report\u000a\u000aAdditionally, "there's been a big thing on 'this is a women's probiotic' or 'this is a men's probiotic.' There has been a big thing on gender probiotics," McFarland said of one emerging trend.\u000a\u000aHowever, she added that there is no difference between a male or female microbiome, and therefore, there should be no difference in how a probiotic would benefit a man or a woman -- that is, outside of vaginal health.\u000a\u000a"The only difference is that there are some probiotic strains that are good for vaginitis, so if they're trying to say 'restores vaginal health,' then that might be OK as a woman's product," McFarland said.\u000a\u000a"The thing to remember is that your vagina is a very acidic environment, and it's colonized with lactobacillus," she said. "There's only a couple strains that have been shown to be really good -- Lactobacillus reuteri and rhamnosus -- and others have been tried but haven't really been that effective."\u000a\u000aAll in all, McFarland said, probiotics may be beneficial if taken to prevent travel-associated diarrhea or to prevent side effects of antibiotics. For any other purposes, however, she recommended consulting with your doctor or checking scientific literature for guidance.\u000a\u000a"What we're finding is that a person has their own profile of their microbiome. If that's disrupted, and even if you take probiotics, after you stop taking probiotics, it goes back to what your profile was before," McFarland said.\u000a\u000a"So, it's like it remembers who's invited to the party, and it only invites those people," she said. "I think it's still an exciting field for research because, the more we appreciate how much bacteria do for us, the more we appreciate what happens when it gets disrupted."\u000a\u000aShanahan recommends going old-school.\u000a\u000a"From my perspective, the more logical thing to do is to eat foods that are good for us and that bacteria can utilize as well," Shanahan said.\u000a\u000a"I get foods rich in prebiotics and ready-to-eat fermented foods. I'll eat yogurt or kimchi, and for prebiotics to feed the probiotics, I make sure I always get some kind of fiber-y thing, whether it's nuts or vegetables or beans," she said. "But the probiotic-rich foods, which are the fermented and cultured foods, are more likely to be beneficial than supplements."\u000a\u000a2017: A sign that probiotics could prevent sepsis\u000a\u000aA combination of the right probiotics with a prebiotic were found to be effective in preventing sepsis in babies in rural India in a large randomized, controlled trial, the results of which were published in the journal Nature in August.\u000a\u000aThe first-of-its-kind study suggests that taking a capsule of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum plus the prebiotic fructooligosaccharide is associated with a significant 40% reduction in an infant's risk of neonatal sepsis and subsequent death.\u000a\u000aAbout 1 million neonatal deaths each year are related to neonatal sepsis , a blood infection that can occur in an infant younger than 90 days.\u000a\u000aBabies with signs of sepsis are typically treated with antibiotics, administered intravenously. However, the new study explored preventing infections to begin with using orally administered probiotics combined with a prebiotic, called a synbiotic.\u000a\u000aThe study involved 4,556 infants with no signs of sepsis in Odisha, India, where neonatal and infant mortality rates are among the highest in India, the researchers noted in the study.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe researchers monitored the health of the infants for their first 60 days of life while half of the infants were given the synbiotic and the others were given a placebo. Those in the synbiotic group were given the synbiotic orally for seven days, beginning between their second to fourth day of life.\u000a\u000aAmong the infants, the researchers observed a reduction in neonatal sepsis between the groups: Nine percent in the placebo group developed sepsis, compared with 5.4% in the synbiotic group.\u000a\u000a"These findings suggest that a large proportion of neonatal sepsis in developing countries could be effectively prevented using a synbiotic containing L. plantarum," the researchers wrote in the study.

aVMumbai, India (CNN) Hidden in the back alleys of a bustling Mumbai neighborhood lies an Art Deco masterpiece with a colorful history.\u000a\u000aThe Liberty Cinema symbolizes a unique architectural amalgamation known as "Bombay Deco." Dating back to the year of Indian independence, 1947, the building also represents the rising aspirations of a nation.\u000a\u000a"It's a statement to the Indian people that no theater can be too good for them and no screen too good for Indian pictures," reads a Liberty brochure from 1949, a time when most elite cinemas in Bombay only showed Hollywood movies.\u000a\u000aThe 1,200-seat, single-screen movie theater was one of the last buildings to be constructed in the Art Deco architectural style. Mumbai is widely believed to have the second largest collection of Art Deco buildings in the world\u000a\u000aBut the city's Art Deco heritage is under threat, according to Atul Kumar, founder of the not-for-profit conservation organization Art Deco Mumbai.\u000a\u000a"In the face of rising real estate prices, the Art Deco legacy of Mumbai is at a real risk of being lost forever," he said in a phone interview.\u000a\u000aA cosmopolitan collection\u000a\u000aThe origins of Art Deco in Mumbai (which was officially known as Bombay before 1995) can be traced back to the period between the two world wars.\u000a\u000aDuring an era of relative prosperity and cosmopolitanism in India, a rising middle class found that it had the means to commission its own architecture.\u000a\u000aTaking influence from Paris, Miami, New York and Los Angeles, Bombay Deco put an Indian twist on a well-known style. And it was all made possible by new construction materials, according to Mustansir Dalvi, professor of architecture at the Sir JJ School of Art.\u000a\u000aBack of the Oval\u000a\u000a"You get an expression that is possible only with concrete," he said in a phone interview. "Wood horizontals, flat roofs, cantilevered balconies, smooth corners -- it is the materials that allows you to develop architecture that is quite unique."\u000a\u000aMost Bombay Deco architects were Indian, though they had often traveled to Europe and America. While many of their buildings were created in a classic Art Deco style, some incorporated traditional Indian motifs that made them distinct.\u000a\u000a"The Lakshmi Insurance Building is emblematic of Indian-ness in Art Deco," Dalvi said. "It has a statue of (Indian goddess) Lakshmi on top, and elephants on the facade. You also see murals showing Indian life, (while) depictions of labor can be seen in several places in Mumbai."\u000a\u000aConservation efforts\u000a\u000aIn Mumbai, conservation efforts often overlook Bombay Deco in favor of Victorian-era buildings, which are usually larger and grander in stature.\u000a\u000a"People are filled with regret when we tell them of the incredible histories behind these buildings," said Kumar, whose organization offers architectural walking tours. "They wish they'd known of the buildings' value earlier, so they could have better protected them."\u000a\u000aLotus Court\u000a\u000aHaving been involved in conservation advocacy for over a decade, Kumar contributed to a recently approved proposal to include Bombay Deco among India's nominations for UNESCO world heritage status. Kumar has also launched an online inventory that he claims is the first attempt to comprehensively catalog the city's Art Deco buildings.\u000a\u000aIn one Mumbai neighborhood, 53 examples were recorded in an area smaller than one square mile. And this is "just the tip of the iceberg," Kumar claimed.\u000a\u000a"There are even areas outside the proposed World Heritage Site that have a large number of vintage Art Deco buildings," he added.\u000a\u000aPreserving the city's essence\u000a\u000aMany of Mumbai's remaining Art Deco masterpieces have survived against the odds. Having become obsolete in the multiplex era, the Liberty Cinema was at the brink of shutting before extensive renovations were carried out in 2012.\u000a\u000aIt is now a cultural space hosting a range of events, from theater performances to one of South Asia's largest LGBT film festivals. But the future of the cinema remains uncertain, according its owner Nazir Hoosein.\u000a\u000a"In the eyes of the government, we might as well be an auditorium with bare walls," he said in a phone interview. "They don't see the magnificent heritage of this cinema."\u000a\u000aAmid lax conservation laws and growing demand for land in India's most populous city, conserving Mumbai's architectural heritage may seem like a futile enterprise. But for Bombay Deco enthusiasts like Dalvi, it is the only way to preserve the city's essence.\u000a\u000a"Art Deco is, in many ways, a depiction of cosmopolitan Bombay," he said.\u000a\u000a"These buildings collectively form the urban fabric of the city. Transforming them into multi-story towers would be a destruction of that fabric -- and a destruction of that Bombay."

aV(CNN) If anyone has suggested adding a little water to your whiskey, you may want to give it a try. Rather than watering it down, the addition may act as a flavor enhancement, and we now know the science behind it , thanks to a new study .\u000a\u000aThe combination is a bit counterintuitive, which is part of the reason researchers wanted to look at the molecular chemistry behind what's happening in your whiskey glass.\u000a\u000aOn the surface, whiskey seems simple: It's mostly grain and water that goes through a specific process. But from a chemistry standpoint, whiskey includes a complex variety of molecules that contribute to its unique taste. One of those is the compound guaiacol, which lends itself to the smokiness associated with some whiskeys.\u000a\u000aGuaiacol is the molecule that two researchers from the Linnaeus University Center for Biomaterials Chemistry in Sweden focused on for their study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.\u000a\u000aThe researchers looked at both bottled and cask-strength whiskey. Bottled whiskey has been diluted to about 40% alcohol by volume, down from 70% after distilling. Cask whiskey is stronger, at about 55% to 65% alcohol by volume, even if some alcohol evaporates as it matures in barrels for at least three years.\u000a\u000aWhat they discovered is that guaiacol is most present at the surface of diluted whiskey, which is why whiskey with added water tastes better: The taste molecules are at the top of your glass.\u000a\u000a"From a molecular perspective, water and alcohol don't completely mix," co-author Ran Friedman wrote in an email. "Instead, we have clusters of water molecules and clusters of alcohol molecules. When whisky is diluted, the alcohol is driven to the surface, and many of the taste molecules follow it because they like to be in a slightly less aqueous environment. The taste that we experience is therefore enhanced -- but there's a limit. If we dilute the whisky too much the concentration of the taste compounds is reduced and the drink will be meager."\u000a\u000aIn higher-alcohol whiskey, the flavor is different because the taste molecules aren't reacting to the presence of water.\u000a\u000a"The most interesting finding was that at high alcohol by volume concentrations -- 59% and up, cask-strength whisky -- the taste compound was surrounded by ethanol molecules in the solution," Friedman wrote.\u000a\u000aFriedman and colleague Bjorn Karlsson didn't discover this through taste, although both like whiskey, but by using computer simulations of the molecules.\u000a\u000a"They enable us to follow on chemical processes as if we're watching a molecular movie. We usually work on problems that have something to do with biology or human health, but at some point got interested in understanding why dilution affects the taste of whisky," Friedman said.\u000a\u000aThe researchers believe their findings can be applied to other aged spirits, like brandy, rum and tequila, because they have similar solutions, taste compounds and alcohol by volume.\u000a\u000aThough they didn't drink any whiskey during the study, the two researchers enjoy traditional Swedish snaps (what we might call schnapps), ice-cold and undiluted.\u000a\u000a"We believe that the principles we describe are true for a long list of taste compounds," Friedman said. "In that case, one can find an optimal alcohol content for a spirit to taste best for many drinkers. The conclusions may also apply for the food industry, as some extracts that are used in the industry are stored in diluted alcohol solutions."\u000a\u000aWhiskey expert: 'Feel the Kentucky hug'\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to whiskey and how best to enjoy it, it can be a very personal choice.\u000a\u000aAs a mixologist, Rod Weaver likes to offer a pour of bourbon or rye whiskey in two ways: neat and over ice.\u000a\u000a"This approach allows the drinker to compare the two; one room temp, and the other throughout the natural dilution as the ice melts over time," Weaver wrote in an email. "There will be considerable change as it 'opens up.' This can also happen with oxidation."\u000a\u000aBut as a whiskey lover, he recommends becoming acquainted with the type of whiskey "just the way the maker intended" before changing it in any way, whether it's "a 10-year plus, non-chill filtered, barrel-proof 'Haz-Mat' (over 140 proof) face-melting monster, or a 6-month-young local and grainy infant" whiskey.\u000a\u000aHe believes that Scots were most likely the first to dilute their whiskey in the glass, while blenders and distillers of whiskey decide how much to dilute their products individually.\u000a\u000a"But the best way to taste bourbon is hot, straight out the bottle," Weaver said. "Chew it around your mouth, swallow, and feel the Kentucky hug."\u000a\u000aLeNell Camacho Santa Ana, owner of LeNell's Beverage Boutique in Alabama, tells people to drink whiskey however they like it best. She isn't one to say there's a "proper" way to drink.\u000a\u000aShe used to sell her own brand of whiskey called Red Hook Rye, and included a formula for how to add water to reduce proof in the packaging of her barrels. The formula comes from Chuck Cowdery's book "Bourbon, Straight."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Divide the proof you have by the proof you want and subtract one," she wrote in an email. "Multiply that number by the amount of whiskey you want to dilute and the result will be the amount of water to add. For example, to reduce 2 ounces of 135 proof whiskey to 100 proof, divide 135 by 100 and subtract one. Multiply that number by 2 ounces. You add 0.7 ounces water to 2 ounces Red Hook Rye to make it 100 proof.\u000a\u000a"The only time I do highly recommend adding water is when drinking a cask-strength whiskey, a whiskey that has been bottled straight from the barrel to the bottle without addition of water," she said. "Those high proofs are fine for a sip to taste the power of the spirit; however, if you drink barrel-proof whiskeys, the strength could damage the lining of your esophagus, besides the fact you may end up with a nasty hangover."

aV(CNN) It could be one of the feel-good stories of Rio 2016 -- a tiny island nation triumphs on the world's biggest sporting stage to win its first Olympic medal.\u000a\u000aFiji is favorite to claim gold in the men's rugby sevens tournament, which starts Tuesday, having overcome financial problems and the loss of leading players to win back-to-back world titles.\u000a\u000aSuch a result would, according to Brett Gosper, the head of World Rugby, be "the fairytale result -- a story that transcends the sport."\u000a\u000aBut not everything is rosy with rugby in the Pacific Islands. Neither Samoa, a one-time powerhouse of the sevens format, nor Tonga have qualified teams for Rio.\u000a\u000aAnd the three rugby-proud nations are losing top talent to an increasing number of tier-one teams -- an age-old problem -- with many stories of players then being blocked from playing for their countries by their club employers.\u000a\u000aThe body representing the players has heard stories of players being left stranded without visas in their new countries, or else left with sizable tax bills, unaware of the contracts they had signed.\u000a\u000aThe great rugby rip-off?\u000a\u000aEnglish clubs sign many Samoan players such as Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu.\u000a\u000aEliota Fuimaono-Sapolu represented Samao on 23 occasions and had a lengthy professional career in England with Bath and Gloucester. Having returned to Samoa, he is increasingly concerned about the plight of Pacific Island players.\u000a\u000a"Everyone comes here to take players but they don't give back," he explains. "When they take players, they don't then get to play for their countries. It's take, take, take. Everyone is trying to rip everyone off.\u000a\u000a"You hear stories of dudes just stranded in France with no money to get home. It's hard because a lot of these boys have never left the island, so to grasp the concept of money and contracts is difficult. These are complex 30-page documents for guys that barely speak English, so people can rip them off and dump them."\u000a\u000aWorld Rugby rules stipulate the players at clubs across the globe must be released to play for their countries in the international window, but Fuimaono-Sapolu says he knows of a litany of instances where players have effectively been blocked from doing that by their clubs.\u000a\u000aPacific Island teams also suffer when players from countries such as Samoa or Fiji acquire dual citizenship and represent their adopted nations -- meaning they are no longer eligible for their homeland.\u000a\u000a"There are players that can't play for the country of their birth as they've played one minute for New Zealand Sevens," Fuimaono-Sapolu says.\u000a\u000a"These rules are contrary to simple UN human rights. I've seen contracts where locals only get a contract if they agree not to play for Samoa. We're just cannon fodder."\u000a\u000a'Regulation nine'\u000a\u000aWorld Rugby invested £26.8 million ($35 million) into the three unions in the four years leading up to the 2015 World Cup and held its first committee meeting of Bill Beaumont's current presidency in Fiji this year. In addition, the ruling body is looking at introducing a Fijian team in Australia's National Rugby Championship.\u000a\u000aWhile CEO Gosper admits there are "challenges," he is confident World Rugby is moving in the right direction in the region.\u000a\u000aSpeaking in Rio de Janeiro on the eve of sevens making its Olympic debut, he said: "You want to make sure you're optimizing that region as best you can, that your high-performance programs are as they should do, that you keep players in the country the best way you can and for as long as you can, and ensure that those players come back to play for their country.\u000a\u000a"We police that as strongly as you can, and some things happen that we can't control in ensuing that regulation nine (the rule that stipulates clubs must release players to represent their country) is respected. We're continuing to think about and invest in the region."\u000a\u000aMinimum wage\u000a\u000aSamoa won May's Paris Sevens title but lost in the final of the Olympic repechage qualifier.\u000a\u000aThe exodus of players has had a direct impact on Samoa's sevens program, in particular. Census figures show that nearly as many Samoans now live in New Zealand than on their home island.\u000a\u000aThe team's English coach Damian McGrath built up a squad of 16 players last season, but will be forced to start from scratch for the 2016-17 Sevens World Series.\u000a\u000a"We'll start the season with just three guys from last year's squad," he says, "and that's because the others have gone overseas and some not necessarily to play professional rugby.\u000a\u000a"Five of our players have moved to New Zealand just to work and play for local clubs. It's not about professional rugby for them, it's something that gives them a lifestyle."\u000a\u000aThe lure of moving abroad is obvious. In Fiji, the minimum wage is just FJD $2.32 ($1.12) per hour whereas in Australia and New Zealand the earning potential is infinitely higher.\u000a\u000a'Every man for himself'\u000a\u000aAkapusi Qera in action for Fiji at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\u000a\u000aThe club-versus-country row is arguably the biggest issue, though, facing the Pacific Islands.\u000a\u000aAkapusi Qera has twice turned down the opportunity to represent his country for the good of his club career -- the second time was at the expense of the Fijian captaincy.\u000a\u000a"I decided not to play for my country and that didn't go down well back at home," he says from his home in the south of France. "People talk crap about it but, at the end of the day, it's every man for himself.\u000a\u000a"You're so proud to play for your country and you have to take tough decisions along the way because of family. It's a very difficult decision, one of the most difficult decisions you will ever have to do."\u000a\u000aQera first withdrew from Fiji's northern hemisphere tour in November 2012 in order to focus on playing for Gloucester in what he described as "a series of important games coming up." He was captain for the 2015 World Cup but made himself unavailable for June's home internationals.\u000a\u000aPlayers will often have to pay their own way to fly back home to represent their countries, with no funds from the national unions. When coach Ben Ryan took over Fiji's sevens team in 2013, he was not paid for four months due to his employer's financial problems.\u000a\u000aRepresenting the players\u000a\u000aFormer NZ Sevens star Josh Blackie now works for the International Rugby Players' Association.\u000a\u000aQera's other gripe is that Pacific Island players get treated differently by clubs.\u000a\u000a"Take the England or France boys," he says. "When they come back from their Tests, they get days off but the island boys always go straight back in. There's never any time off. That's just bad for player welfare.\u000a\u000a"As professional rugby players, we deserve to be treated the same. These are the things World Rugby needs to hear. They need to know about the difficulties going on. I'm just grateful for Josh Blackie and his team for helping and now there are players' associations set up in the islands. That's a big plus moving forward. I hope this will change things."\u000a\u000aFormer NZ Sevens representative Blackie works for the International Rugby Players' Association (IRPA), which also incorporates the Pacific Islands Players' Association (PIPA).\u000a\u000aAccording to the IRPA calculations, 16% of all professional rugby players on the planet are of Pacific Island descent. His organization represents 350 players from the region, and in the past few months has put a player development officer in Fiji.\u000a\u000aFiji's sevens team trains during its Olympic selection camp.\u000a\u000a"It might be if a player hasn't sought independent advice or a club is exploiting a player for whatever reason, or they've been sold a good story," Blackie says. "For us, the key is to get the key messages across early on in terms of tax, budget, how to handle themselves publicly, on social media.\u000a\u000a"Sure, there are horror stories but we're working hard and taking a positive approach from the start rather than dealing with the train wreck at the end. And sometimes we're like an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff if players make an error or something else goes wrong.\u000a\u000a"We have examples of players going to a club and doing everything for it, sometimes to the detriment of playing for their national union. World Rugby have relations in place to protect the smaller islands and nations for player release.\u000a\u000a"There's certainly a lot of work to be done to ensure that the Pacific Islands have access to the players to use them when they need them. No one has a magic bullet at the moment, that's the reality and it's a challenge."\u000a\u000aFuture solutions?\u000a\u000aSeilala Mapusua was Samoa's vice-captain at the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\u000a\u000aMany Pacific Island players either in the twilight of their career or now retired have been working with Blackie and PIPA in a bid to help improve the game in the region and also relieve the plight of the players.\u000a\u000aThe visit of the world champion All Blacks to Samoa in 2015 gave the sport a massive boost, while New Zealand provincial teams the Chiefs and Crusaders contested a Super Rugby competition match in Fiji.\u000a\u000aFormer Samoa international Seilala Mapusua is one of those liaising with Blackie, looking for answers to the problem.\u000a\u000a"I've asked myself the same questions throughout my career -- how to solve it. What can be done to improve it?" he says.\u000a\u000a"I really don't know what the answers are, maybe some form of shared revenue when Samoa plays to a sell-out crowd at Twickenham, almost as an act of good faith. I know the home nation isn't obliged to. Getting the All Blacks to Samoa last year was absolutely huge. Hopefully that can encourage other top tier nations to come over.\u000a\u000aAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen was made an honorary High Chief Of Vaiala on the 2015 visit to Samoa.\u000a\u000a"It feels like things are slowly heading in the right direction. The buzz from the All Blacks was huge, likewise the Super Rugby game, and Samoa made the game competitive. It shows if given the chance we're not too far behind.\u000a\u000a"But there are still issues. You get boys withdraw from tours all the time and you never hear them say 'the club wanted me to stay' as clubs have to release them for international duty -- but everyone knows it's happening.\u000a\u000a"Players are caught between a rock and a hard place. Everyone wants to represent their country, that's the pinnacle for a professional rugby player."\u000a\u000aClub vs. country\u000a\u000aHale T-Pole (left) in action for Tonga against Namibia at the 2015 World Cup.\u000a\u000aThe recurring theme appears to be the difficulty in getting players released to play for their country and thereby give the Pacific Island nations the best chance possible to shine on the global stage.\u000a\u000aFormer Tonga international Hale T. Pole wants players to stand up more strongly on the issue.\u000a\u000a"I didn't care if the club were going to sack me to not," he says. "So I never had a problem on playing for my country as I stayed firm.\u000a\u000a"That's supposed to be law that they have to release you, but some clubs beat players down on that. It didn't happen to me but I've seen it firsthand, players not getting released from their clubs. The clubs would try to bend the rules without saying 'you have to stay.'"\u000a\u000aTonga has not played a home international since 2009, something that Pole describes as "unheard of" -- but he believes rugby authorities are addressing the issue.\u000a\u000a"I know Tongans are quick to judge World Rugby," he adds. "But World Rugby have done their best. We're all trying to do our best but, right now, I feel a bit lost."\u000a\u000aThe sense is that things are slowly changing. If Fiji wins gold in Rio on Thursday, the ripple effect could provide benefits for the wider region.

You get an easy and honest conversation that speaks volumes about how we can talk to our kids about gender and how much we can learn from their openness.\u000a\u000a"What gender do you think I am?" Hennessy asked 11 sixth-graders in New York Citywho are members of SheKnows' unique Hatch program , which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation. The program is in its fourth year.\u000a\u000aThere is silence for a second, and then one girl says "male" and another says, "I heard earlier that you were transgender."\u000a\u000aHennessy, an actor in New York City and co-host of the podcast " Kill Me Now" with comedian Judy Gold, says they are both right.\u000a\u000a"I'm a transgender male," he says.\u000a\u000aAnd then the questions begin. "When did you first realize you were transgender?" a boy asks before the conversation turns to terms the kids may or may not have heard before: transgender, agender (when you don't identify as male or female), gender fluid (you feel more masculine one day, more feminine the next) and sexual orientation.\u000a\u000a'Don't treat it like a gross, icky ... thing'\u000a\u000aHennessy hopes the new video of the Hatch workshop, released Thursday, will be seen by children and parents across the country and lead to more understanding about people like himself who are born with reproductive organs that do not match their gender identity.\u000a\u000a"If you don't treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing, they don't treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing," Hennessy said in an interview. When kids as young as 4 or 5 years old use female pronouns when they meet him, he tells them, "Oh, no, I'm a boy," at which point they often ask, "What, you're a boy?"\u000a\u000aHe then explains to them what being transgender is. "And boom, they get it right away," he said.\u000a\u000aMaverick, 12, knew what transgender was before taking part in the Hatch workshop. His mom is a sexuality educator who has been talking to him about sexuality and gender since birth. But he had never met anyone who was transgender until Hennessy.\u000a\u000a"I thought it was a very powerful experience for me," Maverick said. "I'm not sure about other kids, but I think meeting a transgender male for the first time was a very impactful thing in my life."\u000a\u000aThe experience gives him a better understanding of how other people think, he said. "I think it just tells me more about others and how to act with them and respect them in different ways."\u000a\u000aReed, who's also 12 and participated in the workshop, said it's very helpful to meet and talk with someone who is transgender or watch them in a video.\u000a\u000a"It's not just like learning from maybe people who don't know that much about that," she said. "You're learning from people who have experienced it."\u000a\u000a'Just Google it'\u000a\u000aLogan Levkoff is a sexuality educator who has taught and designed many of the sex education programs used in private schools throughout New York City and the surrounding areas. She is also the mother of Maverick and an 8-year-old daughter. Gender is a constant conversation in their household.\u000a\u000a"We've always spent a lot of time talking about what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl and maybe more importantly, the fact that there is not one definition of boy and girl and anything in between," said Levkoff, author of "Got Teens? The Doctor Moms' Guide to Sexuality, Social Media and Other Adolescent Realities."\u000a\u000aShe has told her kids that every person has the right to experience life the way they see fit, in a way that best reflects who they are. "And sometimes that means not feeling like a boy or not feeling like a girl or feeling like something else entirely," she said.\u000a\u000aHer advice for parents, when it comes to how and when to start talking to kids about what it means to be transgender and gender in general, is to first figure out what exactly they want their kids to know and then recognize what their own limitations are and the gaps in their own knowledge.\u000a\u000a"The likelihood is that for a lot of parents, they may not have any personal experience, which means that you have to get some information and education and also be willing to tell your child, if they have a question for you, to say, 'You know what, I don't know what the answer is, but I'm going to find it out for you,' " said Levkoff.\u000a\u000aHennessy, who grew up in Maui, Hawaii, at a time when there was no dialogue about being transgender, said parents should absolutely take time to learn more about it.\u000a\u000a"Just Google it. Google transgender. Google transsexual. Google tranny, and it won't take that long," he said. "Just learn a little bit. All you've got to do is start. You don't have to learn everything all at once ... It's a lot simpler than people try to make it, so we have all these definitions and words to define things, but it's really super simple. ... We overthink it."\u000a\u000aHennessy didn't hear the term transgender until roughly five years ago. Before that, he always felt "off," he said. "I felt totally born wrong since day one." Ashamed about being in a woman's body, he had bound his breasts ever since he started developing. "I would wear two sports bras and one of my dad's extra-large shirts ... and any time the wind blew up against me, I would pull my shirt up off of my chest."\u000a\u000aHow parents can learn from their kids\u000a\u000aLike Levkoff, Hennessy can't emphasize enough how the more honest and open you are with your child about sexuality and gender, the better.\u000a\u000a"I say, as soon as they start asking you, answer the questions, no matter how old they are, as soon as they start asking you, because if you don't answer them, someone else will, and you can choose what they hear first," he said. "It takes the mysticism out of sex. It takes the pervertedness out of sex."\u000a\u000a"There are some young kids who are really capable of some really sophisticated thought about gender and sexuality, and there are some adults who are completely incapable of having a mature conversation, so age doesn't determine whether or not someone can handle this, but I think it's important for parents to remember that from the time our kids are born, how we dress them, how we allow them to express themselves, how we allow other people to talk to them or the assumptions they make about them, are all little doses of education about gender and expression," she said.\u000a\u000aWhat is clear, at least from the video featuring Hennessy and the Hatch participants, is that there's a lot parents can learn from kids, especially about topics such as gender.\u000a\u000a"I think parents should learn from kids, because kids are more exposed to all this stuff now ... and parents, their generation wasn't as exposed," said Reed, one of the young participants. "It shouldn't just be kids learning from parents. It should go all ways."\u000a\u000aLevkoff said she is "constantly amazed" at how "color- and gender-blind" today's kids are. "And by the way, not all of them, because they are a product of us," she said. "But their default setting isn't to be intolerant. Their default setting is to just be open, and that's really an incredible thing to watch."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHennessy said most parents teach their kids to love equally and to eschew racism. He hopes they will also find ways to teach them to be open and accepting of another person's gender.\u000a\u000a"When someone is coming to you with something that is different from your experience, just give them a chance to tell their side and believe them and don't try to change them, because by trying to change them, you're telling them that their existence isn't good enough," Hennessy said.
