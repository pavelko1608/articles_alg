aVParis (CNN) A 9-year-old South African child diagnosed with HIV when he was 1 month old has been in HIV remission for 8½ years -- without regular treatment.\u000a\u000aThis is the first reported case of a child controlling their HIV infection without drugs in Africa and the third known case globally.\u000a\u000aSoon after diagnosis, the child was placed on antiretroviral treatment, or ART, for 40 weeks, at which point treatment was stopped and the child's health was monitored.\u000a\u000aBlood tests in late 2015 revealed the child is in HIV remission, meaning levels of the virus in the blood are undetectable using standard tests. Subsequent testing of samples dating back to the child's infancy confirm remission was achieved soon after treatment was stopped.\u000a\u000aTreatment was paused as part of a larger research trial investigating the potential for early ART to decrease infant mortality and reduce the need for lifelong treatment among newborns infected with HIV.\u000a\u000a"This is really very rare," said Dr. Avy Violari, head of pediatric clinical trials at the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. Violari is the child's doctor and presented the findings at the 9th International AIDS conference on HIV Science in Paris on Monday.\u000a\u000a"By studying these cases, we hope we will understand how one can stop (treatment)," Violari told CNN.\u000a\u000aThere is no cure or vaccine against HIV, and lifelong treatment for children comes with the risk of potential toxicity, side effects and the need for daily adherence, which becomes harder during the teen years.\u000a\u000aThe benefits of early treatment\u000a\u000aThe child, who was not identified, was part of a study known as the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy, or CHER, trial, which ran from 2005 to 2011. More than 370 infants infected with HIV were randomly assigned to immediately receive ART for either 40 weeks or 96 weeks. A third group were not placed on immediate treatment, but instead received treatment according to standard guidelines at the time.\u000a\u000aWhen the trial began, standard treatment was based on the level of immune cells damaged by the virus, known as CD4 cells, within the body. Current guidelines recommend immediate treatment, irrespective of CD4 cell count.\u000a\u000aIn infants infected with HIV close to birth, progression of the disease occurs very rapidly within the first few months of life and can often lead to death, according to the World Health Organization. An estimated 110,000 children died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2015, according to UNAIDS\u000a\u000aPediatricians also worry about the side-effects and health impacts of lifelong treatment with antiretroviral drugs for those who survive.\u000a\u000aMore than 1.8 million children were living with HIV in 2015, according to UNAIDS, and 150,000 children became newly infected, the majority of which were in Africa.\u000a\u000aThe CHER trial set out to investigate whether mortality rates could be reduced, but also whether earlier treatment could keep children healthy enough to enable them to come off treatment for certain periods.\u000a\u000a"We were hoping to make it a slower-progressing disease," said Violari.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Patients zero: Disease victims who were blamed for outbreaks Photos: Patients zero: Disease victims who were blamed for outbreaks Mary Mallon, who became known as "Typhoid Mary," was identified circa 1907 as the controversial "patient zero" in a typhoid fever outbreak in the United States in the early 1900s. Although she never had symptoms, she was forced into quarantine on two occasions, for a total of 26 years. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Patients zero: Disease victims who were blamed for outbreaks Gaëtan Dugas, a French-Canadian flight attendant, was mistaken as the "patient zero" who brought human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, to the United States. Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first documented the mysterious disease in 1981. Dugas and his family were condemned for years, until his name was cleared decades later in a research paper published in the journal Nature in 2016.

Hide Caption 5 of 5\u000a\u000aThe study found mortality decreased by 76% and HIV disease progression reduced by 75% among the infants who received treatment immediately, for 40 or 96 weeks. The group receiving standard treatment saw an increase in mortality based on interim results, so that arm of the trial was stopped early.\u000a\u000aChildren receiving early treatment in the trial needed to go back onto it, on average, after two years, Violari said, with cases ranging from needing it immediately to needing it after four years. An estimated 10 children have not had to go back on treatment, she said, as their viral loads are fairly low -- between 1,000 to 3,000 per milliliter of blood -- meaning they are healthy, in clinical terms.\u000a\u000aBut virus levels in the 9-year-old case are undetectable. "The child is the only child showing remission," said Violari.\u000a\u000a"We cannot see virus in the blood using standard techniques ... we can see fragments of the virus in the cells," she said, adding that these fragments appear not to be able to replicate, for now, giving hope the child may stay this way. "This child is unique."\u000a\u000aOnly three cases\u000a\u000aThe South African child is the third reported case of long-term HIV remission in a child after early, limited treatment with antiretroviral drugs.\u000a\u000aThe first case was a Mississippi baby, a girl born in 2010, who received ART just 30 hours after birth until she was 18 months old, at which point HIV remission was achieved. The baby sustained remission for 27 months, until 2015, when she rebounded and the virus was found in her blood, crushing hopes that this approach could be the route to a "functional cure" for HIV.\u000a\u000aNext came the 2015 case of a French teenager , now 20, whose mother was HIV positive. The French child was given antiretroviral treatment soon after birth, stopped treatment at age 6 and has maintained undetectable levels of the virus in her blood since.\u000a\u000aAsier Saez Cirion from the Institut Pasteur in France, who presented the findings on the teenager in 2015, confirmed to CNN this week that the teen is still in remission and maintaining good health, meaning she has been controlling her virus for more than 13 years.\u000a\u000aNow comes the case of the 9-year-old in South Africa, in remission for more than eight years, but after just 40 weeks of treatment. Violari stressed, however, these cases are extremely rare and that people infected with HIV should by no means come off their treatment.\u000a\u000a"Not everyone can achieve remission," she said.\u000a\u000aall received bone marrow transplants for this result, not early treatment with antiretroviral drugs. The two Boston patients rebounded, leaving Timothy Ray Brown, the Berlin patient, as the Three adults have also been reported to achieve remission to date, known as the Boston patients and Berlin patient, butallreceived bone marrow transplants for this result, not early treatment with antiretroviral drugs. The two Boston patients rebounded, leaving Timothy Ray Brown, the Berlin patient, as the only person to be clinically cured of HIV.\u000a\u000a"This (case in South Africa) tells you this is possible in some babies, to see long-term remission," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the CHER trial and ongoing followup on these infants.\u000a\u000a"The real question will be what percentage of babies treated early will achieve this result? We don't know," he said.\u000a\u000aFauci believes this kind of outcome only becomes important if you have a considerable proportion of babies protected, making it applicable as a potential therapy approach.\u000a\u000a"You always get an outlier," he said. In this case, the outlier being the 9-year old. "Further study is needed to learn how to induce long-term HIV remission in infected babies," Fauci said.\u000a\u000aHow is it possible?\u000a\u000aViolari agrees that this new remission case is not applicable to all infants with HIV, but instead that something unique about his biology and immune system helped him protect himself from the virus, aided by starting treatment early.\u000a\u000aHe developed an effective immune response to the virus early on, she said, and treatment then protected the child. "I think the early treatment aided it," she said.\u000a\u000aHer team now hopes to investigate the child, and others from the original CHER trial along with HIV-negative children to try to elucidate just what is unique about the biology enabling a child who has been treated to then suppress the virus indefinitely -- and independently -- known as a post-treatment controller.\u000a\u000a"We need to see where the differences lie," she said, adding that this insight could be used to inform vaccine design or new treatment approaches, such as the use of neutralizing antibodies to help people suppress the virus.\u000a\u000aWe could develop a product given to people in combination with ART so people can eventually stop ART, said Violari. This would not be because they are cured, but because virus levels are low enough, or undetectable, to help them stay healthy without the need for drugs.\u000a\u000a"It's a long shot," Violari said. "But we can look at what's different."\u000a\u000aFauci agreed that extensive evaluation of immune regions of these cases could help scientists find something special to guide inducing this in others. "That's being intensively studied now," said Fauci. "We have the outcome, we just need to get there."\u000a\u000aHope for future HIV control\u000a\u000a"We are delighted and excited by what happened with this child ... we need to extrapolate (from this) to the benefit of other children on antiretroviral drugs," said Dr. Mark Cotton, professor of pediatrics at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, who co-led the study. "Africa is still the epicenter of the epidemic and more babies are acquiring HIV than anywhere else."\u000a\u000aCotton hopes his team presenting these results will boost morale, both among cure researchers and those managing treatment programs for children across the continent.\u000a\u000aDr. Deborah Persaud, professor pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the United States, agreed this discovery will become useful in terms of treating HIV-infected infants.\u000a\u000a"This offers hope for the field," she said. "Every case like this keeps optimism around perinatal infection."\u000a\u000aPersaud is part of team that reported the case of the Mississippi baby in 2013 and continues to care for the child and track progress.\u000a\u000aShe agreed with Violari's team that there is something unique about the South African child's biology, because their viral levels began coming down even before the child received treatment. "This suggests there was an immune mechanism at play here," she said. "Somehow, there was early control of the virus."\u000a\u000aThe three cases to date all form part of this era in which rare examples of remission are coming to light and providing valuable insight for HIV cure researchers. They serve as proof of concept that this can occur, she said, stressing that this is far from the norm.\u000a\u000a"Many kids around the world have been treated early and are not off treatment," she said.\u000a\u000aA current trial, known as IMPAACT P1115 and funded by the US NIH, is providing treatment to HIV-infected infants within 48 hours of birth, further exploring options to eventually enable children to come off ART, even if just for a few months at a time, and investigate the potential for remission.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAlmost 400 infants have been enrolled across nine countries. The first cases might be eligible to stop ART later this year, according to the NIH.\u000a\u000aWhile Persaud said remission cases are likely to be the exception to the rule, she added that the long-term hope is to go from the need for daily ART, which involves potential toxicity and the need for adherence, to children being able to come off treatment for extended periods.\u000a\u000aEven not taking drugs for three months of life, some adults say is a big step for them, she said. "This can make living with HIV less burdensome ... and just make life a lot more livable."

aVMichelle Obama is the first lady of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Watch CNN Films' "We Will Rise: Michelle Obama's Mission to Educate Girls Around the World" on CNNgo.\u000a\u000aNeither of my parents and hardly anyone in the neighborhood where I grew up went to college. But thanks to a lot of hard work and plenty of financial aid, I had the opportunity to attend some of the finest universities in this country. That education opened so many doors and gave me the confidence to pursue my ambitions and have a voice in the world.\u000a\u000aFor me, education was power.\u000a\u000aAnd a few years ago, when I had the honor of meeting Malala Yousafzai , who was shot in the head just for trying to go to school, this issue got really personal for me. I saw that the terrorists who nearly killed her were trying to silence her voice, snuff out her ambitions, and take away her power.\u000a\u000aThat's why I decided to work on global girls' education as first lady: because right now, there are tens of millions of girls like Malala in every corner of the globe who are not in school -- girls who are so bright, hardworking and hungry to learn. And that's really the mission of the Let Girls Learn initiative we launched last year: It's a global effort to give these girls the education they need to fulfill their potential and lift up their families, communities and countries.\u000a\u000aNow, as first lady, I have no budget of my own for programs, and I have no authority to make or pass laws. That's why, when we first launched Let Girls Learn, many folks doubted that we could make a real impact on this global issue.\u000a\u000aBut over the past year and a half, we've established partnerships with some of the world's largest companies and organizations that are committing money, resources and expertise. We're collaborating with countries like Canada, Mexico and the Nordic countries on girls' education efforts. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have collectively pledged nearly $600 million.\u000a\u000aThe United States is investing over a billion dollars through new and ongoing efforts and running Let Girls Learn programs in more than 50 countries. The World Bank Group will be investing $2.5 billion over the next five years. And through social media campaigns, Let Girls Learn has rallied people across America and across the globe to step up and be champions for girls worldwide.\u000a\u000aAll this is happening because time and again, whether it's a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a 15-year-old girl here in the United States, when people hear the stories of girls who aren't in school, they want to help.\u000a\u000aThat's why CNN's new film on global girls' education, "We Will Rise," airing for the first time this week, is so critically important -- because it tells these girls' stories.\u000a\u000aThis powerful film chronicles the lives of some of the girls I visited this past summer in Liberia and Morocco, two countries in Africa where many girls struggle to get an education. I was joined in my travels by the actors and activists Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto , who are also passionate about girls' education, as well as CNN anchor Isha Sesay\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Why young girls in Morocco are missing school Replay More Videos ...

Others face cultural pressures to drop out, marry young and start having children of their own.\u000a\u000aBut these girls have big plans for their lives. They want to attend college and become doctors, teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs; and day after day, they do whatever it takes to get the education they need to fulfill their dreams.

aVFullerton, California (CNN) For Democrats hoping to turn President Donald Trump's unpopularity into an opportunity to take control of the House next year, this Orange County community is ground zero.\u000a\u000aTheir target here -- Rep. Ed Royce -- is like several other established Republican incumbents in California who progressives hope can be toppled in a wave of anti-Trump backlash. In their bid to win the 24 seats necessary to take control of the House, Democrats are focusing on California -- and particularly a swath of seven Republican-held seats clustered in or near Orange County.\u000a\u000aThe reason those seats are being targeted: 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton bested Trump in all seven districts in the 2016 election. Clinton was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to carry Orange County, and her victory there reflected the rapid demographic changes in the increasingly young, diverse and educated region.\u000a\u000aRoyce hadn't planned a town hall meeting during the August recess -- so Indivisible, Planned Parenthood and other groups scheduled one without him. Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez, who represents a nearby Southern California district, attended and fielded questions for hours instead.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, five Democrats who are running against Royce mingled with the crowd of hundreds.\u000a\u000a"There's just a lot of built-up anger," said Gil Cisneros, who won a $266 million lottery prize in 2010 and is now challenging Royce. "We have to find a way to keep that going."\u000a\u000a"In some ways, this is an opportunity to really bring new people into the fold," said Sam Jammal, a former chief of staff to Rep. Tony Cardenas, an Obama administration Commerce Department official who is also running in the district.\u000a\u000aThe event underscored the opportunities and challenges confronting Democrats headed into the 2018 midterm elections: The party's base is energized enough to draw a massive crowd on a Thursday night 15 months away from the election. But it has also attracted candidates in droves, which means a long, expensive primary season before a Democrat can fully focus on Royce, who already has $3.1 million in the bank.\u000a\u000aRoyce and Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters' districts are located in Orange County. Rep. Darrell Issa's district extends from its south toward San Diego.\u000a\u000aRep. Steve Knight represents the suburbs north of Los Angeles. And Reps. David Valadao and Jeff Denham represent California's Central Valley, not as near to Orange County as others but areas with similar demographics and recent election results that have led Democrats to believe their seats are also within reach.\u000a\u000aThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the first time has moved its Western regional office to Irvine, California -- a decision that reflects the group's early commitment to the region. The House Democrats' campaign arm has six staffers working in that office and six more organizers in target districts across the state.\u000a\u000aRepublicans are moving more slowly, but emphasizing the jam-packed fields of challengers and underscoring the rifts those primary fights could expose within the Democratic Party.\u000a\u000a"While Republicans are focused on their districts, Democrats are tearing one another apart in brutal, expensive races to the left," said Jack Pandol, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. "Thus far, Democrats' big promises in California have won them nothing except more friendly fire that they are struggling -- and failing -- to control."\u000a\u000aAn influx of outside spending is also already reaching the districts of Royce, Valadao, Knight and Denham.\u000a\u000aThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, has opened field offices in each of the four districts, and could open offices in more competitive California districts in the coming months.\u000a\u000aThe affiliated group American Action Network plans to launch television advertising in the districts of Valadao, Knight and Denham at the end of this week that will give the three Republicans air cover as the party starts a tax reform push, touting popular planks of such an effort. Already, it has launched both English- and Spanish-language radio ads in those districts.\u000a\u000aIts organizers are also playing up individual House Republicans' district-focused strengths, such as Denham's work on water issues.\u000a\u000a"California is really a state that we know that Democrats are going to be targeting, so we need to start early and be out there talking to voters about what these members are doing back in DC on their behalf," said Ruth Guerra, a CLF spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aOn the left, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer's group NextGen America is focusing its early 2018 efforts on Royce, Valadao, Knight and Denham -- "four districts where young people obviously can be the swing," Steyer said.\u000a\u000aHe said his group will be on more than 200 college campuses in eight states in the 2018 cycle, organizing young people who will be part of a grassroots program that emphasizes face-to-face conversations and texts with potential voters. In the 2016 election cycle, Steyer said, young people were 23% more likely to vote if they'd spoken with NextGen organizers than if they had not.\u000a\u000aThat's particularly important in California, where the sky-high costs of advertising in the Los Angeles media market could keep Democrats -- especially those who face competitive primaries -- from keeping up with their Republican foes on the airwaves.\u000a\u000aIn addition to geography, the House Republicans whom Democrats are targeting have a key vote in common: They each supported the House's bill to repeal President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act and replace it with legislation crafted by GOP leadership and supported by Trump.\u000a\u000aIn Rohrabacher's district, Hans Keirstead, a pioneer in stem cell research who sold his business for more than $100 million in 2014 and later bought it back, has given Democrats a top recruit with a science and business background in a district where Republican registration outpaces Democrats.\u000a\u000aKeirstead, a 50-year-old Canadian immigrant, said he plans to offer himself as an expert voice on health care with decades of experience in scientific research and pharmaceutical trials and approval -- something he said Congress needs.\u000a\u000a"The breadth and depth in health care experience is lacking" on Capitol Hill, he said, arguing that Republicans and Democrats "both want experts there -- and they both want change."\u000a\u000aHe faulted Trump's administration for slashing spending on Obamacare digital and television outreach and narrowing the enrollment period. "That had a direct effect of increasing premiums," he said.\u000a\u000aThen, he said, Trump's threats to end government payments to health insurers caused insurers to "hedge" and increase premiums again.\u000a\u000a"Here, months later, we say, 'oh, look at the rising premiums, continually rising.' It was just cresting to decrease," Keirstead said. "That crippling of Obamacare for nothing more than political gain really disappointed me. I just thought, putting politics in front of peoples' health -- it's just so disgusting."\u000a\u000aDuring a tour of his Aivita Biomedical offices in Irvine, Keirstead also lambasted Trump's administration for proposing a budget that would slash the National Institutes of Health's funding for scientific research\u000a\u000a"We're cutting off the future of medicine and health care," he said.\u000a\u000aRoyce and Rohrabacher's offices did not respond to CNN interview requests.\u000a\u000aCalifornia Republicans say they are optimistic that their incumbents' fundraising advantage and their survival in 2016 will position them well in the midterms -- when the party expects a gubernatorial race could help draw some additional Republican votes.\u000a\u000a"The fact of the matter is, in a presidential election with near-record turnout, these Republicans won rather handily, even though Hillary Clinton won their districts. They will more than likely outperform their margin of victory in 2018," said Jim Brulte, the California Republican Party chairman.\u000a\u000a"We are aware that Nancy Pelosi wants to be speaker. We are aware that she believes her return to the speakership runs through some of these seven California districts," Brulte said. "We are confident we will hold them -- but we don't take anything for granted."

aVManchester, England (CNN) If Manchester City used to be the club boasting high-profile signings on provocative billboards, these days this northern English city's "noisy neighbor" is taking a more softly, softly approach.\u000a\u000aAhead of Saturday's Premier League derby against rival Manchester United, it's all about the grand scheme for a club that was once written off for having "a small mentality."\u000a\u000a"It's been a bit like an iceberg coming out of the water," says Manchester City's chief infrastructure officer, Jon Stemp. "People only see the tip of it."\u000a\u000aGiven City were playing in England's third tier in 1999, the club's ascent to English football's top table initially necessitated the acquisition of players -- an investment of just under $1 billion since the Abu Dhabi United Group took over.\u000a\u000aWithin hours of the club changing hands, City had smashed the British transfer record for Real Madrid's Robinho. City's transfer policy was denigrated -- the new kids on the block were branded oil rich and regarded by many as no more than a billionaire's plaything.\u000a\u000aBut Sheikh Mansour and his team have never lost sight of the bigger picture...\u000a\u000aYou can win anything with kids\u000a\u000a"People were measuring the investments in the short term without knowing there was a long-term plan coming," Stemp says.\u000a\u000aBeneath the surface, greater plans have been afoot ever since Mansour declared in 2008: "We are building a structure for the future, not just a team of all-stars."\u000a\u000aIn the heart of the Etihad Campus, deep within the area of Manchester known as "Sportscity," the 5,000-seater, 7,000-capacity Academy Stadium is the shining jewel in one of the finest youth complexes in the world.\u000a\u000aThe Academy Stadium is predominantly used by the Elite Development squad and Manchester City Women. "I like to think of us as pioneers ... not just in England, but globally," says Man City and England Ladies midfielder Izzy Christiansen.\u000a\u000aIn fixtures against United last season, City went unbeaten in every age group, from the Under-9s all the way up to the U18s.\u000a\u000aA 9-0 aggregate win at U14 level against the Red Devils will have been particularly galling for a club so proud of Ferguson's Class of '92 -- featuring the likes of David Beckham -- and the Busby Babes\u000a\u000aIn an age when many of the world's wealthiest clubs' academies are filled with many different nationalities, 75% of the players in City's Football Academy are drawn from the Greater Manchester area.\u000a\u000aAll in all, the club engages with "the best part of 50,000 young people in Manchester every year," according to former City goalkeeper Alex Williams -- now manager of club's City in the Community program.\u000a\u000aEven United luminaries Robin van Persie, Phil Neville, Andrew Cole and Darren Fletcher have opted to send their sons to the Etihad Campus instead of the Trafford Training Center in recent years.\u000a\u000aStemp allows himself a contented smile. "Now, eight years on, you see the rest of the investment plan emerging."\u000a\u000aThe Mission\u000a\u000aPart of the legacy of the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the Etihad Stadium was the "first brick in the wall," according to Stemp.\u000a\u000aEver since, City plots its expansion in terms of "building blocks of eureka moments," from the transformation of blighted lands with the construction of the training complex, to the development of commercial opportunities around the East Manchester site.\u000a\u000aWithin a stone's throw of the Etihad, remnants of Manchester's industrial past are still very much visible -- disused gas holders dot the landscape while a canal runs side-by-side with the city's new tram network.\u000a\u000a"East Manchester was all industrial, and therefore the ideal location for regeneration," Stemp tells CNN.\u000a\u000aBut 80 acres of contaminated brownfield land have been transformed by self-confessed "grass nerd" Stemp and his team; 46 acres now comprise managed grass and wildflower meadows; and more than 2,000 trees have been planted.\u000a\u000a"It was very derelict," reflects Stemp, gesturing to the work the club has done. "We put our arms around the land and took control of it."\u000a\u000aThe final piece in the puzzle\u000a\u000aAs well as the physical building blocks, City officials believe coach Pep Guardiola is the final piece in a complex puzzle.\u000a\u000a"I have no doubt about his positive impact," City's chief operating officer Omar Berrada tells CNN. "We've already expanded the stadium and we think (Guardiola) will bring the potential for continued expansion."\u000a\u000a"Pep delivers a culture of success and style of play that will be developed across everything that we're doing here," Berrada says. "I'm sure that will have long-lasting effects."\u000a\u000aPep Guardiola already seems at home at the Etihad.\u000a\u000aBerrada branded Guardiola "the best in the world" within days of his arrival in a reference to the success he brought to his former clubs, Bayern Munich and Barcelona.\u000a\u000aThe Spanish coach's reputation is also helping lure the world's finest players to Manchester as the club bids to win its third Premier League title in six seasons.\u000a\u000aGundogan\u000a\u000aGuardiola's first foray into the market was for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan -- a distinguished Germany international.\u000a\u000a"To have this possibility is amazing for me," Gundogan tells CNN. "We have the best manager in the world, and day-by-day I recognize I have made the right decision."\u000a\u000aIlkay Gundogan began his career at VFL Bochum, going on to star for FC Nurnberg & Borussia Dortmund\u000a\u000aThe 25-year-old may have only been at the club for a matter of months, but he already perceives the investment transforming not just City, but the city.\u000a\u000a"Everything is developing really fast. I love the mix between old buildings and the new buildings," Gundogan says.\u000a\u000a"Manchester has a real charm."\u000a\u000aBreaking the glass ceiling\u000a\u000aIf the acquisition of players of Gundogan's stature is no longer breaking news for a club that has come so far, Kelechi Iheanacho's breakthrough from the academy shows progress is being made in all departments.\u000a\u000aIheanacho had the Premier League's best minutes- per-goal ratio in 2015-16, scoring on average every 93.8 minutes.\u000a\u000aSmashing through a glass ceiling that traditionally has proven so troublesome for young players aiming to make it in the world's richest league, the 19-year-old scored 14 goals in just 11 starts last season -- suggesting he has the mettle to become one of the most clinical finishers in Europe.\u000a\u000aWith key striker Sergio Aguero serving a three-match ban, Iheanacho could start against United Saturday.\u000a\u000a"City were a club on the way up," Iheanacho tells CNN, reflecting on his perception of the team when he joined, shortly after winning the U17 World Cup with Nigeria.\u000a\u000a"Coming from Nigeria where I was often unable to afford to watch the Premier League, I'm very proud to be playing here. It has been a great experience coming to Manchester."\u000a\u000aCitizens beyond The Citizens\u000a\u000aHowever, in an age of growing discord between fan and player -- as both Iheanacho and Gundogan earn tens of thousands of dollars per week -- how has the club's investment in its future served the rest of Manchester?\u000a\u000aWorking at Bonnie's Cafe near the Etihad Campus, Sheila Duffy has experienced first-hand the fruits of the area's regeneration -- as well as the potential pitfalls of gentrification.\u000a\u000a"We had drugs, street crime, everything like that, and nobody cared because it was derelict," she reflects. "The swimming baths were closed down, the youth club was shut. There was nothing for the kids so they'd be hanging around on street corners."\u000a\u000aDuffy acknowledges the "Sheikh up in his helicopter" may not have directly engaged with the man on the ground and his full English breakfast, but she's the first to admit her surroundings have changed dramatically -- a reference to the five and half acres of the Etihad Campus site donated to the local community.\u000a\u000aWhere the skeletons of Manchester's industrial boom once stood, a sixth-form college, leisure center, and cutting-edge medical institute now preside.\u000a\u000a"It was a rough area of the city and now there's certainly a sense of hope ... and I'm a Manchester United supporter!"\u000a\u000aA 190m span bridge across Alan Turing way is emblematic of the connection between club and community.\u000a\u000aPep vs. Jose\u000a\u000aIf the foundations are in place, can City make good on the club's rich promise?\u000a\u000aWhile Iheanacho may be a singular talent, his presence as a youth-team graduate in the Citizens squad currently remains similarly conspicuous.\u000a\u000aPromisingly, Guardiola gave 22 young players debuts during his time at Barcelona -- many of whom, from Busquets to Thiago Alcântara, have gone on to enjoy great success.\u000a\u000aBut there is still some way to go before City emerges from United's shadow in this regard.\u000a\u000aNicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville would all go on to become United regulars having progressed from the youth team under Sir Alex Ferguson.\u000a\u000aSince 1940, almost 50% of all Manchester United players have come through the club's youth system. United has had at least one academy player in the squad in every first team game since October 1937 -- a run spanning 3,808 consecutive clashes.\u000a\u000aStriker Marcus Rashford, already an England international at the age of 18, looks the latest in a long line set to benefit from that unwavering faith this year -- even if manager Jose Mourinho's commitment to youth has been questioned, and fellow "homegrown" player Paul Pogba required a $100M education abroad.\u000a\u000aExcept the envious glances toward Old Trafford have stopped.\u000a\u000aConverging with its more illustrious counterpart on and off the pitch, City has finished above United in four of the past five seasons, and Mourinho looks like he has quite the job on his hands getting the better of his old rival Guardiola.

aVWashington (CNN) The New York Times published a story over the weekend detailing the "shadow" campaign underway among ambitious Republicans to be prepared in the event that President Donald Trump doesn't run for a second term in 2020.\u000a\u000aThe story mentioned that Vice President Mike Pence's "schedule is so full of political events that Republicans joke that he is acting more like a second-term vice president hoping to clear the field than a No. 2 sworn in a little over six months ago."\u000a\u000aAnd that Pence -- via aides -- is making sure he's first in line if Trump bows out; "multiple advisers to Mr. Pence have already intimated to party donors that he would plan to run if Mr. Trump did not," wrote Timesmen Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns.\u000a\u000aIn reaction to the story, Pence -- and this is no exaggeration -- went bananas. He released a statement through the vice president's office insisting that the Times story was "disgraceful and offensive to me, my family, and our entire team." He also called it "laughable and absurd" that he was doing anything in regard to 2020 other than working to ensure Trump wins a second term.\u000a\u000aPence's reaction was far more aggressive than the others -- Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, as well as Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- mentioned in the story as laying the groundwork to be ready if Trump exits after a single term. (This may all be a moot conversation, given that Trump insists he is running in 2020 and has already raised about $17 million for his re-election race .)\u000a\u000aPence's (over)reaction raises a simple question: Why?\u000a\u000aAnd the answer starts with "Donald" and ends with "Trump."\u000a\u000aPence's political fortunes are 100% tied to Trump. They have been since the day the then-Indiana governor said "yes" to Trump's offer to share the ticket. On that day, Pence became a stranger to the GOP political establishment that was still very leery of the idea of Trump as the party nominee.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Pence: New York Times report is disgraceful Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pence: New York Times report is disgraceful 01:54\u000a\u000aThat estrangement has only continued since Trump became President. Pence has been an unquestioning Trump ally at every turn, insisting that the President knows exactly what he's doing -- and either ignoring or rebutting the criticism leveled at Trump by many of the people Pence once served with. (Remember that Pence was a member of the House Republican leadership before leaving to run for governor in 2012.)\u000a\u000aPence, in other words, is all in on Trump. His path to become president is to be the Trump-endorsed candidate, the heir to the movement that Trump built during the 2016 campaign. And to do that, Pence absolutely must make sure there is never any distance between him and the President.\u000a\u000aIt's doubly important for no one to be able to slip a piece of paper between Pence and the President because the President is Donald Trump. Trump is forever watching to make sure no one in his world is eclipsing him -- or even trying to. The unforgivable sin in Trump's world isn't saying or doing impolitic things, it's appearing to be something short of entirely loyal.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mike Pence's political life and career Pence announces that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services had approved the State's waiver request for the plan his administration called HIP 2.0 during a speech in Indianapolis on January 27, 2015.

aVOver 350 global business leaders gathered yesterday to discuss the theme \u201cBeyond Oil in a Changing World\u201d at the inaugural CNN Middle East Business Forum held at Four Seasons Abu Dhabi on Al Maryah Island.\u000a\u000aKeynote speeches were given by former President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso (pictured) and Mubadala\u2019s Group Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director H.E. Khaldoon Al Mubarak.\u000a\u000aPanel discussions and interviews with a stellar list of speakers were conducted by CNN\u2019s foremost experts on business and the Middle East \u2013 Anchor and Managing Editor, Abu Dhabi, Becky Anderson, CNNMoney Editor at Large Richard Quest, and CNNMoney Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios. A virtual reality \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 session from CNN\u2019s Jason Farkas closed proceedings.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis inaugural CNN Middle East Business Forum was a platform of informed and intelligent discussion amongst key influencers about the opportunities and challenges in the Middle East during a time of seismic change,\u201d said Rani R. Raad, President, CNN International Commercial. \u201cWe are proud to have worked with our partners Mubadala and twofour54 to bring together news-makers, agenda-setters and business leaders for meaningful debate about what the future holds.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Forum was held in association with Mubadala and twofour54 and with commercial supporting partners Al Maryah Island and Abu Dhabi Global Market on the weekend that eyes of the world turn to the UAE during the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\u000a\u000aHighlights show CNN Middle East Business Forum: Beyond Oil will first air on CNN International on 9 December at 2030 GST. Coverage from the Forum is also at money.cnn.com.\u000a\u000aKey quotes from the speakers at the CNN Middle East Business Forum include :\u000a\u000aIn conversation with José Manuel Barroso, H.E. Khaldoon Al Mubarak said: \u201cGlobal economic volatility is here for the foreseeable future; however, Abu Dhabi has acted to stay competitive and continue delivering against its economic development priorities.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe continued: \u201cStrong government to government relationships create a foundation for significant capital allocations in markets across the East and West, and we see incredible potential for significant investment in relatively new markets for us, such as China and Russia.\u201d\u000a\u000aJosé Manuel Barroso talked about the topic of diversification: \u201cLower oil prices is a job for all the GCC countries, but I believe the UAE is in a very good position. The GCC has turned from a net exporter to a net importer of capital with this focus on IPOs and privatisations. We are seeing here a very important change.\u201d\u000a\u000aTalking about Brexit, Barroso commented: \u201cIt is too soon to say what will happen with Brexit. Why? Because there is no strategy. Neither from the British or European side. The British haven\u2019t decided what they want. It was easy to vote no but the question is to vote how to do it. It is not clear how to do it\u2026. Frankly, nobody knows in London.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd on the US election result, Barroso said: \u201cPresident Elect Trump needs to adapt to the world and the world needs to adapt to him. In economic terms, investors are mainly happy about what he has announced so far \u2013 less regulation, lower taxes and huge programme of infrastructure\u2026 There is a question mark though on trade, where his rhetoric has been extremely negative. I believe that if the agenda of President Elect Trump is an agenda about growth, then he cannot do it without trade.\u201d\u000a\u000aH.E. Noura Al Kaabi, Chairwoman, Media Zone Authority-Abu Dhabi and twofour54 said: \u201ctwofour54, Abu Dhabi\u2019s content creation hub, and the Tourism and Culture Authority Abu Dhabi are working to drive the development of Abu Dhabi\u2019s cultural economy by bringing together the best of government, private sector and international partners to deliver major initiatives.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a location for blockbuster films such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the last stop on the global Formula 1 calendar, and home of international cultural collaborations such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi; we are creating an international brand and destination that appeals to a diverse global audience.\u000a\u000aShe further commented: \u201cAbu Dhabi organizations are working behind the scenes to incubate a sustainable media and cultural ecosystem by supporting infrastructure development, educational initiatives and legislative frameworks.\u201d\u000a\u000aH.E. Mohamed Al Mubarak, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority, said: \u201cBoth TCA Abu Dhabi and TwoFour54 play crucial roles in delivering Abu Dhabi\u2019s economic diversification ambitions. We have clear targets for the tourism sector, and our local cultural attractions and globally recognized events calendar are a major drivers of visitors.\u000a\u000a\u201cSuccess in particular sectors occurs when the home environment plays to its unique strengths \u2013 and that\u2019s what is happening in Abu Dhabi. We have a wealth of cultural and heritage assets which we are leveraging along with our values, natural environment, economic structure and creative and tourism institutions, to forge a reputation as a distinct and attractive destination.\u201d\u000a\u000aNotes to Editors:\u000a\u000aFor more information, please contact:\u000a\u000aDan Faulks\u000a\u000aVice President, Communications CNN International Commercial\u000a\u000aTel: + 44 20 7693 1362 Dan.Faulks@turner.com\u000a\u000aAbout CNN International\u000a\u000aCNN\u2019s portfolio of news and information services is available in seven different languages across all major TV, digital and mobile platforms reaching more than 420 million households around the globe.

aVMichael D'Antonio, a CNN contributor, is the author of the book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success " (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his\u000a\u000a(CNN) General Michael Flynn bought in during what you could call the pre-opening sales period, when an eager purchaser could get the best deal.\u000a\u000aHe joined the Trump campaign early and became national security advisor to the President. Jeff Sessions was another early-purchaser , becoming the first senator to stand up for Trump. He was named attorney general. Sean Spicer was a latecomer, but anted up his credibility. It bought him the job of White House press secretary.\u000a\u000aToday, Flynn is in legal peril after being forced to resign after 23 days on the job after the White House was warned he had misled the administration about his contacts with Russians. Freshly unemployed, Spicer faces professional disgrace after expending much of his credibility in support of Trump's myriad lies and having a new man installed above him. And Sessions is being undermined by the President, who has hit him with a barrage of humiliating social media posts , including, "Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes."\u000a\u000aAlthough each of the President's loyalists has suffered in a unique way, their experience with the President has followed a pattern. Flynn, Spicer, and Sessions were players in the game of politics and policy who never quite earned superstar status. Then came Trump, with his billionaire's swagger and his private aircraft, insisting that the old rules no longer apply. He offered them sudden promotions that likely fulfilled their long-life dreams. The deals were too good to pass up, so they bought.\u000a\u000aHow did the President's men, each blessed with enough competence and intelligence to at least reach the big leagues, wind up in such a world of hurt? The answer is that they ran into a high-pressure salesman with an apex predator's eye for weakness and an instinct for exploiting it.\u000a\u000aThroughout his life Trump has demonstrated he is a keen student of human nature who reduced men and women to certain basic drives. In his view, people were, like him, interested mainly in money, sex, power, and attention. He is a man who unashamedly says, "I'm very handsome " and openly admits, "I'm a greedy person." In my encounters with Trump he made it clear that he felt I shared his values. At one point he flattered me, a bearded, bald man, for my appearance and at another he talked about how it would benefit me if I wrote about him in a positive way.\u000a\u000aIf it doesn't occur to Trump that some people can't be bought with money or flattery it may be because it often seems like these techniques work. "I play to people's fantasies ," he explained in his book "Trump, The Art of the Deal." "People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do."\u000a\u000aTrump's method for making people excited begins with setting the proper mood. As a businessman he put his name in huge gold letters over the entrance to the tower where he kept his office. He decorated the interior to look like the Hollywood version of a modern mogul's lair and filled it with young women with movie star looks, who addressed him only as "Mr. Trump." It was the next best thing to working in the Oval Office and being called "Mr. President."\u000a\u000aDeal seekers and job applicants who entered Trump's world found themselves confronted with the classic techniques of high-pressure salesmanship . Confusing chatter, emotional manipulation and a charming sort of friendliness all combine to make a target drop his or her guard. Trump's preposterous honesty about things like his greed and his clumsy/folksy pattern of speech combine to create a sense of familiarity and even common cause.\u000a\u000aWith the voters, Trump built a relationship based on a shared sense of anger at politicians (even though he had become one). Ambitious operatives seeking to advance found in Trump a possible shortcut to the top. Flynn, Spicer and Sessions were not likely to reach the highest ranks on their own, but Trump gave them the chance to become instant superstars and thus defy all those who may have once considered them each second-rank. They may have felt that the appeal of such a great reward justified the risk of signing up with a leader whose own record was so tarnished -- by bankruptcies, scandal, and lies -- that sober-minded people, including great numbers of mainstream Republicans, avoided him.\u000a\u000aIndividual voters invested only their hopes and a ballot in President Trump. Some may be feeling misgivings about the choice, but politics and policy are not, for most, all-consuming interests. The same cannot be said for those who threw in with a President who seems to demand loyalty to him -- personally -- as a condition of employment.\u000a\u000aJames Comey, whom Trump appeared to admit to firing because of his commitment to an impartial probe of the Trump campaign and Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, testified that the President said, "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty." Comey, whose commitment to the Constitution was obviously greater than his commitment to Trump, didn't satisfy the demand and was soon dismissed.\u000a\u000aWhat made Comey choose the system over the man? It's most likely that he didn't fit Trump's assumptions about the motivations that drive people to succeed. As a public servant Comey wasn't making much money, at least by Trumpian standards, and he didn't come in for much admiring commentary about his appearance.\u000a\u000aHe was powerful, but that power was held by his office, not the man. In the end, Comey was like a potential customer who brings a supply of sales resistance into every encounter with someone who wants to sell him something. Simply put, his sales resistance was so highly developed that none of Trump's high pressure techniques worked.\u000a\u000aFor a better sense of how much Comey differed from the men who have suffered as they made their deals with Trump, consider how much each of them compromised to make their arrangements work. Flynn so wanted to be Trump's national security advisor, especially after being fired by President Obama , that he risked omitting key information from his government paperwork.\u000a\u000aSpicer was so eager to stand at the podium in the West Wing briefing room that he was happy to double down on presidential lies to such a degree that he became a laughingstock. And Sessions, whom no other president was likely to name to the office of attorney general, so loves his job that he has tolerated Trump's repeated public criticisms. To a man, they confirmed the President's worst assumptions about the nature of ambitious men.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThe man whose hiring led Spicer to quit, Anthony Scaramucci is himself a super salesman and a willing buyer of the Trump sizzle and shine. He debuted with such an outpouring of affection for his new boss that it almost seemed like he had been offered not a job, but a place in the Trump family. However, Scaramucci is, by all accounts, independently wealthy and he is so good at cultivating attention on his own that he may not need the reflected glory the White House offers. With these two qualities, he may endure longer than anyone who would have accepted the job because he or she really needed it.

aVStory highlights New Russia sanctions risk driving a wedge between US and allies, Richard Connolly says\u000a\u000aSome European countries see move as a naked economic power grab by US, he says\u000a\u000aRichard Connolly is an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a foreign affairs think tank based in London. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Since the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the subsequent involvement of Russia in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, Western powers -- led by the United States and European Union -- have been remarkably firm in maintaining a united front when it came to the hard business of dealing with Russia.\u000a\u000aThis was nowhere more notable than in the West's use of economic statecraft as the primary tool in exerting pressure on Russia to change its policy concerning Ukraine\u000a\u000aThe sanctions regime that gradually came into effect targeted strategic sectors of the Russian economy, including energy, defense and finance. But as well as hitting Russian entities, Western firms also suffered.\u000a\u000aAmerican and European manufacturing and energy giants lost a lot of money. The sale of French warships and German machinery was halted. Billions of dollars' worth of investments by energy giants such as ExxonMobil, Total and Shell were postponed. Businesses in countries with historically close commercial ties with Russia -- such as Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria -- were hit especially hard.\u000a\u000aBut the considerable economic cost paid by Western firms made the political cohesion on sanctions that has held until today all the more impressive. Despite the economic pain, the political gain of maintaining a unified front was considered to be more important. Central to this cohesion sticking was a clear effort at coordination between Washington and Brussels.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVFor complete coverage of the Eclipse of the Century go to cnn.com/eclipse . Watch live, in virtual reality, as the eclipse moves coast to coast on August 21st.\u000a\u000a(CNN) While most of us will be looking up at the eclipse August 21, you may also want to look around and take a close listen, because something unusual could be happening with the animals on our planet -- at least, we think it could.\u000a\u000a"There are many more scientific papers about Sasquatch than about animal behavior during an eclipse," said Adam Hartstone-Rose, adjunct scientist at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina.\u000a\u000aThe Riverbanks Zoo and Garden has been fielding dozens of calls from the public about what the zoo plans to do for the big day. It and a handful of other animal parks are in the path of full totality. That means, with the full eclipse over their zoos, there's a chance to enlist the public to see what, if anything, animals are doing when their sun disappears and the temperature drops.\u000a\u000aIf you have ever put one of thosethunder jackets on to calm your pooch during a storm (other than to take cute pictures), you know that animals can be more sensitive to natural phenomena than humans,toiling away in windowless, temperature-controlled offices. Well, if you don't count the human excitement that comes from taking selfies while wearing those funky eclipse glasses.\u000a\u000aThe Nashville Zoo will be handing out those funky glasses on eclipse day, and it's encouraging visitors to leave their animal observations on the zoo's social media page or to make comments on the app INaturalist. You too can use that app to share photos and jot down notes on animal or even plant behavior, even if you're not at the zoo. However, the scientists would likely prefer you keep your observations to animals of the fluffy and scaled variety; photos of your bizarre co-worker's behavior during the eclipse may be a better fit for Facebook or Instagram.\u000a\u000aThe Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga has plans to watch its lemurs carefully. There is evidence from past eclipses that lemurs "behave oddly during these events," according to Thom Benson, the aquarium's director of external affairs. The Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago is betting something could happen with its collection of chimps, which it will be watching closely.\u000a\u000aThe director at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden predicts that its animals may display subtle change. "We don't think we will see the giraffes doing back flips that day," said Ed Diebold, Riverbanks' director of animal collections and conservation. "We are curious, though, to see what will happen."\u000a\u000aWhatever change they experience, Diebold and his team will be ready. Hartstone-Rose and his scientists, along with the keepers who know the animals best, and the public who will be given surveys to record their observations will all be ready. If they see anything, they hope to include these data in a research paper. The experts there will likely concentrate on the primates, the elephants, the giraffes, the birds and the reptiles, most of which have demonstrated interesting behavior in prior eclipse events.\u000a\u000a"There are interesting philosophical questions too, because we don't know how to tell when a giraffe perceives the sun, but we know they are affected by this," Hartstone-Rose said. He thinks that if some of the more vocal animals get anxious, they'll start making more noise. Some animals may prepare for bed, others may wake up, but not all animals will care.\u000a\u000a"Giraffes, for instance, don't have a lot of reason to look up, because there are no predators for them that come from above, so the staff feels there won't be enormous changes there, but there may be with others, and hopefully we can tease the changes out."\u000a\u000aScientists have been watching animal behavior during eclipses for centuries, although the reliability of some accounts may be more believable than others. In the 1500s, an astronomer noted that birds fell out of trees and stopped singing. Keep in mind, scientists in that era also thought leeches were a cure for many ailments too, so no, you don't have to skip lunch outside to avoid the falling pigeons.\u000a\u000aIn the Victorian era, a scientist noted that ants that were "busily carrying their burdens, stopped and remained motionless till the light reappeared." And in the more recent era, scientists during a 1997 solar eclipse in Mexico noticed that lizards also seemed to react and perform the same activities as they would during sunset, but that may be a little harder to observe, since they buried themselves below the soil making up their little lizard beds.\u000a\u000aAnother official-sounding scientific group called the New England Eclipse Behavior Committee did a pre-Internet-era version of crowdsourcing and had skilled and unskilled observers send in observations. The notes show that some bird species returned to their roost and quieted down. Others noted that the hippos remained on alert, partially hidden underwater; captive squirrels got agitated; bees stopped humming; butterflies disappeared; painted turtles sought shelter; chickens huddled together; cows, however, seemed "quite unconcerned."\u000a\u000aOther studies have shown that the eclipse can be a rude awakening for some nocturnal creatures. Bugs that you would normally see active at dusk or at night have gotten active for a few minutes during previous eclipses. That means mosquitoes may come out of their nap for their midnight snack during the event, so bring your bug spray if you plan to be outside. Thankfully, most of the pests did disappear when the heat of the sun came back. Scientists have noticed frogs start singing during the eclipse.\u000a\u000aThe temperature drop that comes with an eclipse also seems to impact some animals. In 1991 , scientists who happened to be collecting cicadas in the Arizona desert noticed that the bugs went silent when coverage of the sun reached about 50%. Typically, male cicadas sing to attract a mate. Scientists don't think the eclipse acted like a cold shower to kill the romantic mood; rather, these particular cicadas needed radiant energy to elevate their body temperature enough to be physically able to sing. There was good news for cicada romance, in that love did win out, and they went back to their courting song about 20 minutes after the eclipse.\u000a\u000aChimps, who don't need the sun to chat among themselves, also seemed to react. During the 1984 eclipse , scientists at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta noticed that the females with babies and some of the solo gals all began to gather on a climbing structure when it started to get dark. The females, who typically socialized on the structure and would normally turn toward each other, instead faced the direction of the eclipse and started to watch the sky. One young chimp even stood and pointed at the eclipse.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't as dramatic as the opening scene from " 2001: A Space Odyssey ," but the animals did go back to their normal chimp business once the eclipse was over.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAs far as your pets, you can watch them, but don't count on a viral video. Studies have shown more mixed results. A study from the 1970s found that pet rabbits mostly slept. A few caged birds got agitated. Some dogs ignored the eclipse; a few seemed scared; a few barked when it was over. Cats, well, cats were cats. Some played, some meowed, but for the most part they slept, again showing off their best quality, as anyone who owns a cat knows: Our feline friends think the sun and the moon revolve around them, so what's the big deal about a more little shade?

aV(CNN) When does a child stop being a child and become a girl or a boy? A difficult question which can have serious consequences for children, according to a new report by Plan International , which has been gathering data and analyzing statistics on young adults.\u000a\u000aOver the next decade, an estimated 40 million youngsters in Sub-Saharan Africa will drop out of school, according to the World Bank\u000a\u000aGirls drop out of school more than boys, according to Plan, and researchers want governments to change the way they gather data and pay more attention to the reasons why this happens in order to fight gender inequality.\u000a\u000aStatistics on the under-15s tend not to differentiate between boys and girls, and this keeps the specific needs of young girls in the shadows, according to Plan International's CEO Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen.\u000a\u000a"You simply cannot target the program to the girl child, because you can't analyze the data in a way that will allow you to tailor your programs in an appropriate way," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000a"We have fairly good statistics that show us that there are more girls that drop out of secondary (high) school than boys, but what we don't know is why they do it."\u000a\u000aAlthough this is a blind spot in the official data, organizations like Plan have begun to investigate the causes and have found three key reasons: child marriage, menstruation and poverty.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Siphethangani, 18, pictured, finished secondary (high) school with flying colors and is now doing her A-Levels (college exams). "I love school because that's the foundation of a good life," she tells the researchers. But life looks very different for some girls. From poverty to child marriage, there are an array of reasons why many young Zimbabwean women drop out of school. These are their stories, as told to Plan International.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Siphiwe, 19, is a stay-at-home wife and mother who couldn't afford to finish school.

She took up work as a sex worker to make ends meet -- she earns a couple of dollars per client, according to Plan. Sometimes, clients reject her for being too young, she told Plan's researchers. Others are violent. "Sometimes the men use force. It's very painful." Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Jenny's friend Pauline has been working as a sex worker for three years, and has lost count of the number of men she has been with, according to Plan.

Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 To pass the time, Melissa plays netball with other girls who no longer go to school. According to Plan, there are hundreds of Zimbabwean girls out of school living unfulfilled lives. Hide Caption 10 of 10\u000a\u000aTake menstruation for example. Approaching puberty can be tough for everyone, but in some African countries girls skip school during their periods if they have nowhere to wash or change sanitary towels and tampons, according to Albrectsen.\u000a\u000a"We have literally hundreds of thousands of stories of that kind," she says.\u000a\u000a"One month they might stay away a week, and then another week next month. Then they start falling behind and they don't want to go back to school, and some may drop out altogether," she adds.\u000a\u000aWhile the most common reason given is money, forced marriage and pregnancy are other key factors, despite most governments having targets for all children to complete secondary education, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aChild marriage, periods and poverty are among barriers keeping girls out of education.\u000a\u000a"We see time and time again that some of those programs fail, because they are not based on enough evidence on where to target the investment."\u000a\u000aPlan International's researchers have been interviewing girls and young women in Zimbabwe about their education.\u000a\u000a"A girl might be forced into marriage, then get pregnant, and therefore can't go to school," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aChild marriage, poverty and education are all linked, the interviews suggested. Some girls get married early for family financial reasons and then quit school, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000a"Basically you marry the girl off, and so she is less of a burden to the family."\u000a\u000aOthers in the case study quit school for financial reasons and then got married.\u000a\u000a"Whether it's poverty that forces the girl out of school, or marriage, is inconclusive, but it's clear that a combination of the prevalence of early marriage and poverty has a devastating impact on girls being able to complete secondary education," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aDue to a lack of job opportunities for young women without an education, some young girls in Zimbabwe have turned to prostitution, according to Plan.\u000a\u000aThe UN's Global Sustainable Development Goals include targets for improving gender equality, and Plan's report is a wake-up call to governments trying to bridge the gender gap.\u000a\u000aThis gap goes beyond education. The day-to-day realities of young boys and girls can be very different even within the family, according to a recent UNICEF report , with gender roles forming already early on and young girls bearing the greater burden of household chores.\u000a\u000aThis form of inequality in the household could be detrimental to girls' development and self-image, according to UNICEF's report.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are 1.1 billion girls in the world under the age of 18. More than half live in Asia and a quarter in Africa. While many regions will have fewer or as many girls by 2030, the number of girls in Africa will grow by 30 percent, according to UNICEF.\u000a\u000a"There are almost 2 billion children in the world under the age of 15, and most of those live in developing countries," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aIf African governments are to improve the prospects for young girls, they need to tackle the blind spots in gender data for the under-15s, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aBut why in the eyes of data do children typically become men and women at the age of 15?\u000a\u000aAlbrectsen doesn't know the answer. But placing women's reproductive age between 15 and 49 is prevalent worldwide, she says, even though the actual reproductive age may begin earlier.\u000a\u000a"Fundamentally you're saying they are just children, and they are legally not allowed to, or shouldn't be, having sex," she says.\u000a\u000a"But they are."\u000a\u000aThis may mean that data on pregnancies and sexual activity under the age of 15 is not gathered, she says.\u000a\u000aCan a data revolution make the world a more equal place?\u000a\u000aThe result? Governments may be unable to tackle issues such as teenage pregnancies.\u000a\u000a"If you are not measuring it, how can you deal with the consequences?"\u000a\u000aHowever, data collection is expensive, and it can be hard for governments to justify spending money on this, at the expense of other areas, especially in developing countries.\u000a\u000aBut Albrectsen says it would pay off.\u000a\u000a"Initial investment in getting the data systems up and running will ultimately save money through better targeting of [equality] programs in the long run, and have a bigger impact."

(Credit: KMOV)\u000a\u000aSt. Louis is now home to a first-of-its-kind clinic for transgender teens and kids. It's being administered by Washington University physicians based out of St. Louis Children's hospital.\u000a\u000aThe clinic aims to provide transgender children and teens with comprehensive health care including mental health resources, hormonal therapy, voice therapy, and reconstructive surgery. Washington University physicians have been taking care of transgender children and teens since 2009 and noticed the growing demand which sparked the push to establish a fully operating clinic.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, Washington University physicians had 74 transgender patients. From just January to May 2017, they've already seen 71 patients.\u000a\u000aThis clinic is a huge milestone for the Seay family this month, especially for 15-year-old Leslie.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes I identify as a girl, sometimes a boy, sometimes neither," said Leslie Seay.\u000a\u000aShe started exploring gender identity at 13-years-old, ultimately assigning to being gender fluid, which means she will always feel a mix of identifying between a boy and a girl.\u000a\u000a"I would really like to go on hormone blockers so that my voice doesn't get any more feminine and [no] more feminine features show up," said Seay.\u000a\u000aLeslie's identity is simple to her, so she needs a pediatrician who understands transgender health simply too.\u000a\u000a"Having support and acceptance is extremely important for this patient population," said Dr. Christopher Lewis, founder and physician of the Transgender clinic. "Transgender patients already deal with harassment and discrimination within the medical community and that is a barrier to them accessing care."\u000a\u000aLeslie's dad, Peter Seay, is thrilled to know his child is in safe, supportive care with an expertise in transgender health.\u000a\u000a"To find out that the gender center was opening this month was something we've been celebrating for a little while. We've been very excited about this," said Peter Seay. "There could not be a greater value, the gratitude will not stop."\u000a\u000aThe Transgender Center of Excellence opened the first week of August. They are already booked through mid-September with new patient appointments. It's the only clinic of its kind within a 250-mile radius.\u000a\u000aCopyright 2017 KMOV (Meredith Corporation).

aVVenezuela's bills keep piling up.\u000a\u000aThe country, which is engulfed in crisis, owes $251 million to bondholders on Monday.\u000a\u000aThe payment comes after a weekend in which the attorney general was kicked out of office, a controversial legislature took power, and the military thwarted an alleged attack by a small paramilitary group.\u000a\u000aExperts anticipate that Venezuela will make the payment to bondholders. But it has other payments coming due in the near future and could fall short on those if the economy continues to tailspin and the United States hits it with heavy sanctions.\u000a\u000a"This model is broken, and default is inevitable," says Siobhan Morden, an expert in Latin American bonds at Nomura Holdings. Oil "sanctions will probably arrive sooner and force default sooner."\u000a\u000aRelated: Venezuela quells 'paramilitary' attack at base; 2 dead\u000a\u000aPresident Trump slapped sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro following a July 30 vote that allowed Maduro to replace the opposition-held National Assembly with a new legislature filled with his supporters.\u000a\u000aMost countries around the world have dubbed the vote fraudulent and say the new Constituent Assembly is a sign of a dictatorship.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration says harsher sanctions could come if the political situation continues to deteriorate. The ousting of Attorney General Luisa Ortega, along with oppressive police tactics against protesters, quickly proved the new government went against the international community's demands to restore democracy.\u000a\u000aRelated: Venezuela's hyperinflation is jaw dropping.

They could make Venezuela's food and medical shortages even worse than they already are. They could also embolden Maduro's base.\u000a\u000aBeyond sanctions, Venezuela's economy continues to spiral our of control. The unofficial exchange rate that most Venezuelans use has more than doubled since late July. Inflation is expected to soar 720% this year and and over 2,000% next year, according to the International Monetary Fund.\u000a\u000aRelated: U.S. slaps sanctions on Venezuela President Maduro\u000a\u000aVenezuela owes about $5 billion to bondholders for the rest of this year, and it has only $10 billion in the bank.

aVTokyo (CNN) Demolition worker Yuichi Aoki's face creases up when he thinks about Japan's future.\u000a\u000a"I got asked to resign from my job in the IT industry when I was 55," Aoki, 59, tells CNN as he takes a break from tearing down a derelict house in Saitama, Japan.\u000a\u000a"Now I have to work into my sixties. I worry about how my children and their children will cope with an increasingly ageing population."\u000a\u000aConsiderably older than most of his co-workers, Aoki, a former IT worker is also one of only a handful of Japanese nationals employed by a Saitama-based demolition company owned by a Kurdish former asylum seeker.\u000a\u000aThe company, the majority of whose workers hail from Turkey, Iran and various parts of Africa, is somewhat unique in Japan, where foreign nationals make up just 1.6% of the country's overall population.\u000a\u000aOperated by Mehmet Yucel, 28, the company is part of a growing and largely unregulated grassroots economy, that is helping to ease Japan's labor shortage in so-called undesirable sectors such as demolition and construction.\u000a\u000aSince founding the company in 2016, Yucel says he has received daily calls from immigrants in search of work -- some with the right to work legally and others without.\u000a\u000a"Japan is turning a blind eye to these workers because it needs them, but it won't come up with a proper long-term strategy for them," says Yucel, whose company is located on the fringes of the Japanese capital.\u000a\u000aYucel came to Japan 12 years ago to escape ethnic conflict. Now married to a Japanese woman, he has permanent residency status.\u000a\u000aMehmet Yucel receives calls from both asylum seekers and Japanese people looking for work in Japan.\u000a\u000aPart of a increasing group of 2.23 million legal immigrants, Yucel considers himself one of the lucky ones. Though Japan is the fourth-largest donor to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), in 2016, it accepted just 28 refugees from a total of 10,901 applicants.\u000a\u000aGraying population\u000a\u000aJapan is considered a "super-aged" nation , where more than 20% of the population is over 65 and the birth rate has reached record lows.\u000a\u000aBy 2060, the country's population is expected to plummet by more than 40 million from 2010, to 86.74 million people, according to a projection by the Japanese Health Ministry. With fewer workers paying taxes to support a growing silver population in need of pensions and healthcare services, Japan's economy is facing an unprecedented challenge.\u000a\u000aThis year, labor shortages were the highest they'd been in 40 years , and analysts predict rising shortages in the years ahead.\u000a\u000aCalling Japan's shrinking population an "incentive" as opposed to a "burden," Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has attempted to encourage more senior citizens and women to join the workforce. Yet outside observers argue that large-scale immigration would provide a more obvious fix to Japan's labor crisis and demographic issues.\u000a\u000aBut there appears little appetite among the country's political class to increase levels of immigration, however important the need.\u000a\u000aIn 2005, the then-director of the Tokyo Immigration Bureau Hidenori Sakanaka, promoted a plan where Japan would accept 10 million immigrants over a 50-year period. Few people supported the idea and it was later dropped.\u000a\u000a"Japan doesn't have an immigration policy -- this is something that politicians stress," Chris Burgess, a migration researcher and lecturer of Japan studies at Tsuda Juku University in Tokyo, tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"Many people in Japan believe that the country's peace and harmony is based on it being a homogenous country where there are few foreigners," says Burgess. "That kind of thinking pervades a lot of aspects of society and underlies the no immigration principle."\u000a\u000aDoor is closed\u000a\u000aJapan's attitude to the outside world is nothing new, and the country has a history of being closed off from foreign influence.\u000a\u000aDuring a period of isolation between 1641 to 1853, Japan barred its nationals from leaving and foreigners from entering. Only traders from China and the Netherlands were allowed at the port of Nagasaki on Japan's southernmost island of Kyushu.\u000a\u000aKurdish demolition workers survey a derelict building in Saitama, Japan.\u000a\u000aNor did Japan rely on foreign labor during its era of rapid economic growth between 1955 and 1973.\u000a\u000aOnly in the late 1980s, with the threat of a growing labor shortage, did the country debate the possibility of accepting foreign workers, according to Atsushi Kondo, a law professor and immigration expert at Meiji University.\u000a\u000aSince 1988, the Ministry of Labor has welcomed a small number of foreigners with high skills and qualifications. In the 1990s, the country began to encourage the return of nikkeijin (people of Japanese descent) to the country, under a special visa program.\u000a\u000aBut the doors remain closed to low-skilled workers.\u000a\u000aThough Abe has mentioned the need for "foreign technicians" to construct buildings for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics , he stressed that this should not be misunderstood as an implementation of an immigration policy at an economic meeting held with his cabinet in April 2014.\u000a\u000aThe "technical trainee" program is a heavily criticized government program where foreign workers -- predominantly from China and Southeast Asia -- travel to Japan to work in the agriculture and manufacturing industries purportedly to acquire skills to bring back to their respective countries. Experts argue, however, that this program has led to the exploitation of some, and forced others to depend on loopholes in the system.\u000a\u000a'Smoke and mirrors'\u000a\u000aIn a small office in northeast Tokyo, Ippei Torii, who has fought for migrant rights for the better part of two decades, is exasperated. He maintains that Japan's labor shortages could be solved if there was an actual visa for manual laborers seeking to come Japan.\u000a\u000aTorii, the director of nonprofit organization, Solidarity Network with Migrants Japan (SNMJ) tells CNN that instead of creating a long-term immigration strategy that would allow low-skilled workers to have access to the same rights as Japanese citizens, the government has continuously opted for "back door" measures that allow low-skilled foreign workers into Japan on a temporary basis.\u000a\u000aTorii slammed the technical trainee program, asserting that foreign workers ended up taking menial jobs as opposed to learning skills they could take back to their respective countries. He criticized another measure that allows foreign students in Japan to work up to 28 hours part time.\u000a\u000a"These programs are all just smoke and mirrors," says Torii.\u000a\u000aA spokesman from Japan's Ministry of Justice, however, refuted Torii's claim.\u000a\u000a"It's not true that we use backdoor policies and tolerate illegal immigration to help solve the labor shortage," he tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"The asylum seeker's application status is misused by illegal immigrants and we believe that most of the applicants aren't really asylum seekers. That delays the process for real asylum seekers," he says.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, Japan saw a 44% increase in asylum applicants with Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines being the top three countries of origin.\u000a\u000aA 2010 legal revision has led to the rise of economic migrants posing as asylum seekers, according to Takizawa Saburo, an expert on refugee policy and a member of the Ministry of Justice Immigration Policy Discussion Panel.\u000a\u000a"As Japan doesn't accept unskilled laborers, many people from countries in Southeast Asia have no way of coming to Japan to work, except through the asylum route," Saburo tells CNN.\u000a\u000aThe 2010 legal revision allows foreigners with valid visa statuses who apply for asylum to start working six months after their application is submitted. While it allows asylum seekers waiting for their cases' outcome to regain a sense of normalcy and support themselves, it doesn't allow those without a valid visas status who apply for asylum to work.\u000a\u000a"When this loophole in the law was discovered, it spread through word of mouth and is well-known nowadays," says Saburo.\u000a\u000aCaught in the system\u000a\u000aIn May of this year, around 20 asylum seekers detained at the Tokyo Regional Immigration Bureau staged a rare two-week hunger strike.\u000a\u000aFrustrated by a bureaucratic system that is often slow to process cases, the protesters demanded an end to repeated detentions and a more viable path to working visas.\u000a\u000aYuki Moriya, a UNHCR Japan spokeswoman, tells CNN the current issue was "really a chicken-and-egg problem."\u000a\u000a"While the numbers of asylum seekers have increased, the numbers of immigration officials hasn't, and that's led to a real delay in processing all these cases. It's hard for both parties," she says.\u000a\u000aNurettin, 25, is a Kurdish asylum seeker who has lived in Japan for the past five years.\u000a\u000aAt Yucel's demolition site, 25-year-old Kurdish asylum seeker Nurettin, knows what it's like to be caught in the system.\u000a\u000aHe arrived in Japan in 2012, fleeing conflict in southeast Turkey, and has spent two stints in an immigration detention center. He is waiting for his asylum case to be processed.\u000a\u000aNurettin has no legal right to work, but he can depend on the grassroots support of men like Yucel, and on a larger Saitama-Tokyo based community of around 1,400 Kurdish migrants to get by. He's had no difficulty working alongside his Japanese colleagues despite the language barriers.\u000a\u000a"We might have different beliefs and ideologies, but when we're at work it doesn't matter, we just get the job done," Nurettin says.\u000a\u000a"I'd be happy to pay taxes to the state if I could receive more support in return, but I don't see that happening anytime soon."\u000a\u000aTo his side, Aoki nods in agreement.\u000a\u000a"Young people in Japan don't want to do demolition work, so it's helpful to (Japanese) society that foreign workers want to do this, and they should get support from the state in return," Aoki says.\u000a\u000a"Japan really needs to get over its identity as a homogenous nation. If the country remains closed off, the future is uncertain."

aV(CNN) Six months into his presidency, Donald Trump's overall approval rating stands at its lowest point in CNN polling, while three-quarters of Americans say they can't trust most of what they hear from the White House.\u000a\u000aOverall, 38% say they approve of Trump's handling of the presidency, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS , with 56% saying they disapprove. Just one other newly-elected president has held an approval rating below 50% at this point in his presidency since modern polling began: Bill Clinton, whose approval rating stood at 44% at this point in 1993.\u000a\u000aEnthusiasm breaks against Trump by a 2-to-1 margin. Nearly half in the new poll say they strongly disapprove of Trump's handling of the job (47%), while just a quarter say they feel strongly positive about Trump's performance (24%).\u000a\u000aThose numbers have soured in recent months, particularly among Trump's core supporters. Among Republicans, strong approval has dropped from 73% in February to 59% now. Among whites who do not have college degrees, a core component of Trump's base, just 35% strongly approve, down 12 points since February. At the same time, strong disapproval among Democrats has held steady around 80%.\u000a\u000aOn top issues, Trump's approval ratings largely tilt negative. And perceptions of the President as someone who will bring change are fading. Just 43% say Trump can "bring the kind of change the country needs," down from 48% in April, and the share who say he "can manage the government effectively" now stands at 39%, down from 44% in April.\u000a\u000aThe poll finds widespread doubts about the veracity of information coming from the White House. Only a quarter of Americans (24%) say they trust all or most of what they hear in official communications from the White House, while more (30%) say they trust "nothing at all" that they hear from the President's office. (Even among Republicans, only about half say they can trust most of what they hear from the White House.)\u000a\u000aTrump's acumen as a manager and ability to bring change were the brightest spots for the President in polling conducted before he took office. But cracks in Trump's base of support are evident in the results on those questions now.\u000a\u000aAmong Republicans and independents who lean Republican, the share saying Trump can manage the government effectively has dipped 10 points since April's CNN/ORC poll. Among whites without a college degree, just 50% see Trump as an effective manager. Those non-college whites are also less likely to see Trump as a change agent, 58% say so now, down from 64% in April.\u000a\u000aStill, these tepid ratings come even as most Americans feel things in the country are going well (53% say so), a number that's held roughly steady since April.\u000a\u000aThat positive feeling hasn't boosted Trump's ratings on the issues, however. He gets a mixed 48% approve to 47% disapprove rating on national security, and Americans are also divided on his handling of the economy (47% disapprove to 45% approve). On just about every other issue tested, majorities disapprove of Trump's work, including on health care policy (62%), foreign affairs (61%), immigration (55%) and helping the middle class (54%). Nearly half (48%) disapprove of his handling of taxes while just 34% approve.\u000a\u000aLooking back over the first 200 days of Trump's time in office, just 36% say they consider it a success, and 59% consider it a failure. Both Barack Obama and George W. Bush were viewed as successful at this stage of their presidency by most Americans (56% for Bush, 51% for Obama).\u000a\u000aFurther, 62% overall say that Trump's statements and actions since taking office have made them less confident in his ability to be president. Half of whites without college degrees share that view.\u000a\u000aThe day-to-day operations of the executive branch appear to be chipping away at confidence in Trump and his management style. Most Americans (59%) say Trump hasn't paid enough attention to the country's most important problems. About the same number say his management style and the high rate of turnover in the West Wing hurts the administration's ability to be effective (58%). Slightly more say Trump has done a poor job assembling a team of top advisers to work in the White House (62%, up from 56% saying so in April).\u000a\u000aPersonal praise for the President is scarce, just 30% say they admire the President, and 34% say they are proud to have him as president. A majority (55%) say he has lowered the stature of the office of the president. Six in 10 don't consider Trump honest and trustworthy.\u000a\u000aLooking more deeply at Trump's tweets: About 7 in 10 agree with the President's assessment that they allow him to communicate directly with his supporters without a media filter, but fewer see other positives in his use of the social media service.\u000a\u000aA majority (52%) say his tweets are not an effective way for him to share his views on important issues, and 72% say they do not send the right message to other world leaders.\u000a\u000aSeven in 10 say they too often seem to be in response to TV news the President may have seen, and 71% that they are a risky way for a president to communicate. Six in 10 say they are easy to misunderstand, 63% that they too often turn out to be misleading.\u000a\u000aFew Americans report having personally shared or responded to a tweet from Trump, just 10% say they've done that on Twitter or other social media platforms.\u000a\u000aThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS by telephone August 3 through 6 among a random national sample of 1,018 adults. The margin of sampling error for results among the full sample is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is larger for subgroups.

aVNew CNN Special Report Premieres Monday, August 7 at 9:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S. and CNN International\u000a\u000aDonald Trump\u2019s victory on Nov. 8, 2016, shocked the American political establishment. WHY TRUMP WON, tells the story of the signals many missed, but were there all along. Fareed Zakaria points to himself \u2013 \u201cI got it wrong,\u201d he says \u2013 as he explores the cultural forces that propelled Trump towards his historic presidential win in a new CNN Special Report, WHY TRUMP WON, that will premiere Monday, Aug. 7 at 9:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S. and CNN International.\u000a\u000aWHY TRUMP WON shows how Trump has worked towards closing the ultimate deal \u2013 winning the White House \u2013 for decades. Trump attended his first Republican National convention in 1988 and competed for the Reform Party nomination in 1999. And, through print ads, television interviews, and social media, Trump has carefully tailored his political messages over the years and ultimately persuaded millions to join his powerful political army.\u000a\u000aIn WHY TRUMP WON, Zakaria reports on families falling apart: depression, drugs, desperation, and finally resentment taking root in some American communities, supplanting what had been flourishing middle class optimism. Under a veneer of rosy 2016 stock market and jobs statistics, was a decades-long crumbling of middle class culture and a long-simmering loss of faith in institutions.\u000a\u000aDavid Betras, chairman of Ohio\u2019s Mahoning County Democratic Party, is frustrated that \u201ca man who [uses] gold-plated toilets\u201d became the political bannerman for middle America, but Betras feels Hillary Clinton and the Democrats lost as definitively as Donald Trump won in 2016. Betras says working class people in Mahoning felt Democrats, the \u201cparty of the people,\u201d had left them. And, they channeled their frustrations into electoral victories last year for Donald Trump that were decisive in what some described as an earthquake of an election. FULL POST

aVToday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union , Donald Trump Jr., Son of Donald J. Trump joins anchor, Jake Tapper to discuss repercussions of the recent DNC e-mail leak, Roger Ailes stepping down, the possibility of running for Mayor of New York and more.\u000a\u000aMANDATORY CREDIT: CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\u000a\u000aTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\u000a\u000aDonald Trump Jr. on how Mook responded to DNC email leak: [TAPPER] So, I don't know if you were hearing earlier, but Robby Mook, the campaign manager for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I asked him about the DNC leak.And he suggested that experts are saying that Russians were behind both the leak - the hacking of the DNC e-mails and their release. He seemed to be suggesting that this is part of a plot to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. Your response?[TRUMP JR] Well, it just goes to show you their exact moral compass. I mean, they will say anything to be able to win this. I mean, this is time and time again, lie after lie. You notice he won't say, well, I say this. We hear experts. You know, here\u2019s (INAUDIBLE) at home once said that this is what's happening with the Russians. It's disgusting. It's so phony. I watched him bumble through the interview, I was able to hear it on audio a little bit. I mean, I can't think of bigger lies, but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win.You hear it with the DNC where they're leaking emails about Bernie Sanders and his Jewish heritage, to be able to try to destroy him in the south. It's a rigged system. It's disgusting and the people who should be fed up because when I heard it I certainly was.[TAPPER] President Obama \u2013There\u2019s nothing wrong with a fair fight, Jake. I don't mind a fair fight, but these lies and the perpetuating of that kind of nonsense to try, you know, gain some political capital is just outrageous and he should be ashamed of himself. If a Republican did that\u2026[TAPPER] President Obama \u2013[TRUMP JR]: \u2026 they would be calling for people to bring out the electric chair.\u000a\u000aDonald Trump Jr. on the possibility of Roger Ailes joining the campaign: [TAPPER] Your father raised the prospect of bringing on Roger Ailes the former chairman and CEO of FOX News and the idea being Mr. Trump said something along the lines of people are talking about maybe he would run my campaign. Is that actually in play, roger Ailes coming on board and running the campaign? [TRUMP JR.] Not that I\u2019m aware of. I mean, I know they are friends and have a long-term relationship but I\u2019m happy with the work that Paul Manafort is doing, I think our team is really coming into place and swing, it's been exciting to be a fly on the wall watching a lot of this stuff go down. Because - you know, again, we're trying to give a voice to the people who have been forgotten and I think the campaign is doing a wonderful job of that.\u000a\u000aFULL POST

aVRepublicans are stepping up their efforts to remove Consumer Financial Protection Bureau chief Richard Cordray from office.\u000a\u000aUnder current law, President Trump does not have the power to remove Cordray from office except for cause, although that provision itself is being challenged in courts. On Friday, a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee issued the results of an investigation which recommended that Cordray be found in contempt of Congress, charging that he and the agency had failed to comply with a committee investigation into its rulemaking process.\u000a\u000aRelated: Americans paid $15 billion in overdraft fees last year, CFPB says\u000a\u000aGiven that Republicans control the House, it appears likely that the effort to find him in contempt will pass now that there's a formal recommendation to do so. And such a finding may give Trump grounds to remove Cordray.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, CFPB spokeswoman Jen Howard said the consumer agency has been " working diligently to comply with the Committee's oversight on a number of fronts."\u000a\u000aShe said the agency has "produced thousands of pages of documents thus far, and by next week ... We will continue our efforts to understand how we can respond to the Committee in a satisfactory manner."\u000a\u000aThe head of the committee, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, was already on record at a hearing in April urging President Trump to remove Cordray.\u000a\u000a"I believe the president is clearly justified in dismissing you and I call upon the president...to do just that, and to do it immediately," said Hensarling said to Cordray at a hearing in April.\u000a\u000aRelated: It just got easier to sue your bank and credit card company\u000a\u000aCordray was attorney general of Ohio before he was tapped to become the first head the CFPB by President Obama in 2012. It is widely believed he is preparing to run for governor of Ohio next year. Current Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican, is barred by term limits from running for reelection. Cordray's term at CFPB runs for another year, but if he wants to make a run for governor, he would have to resign before then to launch his campaign.\u000a\u000aThe Dodd-Frank legislation that created the CFPB and imposed a number of new regulations on the financial sector has long been under attack by Republicans and the banking industry.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration's proposal to reform Dodd-Frank specifically calls for the president to have the power to remove the head of the agency at will.\u000a\u000a"The CFPB was created to pursue an important mission, but its unaccountable structure and unduly broad regulatory powers have led to predictable regulatory abuses and excesses," said Treasury's reform proposal.

aVYour grocery store's tomatoes may have a new friend aiding their development: artificial intelligence.\u000a\u000aNatureSweet, which grows tomatoes on six farms in the United States and Mexico, is using artificial intelligence to better control pests and diseases in its greenhouses.\u000a\u000aThe technology, developed by the Israeli digital farming company Prospera, has already improved harvests and reduced labor costs. NatureSweet began testing the technology almost a year ago at one of its farms in Arizona. It plans to roll the tech out to all of its locations soon.\u000a\u000aAdrian Almeida, chief innovation officer at NatureSweet, believes artificial intelligence will eventually improve his greenhouses tomato yields by 20%.\u000a\u000aRelated: How farmers use digital agriculture to grow more crops\u000a\u000a"It'll be better for the environment and for the customer," Almeida said.\u000a\u000aFarms are increasingly using technology to grow crops, from task-tracking systems that monitor watering and seeding to drones that capture aerial images.\u000a\u000aSo far, NatureSweet's weekly harvests have grown 2% to 4%. This may seem modest, but the results makes a big difference when growing millions of pounds of tomatoes a year.\u000a\u000aTo use the method, NatureSweet installed 10 cameras in greenhouse ceilings. The cameras continuously take photos of the crops below. Prospera's software has been trained to recognize trouble, such as insect infestations or dying plants.\u000a\u000aPreviously, some of NatureSweet's 8,000 employees were tasked with walking through the greenhouses to identify struggling plants. But the process was slow and expensive. NatureSweet did this only once a week.\u000a\u000aThe cameras from Prospera monitor the plants 24/7 and provide instant feedback.\u000a\u000aProspera's founder Daniel Koppel previously researched how to predict crop yields from satellite photos -- insights that can be used to trade commodities on Wall Street. Instead, he built his own business, figuring it would have a greater global impact.\u000a\u000aNatureSweet has also experimented with using the cameras to forecast when plants are ready to be harvested.\u000a\u000aAlthough Almeida said that aspect of the technology is still a work in progress, improved efficiency is apparent. He estimated NatureSweet's headcount would have to grow by 4% without it.\u000a\u000aThe company announced this week it raised $15 million from investors such as Qualcomm Ventures and Cisco Investments to fund expansion. Prospera plans to track more crops, including peppers and potatoes, as well as monitor plants outside greenhouses.

aV(CNN) All the signs suggest that 2018 is going to be a very good year for Democrats.\u000a\u000aMidterm elections are historically terrible for the president's party. In 18 of the last 20 midterm elections, the president's party has lost seats. In those 18 elections, the average seat loss is 33. Those numbers are even more daunting for presidents under 50% job approval -- as Donald Trump is right now. Since 1946, the average seat loss in the House in that situation is 36 seats\u000a\u000aStates up for re-election -- Blue: Democratic. Red: Republican. Yellow: Independent.\u000a\u000aBut before Democrats get too delirious about the election to come, they should read this paragraph from David Wasserman's terrific analysis of the 2018 election on FiveThirtyEight\u000a\u000a"Even if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points \u2014 a pretty good midterm by historical standards \u2014 they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats."\u000a\u000aThat's absolutely stunning. And reflective of the advantages Republicans have going into 2018 -- one, in the House, built on having largely controlled the 2010 redistricting process, and the other, in the Senate, based on how great the 2006 and 2012 elections were for Democrats.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVThe 33-year-old Georgia resident doesn't currently get her health insurance through the exchanges, although she has in the past, nor is she on Medicaid. Both could be impacted by the Republican legislation proposed as a replacement to Obamacare.\u000a\u000aStill, she is watching that legislation closely because she, like 117 million Americans, has a chronic condition. It has no cure and requires expensive care. She worries about whether her husband's job will still come with benefits and whether they'll be able to avoid penalties by maintaining consistent coverage.\u000a\u000aTo Daniel, the health care debate is not political, it's personal.\u000a\u000aDaniel has Crohn's disease, which is inflammation of her GI tract. Sometimes she feels fine and can go about her day as if she is well. Other times, the condition leaves her in such pain and with so little energy, she is confined to bed for days at a time. She's had bouts when she can't swallow. Sometimes her body rejects all food. Once, when she was in college, she spent an entire weekend on the bathroom floor, too sick to eat, drink or move, she said.\u000a\u000aIt's been rough, particularly since she is a busy mother with two young children who demand a lot of her time.\u000a\u000a"It's been really hard, especially this year, on my kids," Daniel said. "They can't comprehend what's really going on with me. They just know that I'm sick. Thankfully, they're really great kids, and I have a lot of friends and a lot of family who have volunteered to help."\u000a\u000aShe said the help comes in handy when she gets her treatments. Her doctors have had her try nearly every medication that's out there. She's also had to have surgery to remove part of her colon. None of it worked permanently, so her doctors put her on Remicade. The drug comes in the form of an infusion that she must get at a hospital that's a 40-minute drive away. She gets it every few weeks. Without insurance, the drug would cost about $20,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe good news is, it seems to be working.\u000a\u000a"This type of medicine is a lifetime commitment," she said. That means she can't afford to go without insurance if she wants to stay well.\u000a\u000aHer husband, Justin, rarely gets sick, she said, so he might be able to get away without insurance, but her daughter may also have an autoimmune disease, so the family has to keep its coverage, which they get through his work.\u000a\u000aThe absolute need for insurance is something that keeps Daniel focused on what is going on with the GOP health care bill.\u000a\u000a"What are they going to do for people like me who have chronic illness?" she asked. "There is a little bit of nervousness here."\u000a\u000aThe current GOP bill does not bring health care back to the way it was before Obamacare.\u000a\u000aBefore the Affordable Care Act, if you shopped for a plan on the individual market, companies often wouldn't sell a plan to someone who had a chronic or pre-existing condition. There were also lifetime caps on how much a company would spend on your care. With an expensive drug like Remicade, Daniel could have easily maxed out a policy in the old system.\u000a\u000aObamacare eliminated lifetime caps and made it so insurance companies couldn't discriminate against you if you had a pre-existing condition. The current bills do not change either issue, but the bills do incentivize people to have continuous coverage. And large employers would no longer be required to offer affordable insurance to their employees, like they do now.\u000a\u000aThat means if the bills become law and her husband's company decides to drop its benefits, Daniel could lose her insurance. And although the family has done everything in its power to keep coverage, she said, she could easily see when there could be a gap.\u000a\u000aThat nearly happened a few years ago, when her husband lost his job. For the three months he was out of work, the family went on COBRA, which is not subsidized. It cost $900 a month. It was such a steep expense, Daniel said, they had to ask family members to help them cover their bills. Without generous family, they could have taken their chances and skipped insurance coverage to keep afloat financially.\u000a\u000aBut skipping coverage would be an even tougher decision if they faced another job loss. With the proposed GOP health care plan in place, they could face a 30% penalty if they bought a plan on the individual market for the rest of that year.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aDaniel said she hopes, whatever Obamacare replacement goes into law, that she and others with chronic conditions will be OK. Until then, she'll be thinking constantly about what could happen to her insurance.\u000a\u000a"I'm nervous not knowing the future," Daniel said. "You never know how much you're going to end up with that you're responsible for. You never know how bad it's going to get."

aV× Montgomery County woman accused of stealing nearly $1 million from company payroll\u000a\u000aDOUGLASVILLE, Montgomery County \u2014 A 31-year-old Douglasville woman accused of stealing nearly $1 million from her employer is facing charges of theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property and identity theft, according to the Montgomery County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u000a\u000aChristine Cushman was an employee of HighPoint Solutions when a bank officer notified the company\u2019s payroll department that suspicious direct deposits of significant size \u2014 totaling $919,301 \u2014 had been sent to her personal account, according to Montgomery County DA Kevin R. Steele.\u000a\u000aThe company\u2019s chief financial officer reported the suspected theft to East Norriton Township Det. Anthony Caso on July 4. The ensuing investigation revealed that Cushman, director of human resources at HighPoint Solutions at the time, was issuing fraudulent payroll checks in the names of four former subcontractors who no longer did business with the company. There were reportedly 45 suspicious deposits made to Cushman\u2019s personal account between May 5 and June 15, police say.\u000a\u000aCushman was arrested and arraigned before Magisterial District Judge Ester J. Casillo on Aug. 2, 2017, who set bail at $10,000. She posted bail and was released.\u000a\u000aA preliminary hearing is scheduled for 10:15 a.m., Aug. 22, 2017, in front of Judge Casillo. The case will be prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney Christopher Daniels of the Economic Crimes Unit.\u000a\u000a\u201cNearly $1 million was stolen from this company by a senior-level, trusted employee. This breach of trust is something that needs to be guarded against by other companies,\u201d said Steele in a press release announcing the arrest. \u201cUnfortunately, corporate theft is all too prevalent and requires a system of checks and balances within the corporate system to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d

aVHow can you enjoy fine wine by the glass without having the rest of the bottle turn to vinegar?\u000a\u000aThat was the challenge Greg Lambrecht set out to solve when his wife gave up alcohol while pregnant.\u000a\u000aFrustrated by opening bottles of wine that would then go to waste, he invented Coravin -- a device that allows you to pour a glass without removing the cork.\u000a\u000aIt works like this: A thin, hollow needle is pushed through the cork to inject argon gas into the bottle. The gas pressure forces wine back up through the same needle and into the glass, while preventing the rest of the bottle from oxidizing. When the needle is withdrawn, the cork reseals.\u000a\u000aLambrecht's inspiration for Coravin came from medicine. After studying nuclear engineering at MIT, he went into medical engineering after working at Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).\u000a\u000aHis first start up -- Intrinsic Therapeutics -- makes technology for spine implants and cancer treatments.\u000a\u000a"I thought - in medicine we go through things all the time with needles and don't damage them," he said.\u000a\u000a"My dad is diabetic, he has an insulin bottle, he sticks his needle through, he drives in the insulin. Maybe I can go through this cork and try to suck out wine like my dad does with insulin?"\u000a\u000aCoravin is available in 50 countries for $299, or $199 depending on how slick you want your model. The argon capsules cost $11 each and need replacing after 15 glasses of wine.\u000a\u000aThat begins to add up. The cost of pouring six glasses would add more than $4 to the price of a bottle.\u000a\u000aBut the serial entrepreneur rejects suggestions that Coravin is a luxury product.\u000a\u000a"I use Coravin even on a $10 bottle of wine. It's about drinking the amount I want and having that wine in the perfect shape every time I taste it," Lambrecht said.\u000a\u000aCoravin's biggest markets are in the U.S., U.K., and France but it's hoping to grow in China and Japan as well as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.\u000a\u000aThe company hired Frédéric Lévy, former president of Nespresso North America, as CEO in 2015 to lead its expansion.

aVBrooklyn, New York (CNN) Behind Andre Rozier's bright smile is an iron will to win.\u000a\u000a"I don't like to lose," the champion boxing trainer says. "I don't like my fighters to lose."\u000a\u000aHis brusque commands to "keep moving" and "don't fold up" echo through his basement gym in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes you have to punish yourself to achieve maximum success," the New York native explains.\u000a\u000aIt is clear Rozier knows what he wants in the ring.

But when he went for the physical, he received disturbing news.\u000a\u000a"I was told that I have high blood pressure," he recalls, "... and I said to myself 'what are you talking about?'"\u000a\u000aDoctors suggested Rozier go for a walk and retake the test.\u000a\u000a"I came back the next day and was told the same thing."\u000a\u000aRozier was stripped of his boxing credentials and, ultimately, his dreams of becoming a world-class fighter. Unable to compete, he hung up his gloves.\u000a\u000a"At that point, I was like, you know what, this is it. I'm finished."\u000a\u000aYears later, an eager young boxer pulled a reluctant Rozier back into the sport.\u000a\u000a"I met a young man in my apartment complex who kept asking me to take him to the gym," the trainer explains. "And I would say 'no, I don't have time for it.' "\u000a\u000aBut the relentless boxer continued to pester Rozier to train him.\u000a\u000a"He broke my shell," the corner man says with a laugh. "I wanted to break him."\u000a\u000aStepping back inside the ring\u000a\u000aAfter stepping inside the ring with the young boxer, Rozier says "a new fire was lit" within him.

aV(CNN) For a man who glides so quickly and effortlessly through the water it seems perverse to think of Michael Phelps confining himself to one room for four straight days.\u000a\u000aSuch were the depths of a spiral that would threaten to cripple the comeback of a man widely regarded as one of the greatest sportsmen of all time.\u000a\u000aHis self imprisonment followed a second charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, in September 2014, that led to a six-month suspension by USA Swimming.\u000a\u000aIf swimming is one of the most individual sports there is, it turns out that behind the world's greatest Olympian is a support network of family and friends. They were key to Phelps summoning the courage to seek help.\u000a\u000a"I'm so thankful for the support that I have," Phelps told CNN in an emotional interview with Coy Wire, conducted earlier this year.\u000a\u000a"Those days when I was sitting in my room, where I didn't move for four days, I had the support team of my friends and my closest family members and everybody who was there -- my house was like a revolving door.\u000a\u000a"They were people who matter the most to me and were there because they truly care about me. I was like, 'That was a really dumb idea, let's figure this out.'"\u000a\u000aRock bottom\u000a\u000aMany would have thought Phelps had it all at the time he reached rock bottom in 2014: a haul of Olympic medals some countries would have proud of, prodigious talent in the pool, plus adulation from fans around the world.\u000a\u000aBut, after retiring from the pool after London 2012, his self-worth deserted him. He lost purpose and direction.\u000a\u000aPhelps describes the darkness that enveloped him as a "time bomb waiting to go off." It was during this period he even contemplated suicide.\u000a\u000aAsked what has scared him most in his life, he replied: "I would probably say when I didn't want to be alive anymore. At that point, I thought 'The best thing to do is just not to be here.'\u000a\u000a"I've been known to not always make the best decisions. It's put me into interesting and tough spots at times."\u000a\u000aIf it took determination and talent for Phelps to win all those gold medals, it also took courage to admit he needed to seek help.\u000a\u000a"I think it took those spots for me to be able to learn exactly what's going on and what I needed to change. At that time I just knew I needed help and I knew I needed to change something in my life.\u000a\u000a"I was kind of in a lost place so we did some research on what we could do and I went to treatment for a couple of weeks and just basically rebuilt myself. They kind of tore me down and built me back up and I went through some things that I never wanted to go through before."\u000a\u000aMental health ambassador\u000a\u000aSpeaking out marked the turning point for Phelps and part of his post-swimming career is dedicated to encouraging others, especially children, do the same.\u000a\u000aHe and fellow Olympian Allison Schmitt were ambassadors for the National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day in May.\u000a\u000aPhelps relays the story of William, a young boy who lost his father and regularly attends the Boys & Girls Club program in Tennessee -- part of the swimmer's foundation -- whom he has helped to recognize different emotions and encouraged to be open about them.\u000a\u000a"As an American it's (seen as) weakness when you ask for help and in our society, it's just not what you do," he said. "It took me a while to get to that point where it's OK to ask somebody for help.\u000a\u000a"When I went to treatment I didn't want to talk to anybody, I didn't open up and two or three days into it I was like 'I'm here for 45 days, I might as well do this.'\u000a\u000a"I might as well just attack it. I just looked at it as another challenge for me to get better. I just took full advantage of it and dove in and this is where we are today."\u000a\u000aTriumphant Rio return\u000a\u000aWhere we are today is with Phelps' legacy enhanced and emboldened by a haul of five Olympic gold medals at Rio 2016 to take his overall tally to an incomparable 23.\u000a\u000aThe fact the Baltimore-born star had been retired for two years before deciding to compete in Brazil, at the age of 31, makes it even more remarkable.\u000a\u000aRehab done and focus regained, he also rediscovered his zest for competition, and got himself in better shape than he ever had before.\u000a\u000aThe hunger for training that had, by his own admission, dissipated in the lead up to London 2012 -- an event in which he still claimed six medals, four of them gold -- returned with a vengeance.\u000a\u000a"I knew I had to get myself in the best physical shape I could, especially at the age of 31," he said. "For me that was eating or sleeping right, doing every little ABC to make sure I was as prepared for every single workout as I could.\u000a\u000a"Eating became a job. There are days when you're tired and you don't want to eat but you have to, you're forcing yourself to eat and it was just painful.\u000a\u000a"I got down to four-and-a-half percent body fat. I mean, it's basically like skating on thin ice -- any lower than that is unhealthy.\u000a\u000a"Holy hell, four-and-a-half percent was just ridiculous. I don't think I'll ever get back to that again."\u000a\u000aThe perfectionist\u000a\u000aIn what was his fourth Olympics, Phelps entered six events in Rio and won five of them.\u000a\u000aHis tally of 28 medals sets him apart as the most decorated athlete of all time -- a full 10 clear of former Russian gymnast Larisa Latynina.\u000a\u000aAnd though his triumphant return thrilled the sports-loving public across the globe, the perfectionist in Phelps can still, incredibly, pick a few holes in his performance.\u000a\u000a"The 200 meter (butterfly) was something that I wanted back, I wanted to retire with that race with that gold medal," he said.\u000a\u000a"I'm always hard on myself. I mean I saw the replay of the 200m (individual medley) this morning and they're like 'It was amazing' and I was like, 'Yeah, still didn't break the world record.'\u000a\u000a"That was that was one thing I wanted -- I wanted to break one more world record. I wanted to go out with 40 world records and that would have been awesome. But you know what, to four-peat that race is pretty awesome."\u000a\u000aAwesome is a fitting word to sum up Phelps' career and perhaps the enormity of what he has achieved will only sink in as the years go by.\u000a\u000a"It's been a fun career and now I get to kind of go back and look at everything that I did, because I never had that," he explained.\u000a\u000a"I was always going from one thing to the next and the next the next. And now I finally get to look at the medals and realize what happened in the 20-plus years that I was swimming."

aV(CNN) Even as the White House this week firmly insists President Donald Trump is determined to seek a second term, a new analysis of polling data shows that he's caught in a three-way political squeeze in the states that tipped the 2016 presidential race, and will likely decide the 2020 contest.\u000a\u000aOn one front, Trump faces undiminished resistance from minority voters, who opposed him in preponderant numbers last year. On the second, he is confronting a consistent -- and, in many states, precipitous -- decline in support from white-collar white voters, who expressed much more skepticism about him last fall than GOP presidential candidates usually face. From the third direction, Trump's support among working-class whites, while still robust, is receding from its historically elevated peak back toward a level more typical for Republican presidential candidates -- especially in the pivotal Rust Belt states that sealed his victory.\u000a\u000aThese are among the key conclusions from a new analysis of the state-by-state Trump approval ratings released recently by the Gallup Organization. Those results, based on interviews with 81,155 adults in Gallup nightly tracking polls from January 20 through June 30, found that Trump's overall approval rating had fallen below 50 percent in 33 of the 50 states.\u000a\u000aExtending beyond those reported results, Gallup provided me previously unpublished findings that tracked Trump's approval rating in key swing states among three demographic groups: non-whites, whites with at least a four-year college degree, and whites without a four-year degree.\u000a\u000aMuch, of course, will happen that could reshape the landscape between now and the next presidential election, which the White House this weekend insisted Trump plans to contest amid reports that Vice President Mike Pence and other possible contenders are preparing for the possibility the President might not run.\u000a\u000aBut these poll results challenge the conclusion that Trump's political base has remained impregnable across the traditionally decisive swing states in presidential politics -- as well as several other states that each side hopes to put into play by 2020. "The implications going forward are fairly problematic," says long-time Republican pollster Glen Bolger. "He doesn't have a lot of room to drop, and yet he is."\u000a\u000aTrump approval down in key Rust Belt states\u000a\u000aThe 2018 Senate map is favorable to Republicans and could blunt the implications of Trump's erosion for the midterm election. As Gallup has reported, the President retains his strongest approval ratings in several preponderantly white interior states where Democratic senators will be seeking reelection next year -- including West Virginia, North Dakota and Montana; he's just below 50% approval in Missouri and Ohio, two other states with Democratic incumbents. But Trump is confronting approval ratings well below 50% in other states with marquee Senate races -- including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida (where Democrats are attempting to hold seats) as well as Nevada and Arizona (where Republican incumbents could face their most serious challenges.)\u000a\u000a"In 2016, there were two frames for the election: one was change, and the other was 'how do I feel about Hillary?'" says Bolger. "That was enough to win him the election. In 2018, the frame is going to be how do people feel about Donald Trump, how do they see him as president. Up to this point, that's not a real positive frame (for Republicans)."\u000a\u000aWhatever Trump's effect on 2018, the Gallup results offer insights about the stability of the coalition he would likely need to assemble for 2020.\u000a\u000aGallup provided detailed demographic results for nine of the eleven states that both sides have recently treated as the most competitive battlegrounds -- including Virginia, North Carolina and Florida in the Southeast; Colorado and Nevada in the Southwest, and Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania across the Rust Belt. Iowa and New Hampshire, the other traditional battleground states, did not have samples large enough to analyze with this specificity.\u000a\u000aGallup also provided detailed results from Arizona, Georgia and Texas, where Democrats are hoping demographic change will increasingly allow them to compete, as well as Minnesota, where Trump supporters hope that an older and predominantly white population will allow them to break a Democratic winning streak that extends back to 1984. Of the 13 states analyzed, Trump won all except Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and Minnesota.\u000a\u000aA precipitous drop in approval from educated whites in key states\u000a\u000aTo assess the health of Trump's coalition across the 13 states, I compared his current approval rating with the share of the vote he won last November among each of the three key groups, according to exit polls posted on CNN.com. The comparison isn't exact because Gallup is measuring all adults, rather than actual voters, but the contrast provides one gauge of the health of his coalition across these pivotal states.\u000a\u000aAnd despite the President's contention on Twitter Monday morning, that coalition is displaying some very pronounced cracks.\u000a\u000aThe most striking trend is the erosion of Trump's standing among college-educated white voters. Many of these voters have been ambivalent about Trump from the outset. In the general election he carried only 48% of them, down sharply from Mitt Romney's 56% in 2012. Yet, aided by widespread doubts about Clinton among these voters, Trump still bested her with them in nine of these 13 states while tying her in another (Pennsylvania).\u000a\u000aBut in the Gallup results, Trump's approval rating among college-educated whites has declined relative to his 2016 vote in all 13 states. In seven of those states, his approval rating stands at least 10 points lower than his vote --a list topped by North Carolina and Florida (both 19 points lower), Georgia (18 points lower), Ohio (15 points), Virginia (12 points), and Michigan and Minnesota (11 points each.) His approval rating among these white-collar whites reaches above 50% only in Texas and Georgia, and exceeds 45% in just two other states, Nevada and Arizona. In seven states, his approval among these well-educated white voters has tumbled to 40 percent or less. (That includes four states essential to his victory: North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.)\u000a\u000aThe absence of Clinton as a factor\u000a\u000aThese anemic numbers suggest how much Trump benefited last fall from the doubts these voters also held about Clinton; standing alone, without her as a foil, he's facing much harsher assessments. (In a separate national Quinnipiac University poll released last week, 59% of college-educated whites said they "strongly" disapproved of Trump's performance.) "I think the doubts about her blocked how big the potential was for those voters to vote against Trump," says long-time Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg.\u000a\u000aSome of Trump's policies collide with the preferences of college-educated white voters (particularly on the environment, gay rights and immigration). But many of them (especially men) are also drawn to his lower-taxes, small government message. Like many observers, Greenberg believes Trump's biggest obstacle with these voters is not policy overall, but rather his blustery leadership style, which often stresses his disdain for expertise and stokes racial tensions. "It's cultural: everything [that's important] to the worldview of college graduates, he's disdainful of, " Greenberg says. "He's not just misaligned, he's at war with the idea of knowledge and information, science and progress, and tolerance and mutuality."\u000a\u000aCompared to 2016, Trump's standing among non-white voters has changed less dramatically in most states. Last year he won about one-fifth or less of the minority vote in each of these 13 states except Florida (where he won about one-fourth), and Texas, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada (where exit polls put him around 30%.) In the states where Trump was weakest with minority voters, his current approval rating among them almost without exception runs only a point or two above or below his vote with them. In Florida and Nevada he's also seen minimal declines. But in Texas, Arizona and Colorado, relative to his vote, he's seen more substantial declines of seven-to-ten percentage points.\u000a\u000aDropoff in approval from less educated whites is less steep\u000a\u000aThe most important factor in Trump's victory last year was his superheated support among working-class whites. The Gallup numbers offer him a mixed picture on that front. His overall approval numbers remain much stronger among whites without a college degree than among whites holding advanced education: the Gallup findings place him at 60% or more among working-class whites in six of these states, and at 51% or more in the others except Minnesota (where he's just below at 48%).\u000a\u000aBut that standing still represents an erosion from his 2016 vote among blue-collar whites in 12 of those states; in five of them, he's declined by double-digits. Perhaps most important are the trends in four of the Rust Belt states that proved decisive last year: Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In all of them exit polls found Trump won between 62 and 64% of non-college whites. In each case, that was a substantial increase from Romney's performance with those voters in 2012, when former President Barack Obama carried the states.\u000a\u000aStrikingly, though, Trump's job approval among working-class whites in each of those states has now receded to match, or even slightly trail, the level of support they provided Romney when he lost the same states to Obama. In Wisconsin, for instance, Trump's approval among whites without a college degree now stands at 51%, close to Romney's 53% vote share in 2012 but far below Trump's own 62%. Likewise, in Pennsylvania, Trump is now at 55% approval with non-college whites, almost exactly Romney's 56% vote in 2012, but well below the president's 64% among them. (Adding to the pressure, Trump's current approval among college whites in all four states is well below not only Romney's 2012 showing with them but also his own generally weaker 2016 numbers.)\u000a\u000aMore detailed results show Trump suffering relatively modest single-digit losses among working-class white men in these states. But, compared to his 2016 vote, his Gallup approval rating among working-class white women has plummeted in Wisconsin (down 18 points), Michigan (15 points) and Pennsylvania (13 points) and slipped in Ohio (down five points.) Greenberg points to the extended debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act -- and in particular cutting Medicaid -- as the key to that shift.\u000a\u000a"The ones who are eroding are because he's going after their health care, because he's such a threat to social insurance that people depend on," he said. "In the campaign (he talked) about making health care affordable for all-it was a social democratic offer, it was not a (House Speaker Paul) Ryan offer. And for women, who are particularly focused on these health care issues, it's a real threat"\u000a\u000aThese working-class white women across the Rust Belt overwhelmingly rejected the first female major party nominee last fall, giving Trump big majorities of their votes in all four states. That backing was pivotal, and arguably decisive, in electing him president. Seven months into Trump's presidency, with resistance to him widening among white-collar whites and hardening among minorities, rebuilding his support among those women looks more critical for him than ever.

aVAt least a million babies have been born in the U.S. using lab-assisted techniques, a new report finds.\u000a\u000aThe latest report on in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive techniques (ART) shows that nearly 68,000 babies were born using one or the other of the methods in 2015.\u000a\u000aComputer artwork of in vitro fertilization technique known as ICSI Getty Images/Science Photo Library RM\u000a\u000aThe Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology said about 213,000 treatment cycles were tried in 2015, giving the methods an overall 32 percent success rate.\u000a\u000aThe number is probably higher than that.\u000a\u000aThe Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, part of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), reports data from its member clinics and has only been collecting that information since 1985.\u000a\u000aThe first American IVF baby was born in the United States in 1981. The world\u2019s first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born in Britain in 1978.\u000a\u000aRelated: Baby Born Using Three-Parent Technique\u000a\u000aThe first assisted reproductive technique was IVF but there are now several different techniques offered at more than 440 clinics, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u000a\u000aFor many years, fertility doctors would routinely transfer several embryos into a woman at a time, resulting in twins, triplets, quadruplets and more. Such multiple pregnancies are dangerous to mothers and babies alike and can result in premature births.\u000a\u000aNow, groups like the ASRM strongly encourage fertility specialists to transfer just one embryo. They\u2019ve got data to back up the reassurance that going just one at a time is every bit as likely to result in a live birth as transferring multiple embryos.\u000a\u000aRelated: World's First IVF Baby Has Her Own Baby\u000a\u000aStill, only 34.5 percent of attempts used just a single embryo, SART reported.\u000a\u000a\u201cFewer embryos transferred leads to lower incidence of multiple birth: 80.5 percent of babies born from 2015 cycles were singletons; 19.1 percent twins; and fewer than one-half of one percent were triplets (or higher order),\u201d the group said.\u000a\u000aMore women are opting for frozen, donated eggs as well. More than 3,200 ART attempts used a frozen egg, the group said.\u000a\u000aAge still strongly affects success rates. The success rate of 48 percent for women under the age of 35 and fell to 3 percent per try for women over 42.

This one was more ominous.\u000a\u000aWhen the towering South African accidentally clashed heads with a teammate during a training session last year, it was the fifth concussion he had suffered in two years. For the sake of his long-term health, Hargreaves took the decision to retire from the game aged 30.\u000a\u000aOn the touchline of a quiet, North London sports pitch, it was hardly the ending any athlete dreams of.\u000a\u000a"It was a strange one because you don't see your career ending on the side of a field on a Monday afternoon," Hargreaves, who won four caps for the Springboks before joining English Premiership side Saracens, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"A pass came and we were both looking at the ball, and just bang -- a clash of heads, a bit of dizziness.\u000a\u000a"I got home that evening and was straight out for the count at about five o'clock. I fell asleep until 10 and woke up with a raging headache, and was in a dark room for the whole weekend. The writing was on the wall."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What is a concussion? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is a concussion? 00:32\u000a\u000a'Like being in a fog'\u000a\u000aConcussion is a brain injury that results from force either being directly applied to the brain, or transmitted up to the brain as a whiplash effect. Doctors believe this causes nerve cells to become stretched, releasing chemicals that can alter, among other things, consciousness, memory, mood, or sleep.\u000a\u000aIn rugby terms, it can result from a big tackle, a heavy fall to the ground, or simply -- as Hargreaves found -- an accidental blow to the head. The symptoms vary from case to case, something that the former Saracens captain readily acknowledges.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes it's very obvious -- you're dizzy and you've got a headache for three or four days; you feel like you've got vertigo every time you get up off the couch," he says.\u000a\u000a"For me there's a lot of things that occurred, like when I was defending I felt that my peripheral vision just wasn't there. Guys would just be running past me.\u000a\u000a"Other times it's just a lingering feeling that you're a little bit off, 5% off. Like being in a fog. That sounds ridiculous, but you do feel that something's not quite right."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Hargreaves: 'Concussion ended my career' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hargreaves: 'Concussion ended my career' 01:57\u000a\u000aDespite his premature retirement, Hargreaves has few complaints about his career. Having won two Premiership titles and the European Champions Cup with Saracens, he admits that he's "incredibly privileged to have done what I've done." He now runs a craft beer business -- Wolfpack lager -- alongside former teammate Chris Wyles.\u000a\u000aHis concussion story is by no means unusual. Like Hargreaves, Wales international George North suffered his fifth concussion in two years earlier this season. In a decision that has been criticized by leading doctors, the winger was allowed to play on despite being knocked unconscious -- reason to remove a player permanently from the game.\u000a\u000aAll Blacks great Richie McCaw, who suffered six bouts of concussion, has admitted that he was "lucky" to end his career unscathed from long-term damage.\u000a\u000aA five-year law suit between the NFL and retired players concluded at the end of last year after ex-players claimed that the NFL had hidden the risks of brain injuries.\u000a\u000aAs of January 7, former players are eligible to claim settlements to help treat debilitating brain injuries -- which in some instances include Alzheimer's and the degenerative brain disease ALS. The sport also announced a $100 million initiative intended to support engineering advancements and medical research surrounding concussion in September last year.\u000a\u000aIn soccer, recent research has found a link between concussion and the heading of a ball.\u000a\u000aHargreaves made 79 appearances for English Premiership side Saracens\u000a\u000aTackling the issue\u000a\u000aIn rugby as in NFL, protocols that identify and treat concussion during games are constantly being honed and rewritten, but much of the issue owes to the fact that concussion treatment is still in its early stages of medical development.\u000a\u000a"It's recognized to be the most difficult sports injury to consistently recognize and diagnose," England Rugby's chief medical officer Simon Kemp told CNN.\u000a\u000a"This is the No. 1 player welfare issue in collision and contact sports at the moment ... The science around head injury and particularly around concussion in sport is relatively immature and evolving very rapidly."\u000a\u000aIn 2012, World Rugby introduced the Head Injury Assessment, an in-game protocol intended to help identify and manage concussion as soon as a knock to the head occurs.\u000a\u000a"The average assessment of a player in the 2015 World Cup was 64 seconds and done on-pitch where the player couldn't engage in the assessment," Kemp says. "We now have a 10-minute, off-pitch assessment informed by video review with a structured assessment.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Technology helps to reduce rugby concussions Replay More Videos ...

But even if they have all normal results, if in the opinion of the team doctor that they may be concussed, they still don't return ... It's not pass or fail. The HIA supports the doctor's decision-making."\u000a\u000aThe HIA has received criticism from some leading officials, most notably when players (including North and Ireland international Conor Murray) were suspected to have been knocked unconscious but allowed back on the field. Hargreaves, however, praises the protocol, having experienced it first-hand.\u000a\u000a"It's a good system," he says. "I think they could probably improve what it actually entails, what questions you get asked in the changing room, how you deal with this, what's the prognosis for coming back to play, for recovery -- all those kind of things could be tweaked.\u000a\u000a"But it's a great starting point, and I'm really glad to see that they're taking this seriously."\u000a\u000aBreathalysers, proteins, and head gear\u000a\u000aThe science surrounding concussion is still evolving, and how it is applied to rugby is likely to shape how the game is perceived in the public eye. Players are getting bigger, hits are getting harder, but solutions are being sought out.\u000a\u000aAlex Corbisiero, for example, a former England international who took a sabbatical following multiple injuries and surgeries, has been working to develop the N-Pro -- a head guard he hopes will manage and reduce the effects of blows to the head in rugby.\u000a\u000aBut the N-Pro hasn't been medically certified and World Rugby has released a statement prohibiting its use because of insufficient trials in a playing environment.\u000a\u000aCorbisiero played professional rugby for 10 years. Born in New York but raised in England, the pinnacle of his career was the 2013 British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia where he played in two games of the 2-1 series win.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Alex Corbisiero: Rugby injuries' mental toll Replay More Videos ...

It's a tremendous accumulative load. As the game keeps evolving player welfare needs to be addressed.\u000a\u000a"(The N Pro) is just a consequence to understanding that the reality of the sport is big blows and impacts to the head.

He also knows of companies working to develop a breathalyser that measures chemical levels in a player's brain to assess whether they've sustained any damage.\u000a\u000aBut the problem won't go away anytime soon, and Kemp admits that officials will "still be looking at this problem in five, 10, 15 years."\u000a\u000aAs for Hargreaves, his experience won't stop him sharing his love for the game with his son -- who was an important factor in his decision to retire. But the former second-row forward does accept that work still needs to be done.\u000a\u000a"I don't want to be in a position in five years' time where I have to turn around and say to my kid, 'Actually, I think it's safer for you not to play,'" he says. "I think that would be devastating.\u000a\u000a"I love the game: I love its physicality, I love that it's aggressive, and I love that it's competitive. You don't want to take away from that ... we've got to be responsible for this. We really have to speak about issues that occur and we have to find problems to solve."

aV(CNN) Brittany Tagliareni is not your typical tennis player. Before a match, she needs help tying her shoes and putting her hair in a ponytail.\u000a\u000aBut none of that matters once she steps on the court.\u000a\u000aThe sport has opened up a whole new world for the 26-year-old athlete with autism.\u000a\u000a"People accept me for who I am, and what I can do," she told CNN.\u000a\u000aHer favorite part?\u000a\u000a"I like ... beating the men," she said with a laugh.\u000a\u000aAn uphill battle\u000a\u000aWhen Brittany was a baby, her mom noticed that she wasn't reaching the developmental markers like other kids her age.\u000a\u000a"Every time I went to the pediatrician, they said, 'Don't worry, don't worry. Some babies are later,'" said her mom, Catherine Tagliareni.\u000a\u000aBrittany never learned to babble or crawl. At 2, she was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder.\u000a\u000a"I just expected her to do the same things as any other baby. It was just going to take her a little bit longer," her mom said.\u000a\u000aBrittany also was diagnosed with an auditory processing disorder and motor-control issues caused by apraxia and dyspraxia.\u000a\u000aShe didn't say her first word until she was 6.\u000a\u000aBut it took three more years for her parents to get a more definitive diagnosis.\u000a\u000a"It wasn't until she was 9 that we heard the word 'autism,'" her mom recalled. "It was one of those things, 'Well, now what do I do?'... But it was the same girl, the same therapies."\u000a\u000aGetting on the court\u000a\u000aGrowing up in Orlando, Florida, Brittany looked up to her brother.\u000a\u000a"I always liked to do the same things my brother did," she said.\u000a\u000a"When A.J. started tennis, Brittany wanted to start tennis," her mom said. "But I said, 'You have to let me help you first. And then if we can get you hitting some balls across the net then I'll put you in lessons.'"\u000a\u000aBrittany was 18 when she first picked up a racquet. With patient coaching and a lot of repetition, she started improving. Her confidence grew both on and off the court.\u000a\u000aTagliareni was inspired by her brother A.J. to play tennis.\u000a\u000a"Before tennis, she would go to a home school class one day a week, and she would not talk to anyone," her mom said. "She really didn't have a social life at all. She didn't have any friends."\u000a\u000aShe would also go into what her mom called "autistic land."\u000a\u000a"It takes so much for her to go somewhere and carry on a conversation," her mom said. "It's much easier for her to go in her room and 'talk to the air,' listen to music or go on the computer and not have to deal with any of those issues."\u000a\u000aBut tennis gave her the motivation to improve her social skills.\u000a\u000a"Girls were coming up and saying, 'I want to be like you,'" her mom said. "And then she was like, 'Wow, this is really cool.'"\u000a\u000aWhen she plays in Special Olympics competitions, she gets paired up with men because she's usually in the top division.\u000a\u000a"She loves to beat the guys," her mom said.\u000a\u000aBrittany also competes in international tournaments through Athletes Without Limits. In 2014, she was the top-ranked woman in her division at the INAS (International Federation for Intellectual Disability Sport) World Tennis Championships in Mont-de-Marsan, France.\u000a\u000a"I am very happy about playing tennis because it's a lot of fun, and I like the fame and the fortune," Brittany said with a smile.\u000a\u000aVladimir Obradovic, her tennis coach, said she always brings a positive attitude to the court.\u000a\u000a"She's an inspiration for me every day ... she's very athletic."\u000a\u000aObradovic said he's seen a huge improvement in her skills.\u000a\u000a"The first lesson that we had, there were 60 balls in the basket, and all 60 balls went over the fence," he said. "Four years later, she's competing in money events here in Florida with people without any disabilities."\u000a\u000aThe sport has given her the chance to exceed expectations, her mom said.\u000a\u000a"When she was young, you always heard from professionals, 'She's not going to be able to do this.

"When something like this happens, it's a little bit of a wake-up call to really make sure we have all the right processes in place. We feel very good that we do."\u000a\u000aDungey did admit, however, that the network's recently released promo for the upcoming season of "Bachelor in Paradise," which drew criticism, missed the mark.\u000a\u000a"The promo in question did not refer to the alleged incident at all. It was actually comprised of tweets from Bachelor Nation who were expressing their potential disappointment that there wouldn't be a season and then the joy that there would be," Dungey said, describing the ad. "We thought that it was cheeky and funny and in line with the show. However, the response told us otherwise and we pulled it."\u000a\u000aDungey said the promo's intention was not to "sensationalize" the allegations but rather point to the fanbase's passionate nature.\u000a\u000aShe added that on the series, the incident will be handled "in a respectful way."\u000a\u000a"Bachelor in Paradise" returns August 14.

aV(CNN) You might expect partisan politicians to question the sanity of a president, but now there's an unusual and growing public debate among those qualified to make the assessment -- psychiatrists and other mental health experts -- as to whether they should be allowed to publicly raise those questions.\u000a\u000aTwo professional mental health associations -- the American Psychoanalytic Association , known as the APsaA, and the American Psychiatric Association , known as the APA -- have opposite opinions about what would be ethical, and what is not. If members want to share their educated opinions about President Donald Trump, or any public figure for that matter, the associations' ethics guidance conflict, leaving dual members with a touch choice.\u000a\u000aIt might sound like an arcane conversation about medical ethics, but the debate has heated up as more experts have publicly shared their concerns about the President's mental health. Dozens of mental health professionals signed on to a letter in February that said Trump's "speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions," and show "a profound inability to empathize."\u000a\u000aHow the policies differ\u000a\u000aThe American Psychoanalytic Association represents about 3,500 members from all mental health professions and academia. It polled its leadership in June and asked whether they continued to support the association's existing policy, that it "speaks to sociopolitical issues only, not about political figures."\u000a\u000aAccording to an association memo from July 6, all the leaders that answered the poll voted to keep existing policy. But, the memo continues, as far as members go, they are "free to comment about political figures as individuals."\u000a\u000aThat means if individual experts want to share their thoughts about the President's behavior, for example, they are free to do so as "APsaA does not consider political commentary by its individual members an ethical matter. APsaA's ethical code concerns clinical practice, not public commentary," the memo states.\u000a\u000aThe other group, the 37,000-member American Psychiatric Association, has a different ethics policy.\u000a\u000a"It is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement," according to its code of ethics. In fact, the APA's ethics committee met this winter and it expanded its existing policy, known as the "Goldwater Rule," to be even more restrictive. In the past, the Goldwater Rule was interpreted by many to apply only to official diagnosis.\u000a\u000aUnder new guidance about the rule, it is "fine for a psychiatrist to share their expertise about psychiatric issues in general," but "member psychiatrists should not give professional opinions about the mental state of someone they have not personally evaluated," according to an APA blog released after the committee's decision.\u000a\u000aThat rule, it clarified, "applies to all professional opinions offered by psychiatrists, not just diagnosis."\u000a\u000aDoing so would be "unethical and irresponsible," wrote American Psychiatric Association President Dr. Maria A. Oquendo. "The complexity of today's media environment demands that we take special care when speaking publicly about mental health issues, particularly when what we say has the potential to damage not only our professional integrity, but the trust we share with our patients, and their confidence in our abilities as physicians."\u000a\u000aConflicting advice for dual members\u000a\u000aDr . Prudence Gourguechon , a Chicago psychiatrist, is a member of both groups, and was the past president of American Psychoanalytic Association.\u000a\u000aGourguechon disagrees with the APA's expanded interpretation of the Goldwater Rule and has fallen on the side of the APsaA's guidance. She said she believes that members should use their expertise on human behavior to help the public better "organize the experience that is happening around us."\u000a\u000aShe penned an editorial about the President in the Los Angeles Times in June.\u000a\u000aHer editorial suggested "as a psychiatrist, I believe we need a rational, thorough and coherent definition of the mental capacities required to carry out 'the powers and duties' of the presidency."\u000a\u000aGourguechon wrote that there is little in scientific literature that defines what mental capacity means for people in positions of "great responsibility." A good source, she suggests, is the US Army's Field Manual 6-22 on leadership development. It emphasizes that a leader must be trustworthy, have discipline and self-control, good judgment and the ability for complex critical thinking, self-awareness and empathy.\u000a\u000aShe does not directly disclose how she feels about the President's performance as it relates to these categories, nor does she make a diagnosis, but she does suggest that there is enough data out there that displays his behavior that "we are all free to compare that observable behavior to the list of traits deemed critical for leadership by the US Army," she wrote.\u000a\u000a"As professionals we should not be shy about talking about really difficult things," she said in an interview with CNN.\u000a\u000a"This is not about one person," she said. "The whole country is in a troubled place. I don't want be so grandiose to say we are treating the country as a patient, but there is terrible conflict right now and people aren't acting their best or thinking their best and we are not just talking about Donald Trump."\u000a\u000aNor does she see the APsaA's different philosophy on this issue as a criticism of the APA's.\u000a\u000a"We would never tell a sister organization what to do with their own ethics policy," she said. She said she will continue to be a member of both organizations.\u000a\u000astatement Tuesday from APsaA said it did not encourage its members to "defy" the APA's Goldwater Rule, but "rather, it articulated a distinct ethics position that represents the viewpoint of psychoanalysts. The field of psychoanalysis addresses the full spectrum of human behavior, and we feel that our concepts and understanding are applicable and valuable to understanding a wide range of human behaviors and cultural phenomenon," the statement said.\u000a\u000aOne 41-year member of the APA told the association to change its guidance and publicly quit in July over the issue, but has remained a member of the APsaA and told the APsaA's president that he "applauded" its policy.\u000a\u000aDr. Leonard Glass is a part-time associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and works as a senior attending psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. He said while there is merit to the Goldwater Rule, he was among the professionals who signed the February letter about the President's mental health, which published in the New York Times\u000a\u000aIt refrained from making a diagnosis, but emphasized there was an urgency behind their need to share their opinions about the President's mental health, which may violate the expanded interpretation of the Goldwater Rule.\u000a\u000a"We fear that too much is at stake to be silent any longer," the letter states. Trump's speech and actions show that he has an "inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions" in which he is unable to empathize, and he is "attacking facts and those who convey them." The letter concluded the President's "instability" makes him "incapable of serving safely as president."\u000a\u000aIn July, Glass wrote an opinion article for Psychiatric Times in which he said he and fellow colleagues were "shocked by what we felt was the APA's 'gag rule' on this issue."\u000a\u000aGlass told CNN he feels the APA code is "insulting" and "self-defeating." With the abundance of data available from television and the President's own Twitter feed, one can make an educated observation, he said. To restrict members from doing so is "clinging to a 40 or 50 year old rule" and shortchanges the public, particularly in such an "extraordinary and frightening time."\u000a\u000a"It doesn't make sense that people with the greatest professional basis for commentary should keep silent," Glass said. "I'm unaware of any other medical specialty that gags its members."\u000a\u000aMembers debate\u000a\u000aThe Goldwater Rule has defenders.\u000a\u000aIn a counterpoint essay in the Psychiatric Times, Dr. Rebecca Brendel, a psychiatrist and director of the master's program in bioethics at Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics, argued in favor of the Goldwater Rule , writing that "psychiatric opinions based on insufficient data and/or method, whether they include diagnoses, compromise both the integrity of the individual psychiatrist and the profession."\u000a\u000aBut an analysis and commentary, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law last year, argued that, in general, the Goldwater Rule was "excessive." APA member Dr. Claire Pouncey and her co-authors wrote that it's "not only unnecessary," it "detracts from the deeper dictates of ethics and professionalism."\u000a\u000aPouncey told CNN that in trying to silence its members, the APA fails to "treat us like our own moral agents."\u000a\u000aThis winter, Pouncey gave a presentation about the Goldwater Rule at the annual APA meeting. She also met with the group's ethics committee to urge them to change its mind about the policy. She said while ethics committee individuals treated her with professional respect, there were leaders outside the committee that dismissed her argument. "I've essentially been shushed," Pouncey said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe rule, Pouncey said, "gives me no space in my separate role as a citizen or as a school board member or as a parent." For example she said if she got arrested at a public protest, that is not automatically an ethics violation, but "if I shoot my mouth off and go a little too far in my professional opinion, this rule was now construed so broadly in March, that now I'm unethical," Pouncey said.\u000a\u000aPouncey will continue her APA membership, but vows to continue to fight from within the organization. She adds that while she strongly opposes the policy, she does know that ultimately the Goldwater rule is "somewhat toothless" and is merely an ethics policy, meant to guide professionals. It is not a law, so no professional will lose their license if they violate these policies. "But it still gets to me."

aV(CNN) Robert Leahy was sitting on his couch, watching TV, when his wife, Gretchen, walked through the front door.\u000a\u000aIt was about 10 p.m. She'd left for the grocery store hours earlier. Now, she "bumbled" about the room, Leahy says, incoherent and vacant. He'd seen her like this before.\u000a\u000a"What the f**k are you doing?" he asked. "You're high."\u000a\u000aAfter the initial shock wore off, Leahy was angry and embarrassed. He worried about his reputation and what his colleagues at the Clermont County Sheriff's Office would think. He'd been a law enforcement officer for more than a decade, and now he was married to a heroin addict.\u000a\u000aHe needed to save himself and their young son. He had done all he could to save her.\u000a\u000aJust weeks earlier, Gretchen had returned home to Madeira, Ohio, from Crossroads Centre Antigua, an addiction treatment facility founded by musician Eric Clapton. It was one of a handful of times she'd received treatment for opiate addiction in the past five years. Leahy says he spent more than $16,000 -- nearly all of their life savings -- to cover the cost.\u000a\u000aAnd now she was high again.\u000a\u000aRobert Leahy with his then-wife and their young son.\u000a\u000aOn September 7, 2005, Leahy filed for divorce and a temporary restraining order. At the time, the US opioid epidemic was in its early stages. Abuse of prescription painkillers was a growing, if hidden, problem, and heroin addiction had yet to ravage rural and suburban America. That would soon change. Nearly 15,000 Americans -- 500 from Ohio alone -- died of an opioid overdose in 2005. In 2015, those numbers soared to 33,000 and 2,700 deaths, respectively.\u000a\u000aAt first, Leahy could not understand why his wife had let herself become an addict, why she had made that choice. But as he watched her struggle for years to stay clean, his knowledge of addiction matured. He began to see it as a disease in need of treatment and compassion.\u000a\u000aMore than a decade later, as Ohio grapples with one of the deadliest drug epidemics in American history, the state's criminal justice system has undergone a similar transformation. Local officers and judges know that they can no longer treat all addicts like criminals. To stop an epidemic, they have to think like medical professionals.\u000a\u000a'This is a mass fatality crisis'\u000a\u000aOn July 31, the White House's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis released an interim report asking President Donald Trump to declare the opioid epidemic a national health emergency.\u000a\u000aOhio has been one of the states hit hardest by the crisis. Last year, 86% of overdose deaths in the state involved an opioid. In Montgomery County, the situation is particularly dire. Local officials say that more than 800 people will probably die from an opiate overdose there this year, more than double last year's record of 349 opioid deaths.\u000a\u000aLaw enforcement officials say the county's location has made it an ideal distribution hub for Mexican drug cartels. Interstates 70 and 75, two major arteries that crisscross the nation, intersect in the northeast corner of the region. Officials say the cartels ship their product directly to Dayton, less than a 10-minute drive from the intersection. Then, local dealers hop onto one of the "heroin highways" and circulate opioids throughout the country.\u000a\u000aA morgue in Montgomery County, Ohio, fills nearly every night with bodies from the heroin epidemic.\u000a\u000aMost nights, the freezer in Montgomery County's morgue is stacked floor-to-ceiling with bodies. Dr. Kent Harshbarger, the coroner whose office services more than 30 counties, estimates that 60% to 70% of these corpses are the result of an opioid overdose.\u000a\u000a"What's most challenging is seeing the same story repeated over and over again," he said. "It seems, from my perspective, inevitable."\u000a\u000aSince last year, to deal with the surge in overdose deaths, Harshbarger has hired six part-time coroners, two autopsy technicians and three field investigators. He also extended some of the staff's workday by three hours so they had time to perform more autopsies and remodeled the morgue freezer to fit more bodies.\u000a\u000aSeveral times in 2015 and 2016, the office was overwhelmed, and he had to house some of the corpses in mobile morgues -- trucks with refrigerated trailers. The state purchased the trucks in the mid-2000s with a grant from the Department of Homeland Security. They were intended to be used in the field to store bodies after a mass-casualty event like a plane crash or a terrorist attack. Harshbarger says the current crisis is not so different.\u000a\u000a"Staff is overwhelmed," he said. "This is a mass fatality crisis."\u000a\u000aWhat started as a heroin epidemic quickly turned even deadlier. Experts say the spike in overdose deaths in Montgomery, and in many places across the country, is largely due to heroin's opiate cousins: fentanyl and its more potent analogues like carfentanil. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin. Carfentanil, originally designed as a large-animal tranquilizer, is 5,000 times more potent than heroin.\u000a\u000aMontgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer says that when addicts think they're purchasing heroin, they're more likely buying one of these synthetic opioids.\u000a\u000a"We need to quit calling it a heroin epidemic; this is fentanyl." he said. "It's really not a heroin issue anymore."\u000a\u000aThe numbers back him up. In 2016, 251 of the 349 opioid-related overdose deaths in the county involved only fentanyl or carfentanil, with no heroin present, and an additional 34 involved heroin laced with fentanyl.\u000a\u000aTo stem the tide of overdose deaths, the sheriff's office is spearheading a new program called Get Recovery Options Working, or GROW. As part of the initiative, a sheriff's deputy, a social worker, a medic and a member of the clergy visit a home where an overdose occurred within the past week. Together, they provide literature about Cornerstone Project, a local drug treatment facility, and talk to family members about how to best help their loved one, and if the individual is willing, the deputy will drive him or her to treatment that day.\u000a\u000a"We just stop and tell them, 'We love you and we care for you, we want to seek help for you,'" Sheriff Plummer said. "And we're having tremendous success with that."\u000a\u000aSince the program started on January 1, GROW has reached out to 162 people who have overdosed, 57 of whom have entered treatment at Cornerstone Project, Plummer says. More than half of those who entered Cornerstone because of the initiative are still in treatment, says Cornerstone Project Community Outreach Manager Wendie Jackson.\u000a\u000aA stopgap\u000a\u000aSheriff Robert Leahy of Clermont County, Ohio, runs the Community Alternative Sentencing Center.\u000a\u000aBy 2014, Leahy had climbed the ranks to chief deputy in the Clermont County Sheriff's Office. That year, drug overdose deaths were also steadily climbing in the county, from 56 in 2013 to 68 by year's end. It was the sixth year in a row the number of overdose deaths had risen.\u000a\u000aLeahy recognized the trend and had an idea. He'd heard about law enforcement agencies in other parts of the country equipping their officers with a drug called naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan. Administered as a nasal spray, the drug could reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and was easy to use. Leahy lobbied Sheriff A.J. "Tim" Rodenberg and volunteered to lead the initiative.\u000a\u000aRodenberg, Leahy says, was receptive but not convinced. He needed more information. The topic would be controversial, he told Leahy. Some in the community would, of course, think it's a good idea, but others would consider it a waste of taxpayer money.\u000a\u000aLeahy called other sheriff's offices in the north of the state that were using Narcan and learned about the success they were having in saving lives.\u000a\u000aHe told Rodenberg what he'd heard and laid out the pros and cons of buying Narcan. Then, Leahy decided to speak from personal experience. He didn't bring up Gretchen by name, but "I think he realized some of the decisions that I made, or the things I pushed along, were related to that."\u000a\u000aLeahy and Gretchen still shared custody of their son, but he says she was rarely around. She would stay clean for a few weeks -- periods he calls "flashes of brilliance." Each time, he hoped she'd turned a corner. But really, he was just waiting for her to relapse. If she overdosed, he would want the responding officer to have all the tools available to revive her, so she'd have the chance to fight another day.\u000a\u000a"How can you get people into recovery if you can't save their lives?" Leahy asked Rodenberg. Within months, the deputies were equipped with Narcan.\u000a\u000a'The challenge is to keep them alive'\u000a\u000aIn Montgomery County, the average opioid user is a 38-year-old white man, according to data collected by the sheriff's office. But officials say the number of young addicts in the area has increased exponentially over the past five years.\u000a\u000aCounty Juvenile Court Judge Anthony Capizzi estimates that nearly a quarter of the young defendants in his courtroom are addicted to either opiate painkillers or heroin.\u000a\u000a"I have jurisdiction over children until they reach 21," Capizzi said. "The challenge for me right now is to keep them alive that long."\u000a\u000aCapizzi presides over the county's Juvenile Treatment Court. The young people in his courtroom have substance abuse issues and often, as a result, lengthy criminal histories. Capizzi puts the vast majority into some kind of treatment program; detention centers are the last resort.\u000a\u000aRachel Chaffin, a cheerleader and 4.0 student, is trying to overcome her heroin addiction.\u000a\u000aThree and a half years ago, Rachel Chaffin walked into Capizzi's courtroom. She was one of the first young defendants addicted to heroin that he'd seen in his 13 years behind the bench in Montgomery.\u000a\u000aChaffin was 15 years old. She had been captain of the JV cheerleading squad in high school and dreamed of one day cheering on the sidelines for the Dallas Cowboys. But growing up, her life was chaotic and unstable. Her family often teetered on the edge of homelessness. In December 2013, Chaffin got pregnant.\u000a\u000a"I was 14. I was freaking out," she said. "I ended up having a miscarriage."\u000a\u000aA drug dealer in her neighborhood later asked her whether she wanted to be a "tester" for his product and check the quality of the dope. She was scared but took the leap, fueled by a depression that consumed her after her miscarriage.\u000a\u000a"Once I started doing it," she said, "I didn't want to stop."\u000a\u000aShe landed in front of Capizzi after multiple felony and misdemeanor charges. Eventually, the judge removed her from her mother's custody because she continued to use and put her in foster care. For the next three years, she bounced from group home to foster home, sometimes clean, sometimes not. She overdosed, and was revived by Narcan, three times.\u000a\u000aNow 18, Chaffin eventually found a good foster home and graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. She says she's been clean since March, when she relapsed after another miscarriage. She says she struggles every day to stay clean, but when she feels weak, she remembers what a counselor told her during a recent stay in rehab.\u000a\u000a"My counselor said, 'I want you to picture your mom coming to the morgue to identify your body,'" she said. "That just broke me. I can't picture putting my mom through so much."\u000a\u000aBefore there's no hope\u000a\u000aInmates at the Clermont County Jail can participate in the Community Alternative Sentencing Center program.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the Clermont County Sheriff's Office collaborated with local mental health officials to open the Community Alternative Sentencing Center inside the local jail. The voluntary program offers people who have been convicted of a misdemeanor and have a substance abuse issue the opportunity to serve their sentences in a wing of the jail that is separated from the general population. Nearly 40% of the participants at any given time were once addicted to opioids.\u000a\u000aThe center is operated by Greater Cincinnati Behavior Health Services. The participants -- or "clients," as staff refer to them -- receive group therapy and drug rehabilitation treatment, such as participating in Narcotics Anonymous.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, the voters of Clermont County elected Leahy sheriff. He says he never had aspirations for the position, but in 2015, Rodenberg told Leahy he was retiring and wanted Leahy to be his successor. Leahy ran unopposed. Now, he was in charge of a program he'd help shepherd for years.\u000a\u000aAlternative Sentencing Center clients technically are not inmates, and there are no correctional officers in that wing of the jail. The clients are on probation, and as part of that, they've agreed to complete their treatment. But if a client leaves the program early, he is in violation of his probation.\u000a\u000aLeahy says these programs can help people before they're burglarizing homes or robbing people to feed their habit -- before they're burdened with a rap sheet full of felonies. Once a person reaches that point, they often believe there's no hope. Leahy saw Gretchen fall into a similar abyss, and it took her years to claw her way out.\u000a\u000a"If you can catch people in the early stages, where their life is starting to go south but it's not totally out of control," he said, "there's a chance for them."\u000a\u000aHe doesn't want people to mistake his compassion for weakness. Those who commit felonies, he says, deserve to be in jail. But most people with substance abuse issues are better served in treatment, he says.\u000a\u000aSo far, the program has helped men exclusively, but in the fall, Leahy and GCBHS will open a women's version in another wing of the jail. The Clermont jail now houses between 90 and 100 female inmates, nearly double the number a decade ago, Leahy says. Virtually the entire increase in population, he says, can be attributed to the crisis. Opioid overdoses have increased 2000% in Clermont County since 2007.\u000a\u000aBoth the Narcan and Alternative Sentencing Center programs seem to be paying off. Overdose deaths in Clermont County decreased from 94 in 2015 to 83 in 2016.\u000a\u000a"Is it too early to tell? Well, I think by the end of 2017, if we can get two or three years in a row with those numbers trending down," Leahy said, "I think people will realize and say, 'I think somebody's doing something that's working.' "\u000a\u000aLeahy says he speaks with Gretchen only occasionally now. There's no ill will, but since their son has grown, there's also no need. Gretchen says she's been sober for three years, and Leahy gives her the benefit of the doubt. Not that he would ever ask. She doesn't owe him any explanation, he says.\u000a\u000aIn some ways, he has a more clear-eyed view of her disease than even she does. Gretchen is still wracked with guilt from the years lost with their son and for driving her husband away.\u000a\u000a"I think that was half of my issue. Every time I would get clean, I couldn't let go of that guilt, shame," she said. "And I still struggle with that to this day."\u000a\u000aBut Leahy sees it differently. He says that the programs weren't in place to save her, that law enforcement didn't understand what they were dealing with yet. He's learned that the addiction chose her, not the other way around.\u000a\u000a"There is no rhyme or reason," he says. "This is one of those deals, it's kind of like fighting cancer. Your first heaviest, hardest hit is going to give you the best opportunity."

aV(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has told a New York fertility doctor to stop marketing a controversial three-parent fertility treatment, which makes it possible for babies to be made from two women and a man.\u000a\u000aThe health watchdog published a letter to Dr. John Zhang , founder of the New Hope Fertility Center in New York City, whose "spindle nuclear transfer" technique was used to conceive a boy born in Mexico in April 2016.\u000a\u000aZhang detailed the procedure in the journal Fertility and Sterility last year and is now marketing the technique, but the letter reminds Zhang the FDA has not authorized his use of the procedure in humans.\u000a\u000aThe procedure\u000a\u000aThe in-vitro fertilization (IVF) technique involves the donation of mitochondria, which provide energy for cells and contain their own DNA.\u000a\u000aMost of a cell's genetic material, or DNA, is contained within the nucleus but a small amount (less than 1%) is found in the mitochondria, which is passed, intact, from mother to child through her egg.\u000a\u000aWhat are mitochondria? Mitochondria are small structures found in our cells that generate the cellular energy used to power every part of our bodies. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which controls only mitochondrial function and energy production. This is separate from our "nuclear DNA," which makes us who we are and determines appearance and personality. Source: Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research\u000a\u000aIf a mother's mitochondrial DNA is faulty, it is possible that she may pass on a number of rare, but very serious, mitochondrial diseases, including muscle weakness, diabetes, heart problems, epilepsy and stroke-like episodes.\u000a\u000aIn serious cases, these diseases can lead to death. According to a study by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia , mitochondrial disease-causing mutations occur in at least 1 in 4,300 Americans.\u000a\u000aThe spindle nuclear transfer technique allows faulty mitochondria in the mother's egg to be replaced with the healthy mitochondria of another woman, before the father's sperm is used to fertilize the egg to create an embryo.\u000a\u000aZhang used the technique last year in an attempt to prevent Leigh syndrome , a severe neurological condition that affects at least one in 40,000 newborns. The mother he treated had previously miscarried four times and given birth to two children, one of whom survived less than a year and another lived for only 6 years, both due to the syndrome.\u000a\u000aOn April 6, 2016, the mother gave birth to a reportedly healthy baby boy. "Transfer of the [normal] embryo resulted in an uneventful pregnancy with delivery of a healthy boy at 37 weeks of gestation," wrote Zhang and his co-authors in the published study.\u000a\u000aZhang's team of doctors went to Mexico to perform the procedure, as it had not been approved for use in the US by the FDA but was unregulated in Mexico.\u000a\u000aIn its letter, the FDA said Zhang's article stated the genetically modified embryo had been created in the United States but implanted over the border.\u000a\u000aCNN reached out to Zhang's office for comment on Monday but received no immediate response.\u000a\u000aFDA warning\u000a\u000aMary A. Malarkey, the director of the FDA's Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Zhang had submitted a written request dated April 22, 2016, "asking for a pre-investigational new drug (IND) meeting for a clinical investigation of a 'spindle transfer for assisted pregnancy in patients with mitochondrial disease.'\u000a\u000aShe wrote in Friday's letter that the FDA declined the request in line with Congress's prohibition on the use of funds to accept IND submissions for clinical investigations that involve a human embryo being "intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification."\u000a\u000aShe wrote: "Your April 2016 letter further informed FDA that "until an effective IND is in place, and a clinical trial is authorized by FDA, Darwin [L]life will not use its spindle transfer technology again within the United States to support ex-US studies or procedures."\u000a\u000aBut Malarkey then highlighted that Zhang had not been honoring that commitment. "You continue to market MRT (mitochondrial replacement technology) to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease and to treat infertility," she wrote.\u000a\u000aMalarkey said the embryo Zhang's team created in 2016 did not meet federal regulations with respect to human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue based products and was also subject to regulations regarding drugs and biological products that barred it from being exported.\u000a\u000a"This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. It is your responsibility to ensure full compliance with the FD&C Act ( Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act ) and the PHS Act ( Public Health Service Act ) and their implementing regulations," she wrote.\u000a\u000aMalarkey then requested Zhang to notify the FDA, in writing, of the steps he has taken or will take to address the violation and to prevent its recurrence.\u000a\u000aOther 3-parent IVF babies\u000a\u000aThough the baby born in Mexico in 2016 was billed by Zhang as a "first ever," a different version of this same technique had been used by fertility clinics in the past, said Professor Hank Greely of Stanford University after Zhang's study was published last year.\u000a\u000a"About a dozen such babies were born in the US in the late 1990s/early 2000s before the FDA -- pushed, I think, by cloning concerns -- decided that this procedure needed FDA approval," said Greely.\u000a\u000aThe clinics who did this before have since stopped performing the procedure, he added.\u000a\u000aIn February 2015, UK lawmakers voted in favor of a law that would allow another form of the pioneering technique, known as pronuclear transfer, by doctors in Newcastle. This method involves fertilizing both the mother's and donor's eggs with the father's sperm, then transferring the nucleus from the mother's fertilized egg into the fertilized donor egg.\u000a\u000aBut the UK's Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority did not give the green light to the treatment until December 2016 , after further safety tests.\u000a\u000aLori P. Knowles, adjunct assistant professor at the University of Alberta School of Public Health, said the fact that the technique had been used to produce a girl was significant.\u000a\u000aThe reason the experimental method was cause for concern -- and was vigorously debated in the UK before approval -- is the genetic modifications produced in a girl baby could be passed onto her children, Knowles said.\u000a\u000a"We know for sure that she will be passing on her mitochondrial DNA through her maternal line," said Knowles. If in the future this baby girl has genetic children, they will inherit her genetic modifications "and that's always been a really bright line," said Knowles -- a line not to be crossed until rigorous scientific testing proves it is safe.\u000a\u000aDr. Valery Zukin, director of the Nadiya Clinic for Reproductive Medicine, where the controversial pronuclear transfer technique was performed, said there were no regulations concerning the procedure in Ukraine.

aV(CNN) The Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, yet only people with higher incomes or more education, or a combination of the two, experience this benefit, found a study published Monday in the International Journal of Epidemiology.\u000a\u000aThe Mediterranean diet emphasizes eating plant-based foods, including vegetables, nuts, fruits and whole grains, in addition to fish and poultry. The diet also recommends that you limit red meat, replace butter with olive oil, and exercise.Red wine in moderation is optional on the diet, which past scientific research proves to be heart-healthy.\u000a\u000aMarialaura Bonaccio, lead author of the new study and a researcher at IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Mediterraneo Neuromed, an Italian Clinical Research Institute, said in an email that this same problem -- in which people from different income levels get different results from the same diet -- may also be true for other diets.\u000a\u000aThe reason? Diets "focus on quantity, rather than on quality" of the food, she said.\u000a\u000aDiet data\u000a\u000aBonaccio and her co-authors randomly recruited over 18,000 people living in the Molise region of southern Italy between March 2005 and April 2010. The Pfizer Foundation, which helped fund enrollment costs, did not influence the analysis or interpretation of results, Bonaccio noted.\u000a\u000aShe and her team calculated total physical activity, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and health history, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. The data available for each participant also included education, household income and marital status.\u000a\u000aUsing the Mediterranean Diet Score, Bonaccio and her colleagues assessed participants' food intake, examining the variety of fruits and vegetables, meat and fish consumed. They scored participants' cooking methods, detailing whether they're using healthy methods such as boiling and stewing or less healthy methods such as frying, roasting and grilling. Vegetables were categorized as organic or not, bread as whole-grain or not.\u000a\u000aOver an average followup period of about four years, participants experienced a total of 5,256 cardiovascular disease events, including incidents of heart failure, diagnoses of coronary heart disease (a buildup of plaque in the arteries) and strokes.\u000a\u000aAnalyzing the data, the researchers found that a Mediterranean diet effectively reduced cardiovascular disease risk, but only among a select group of participants: those with higher income or more education.\u000a\u000a"We found heart advantages were limited to high socioeconomic status groups, even if groups showed the same adherence to the Mediterranean diet," Bonaccio wrote. No benefits occurred for participants in the low income and low education group.\u000a\u000aDifferences in food quality\u000a\u000aSurprised by this result, the researchers dug into the data more deeply and unearthed a possible reason for the difference: The same Mediterranean diet adherence score still included slight differences in food consumption.\u000a\u000a"For example, as compared to less advantaged counterparts, people with high socioeconomic status tended to consume fish more frequently," Bonaccio wrote. She added that, beyond diet adherence, participants in the most advantaged category reported a higher quality diet, which included higher consumption of organic products and whole grain foods.\u000a\u000a"Let's give that two persons follow the same diet, that is equal amounts of vegetables, fruits, fish, olive oil etc. every day so that they report the same adherence score to Mediterranean diet," Bonaccio said. "It might be that, beyond quantity, differences in quality may exist. For example, in olive oil."\u000a\u000aShe said it's unlikely that a bottle of extra virgin olive oil with a price tag of 2 to 3 euros has the same nutritional properties as one costing 10 euros. Given that it is reasonable to assume higher-income participants are more likely to buy the 10-euro bottle compared with lower-income participants, "our hypothesis is that differences in the price may yield differences in healthy components and future health outcomes," Bonaccio said.\u000a\u000aHow the food is cooked or prepared might also contribute to differences in results, according to Bonaccio, though she said the differences in cooking procedures -- "a kind of marker of the numerous differences still persisting across socioeconomic groups" -- probably did not "substantially account" for the disparities in cardiovascular risk.\u000a\u000aSimilar results in US?\u000a\u000aMercedes Sotos-Prieto, an assistant professor and visiting scientist at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, said evidence, including from her own research , shows that a Mediterranean diet is "one of the best choices to improve health."\u000a\u000aSotos-Prieto, who was not involved in the new research, wrote in an email that the new study, which relied on self-reported data, does not prove that socioeconomic status caused the health benefits seen; it shows only a relationship between income and/or education and health outcomes.\u000a\u000a"Previous studies have already showed a socioeconomic gradient regarding adherence to diet quality," Sotos-Prieto wrote. Because of this, a similar difference in health results depending on socioeconomic status may also be occurring in the United States among those who follow a Mediterranean diet, she said.\u000a\u000aDr. Barbara Berkeley, who specializes in weight management and practices medicine in Beachwood, Ohio, said "one caveat in interpreting studies like this is that they are based on diet recall. It is generally very difficult for people to keep accurate food records and there is a tendency for participants to record their diets in the best possible light."\u000a\u000aBerkeley, who was not involved in this research, agreed with the hypothesis of the authors.\u000a\u000a"A good diet is undoubtedly more than just a shopping list," she said. "Quality, freshness, variety and purity of production may truly differentiate diets even when they appear to be the same."\u000a\u000aBerkeley noted that "food deserts" in lower-income areas means both quality and variety of fresh foods may be limited, while organic produce may be unavailable or too expensive.\u000a\u000a"A healthy diet is likely not the sum of its parts but the quality of its elements," Berkeley said.\u000a\u000aMaria Korre, a research fellow at Harvard Chan School of Public Health, noted that "among the most important perceived barriers to healthy eating are the time and cost of shopping." Korre, who did not contribute to the new study, added that "we need to work toward identifying ways ... to overcome these barriers."\u000a\u000a"As a result of the worldwide epidemics of obesity and diabetes, we witness a strong and renewed interest in the traditional Mediterranean diet," Korre said. Yet the appeal of this diet extends well beyond proven health benefits.\u000a\u000aWith its wide range of colorful foods, the diet provides "delicious meals" and "because of its emphasis on limited consumption, rather than abstention from red meat and sweets" plus its inclusion of moderate drinking of alcoholic beverages, "the Mediterranean diet represents a healthy yet indulgent and appealing lifestyle that can be sustained over long periods of time," Korre said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAccording to the study authors, people of high socioeconomic status may actually be selecting foods that are higher in both polyphenols (plant-based micronutrients) and antioxidants (a nutrient found in fruits and vegetables that helps repair damage in our bodies). Such daily choices could result in health advantages unseen by those who make different selections.\u000a\u000a"This hypothesis could be only tested by a direct measure of such natural compounds in biological samples, e.g., blood levels or urinary polyphenol excretion," Bonaccio said. She said her groups' future research and analysis will test this theory.

Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Of all the stories you heard in the news in the past few days, which one moved you the most?

If the answer is the killing of Cecil the lion, you are in lots of company.\u000a\u000aFrida Ghitis\u000a\u000aBy now, it seems, most people agree that the killing, apparently for fun, of the majestic lion by a Minnesota dentist visiting Zimbabwe was a perplexing act of pointless cruelty and cowardice. It spawned millions of posts on Facebook and Twitter -- a kind of outrage tsunami.\u000a\u000aCecil, who was apparently well-known and loved in the natural park where he lived in Zimbabwe, died in a most unnatural way, lured from his home and slaughtered. (The dentist, now perhaps fearing for his life, has apparently gone into hiding.)\u000a\u000aThe intensity of the backlash over the trophy killing has triggered a counter-backlash. Why, some are now asking, do people care so much about the death of a lion when so many human beings are suffering and dying? The surge of sorrow for a dead lion, they say, when compared to the relative quiet about other wrongs, reveals a moral flaw in our humanity, a defect in our moral compass.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor decades, the majestic wildlife found across Africa has been a major draw for tourists wanting to catch a glimpse of roaring lions, towering elephants and rare rhinos.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut wildlife tourism should always be a case of look, but don't touch.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor several African countries, wildlife is more than a tourism treasure.

It's also a key source of revenue. A recent study by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNTWO) compiled figures from government and tour operators throughout the continent to assess the state of the wildlife tourism industry. It found that the industry contributes 80% of international travel sales to the continent, a large percentage of the $34.2 billion African tourism industry.

aV(CNN) One of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather's shoulders, waving a flag as our astronauts returned to Hawaii. This was years before we'd set foot on the moon. Decades before we'd land a rover on Mars. A generation before photos from the International Space Station would show up in our social media feeds.\u000a\u000aI still have the same sense of wonder about our space program that I did as a child. It represents an essential part of our character -- curiosity and exploration, innovation and ingenuity, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and doing it before anybody else. The space race we won not only contributed immeasurably important technological and medical advances, but it also inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers with the right stuff to keep America on the cutting edge.\u000a\u000aThat's one of the reasons why, in my first address as President to the American people, I vowed to return science to its rightful place. In our first few months, my administration made the largest single investment in basic research in our history, and I went to the Kennedy Space Center to call for reimagining and reinvigorating our space program to explore more of our solar system and look deeper into the universe than ever.\u000a\u000aIn the years since, we've revitalized technology innovation at NASA, extended the life of the International Space Station, and helped American companies create private-sector jobs by capitalizing on the untapped potential of the space industry.\u000a\u000aLast year alone, NASA discovered flowing water on Mars and evidence of ice on one of Jupiter's moons, and we mapped Pluto -- more than 3 billion miles away -- in high-resolution. Our space telescopes revealed additional Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, and we're pursuing new missions to interact with asteroids, which will help us learn how to protect the Earth from the threat of colliding with one while also teaching us about the origins of life on Earth. We've flown by every planet in the solar system -- something no other nation can say. And we continue to drive down the cost of space exploration for taxpayers.\u000a\u000aThis week, we'll convene some of America's leading scientists, engineers, innovators and students in Pittsburgh to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers. Just five years ago, US companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it. More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aWe have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we're already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aThe next step is to reach beyond the bounds of Earth's orbit. I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth -- something we'll need for the long journey to Mars.\u000a\u000aThe reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times, John Noble Wilford, later wrote that Mars tugs at our imagination "with a force mightier than gravity." Getting there will take a giant leap. But the first, small steps happen when our students -- the Mars generation -- walk into their classrooms each day. Scientific discovery doesn't happen with the flip of a switch; it takes years of testing, patience and a national commitment to education.\u000a\u000aPresident Eisenhower knew this: In 1958, he devoted great resources to science and math education around the same time he created NASA. And it's why I'm proud that we've passed important milestones in STEM education. For the first time, more than 100,000 engineers are graduating from American schools every year, and we're on track to accomplish my goal of training 100,000 excellent new STEM teachers in a decade.\u000a\u000aWhen our Apollo astronauts looked back from space, they realized that while their mission was to explore the moon, they had "in fact discovered the Earth." If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last, we won't just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we'll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves.\u000a\u000aSomeday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We'll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we'll know that because of the choices we make now, they've gone to space not just to visit, but to stay -- and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.

aVWashington (CNN) The Trump administration can claim a genuine foreign policy win, marked by deft diplomacy on two continents, following the passage of the most punitive UN sanctions ever imposed against North Korea.\u000a\u000aBut it is impossible to say whether the $1 billion slap will slow the most serious national security crisis facing President Donald Trump: Pyongyang's race to top an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit US soil with a nuclear warhead.\u000a\u000aWashington and its allies will hope that the new assault on Pyongyang's already heavily sanctioned economy will change Kim Jong Un's calculations in the building nuclear showdown.\u000a\u000aBut North Korea's initial response, redoubling its refusal to discuss its nuclear and missile programs in any talks, underlined how intractable and dangerous the showdown is becoming for Trump, despite the incremental progress forged at the weekend.\u000a\u000aAnd even though China has signed on to missile sanctions for the first time, there were also indications Monday that it now wants to put the onus back on Washington and Seoul to defuse the crisis.\u000a\u000aThe delicate diplomatic maneuvering was only a preview of the patience, nuance and strategic positioning needed to stop the showdown with Pyongyang spiraling out of control in the years to come, qualities that Trump himself has yet to show in abundance.\u000a\u000aAnd while the administration secured the new sanctions with a team -- including national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, and career State Department and National Security Council officials -- it remains unclear whether the President will be content to allow that model of coordination to prevail in the coming months.\u000a\u000aIn June for instance, Trump caused mystification and a temporary blip in Asian regional tensions, when he tweeted: "While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!"\u000a\u000aThe push for sanctions, while the result of a coordinated administration effort, also followed a period of confusion and mixed diplomatic messages over North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aWhile Tillerson had been raising the possibility of talks with Kim's government, Vice President Mike Pence has several times said Washington does not envisage negotiations. Late last month, CIA Director Mike Pompeo sent shockwaves through Asia by appearing to allude to the possibility of regime change in North Korea.\u000a\u000a"This is high level diplomacy, and you have to be able to use all instruments of national power, in your approach to North Korea, so it makes perfect sense that US officials would be talking about diplomacy; sanctions; and the potential use of military force," said Abraham Denmark, former assistant secretary of defense for East Asia.\u000a\u000a"The key though and the challenge, is making sure those messages are coordinated."\u000a\u000aTrump, at least, was just happy to claim the victory.\u000a\u000a"Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions," Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Russia, North Korea pose challenges to US Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Russia, North Korea pose challenges to US 03:39\u000a\u000aCan it work?\u000a\u000aThe big question is whether the new restrictions against Pyongyang's exports of iron, coal, seafood, and access to international banks and trade, are fully implemented and actually work more effectively than the multiple rounds of previous sanctions imposed on the Stalinist regime over decades.\u000a\u000aTillerson said in Asia that he hoped the tough new approach would cause North Korea to reevaluate its options.\u000a\u000a"We hope that this again, will ultimately result in the North Koreans coming to the conclusion to chose a different pathway, and when the conditions are right that we can sit down and have a dialogue around the future of North Korea."\u000a\u000aYet the regime's bitter response to the sanctions underlined the central conundrum of the crisis: North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the key issue the US wants to broach, are exactly what it will not discuss.\u000a\u000a"We will, under no circumstances, put the nukes and ballistic rockets on (the) negotiating table," North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said at an Asian regional summit in Manila.\u000a\u000aThe blast emphasized that for Kim's regime, the possession of nuclear and ballistic programs is a matter of existential survival, rather than a bargaining chip in talks, as it has been sometimes in the past.\u000a\u000aUnless the new sanctions change that North Korean position, and do it soon, they will have little impact on the wider crisis, since US intelligence estimates that Pyongyang may have the capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon to the US mainland by early next year -- at a moment of truth for Trump.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Haley: Sanctions are a gut punch to N.

Korea 01:50\u000a\u000aCan Trump pressure China?\u000a\u000aGiven that short time frame, it is also unclear whether these or other more punitive sanctions and deeper isolation for Pyongyang could sufficiently force Kim's hand.\u000a\u000a"I don't think they will change the calculus that Kim Jong Un is working under," Gordon Chang, author of "Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes on the World," said on "The Lead with Jake Tapper."\u000a\u000a"Until we stop this incremental approach, the North Koreans, they will just adjust. We have to go all in all at once, stop all of their income," Chang said, calling on Washington to impose economic costs on China to force Beijing to do more to rein in its recalcitrant ally.\u000a\u000aGary Samore, a former top nuclear negotiator for President Barack Obama said Beijing's role was "very significant" because it had joined sanctions to censure long-range missile tests.\u000a\u000a"In, the past the Chinese have supported sanctions but only in response to nuclear tests," Samore said on CNN International. "Beijing has moved the bar now."\u000a\u000aBut there are also signs that China's assistance will not come gratis or is open-ended.\u000a\u000aA commentary in the official China Daily Monday said that alongside a suspension of nuclear and missile activity by North Korea, Washington should agree to suspend military drills with South Korea, a demand the US side has repeatedly rejected.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED McMaster: Trump has N. Korea military options Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH McMaster: Trump has N.

aVBarbara Kelley is the executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America , a consumer organization that provides information, education, advocacy and support to the millions of people with hearing loss in the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) This month, the Senate has an opportunity to dramatically improve the lives of millions of Americans who suffer from mild and moderate hearing loss.\u000a\u000aFar too many are forced to make the latter choice -- Medicare and most private insurance plans do not cover the cost of these critical devices; and most people with hearing loss need two, one for each ear. One study indicates that only 14% of those who could benefit from a hearing aid actually use one.\u000a\u000aMy organization, the Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA), receives hundreds of letters and calls each month from Americans desperate for help but unable to afford the high cost of hearing aids.\u000a\u000aFrom Nevada, Mary wrote of her husband's struggle and the impact it has on their lives: "Just wondering if you can help my husband, Mike. He's 75 and very hard of hearing and using his old uncle's hearing aids and now they have to be taped to hold them together, they are falling apart all the time.\u000a\u000a"We cannot afford new ones as we are on Social Security and on a very tight budget. Do you know of a way he can get hearing aids, otherwise, he can't hear me."\u000a\u000a"I've read the (President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology) report and the study by the National Academies, and everyone says that hearing aids should be affordable and offered over the counter but when will that happen?" wrote Francis from Florida, "I am 88 and I know I need a hearing aid. I have been given all kinds of price quotes, up to $7,500!"\u000a\u000aRoy from Nebraska outlined his monthly income and expenses and declared that there is simply "(n)othing left for hearing aids!"\u000a\u000aThese stories are heartbreaking -- Americans just want to hear ... but cannot afford these life-changing devices.\u000a\u000aFor Francis and Roy and 48 million other Americans, untreated hearing loss is a major health concern that leads to increase risk of falls, isolation, anxiety, depression. Research demonstrates a clear link between untreated hearing loss and cognitive decline . Yet 85% of people who could benefit from hearing aids are not using one.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, PCAST released a report identifying several steps the government could take to "decrease the cost of hearing aids, spur technology innovation, and increase consumer choice," most notably recommending that hearing aids designed to address mild to moderate hearing loss be made available over the counter (OTC). In 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine made a similar recommendation, urging the creation of an over-the-counter category for hearing devices.\u000a\u000aLast month the House of Representatives passed legislation as part of the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act to implement these expert recommendations and allow the sale of OTC hearing aids. The Senate now has an opportunity to do the same, which will dramatically impact consumers by expanding access to innovative, lower-cost hearing technology.\u000a\u000aWe know price is not the only factor delaying adoption of life-changing hearing technology; social stigma and access to care are also factors. But if good and safe technology is offered at affordable prices over the counter, people who might not venture into the clinic of an audiologist or hearing instrument specialist can take that critical first step to a better life with an OTC hearing aid.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aPCAST noted that allowing the sale of hearing aids over the counter will likely "disrupt the current business practices of hearing aid manufacturers and dispensers." So it is unsurprising that the same manufacturers profiting from the sale of $2,000 hearing aids are lobbying against the bill to preserve the status quo. However, organizations like the Consumer Technology Association, which HLAA has received minor sponsorships from in the past, are lobbying for the bill in hopes that it will provide more affordable choices for consumers suffering from hearing loss.\u000a\u000aEvery day, HLAA interacts with Americans who just want to hear well enough to stay on the job, participate in their community, or enjoy their retirement years. It would be wonderful if we could tell them they have affordable choices so they can live well with hearing loss.

He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Last month, when President Donald Trump was asked by The New York Times if special counsel Robert Mueller would be crossing a line if he started investigating the finances of Trump and his family, the President said, "I think that's a violation. Look, this is about Russia."\u000a\u000aThe President is absolutely correct. Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\u000a\u000aAccording to a CNN article, Mueller's investigators could be looking into financial records relating to the Trump Organization that are unrelated to the 2016 election. According to these reports, "sources described an investigation that has widened to focus on possible financial crimes, some unconnected to the 2016 election." The piece goes on to cite law enforcement sources who say non-Russia-related leads that "involve Trump associates" are being referred to the special counsel "to encourage subjects of the investigation to cooperate."\u000a\u000aThis information is deeply concerning to me. It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Subpoenas issued in Russia investigation Replay More Videos ...

aVBut he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\u000a\u000aTen Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.\u000a\u000aHis hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound.\u000a\u000a"I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aWith no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.\u000a\u000aPhotographer Pieter ten Hoopen\u000a\u000aThe studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.\u000a\u000aOne by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.\u000a\u000a"This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aThe project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.\u000a\u000aThe photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.\u000a\u000aWhether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aThe word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.\u000a\u000a"They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible," he said. "I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective."\u000a\u000aThe studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.\u000a\u000a"I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aHe said some patients at the hospital "had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio."\u000a\u000aI build classic photo studios ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten Hoopen\u000a\u000aTen-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.\u000a\u000aHawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.\u000a\u000aTen Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.\u000a\u000a"I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment," he said. "It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you."\u000a\u000aHow did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?\u000a\u000a"It wasn't hard," he said. "I just told them to relax and have fun.\u000a\u000a"Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature."

aVMcDonald's is betting that Chinese consumers are hungry for more.\u000a\u000aThe world's largest fast food chain announced Tuesday that it plans to open 2,000 new restaurants across the world's most populous nation in just over five years, bringing the total to 4,500.\u000a\u000a"China will soon become our largest market outside of the United States," said McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook.\u000a\u000aThe company and its new business partners in China -- investment firms Citic and Carlyle Group -- are hoping the new outlets will help drive double-digit sales growth for the business every year for the next five years. They're targeting smaller Chinese cities in particular.\u000a\u000aRelated: McDonald's comeback kicks into high gear\u000a\u000aThe new plans come after McDonald's sold off most of the China business to Citic and Carlyle, saying they would bring a better understanding of the local market. Under the deal announced earlier this year, McDonald's still holds a 20% stake in the business.\u000a\u000aThe move was part of Easterbrook's ongoing efforts to overhaul the global burger chain. The company's latest financial results pleased investors, with a rise in U.S. sales providing more evidence that Americans are returning to the golden arches.\u000a\u000aMcDonald's isn't the only big U.S. company whose brand is moving deeper into China.\u000a\u000aStarbucks (SBUX) announced plans last year to open more than one new store a day in China for the next five years.

aVBeijing (CNN) The global outpouring of grief and anguish over Liu Xiaobo's death stands in marked contrast to the muted reaction in his homeland.\u000a\u000aThe Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer and human rights activist died Thursday evening of liver cancer while in custody at a hospital in Shenyang in northeastern China. He was 61.\u000a\u000aLiu's funeral was held Saturday morning in Shenyang and attended by his "family members and close friends," according to a city government spokesman. Liu's body had been cremated, and his ashes had been dropped into the sea in a private ceremony, he said.\u000a\u000a"The authorities can't afford to see Liu's grave turn into a landmark and symbol where people gather to pay tribute," said Hu Jia, a leading Chinese human rights activist who has known Liu's wife for years and has served prison terms for his own advocacy. "They want to erase all traces of him."\u000a\u000a"But three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered by water," he added. "His grave is now everywhere."\u000a\u000aIn a government-organized news conference, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother -- who Liu's supporters say had never approved his activism -- on Saturday afternoon expressed the family's "profuse gratitude" to the state for showing "humanity" in providing medical treatment and arranging "perfect" funeral services for Liu. He left without taking questions.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese government, which had long banned Liu's work and even his name, continues to censor the story of his death, deleting social media posts mourning him -- including those simply displaying the image of a burning candle -- and blocking online searches containing variations of his name and famed quotes.\u000a\u000aCNN's broadcast is blacked out in China every time Liu's images or story appear.\u000a\u000aA poster of Liu Xiaobo is held up during a protest in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aDomestic media outlets, all controlled by the ruling Communist Party, mostly have ignored the news. Dominating Friday's front page of the party mouthpiece, People's Daily, was a photo of a beaming President Xi Jinping meeting his Canadian counterpart.\u000a\u000aA few English-language outlets carried short reports on Liu's death, highlighting his "criminal" background and Chinese doctors' effort to save him.\u000a\u000a'Inciting subversion'\u000a\u000aBefore he was granted medical parole last month, Liu had been serving a 11-year prison sentence for "inciting subversion of state power." His conviction in late 2009 stemmed from his co-authorship of a manifesto calling for human rights and political reform in China.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, while he was in prison, the Nobel committee awarded Liu the peace prize for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" -- a move that infuriated Beijing.\u000a\u000aIn a harshly worded, English-language editorial published Friday by the nationalistic tabloid, The Global Times, the state-run newspaper painted Liu as "a victim led astray by West."\u000a\u000a"Liu lived in an era when China witnessed the most rapid growth in recent history, but he attempted to confront Chinese mainstream society under Western support," it said. "This has determined his tragic life."\u000a\u000a"The West has bestowed upon Liu a halo, which will not linger," it added.\u000a\u000aA protester holds up a picture of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo on June 30, 2017, in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aThe newspaper had posted a since-deleted message in Chinese on Sina Weibo, a platform similar to Twitter, mocking the international reactions to Liu's death: "The person's gone but a blockbuster tear-jerker is just on -- we'll sit back and enjoy the show."\u000a\u000a'Improper comments'\u000a\u000aAmid an avalanche of condolences and condemnations from politicians and activists around the world, the Chinese government took the unusual step of issuing a statement shortly after 2 a.m. Friday to respond to what it called "improper comments" by foreign officials.\u000a\u000a"The handling of Liu Xiaobo's case belongs to China's domestic affairs, and foreign countries are in no position to make improper remarks," said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. "We call on relevant countries to respect China's judicial sovereignty and not to meddle in China's domestic affairs with this individual case."\u000a\u000aThe statement was sent directly to foreign journalists and was nowhere to be found on the ministry's website -- just like all previous official responses to questions about Liu.\u000a\u000aChina has conveyed its "strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" to all governments and international entities that commented on Liu's death, including the United States and the United Nations' human rights commission, Geng said at a regular news briefing Friday afternoon.\u000a\u000aChina's warning seems to have gone unheeded, with even the US President -- not known as a public champion of human rights activists -- expressing his sorrow over Liu's death and calling him a "political prisoner" in a statement.\u000a\u000aEchoing myriad other world leaders, Donald Trump made a point of mentioning Liu Xia, a poet and artist who married Liu Xiaobo in 1996 while he was serving an earlier prison sentence.\u000a\u000aLiu Xiaobo has become an icon of the democracy movement in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aAs her husband remained behind bars until recently, Liu Xia, 56, paid a heavy price for simply being his wife. Under de facto house arrest since his Nobel win, Liu Xia saw her communication with the outside world almost completely cut by the government.\u000a\u000aShe has been suffering severe depression, according to close friends, especially after authorities sentenced her brother to 11 years in prison over what supporters call trumped-up charges of business fraud.\u000a\u000aStruggle continues\u000a\u000aNow, Liu Xia is increasingly the focus of an international campaign calling for her freedom and right to live abroad, which many friends and supporters say were her husband's dying wishes.\u000a\u000a"He loved her so much that he felt he owed it to her," said Liao Yiwu, a prominent Chinese writer and longtime friend of the Lius who now lives in Germany.\u000a\u000a"He didn't know about her condition and what had happened at home until not that long ago," Liao said. "That's why he agreed to go abroad with her."\u000a\u000aIn a hastily arranged news conference in Shenyang after his death, Liu Xiaobo's Chinese doctors acknowledged for the first time that he had sought treatment overseas but insisted that his medical condition by then had made international travel impossible.\u000a\u000aThey confirmed that Liu Xia was by her husband's bedside when he died -- and his last words urged her to "live a good life."\u000a\u000aDespite worldwide solidarity behind Liu Xia, many supporters sense the Chinese government's fear of her turning into an international symbol and rallying cry for human rights. They foresee an uphill battle for her ahead.\u000a\u000a"Few knew Liu Xiaobo's thoughts in the last eight years, but she did, and they talked during his last days," said Hu, the Chinese activist. "I think the authorities are afraid of seeing even the simplest last words from him get out and spread."\u000a\u000aGeng, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, repeatedly declined to say Friday whether the government would allow Liu Xia to leave China, insisting that Beijing would handle her case "in accordance with law."\u000a\u000a"Liu Xia is free," the Shenyang city government spokesman said Saturday, but needs privacy to mourn her painful loss.\u000a\u000aIn government handout photos of her husband's funeral, a grief-stricken Liu Xia, wearing all black and sunglasses, can be seen bowing to the open casket and holding a portrait of Liu Xiaobo.\u000a\u000aThe authorities later released videos that they said proved Liu Xia's consent to the burial arrangement. One clip purportedly shows a handwritten note by Liu Xia on Thursday requesting a private sea burial, while the other appears to be a hidden-camera recording of her saying the same thing.\u000a\u000aIn a brief appearance before reporters, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother said Liu Xia was unable to join him due to her "extremely weak condition" that may require medical attention. He did not respond to shouted questions about her whereabouts amid growing international concern over her freedom and welfare.\u000a\u000aAcross the closely monitored cyberspace in China, some internet users have evaded censors to post lines from Liu Xia's poems that were dedicated to her late husband -- including verses from "Wind": "Walls make you suffocate / you are the wind, and the wind / never tells me / when it comes and when it goes."

The structure costs $27,000.\u000a\u000aThe ready-to-use homes have been designed to offer flexibility to homeowners, said British architect David Martyn, who founded Ten Fold Engineering seven years ago.\u000a\u000a"In our new world, we need agility because things change all the time," he said. "Nothing else can be moved at the speed that modern life demands.\u000a\u000a"The question was: 'Can you actually get something that is big enough to be useful, to work in and to carry the things you need?'" Martyn said. "We tried to develop something that could be transported using traditional systems like trucks; that could unload without cranes or workmen; and that could be done in minutes, so you didn't lose any time."\u000a\u000aAlthough initially designed as homes, the structures can be used as offices, shops, restaurants or exhibitions. This flexibility is crucial, said Martyn.\u000a\u000a"You could have it up on a mountain in the winter and on the beach in the summer," he said. "I know that sounds like just a rich person's thing, but it isn't. A school could have a classroom (in one place) during term time (and) elsewhere during summer.

aV(CNN) A night out drinking in Vietnam used to mean one thing: sipping Bia Hoi, a local draft beer with 3% alcohol content, from a tiny stool on the sidewalk.\u000a\u000aBut feather-light lagers aren't the only game in town anymore.\u000a\u000aThe country's craft beer scene is booming, having welcomed more than a dozen micro-breweries in the past two years.\u000a\u000a"The beer culture in Vietnam starts with Bia Hoi," Hao Tran, managing editor of lifestyle website Vietcetera , tells CNN. The craft beer scene that has evolved has done so from people drinking beer in the Old Quarter in Hanoi or Bui Vien Street in Saigon, he says.\u000a\u000a"But there's so much more to beer culture in Vietnam now than just that particular image."\u000a\u000aTapping new tastes\u000a\u000aPasteur Street Brewing Company draws a crowd.\u000a\u000aVietnam is one of the biggest beer consumers in Asia drinking 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.\u000a\u000aand Bia Hoi still account for the lion's share of that consumption, in Ho Chi Minh City alone artisan brewers such as Pasteur Street Brewing Co, Winking Seal, While stalwart brands such as Tiger, Saigon Beer,and Bia Hoi still account for the lion's share of that consumption, in Ho Chi Minh City alone artisan brewers such as Platinum Heart of Darkness , and Fuzzy Logic are providing a real alternative, says Tran.\u000a\u000aThe brands have, for example, introduced potent Indian pale ales (IPAs) and sour gose -- a tart and salty style of German beer -- to the market.\u000a\u000a"As Vietnam has continued to experience income growth and taste for global concepts and standards, that's where craft beer has really come in," says Tran.\u000a\u000a"The tastes and preferences of Vietnamese consumers are changing and evolving."\u000a\u000aWhat's brewing\u000a\u000aOne of Vietnam's craft pioneers, Pasteur Street Brewing Co opened its doors in 2015 and now distributes not only all over Vietnam, but also to Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong, and the United States -- with Japan and Europe to come later this year.\u000a\u000aFor the past two years, Pasteur Street has been leading the revolt against boring lagers and predictable pale ales -- an effort that was rewarded with three gold medals at the 2016 Asian Beer Medal competition.\u000a\u000aalso behind Helmed by Americans John Reid and Alex Violette -- the latter isalso behind Upslope Brewing Company , in Colorado -- the brewery imports its hops from the US and malts from Europe, but adds a local touch to every recipe.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Vietnam's new brews The usual nightlife scene in Vietnam revolves around drinking Bia Hoi -- most commonly consumed street-side on tiny plastic stools. At 30 cents a pint, it's a light and easy choice with just 3% alcohol content.

You see craft beer happening in America, maybe some Vietnamese go visit family in California ... and they say: 'How come we don't have this in our country?'"\u000a\u000aA welcome change\u000a\u000aWhile many of the first microbreweries were set up by foreigners, Vietnamese entrepreneurs have also joined the mix.\u000a\u000aNewly opened East West Brewing Company , for example, is run by Loc Truong, a Vietnamese-American who worked at Anheuser-Busch InBev -- the company behind brands such as Stella Artois and Corona -- before striking out with his founding partners.\u000a\u000a"My being Vietnamese helps the craft beer industry, for sure, because that's one step to connect with the market," says Truong, who was born in Vietnam but studied in the US. "Why do people buy craft beer? It's higher quality, but who's behind it also adds value."\u000a\u000aTruong's lightly hopped beers, such as the East West Pale Ale, he says, provide a stepping stone to stronger flavors for new craft converts.\u000a\u000aFrom there, it gets more challenging, with a bolder Far East IPA, Coffee Vanilla Porter, or 12% ABV Independence Stout.\u000a\u000aThat's alongside Asia-inspired varieties, such as Le Wit, a wit-style beer made with Asian pear, and a dainty Saigon Rose that's infused with raspberries.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people don't know that there are so many different types of flavors in beer," says Truong.\u000a\u000a"We'll see customers coming back five or six times a week, saying they can't drink the traditional lagers or (Bia Hoi beer) anymore. Once they tried craft, they never went back."\u000a\u000aBuilding a bridge\u000a\u000aEast West Brewing Company's set up.\u000a\u000aIn the land of 30-cent drafts of Bia Hoi, charging consumers $5 for craft draft remains a challenge.\u000a\u000aAn on-site brewery was a crucial part of the persuasion strategy for East West Brewing Company, which opened in January.\u000a\u000a"It's all about really educating our (Vietnamese) consumers," Loc Truong, founder of East West Brewing Company , tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"You cannot show them what craft beer is if you don't have a craft brewery to really guide them through."\u000a\u000aIt helps that breweries and bars serving craft beers tend to be clustered in Ho Chi Minh City around central areas of Districts 1 and 2, where there's lots of foot traffic.\u000a\u000aAs a result, new beer-oriented tours have added to the buzz, such as the bar and brewery motorbike excursion operated by Vespa Adventures\u000a\u000aTruong and his team are based in the heart of District 1.\u000a\u000aInside the massive glass building, guests can mingle at the industrial-chic bar and restaurant downstairs, soak up the sun on the rooftop, or take a tour of the steel fermenting tanks and barrel-aging room.\u000a\u000aBefore opening, Truong expected expats and travelers to drive sales, but he was pleasantly surprised that 85% of his patrons were Vietnamese in the first six months of business.\u000a\u000aTruong says that is partly due to a growing middle class in Vietnam.\u000a\u000aWith a 6% annual increase in GDP per capita, the Boston Consulting Group predicts Vietnam's middle class will account for 23% of the population of 95 million by 2020, up from 16% in 2015.\u000a\u000a"Vietnam moves very, very fast," says Truong. "One thing catches on and the next thing you know, the whole market is shifting."

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge impact on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000a(CNN) tl;dr version : You can vote on the first story I'll report as part of this new series on 2 degrees Celsius -- which is the agreed-upon threshold for dangerous climate change. Go here if you don't see the poll . Thanks!\u000a\u000a* * * * *\u000a\u000aIn 2013, I did something that's a little scary for a journalist.\u000a\u000aI asked you to tell me what to cover.\u000a\u000aThose experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of democratic journalism. Editors shouldn't get all the control. You, the audience, have a vital say, too.\u000a\u000aStill, in the two years since I asked for your ideas, I haven't done much, if anything, to address one of the topics you most frequently asked me to cover : climate change.\u000a\u000aI'm hoping to make good on your request now.\u000a\u000aStarting today, Earth Day, I'm planning to spend the rest of the year writing about one tiny little number -- 2 degrees. It may be the most important number you've never heard of.\u000a\u000aMaybe that plan sounds excessive.\u000a\u000a(Eight months reporting on one number!?)\u000a\u000aBut here's why it matters: If we humans warm the world more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), we greatly up the odds of climate catastrophes.\u000a\u000aThink super droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions and acidifying oceans.\u000a\u000aWe don't want to cross that mark.\u000a\u000aHumans never have lived in post-2-degree world, said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, based in Germany, and author of a paper on this history of 2 degrees.\u000a\u000a"If we start warming the planet way beyond what humans have ever experienced, God knows what will wait for us," he told me.\u000a\u000aGood news, though. If we drastically cut carbon emissions, we can stay below the 2-degree threshold. As part of this series, I'll be exploring exactly what it would take to do so.\u000a\u000aThis matters a great deal this year, since the United Nations will gather leaders and policy experts in Paris in December to try to hammer out a new international agreement on climate change. Two degrees will be one useful benchmark to see if the world is on track.\u000a\u000a"It's almost kind of like a truth keeping mechanism," said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute. "It would be hard if it didn't exist to have a sense of whether countries are on track or not."\u000a\u000aIt's not a perfect yardstick. But it's a reasonable one. Think of it like a speed limit, said Jaeger, the economist in Germany. Would a 51 mph limit be better than 50? Or maybe it should be 49? The point isn't the exact number, it's the ballpark: 200 mph would certainly be too fast, as he put it, but 20 mph is too slow.\u000a\u000aFor climate change, the point is we don't know the world will fall into crisis at exactly 2 degrees and not 2.1 or 1.8. But that range is certainly dangerous.\u000a\u000a"The way I think of it is like smoking," said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech. "How many cigarettes are too many? I don't know. I have no idea. Nobody has any idea. But we do know the more cigarettes you smoke, the greater the risk."\u000a\u000aTwo degrees, then, is our most educated estimate. A way to focus attention.\u000a\u000aIt's incredibly valuable in that respect.\u000a\u000aSince the number emerged from a relatively obscure academic paper in the 1970s, it's become widely agreed upon in the international community. In 2009, for example, 114 countries initially signed onto the "Copenhagen Accord," a nonbinding agreement that recognizes the "scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius."\u000a\u000aThat level of consensus is rare on this topic.\u000a\u000a"If there's one thing the world has agreed upon about climate change it's 2 degrees should be the benchmark," said Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org , an advocacy group.\u000a\u000aI'll be writing more about the origins of 2 degrees soon -- where this number came from (one guy, turns out, and I chatted with him), how soon we may cross that mark if we don't take action (short answer: 2050), and how much we've warmed the planet since the start of the industrial revolution, in the late 1800s, which is how these temperature increases are usually measured (0.85 degrees).\u000a\u000aRight now, though, I'd like to ask you to do something that's scary and exciting.\u000a\u000aI want you to vote on the first project I'll report for this series.\u000a\u000aAll of the options center on one theme: What does a post-2-degree world look like?\u000a\u000aI love that question because it -- like all six choices you'll see below -- came from you.\u000a\u000aCNN hosted a Facebook chat on Friday , asking our audience to come up with questions for me about climate change or about 2 degrees of warming. Many of you said you wanted to know what a 2-degree world would have in store, in general. Other folks asked about specific impacts to people and ecosystems if the climate continues to inch toward that dangerous 2-degree mark.\u000a\u000aClay Miller, from Alaska, for example, asked about the Arctic.\u000a\u000aCindy Johnson wanted to know which animals would go extinct first.\u000a\u000aJon Locke was among those curious about farms.\u000a\u000aAnd many of you, including Kayla Helton, from Florida, asked about rising seas. Kelly, a 48-year-old from California, wanted to know what would happen to "climate refugees" as the coast vanishes.\u000a\u000aTell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees Posted by CNN on Tuesday, April 21, 2015\u000a\u000aThe topic with the most votes on Monday at 5 p.m. ET is the one I'll report in May.\u000a\u000aLook for more votes like this in the future as we explore this number together.\u000a\u000aIf you'd like to follow along, consider subscribing to my "2-degree" newsletter\u000a\u000asocial Or you can track me down on the usual networks , including Snapchat.\u000a\u000aI'm @jdsutter on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\u000a\u000aI think of this kind of like non-fiction improv: You throw out the prompts, and I'll go out there looking for the most interesting and informative story. It's an experiment, to be sure. And it scares the hell out of me. But climate change is a topic so big -- so critical to the future of our planet and humanity species -- that we've gotta be in this together.

aVFew places in the world have felt the pain of low oil prices like Saudi Arabia.\u000a\u000aCuts to the bloated public sector have changed the economic prospects for many Saudis. But one local industry is emerging as a winner from the oil bust.\u000a\u000aThe oil crunch is proving a "blessing in disguise" for the country's young tech sector, said Abdulrahman Tarabzouni, a former regional manager for Google (GOOGL, Tech30).\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia is pumping tens of billions of dollars into technology in an attempt to diversify its economy and become less reliant on volatile oil prices.\u000a\u000a"Any individual has a shot now at creating something extremely valuable and accessible to the rest of the world," Tarabzouni told young entrepreneurs and business leaders at a recent forum in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\u000a\u000aMany local and national governments dream of imitating Silicon Valley's success, but the Saudis at least have the cash to make a serious attempt.\u000a\u000aThe kingdom's sovereign wealth fund has already announced plans to pour $45 billion into a tech fund with Japan's Softbank (SFTBF). In June, the Saudi fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia has also set up tech incubators and established venture capital funds with headquarters in Riyadh and offices in Menlo Park, California. Among them is Riyadh Taqnia Capital, which has committed to investing over $100 million in local tech firms.\u000a\u000aRelated: Saudi Arabia and Burj Khalifa developer launch Gulf answer to Amazon\u000a\u000aAmerican tech investor Christopher Schroeder said that what he sees happening in Saudi Arabia represents a deeper entrepreneurial streak running through the Middle East.\u000a\u000a"There are remarkable surprises," he said at the forum. "Over 25% of these startups are run by women. Some of the hardest working entrepreneurs I've met are women -- across the Arab world.\u000a\u000aFemale entrepreneurs are seizing the opportunity to assert themselves in Saudi Arabia's male-dominated culture.\u000a\u000aLateefa Alwaalan, CEO and founder of Yatooq, a startup disrupting the Arabic coffee market with hardware which cuts the time it takes to prepare a drink, says the restrictions on women - especially the Saudi ban on driving -- means being extra creative to help each other.\u000a\u000a"I knew I wanted to hire women. So when I was looking for factories, instead of looking on the outskirts, I got space inside the city so transportation would be easier for them," says the Seattle-educated Alwaalan. "I also include the cost of a driver in their salary."\u000a\u000aSilicon Valley entrepreneurs are watching closely. Jeff Martin helped developed iTunes and is now CEO of Tribal Planet. A frequent visitor to the Gulf countries, he believes governments in the region are paving the way for innovation by digitizing services for citizens.\u000a\u000aRelated: Saudis believe Trump will unleash America's economy\u000a\u000a"In the Gulf countries, and Saudi [Arabia] especially, the notion that citizens are consumers and consumer are citizens, is what I see governments here doing much more intelligently than in other parts of the world," he said.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia's leading entrepreneurs say their biggest challenge is finding talent. And the sector will have to live in the shadow of oil for a while longer.\u000a\u000a"My biggest [challenge] is still getting people to work for a startup instead of the big Saudi brands like [oil giant] Aramco," said Salman AlSuhaibani, CEO and founder of roadside assistance app Morni.

aVOn this day 10 years ago, lines of Apple faithful formed outside of the company's stores across the U.S.\u000a\u000aSome had staked out their spots days before. They brought folding chairs, umbrellas, sleeping bags and, in San Francisco, one mattress. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) handed out bottles of water. People offered to sell their spots in line for hundreds of dollars.\u000a\u000aA few people were doing it for publicity, but many just wanted to be among the first to own the expensive new smartphone Apple had announced six months earlier.\u000a\u000aIt was the kind of dramatic frenzy any tech company would have killed for, and that Apple specializes in manufacturing. Luckily, its product would live up to the hype, selling more than a billion devices over a decade and changing technology forever.\u000a\u000aRelated: Inside Apple: How the iPhone almost never happened\u000a\u000a"I think that everybody was very, very relieved that when the iPhone ultimately launched at the end of June in 2007, that it actually worked," said tech journalist Fred Vogelstein, who wrote a book on the smartphone race between Apple and Google (GOOGL, Tech30).\u000a\u000aSince that day, Apple has grown the iPhone into its most popular and reliable product. It sold more than 50 million iPhones in the first three months of 2017 alone, bringing in $33.2 billion.\u000a\u000aLooking back at the first iPhone, its limitations seem quaint: It was expensive, starting at $499 for 4GB of memory; it only worked on AT&T's EDGE network; and there was no App Store to speak of.\u000a\u000aNow the company releases a new version of the device every year, sprinkling on new features like water resistance or a fingerprint sensor to entice people to upgrade. All of the specs have been radically improved over the years, from the chip to the camera resolution. And the original size looks quaint 10 years later -- Apple now sells versions that are nearly two times as big.\u000a\u000aThe iPhone's success has had a halo effect on other products and industries. Apple went on to make the iPad, a tablet version of the iPhone. It added an App Store to iOS in 2008. Developers have built careers and billion dollar companies on iPhone apps. Apple says developers around the world have earned more than $16 billion.\u000a\u000aThere's even a movie based on characters that were made famous in iPhone games (that flopped, but still).\u000a\u000a"It is truly remarkable that in the 10 year span of the iPhone being on the market, it has disrupted the telecom industry, the music industry, the television industry, the video industry, the computer industry, the communications industry -- and that's just a start," said analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies.\u000a\u000aNot all the disruption has been in Apple's favor. Released a year and a half after the iPhone, Google's Android mobile operating system has been the biggest competitor to Apple's iOS. Android phones accounted for 84% of the market in the first quarter of this year, according to Gartner.\u000a\u000aRelated: How Android beat the iPhone to world domination\u000a\u000aDespite the competition, people still look to Apple for the next big thing. And after 10 years, it's become restless.\u000a\u000aApple's strength lies in its ability to take existing features and refine, repackage and market them as if they are brand new, according to Tuong Nguyen, an analyst at Gartner. He said the next industries it could push forward are augmented reality and voice interfaces, places where other companies are already doing more work.\u000a\u000aFor now, Apple is focusing on a special version of the iPhone that's expected to come out this fall. It could have conductive charging and an edge-to-edge display. (CEO Tim Cook has blamed slumping iPhone sales on excitement for the new device.)\u000a\u000aWhatever its features when it's unveiled in September, whether mind-blowing or disappointing, people will still line up outside of Apple stores, excited to be the first to touch the latest creation.

aVStory by Vanessa Yurkevich; Video by Nicholas Lindner, Olivia Camerini & Steven Sevilla \u2022 Updated 7th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 There are two sides to the Hamptons.\u000a\u000aOne is the chaos during summer when thousands of 20- and 30-somethings descend on the island to party. The other is the tranquility of being 125 miles away from New York City\u000a\u000aThe Hamptons are made up of villages and towns that are bordered by the Long Island Sound (oftentimes referred to as the bay) and the Atlantic Ocean.\u000a\u000aSouthampton, Watermill, East Hampton, Bridgehampton and Amagansett sit on the Atlantic side, while Sag Harbor and the Springs touch the bay.\u000a\u000aMontauk is at the very tip and is the only village that shares both bodies of water. It's got more of a beach town/surfer vibe compared with Southampton's more suburban landscape.\u000a\u000aRegardless of location, the Hamptons have changed over the past decade.\u000a\u000aThere are simply more people, more noise, more annoying-ness. But the Hamptons are still a getaway where you can breathe in clean air and be at one with nature. And the best way to enjoy the Hamptons today is like with everything else in life -- a healthy balance.\u000a\u000aPartying: Pick your poison\u000a\u000aThe Surf Lodge\u000a\u000aThe three words most spoken by millennials in the Hamptons (or at least a close second to "rosé all day") are "The Surf Lodge."\u000a\u000aThere's a traffic jam just to get there, and then the real wait starts.\u000a\u000aThe venue has been around for 10 years, but it still attracts people in droves. The line to get in is always an hour long, and getting in feels like a small victory. There's a stage for bands, and a wooden deck and beach area that looks out onto Fort Pond. "Magic hour" -- when the sun is about an hour away from setting -- really is magical.\u000a\u000aThe best way to get in is to book a dinner reservation, even if it's at 5 p.m. That way you skip the line and you're already inside when the band starts playing at 6. When big musical guests are in town, eager fans will bring their kayaks, boats, inner tubes (whatever they can find) and park themselves in the pond to get a glimpse.\u000a\u000aThe Surf Lodge , 183 Edgemere St, Montauk, NY 11954; +1 631-483-037\u000a\u000a"Magic hour" truly earns its name.\u000a\u000aThe Grey Lady\u000a\u000aNear Gosman's Dock, The Grey Lady is one of the few going-out places on the bay side of Montauk.\u000a\u000aThe place has a rustic nautical feel,with picnic tables for nice group dinners. But once 10 p.m. rolls around it's more of a "meet me on the dance floor" kind of place. The DJs are pretty good and there's a nice outdoor space to escape the sweaty dance space.\u000a\u000aThe line to get in isn't as extreme as Surf Lodge, but be prepared to wait.\u000a\u000aThe Grey Lady , 440 W Lake Dr, Montauk, NY 11954; +1 631-210-6249\u000a\u000aShagwong\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for a dance floor sans the millennial debauchery, head to Shagwong Tavern . It's a no-frills bar with solid bar food right in the center of Montauk.\u000a\u000aThe bands are old school, the dress code is more casual, and people are there simply to have a good time, not so much to be seen. It's a judgment-free zone, and dancing is encouraged. You'll even find some locals cutting a rug there too!\u000a\u000aShagwong Tavern , 774 Montauk Highway, Montauk, NY 11954; + 1 631-668-3050\u000a\u000aAfter the party: Find your detox\u000a\u000aThe competition to get into a workout class in the Hamptons is no joke. (What happened to vacations being about relaxation?)\u000a\u000aRecently, boutique fitness studios like Barry's Bootcamp, SLT, Tracy Anderson and Soulcycle have all opened studios "out east," and spots fill up quickly.\u000a\u000aAt a 11:45 a.m. Soulcycle class in an old barn in Bridgehampton, there were 75 riders and not a free bike in sight.\u000a\u000aThe workout is legit, and many of the best NYC-based instructors come out to the Hamptons to teach in the summer.\u000a\u000aMandala Yoga in Amagansett is a more relaxed speed. The ground-floor studio has a lot of natural light and there's a cool breeze. Most of the yoga teachers are year-round residents which makes the classes feel more like a community.\u000a\u000aAfter a good workout, you can stop by Happy Bowls for an acai bowl. There's usually a wait to get your food, so we'd recommend placing an order then strolling around town. Our favorite toppings are strawberries, blueberries, coconut and honey.\u000a\u000aSoulcycle , 264 Butter Lane, Bridgehampton, NY 11932; +1 631-537-3630\u000a\u000aMandala Yoga , 10 Amagansett Square Drive Amagansett, NY 11930; +1 631-267-6144\u000a\u000aHappy Bowls , 805 Montauk Highway, Montauk, NY 11954\u000a\u000aChow time: Seafood is king\u000a\u000aLunch is served in Montauk.\u000a\u000aThe lobster roll is synonymous with the east end, which is why there is a restaurant called The Lobster Roll in Amagansett. It's known to locals simply as "LUNCH."\u000a\u000aThe warm lobster roll is a must: The bun is perfectly toasted and there is a generous portion of lobster. The restaurant has an extensive menu: fried blowfish, kale salads, burgers, fish platters and lots of lobster. The restaurant has been owned by the same family for 52 years, but they are changing with the times. There's now an entire gluten-free menu too.\u000a\u000aCrow's Nest is newer to town and more upscale, but it still retains the chill Montauk vibe. There's a casual lakeside bar for cocktails and mingling, which is perfect at sunset. Just up the hill is the restaurant, which overlooks Lake Montauk. Must-haves are the blue crab claw tagliatelle and the curried vegetable ragout.\u000a\u000aGosman's Inlet Cafe in Montauk has incredible sushi. We recommend the summer roll. It's not the traditional cucumber-and-fake-crab one you're used to; this one changes every summer, but there's always a delicious piece of fish usually topped with mango and a delicious sauce.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant overlooks the channel where the fishing boats come in after their day's catch. The sushi is so fresh it tastes like it came right off the boat. Gosman's dock was founded in 1943, and the restaurants there still serve fresh seafood.\u000a\u000aThe Lobster Roll ; 1980 Montauk Hwy, Amagansett, NY 11930; +1 631-267-3740\u000a\u000aCrow's Nest ; 4 Old West Lake Dr, Montauk, NY 11954; +1 631-668-2077\u000a\u000aGosman's Inlet Cafe ; 484 W Lake Dr, Montauk, NY 11954; +1 631-668-2549\u000a\u000aSleep: A night next to the ocean\u000a\u000aIt's impossible not to relax with a view like this.\u000a\u000aOne word you can apply to a Hamptons hotel is "cute." There are really charming places to stay if you're in town for a weekend.\u000a\u000aThe top of the line is Gurney's in Montauk. It has breathtaking views of the Atlantic Ocean, an amazing in-house restaurant (Scarpetta, which is also in Manhattan) and a great Sunday beach party.\u000a\u000aAlthough not as elaborate a spread as Gurney's, the newly opened 30-room HERO Beach Club is quaint and a little closer to town. It has a new-age Canyon Ranch vibe with a 1950s twist and the rooms are millennial chic.\u000a\u000aWe also love The Maidstone Hotel in East Hampton. It was recently redone and has the charm of a bed and breakfast. It has 19 rooms and three cottages and the new design is a "whimsical take on the traditional Americana/Hamptons aesthetic." There are free bikes for cruising around town, and a great swing on the front porch.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the spectrum is camping at the Hither Hills Campsite . Situated between Montauk and Amagansett, you can park your car, RV or whatever in between the beach dunes right on the Atlantic Ocean. It's simple, easy living with a milliondollar view.\u000a\u000aCamping not your thing? Try Driftwood Resort down the road. Both the campsite and resort are on a more secluded part of the beach than some of the other hotels, so it's a great way to escape the chaos. Driftwood has beach or dune-facing rooms that can sleep up to four people. Both views make waking up with morning coffee even more enjoyable. The resort also provides beach chairs and umbrellas for free -- a big deal in the Hamptons.\u000a\u000aGurney's , 290 Old Montauk Hwy, Montauk, NY 11954; +1 631-668-2345\u000a\u000aHERO Beach Club , 626 Montauk Hwy, Montauk, NY 11954; +1 631-668-9825\u000a\u000aThe Maidstone Hotel , 207 Main St, East Hampton, NY 11937; +1 631-324-5006\u000a\u000aHither Hills Campsite , 164 Old Montauk Hwy, Montauk, NY 11954; +1 631-668-2554

aV(CNN) If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox.\u000a\u000aBut whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating.\u000a\u000aIn fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar.\u000a\u000aBut there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin.\u000a\u000a"Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old," said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of "The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great." "What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging."\u000a\u000aSugar addiction\u000a\u000aHere's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. "People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar," Alpert said. "We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Why sugar intake has increased Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why sugar intake has increased 02:52\u000a\u000aAbout 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff.\u000a\u000a"People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aHow to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three days\u000a\u000aThe good news is that even if you're not a true sugar "addict," by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance.\u000a\u000a"There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets," Lustig said.\u000a\u000aChildren can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed.\u000a\u000aBut going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.\u000a\u000a"Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clichéd and not effective," Alpert said. "It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.\u000a\u000a"What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate," she said. "They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to."\u000a\u000aSo for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. "You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats."\u000a\u000aFor example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.\u000a\u000aThough they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. "These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aConsuming artificial sweeteners causes "you not only (to) store more fat," Lustig explained, "you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage."\u000a\u000aHow to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candy\u000a\u000aOnce the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple.\u000a\u000a"By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy," Alpert said. "The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again."\u000a\u000aStarting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. "Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aYou can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too.\u000a\u000aDuring week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.\u000a\u000aFor week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.\u000a\u000a"Week three should be quite livable," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aWeek four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week.\u000a\u000a"You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier," Alpert said. "I want people living. Week four is the way to do it."\u000a\u000aWeek four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. "Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one," Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days.\u000a\u000a"The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aBenefits and cautions with slashing sugar\u000a\u000aDetoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. "We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction," Alpert said. "Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!"\u000a\u000aParticipants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Natural sweeteners Photos: Natural sweeteners Although maple syrup contains some vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the amounts in a typical serving are quite small.

Plus, it has been shown to have higher antioxidant levels than any other sweetener. Hide Caption 5 of 5\u000a\u000a"I have lost approximately 40 pounds following the sugar detox," said Diane, who preferred not to share her last name. She has been on the plan for approximately two years.\u000a\u000a"I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes."\u000a\u000aDiane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. "This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal."\u000a\u000aThere are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive.\u000a\u000a"Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue," Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided.\u000a\u000a"If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit. But if you can push through and stay well-hydrated, you can really break your cycle of sugar addiction," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIt's important to note that the plan may not be appropriate for diabetics, extreme athletes or anyone taking medication to control blood sugar. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.\u000a\u000aFinally, before starting a sugar detox, enlist the help of friends and/or family members for support. "You need people around you to help you be successful," Lustig said. "The whole family has to do it together."

aV(CNN) "The Dark Tower" feels like a throwback -- a trim, competently executed "B" popcorn movie, adapted from Stephen King's books with ample action but also lots of clunky exposition. That's not a great prescription for a would-be summer blockbuster, but more an endorsement to watch when it hits cable.\u000a\u000aAlthough King's name is an obvious selling point -- his spotty page-to-screen track record notwithstanding -- the film's underlying tone and template owe debts to another Steven, Spielberg. From its adolescent hero discovering his greater purpose to the drawings that channel images deeply embedded in his consciousness, themes present in "E.T." and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" initially come to mind.\u000a\u000aOf course, part of that has to do with the myriad sources that King drew upon in establishing this universe, which has been awkwardly condensed to fit into a 95-minute movie. The result is a film whose plot is sheer simplicity -- young boy teams with grizzled man-of-few-words to save the world -- while allowing the details to basically just spill out in between fight scenes.\u000a\u000aTom Taylor plays young Jake, whose disturbing visions have his widowed mom ("Vikings'" Katheryn Winnick) at her wits end. In fact, she's about to commit the lad to an asylum when Jake receives a tangible clue that his intricately sketched dreams are real, stumbling through a portal into Mid-World, an imperiled alternate universe that threatens our own. "What happens in one world echoes in others," Jake is told.\u000a\u000aThere, he meets Roland (Idris Elba), the last surviving gunslinger. A brooding knight, he has sworn vengeance against Walter (Matthew McConaughey), an evil sorcerer determined to bring down the Dark Tower, thus letting demons escape and wreak havoc on their domain.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVLondon (CNN) One was a basketball fanatic who became an international soccer star.\u000a\u000aThe other dreamed of being a football great, and is bound for basketball's Hall of Fame.\u000a\u000aSteve Nash and Owen Hargreaves are two of Canada's greatest sporting exports who made their names on opposite sides of the Atlantic.\u000a\u000aBut through a passion for each other's sports -- along with kindred, crisscrossing pasts -- the two have formed a sporting bromance for the ages.\u000a\u000aHargreaves, the younger of the two, was a scrappy high school point guard who dreamed of playing for the Chicago Bulls, while Nash was so crafty with his feet that he was named British Columbia's most valuable high school soccer player as a lanky 16-year-old.\u000a\u000aYet it was Nash, of course, who would blossom into the NBA's two-time Most Valuable Player with the Phoenix Suns, while Hargreaves was winning bookend European titles with Bayern Munich and Manchester United.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Steve Nash: Hoops magician, footie addict Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Steve Nash: Hoops magician, footie addict 03:25\u000a\u000aTwo sides of the same coin\u000a\u000aAlthough the two met only after their careers took off, both standouts grew up in Western Canada as sports-obsessed sons of English soccer players.\u000a\u000aNash made his NBA mark in 1998, as a dynamic counterpart to Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas. It was during his six-year spell in Texas that he heard about a young Canadian soccer player who was making waves in Germany, and through a mutual family friend invited him to attend a Mavs game.\u000a\u000aHargreaves, who like Nash is a dual British-Canadian citizen, was breaking into the England squad and reciprocated with World Cup tickets.\u000a\u000a"I would have loved to have been Steve, because I would have loved to have been an NBA player," Hargreaves told CNN before this year's annual NBA game in London, where the 35-year-old soccer television analyst is a fixture.\u000a\u000a"We connected because we are basically opposites: I grew up in a football family, but wanted to be a basketball player," he explains, noting that he wore number 23 on his jersey throughout his career at Bayern in honor of his hero Michael Jordan.\u000a\u000aBorn to British parents and raised in Western Canada, Nash (L) and Hargreaves achieved greatness in two improbable sports.\u000a\u000aNash, in turn, says he found inspiration in watching soccer players excel during his 18-season Hall of Fame career, which ended last year.\u000a\u000a"I was a big fan of Owen's," the 42-year-old Nash tells CNN. "Obviously, it was phenomenal to hear of a Canadian kid who was making the ranks of Bayern Munich.\u000a\u000a"To watch him go on to Manchester United and win Champions Leagues in both countries, and to have the career that he did representing England ... It was thrilling for all of us Canadians."\u000a\u000aNash even tried to recruit Hargreaves to play for the Vancouver Whitecaps, the MLS team he partially owns, towards the end of the midfielder's career -- which was cut short by knee injuries.\u000a\u000aBut Hargreaves preferred to stay in England, launching stalled comebacks with Manchester United and Manchester City before retiring at 31.\u000a\u000a"The thing I like about Steve is he was such an amazing athlete, but he's such a great guy as well," Hargreaves reciprocates. "I like that people can be big stars and still be humble. Steve was a great example."\u000a\u000aSoccer fanaticism\u000a\u000aIt's no secret that Nash is equally as enamored with soccer as Hargreaves is with hoops.\u000a\u000aAs a fan he watches a lot more footie than he does basketball, even though he is contracted with the Golden State Warriors as a special consultant and is the general manager of Canada's men's team.\u000a\u000aA quick skim through Nash's Instagram feed confirms his soccer obsession.\u000a\u000aHe stars in a Venice Beach league which features the likes of ex-pros Alessandro Del Piero and Landon Donovan, organizes a celebrity charity game in New York going on its 10th year, trains with his beloved Tottenham Hotspur, and rubs shoulders with the likes of Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry.\u000a\u000aNash is a regular at White Hart Lane, home of Tottenham Hotspur. As a youth player, he chose to stay in Canada rather than try out for his family's beloved team.\u000a\u000aNash has also taken his role as a club owner a step further with an active investment in Spanish second division team Real Mallorca.\u000a\u000aThe resident of Manhattan Beach, California has made several trips to the Mediterranean island, known more as the birthplace of tennis ace Rafael Nadal.\u000a\u000a"We love the sport. We have fallen in love with the history of the club and the fans," Nash says on behalf of his investment group, led by Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver.\u000a\u000a"This is something that we are passionate about and want to see succeed."\u000a\u000aDespite his involvement in the club's boardroom, it's hard not to wonder whether something gnaws at Nash for diverting from the path of Hargreaves, or his own brother Martin, who made 38 appearances for the Canadian national team and captained the Whitecaps.\u000a\u000a"The competitor in me thinks that if I dedicated myself the way I did with basketball, I could have been a professional (soccer) player," he says, although he still can't quite admit that the ship has already sailed.\u000a\u000a"The dream is still alive; I'm not going to give up on it just yet," he says, perhaps reconsidering his teenage decision to spurn an offer to join Canada's national under-17 soccer team.\u000a\u000aBy his own admission, Hargreaves -- who is generously listed at 5 foot 11 inches to Nash's 6 foot 3 -- says Nash was a far better soccer prospect than he was on the hardwood.\u000a\u000aHe assesses a young Nash's chances of making it in the English Premier League as high, though "not as a two-time MVP-level player."\u000a\u000aUnlikely path in an unlikely sport\u000a\u000aAs a 12-year-old, Nash showed enough promise that his father John, a former professional in South Africa, offered to send him to live with his aunt in London to latch on to the youth club at Tottenham.\u000a\u000aBut Nash, who was also exceptional in hockey and baseball, found the prospect of moving to a strange city too daunting. Instead, he switched to a new school in Victoria and joined the other jocks playing pickup hoops.\u000a\u000a"Really, I started playing basketball for social reasons," he recalls. But Nash's hyper-competitiveness soon took over and he outgrew his surroundings.\u000a\u000aAt 16 he told his coach at Mount Douglas Secondary School that he was aiming for a scholarship to an American Division I college program, only to be informed he needed to "readjust his goals," according to the book "Steve Nash: The Making of an MVP."\u000a\u000aNash switched schools instead.\u000a\u000aAlthough league rules forced him to sit out a season, he returned as a senior and averaged a near-triple-double at St. Michaels University School. Still, the skinny Canadian kid was rejected by nearly every Division I program he approached.\u000a\u000aOnly tiny Santa Clara University offered Nash a full scholarship, and was rewarded by big-time upsets over UCLA and Arizona. Nash would lead his conference in scoring and assists, before being picked just two slots behind Kobe Bryant in the 1996 NBA Draft\u000a\u000aNash's past, he says, made all those no-look passes for easy buckets possible.\u000a\u000a"In soccer, you already have to know what you are doing before the ball comes to you, so you've calculated your options," he explains. "A lot of kids growing up playing basketball, they don't think like that. They have the ball, then they survey.\u000a\u000a"I think it gave me an advantage to have seen thousands of angles, and players moving, and reading defenses, and making decisions on the soccer field."\u000a\u000a'You did what your Dad did'\u000a\u000aHargreaves, meanwhile, credits fighting for a spot on his high school basketball team for later asserting himself in an unfamiliar sport.\u000a\u000aHis father Colin played soccer semi-professionally in Calgary, and brother Darren was set to play for English team Bolton Wanderers before tearing up his knee, leaving young Owen as the next big hope.\u000a\u000a"I played soccer because my Dad played, and you did what your Dad did," he shrugs.\u000a\u000aHargreaves cared so little for the sport, in fact, that he didn't even have a favorite team. "It wasn't on TV at the time," he recalls, "so I watched basketball."\u000a\u000aGrowing up in Alberta, where it was so cold he could only practice soccer twice a week, Hargreaves hit the indoor basketball courts for five hours a day instead.\u000a\u000aAs an undersized point guard, he struggled at first -- "I wasn't very good at it; I could barely shoot," he confesses -- but earned respectability on the court.\u000a\u000a"Because I worked so hard at getting good at basketball, when I took that competitiveness and applied it to soccer -- where I was more naturally gifted -- it actually helped me so much," he says, sounding a lot like Nash.\u000a\u000aAlthough Hargreaves became a star at Bayern Munich, he played a big part in Manchester United's 2008 Premier League and Champions League titles.\u000a\u000aGiven that Hargreaves only began playing soccer competitively at 15, it's remarkable that just one year later he landed a spot on Bayern's youth team and moved to Germany.\u000a\u000aAs a 19-year-old, he debuted as one of the first three Canadians -- all on the same day -- to ever play in the Bundesliga. He is also one of only seven English players to have played in Germany's top division.\u000a\u000a"Listen, I never expected to be a professional soccer player -- never in a million years -- because it just wasn't possible really," Hargreaves says.\u000a\u000a"And then you just go over one hurdle. And then you go over another one, and another one, and it just builds up your confidence."\u000a\u000aHargreaves' "welcome to world football" moment took place that rookie year when he stripped the ball from Real Madrid star Luis Figo, who he idolized.\u000a\u000a"I remember thinking 'It's Luis Figo, he's going to kill me,'" he says. "That gave me more confidence than anything I had ever had, because I realized he's actually just like me."\u000a\u000aIn many ways, he could say the same about Nash. Through the most improbable mirroring turns, both athletes took their dreams to the highest levels in sports which came secondary to them.\u000a\u000aThese days, Hargreaves seems content with watching his Chicago Bulls from afar as an NBA superfan, while Nash is giving soccer one more go from the owners' box.\u000a\u000aThe dream, as he says, is still very much alive.\u000a\u000aCorrects to reflect that Steve Nash is not yet in the Hall of Fame. He will be eligible for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.

And very few commuters.\u000a\u000aThat's still the case today.\u000a\u000aA station worker recently told Chongqing Morning Post : "Very few passengers get off at this station. Most of the time, there will be no passenger boarding or alighting here."\u000a\u000aDespite its seemingly outlandish location, Caojiawan Station's location is part of an insightful plan that anticipates growth in rapidly modernizing China -- so say Chongqing Rail Transit employees.\u000a\u000a"Caojiawan Station may not be in the most popular area for now," one worker told Chinese media company Manner Video , a Chinese digital video production company.

aVCNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR) is pleased to announce that CNN has become the first organization to be granted a Part 107 waiver by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fly small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) over people for closed-set motion picture and television filming. CNN previously received the first-ever waiver granted by the FAA to fly UAS over members of the public for media coverage, including newsgathering and reporting activities.\u000a\u000aCNN\u2019s successful waiver application builds on its longstanding commitment to moving UAS policies forward for news organizations. In 2015, CNN was selected by the FAA as one of the first three industry \u201cPathfinders\u201d to develop safe uses of UAS in newsgathering, particularly in urban populated areas. This approval builds on CNN's closed set filming authority previously granted under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012.\u000a\u000a"We are delighted the FAA has approved CNN's application for closed set filming authority under Part 107," said Greg Agvent, Senior Director of National Newsgathering Technology and CNN AIR. "We are grateful for the opportunity to work with the FAA to move UAS forward for newsgatherers and filmmakers, and for the commercial UAS industry at large."\u000a\u000aThe new waiver allows CNN AIR to operate a diverse range of UAS over uncovered people who are participating in filming operations. As part of the waiver approval process, CNN demonstrated to the FAA that its operations could be conducted safely.

aVWe can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out.\u000a\u000aThis article is from the archive of our partner . We can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out. After the Times ran a column giving employers tips on how to deal with Millennials (for example, they need regular naps) (I didn't read the article; that's from my experience), Slate's Amanda Hess pointed out that the examples the Times used to demonstrate their points weren't actually Millennials. Some of the people quoted in the article were as old as 37, which was considered elderly only 5,000 short years ago. The age of employees of The Wire, the humble website you are currently reading, varies widely, meaning that we too have in the past wondered where the boundaries for the various generations were drawn. Is a 37-year-old who gets text-message condolences from her friends a Millennial by virtue of her behavior? Or is she some other generation, because she was born super long ago? (Sorry, 37-year-old Rebecca Soffer who is a friend of a friend of mine and who I met once! You're not actually that old!) Since The Wire is committed to Broadening Human Understanding\u2122, I decided to find out where generational boundaries are drawn.\u000a\u000aI started by calling the Census Bureau. A representative called me back, without much information. "We do not define the different generations," she told me. "The only generation we do define is Baby Boomers and that year bracket is from 1946 to 1964." Next, I spoke with Tom DiPrete, a sociology professor at Columbia University. And he agreed with the Census Bureau. "I think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media," DiPrete said, "and the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation." DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation. It "had specific characteristics," and occurred within an observable timeframe. World War II ended. You had the post-war rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family. Then societal changes disrupted those patterns, and the generation, for academic purposes, was over. His main point: "History isn't always so punctuated." I understood why Generation X, a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty, would be poorly defined. But what about Millennials? Doesn't their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers? "I actually haven't seen efforts to document [generations] rigorously, and I would be somewhat skeptical that they can be documented rigorously." DiPrete said. The things that have shaped Millennials \u2014 the rise of technology and social networks, for example \u2014 "affect people's lives differently."

aVOne controversial post from a Google employee has set off a firestorm over the company's internal culture.\u000a\u000aA male engineer at Google (GOOGL, Tech30) shared a 3,300-word manifesto internally last week railing against the company's ongoing push to hire more women and boost diversity. It argued women are not biologically fit for tech roles.\u000a\u000aThe document began circulating widely inside Google on Friday after being shared on an internal company forum, according to employees who posted about it on Twitter (TWTR, Tech30).\u000a\u000aThe complete memo was leaked to several news outlets over the weekend. The author, who has not been identified by CNN Tech, is said to be a rank-and-file software engineer.\u000a\u000aThe reactions internally have been fierce and divisive. Some employees have used an internal discussion group to call for the engineer to be fired, according to a source inside the company. Others have supported the employee's right to voice his opinions, if not supporting the opinions themselves.\u000a\u000a"Something is clearly wrong with the culture," one person wrote in the discussion group. "The author presented his point of view and some people want to leave unless the author leaves or HR take action. That's pathetic."\u000a\u000aGoogle has long prided itself as being a haven for free speech, where employees can engage in open discussion about seemingly anything. The internal employee forums reflect that.\u000a\u000aOne former female employee remembers her colleagues using the forums to complain about executives, share their religious beliefs and explain why they were anarchists.\u000a\u000a"It's kind of like Reddit, except internal to one company," says the former employee.\u000a\u000aThat may have paved the way for this employee to feel comfortable sharing an offensive post. But to many women who've worked at Google, the memo is more than just another exercise in free speech.\u000a\u000aRelated: Women tell their stories about harassment in tech\u000a\u000a"Can someone who writes things like that interview women or black people fairly? Can they give and receive feedback to and from women/people of color appropriately and reasonably?" says Cate Huston, a former Google software engineer. "To suggest that these kind of attitudes don't bleed into someone's day to day work seems dangerously optimistic."\u000a\u000aGoogle declined to comment for this story Monday.\u000a\u000aThe outcry over the post prompted Google's new VP of diversity, Danielle Brown, to weigh in before she'd even had a chance to properly introduce herself to the Google staff.\u000a\u000a"Part of building an open, inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views, including different political views, feel safe sharing their opinions," Brown wrote over the weekend.\u000a\u000aBut, she added, "like many of you, I found that [the document] advanced incorrect assumptions about gender."\u000a\u000aRelated: Storm at Google over engineer's anti-diversity manifesto\u000a\u000aThe debate comes at a sensitive time for Google and the tech industry more broadly.\u000a\u000aSexual harassment allegations have rocked Uber as well as multiple venture capital firms this year. Google has been hit too. One former Google software engineer tweeted in March that she'd been harassed at the company. And one Uber executive was reportedly asked to leave the company in February because he did not disclose a sexual harassment allegation from his time at Google.\u000a\u000a"I'm sure these attitudes exist at both companies," said one person who worked with both Uber and Google. "Though I did feel that Google was much more mature in the way it handled and discussed these kinds of issues internally."\u000a\u000aLike much of Silicon Valley, Google has begun releasing annual diversity reports to highlight its commitment to the issue. Progress has been slow coming.\u000a\u000aIn the most recent report released in June, Google touted the growing number of women in tech roles. Women now account for just 20% of tech positions at Google.\u000a\u000a-- Laurie Segall, CNN Tech senior correspondent, contributed to this report.

The founders say the luggage startup recorded sales of $12 million in its first year.\u000a\u000aThe founders put Away's early success down to its team of 41 tech-savvy millennials and their love of photo sharing app Instagram.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot of people on our team who were coming of age when Instagram came out, so we've definitely learned from them that brand discovery and shopping through Instagram is an important part of how they find things," said Korey.\u000a\u000aWhat makes the perfect suitcase?\u000a\u000aAfter spending months interviewing hundreds of travelers, Korey says the team were able to create luggage that helps take the hassle out of any journey.\u000a\u000aAway suitcases have impenetrable and "unbreakable" shells, says Korey, USB ports that can charge devices, interior compression systems that save space, and wheels designed to provide the smoothest, 360-degree roll.\u000a\u000aRelated: Airline electronics ban: What you need to know\u000a\u000aPrices start at $225 for its carry on model, which includes a battery that can charge an iPhone five times.\u000a\u000aTravelers seem to like the formula.

For us it's all about how can we make travel more seamless," Korey says.\u000a\u000aAccording to the founders, investors include Forerunner Ventures, the original Warby Parker backers, Andy Dunn from menswear firm Bonobos, and Brian Lee from The Honest Company.\u000a\u000aLondon, New York, Los Angeles?\u000a\u000aAway plans to expand into accessories. It also wants to start a travel website with tips and recommendations.\u000a\u000aThe company has one retail store in New York's Soho, but it has also tested pop ups in Los Angeles, London and Berlin. Encouraged by the strong start, the firm is now looking at permanent stores in Los Angeles and London.\u000a\u000aKorey says the company has grown a lot faster than they expected. But they're very careful about who they hire, despite the intense workload.\u000a\u000a"It's going to be worth it to wait for that person who is truly aligned with this vision for creativity and execution and teamwork," Korey says.\u000a\u000aCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Jay Z as a direct investor of Away.

aVTim Spector is professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation .\u000a\u000a(CNN) Mounting evidence suggests that the richer and more diverse the community of microbes in your gut the lower your risk of disease. Diet is key to maintaining diversity and was strikingly demonstrated when an undergrad student went on a McDonald's diet for ten days and after just four days experienced a significant drop in the number of beneficial microbes.\u000a\u000aYour gut microbiome is a vast community of trillions of bacteria that has a major influence on your metabolism, immune system and mood. These bacteria and fungi inhabit every nook and cranny of your gastrointestinal tract, with most of this 1kg to 2kg "microbe organ" sited in your colon (the main bit of your large intestine).\u000a\u000aWe tend to see the biggest diet-related shifts in microbes in people who are unhealthy with a low-diversity unstable microbiome. What we didn't know is whether a healthy stable gut microbiome could be improved in just a few days. The chance to test this in an unusual way came when my colleague Jeff Leach invited me on a field trip to Tanzania, where he has been living and working among the Hadza, one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer groups in all of Africa.\u000a\u000aMy microbiome is pretty healthy nowadays and, among the first hundred samples we tested as part of the MapMyGut project, I had the best gut diversity -- our best overall measure of gut health, reflecting the number and richness of different species. High diversity is associated with a low risk of obesity and many diseases. The Hadza have a diversity that is one of the richest on the planet\u000a\u000aThe research plan was devised by Jeff who suggested I should have an intensive three days of eating like a hunter gatherer during my stay at his research camp. I would measure my gut microbes before heading to Tanzania, during my stay with the Hadza, and after my return to the UK. I was also not allowed to wash or use alcohol swabs and I was expected to hunt and forage with the Hadza as much as possible -- including coming in contact with the odd Hadza baby and baboon poo lying about.\u000a\u000aTo help us record the trip I was accompanied by Dan Saladino, the intrepid presenter and producer of BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme , who was preparing a Hadza microbe special.\u000a\u000aAfter a long tiring flight to Mount Kilimanjaro Airport in Tanzania, we stayed overnight in Arusha, a city in the north of the country. Before setting off the next morning, I produced my baseline poo sample.\u000a\u000aAfter an eight-hour journey in a Land Rover over bumpy tracks, we arrived. Jeff beckoned us to the top of a huge rock to witness the most amazing sunset over Lake Eyasi. Here, within a stones throw of the famous fossil site of Olduvai Gorge and with the stunning plains of the Serengeti in the distance, Jeff explained that we were never going to be closer to home as a member of the genus Homo, than where we were standing at that moment.\u000a\u000aThe million-year-old diet\u000a\u000aThe Hadza seek out the same animals and plants that humans have hunted and gathered for millions of years. Importantly, the human-microbe tango that played out here for aeons probably shaped aspects of our immune system and made us who we are today. The significance of being in Hadza-land was not lost on me.\u000a\u000aUnlike the Hadza, who sleep around the fire or in grass huts, I was given a tent and told to zip it up tight as there were scorpions and snakes about. I had to be careful where I stepped if I needed a nocturnal pee. After an interesting but restless night's sleep, a large pile of baobab pods had been collected for my breakfast.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Wodaabe, Gerewol \u2013 At the end of the rainy season near Lake Chad, northern Niger, Wodaabe people come together for Cure Salee, the "Festival of Nomads." At the center of celebrations is Gerewol, a male beauty contest and courtship ritual. Young men -- traditionally herdsmen -- wear full makeup, jewelry and their finest clothes and stand in line to await inspection by female onlookers. White teeth and white eyes are highly prized, so participants will grin broadly and pull all manner of expressions in the hope of attracting attention. It's flirtation en masse, in the hope of winning a night of passion with one of the judges.

Once the hole is big enough the first of a succession of ornamental ceramic saucers are inserted, stretching it over a period of years -- one example from the neighboring Surma tribe measured Circular lip plates called dhebi a tugion are worn by some Mursi women near Jinka in Ethiopia's Omo Valley. They are one of the few tribes that continue the practice in East Africa, but archaeologists have discovered lip plates in the region stretching back 30,000 years, says anthropologist Dr Jerome Lewis of University College London. "It's a body modification that people find beautiful," he says. "It's also very striking and a distinctive way of marking your difference from other people around you."The bottom lip is pierced with a wooden peg inserted, which is replaced with larger pegs thereafter. Once the hole is big enough the first of a succession of ornamental ceramic saucers are inserted, stretching it over a period of years -- one example from the neighboring Surma tribe measured 19.5cm wide Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Himba, otjize \u2013 Women of the semi-nomadic Himba tribe in northern Namibia are famous for their reddish hair and complexion. It's the result of otjize, a paste of butter, fat and red ocher, applied daily to their hair and skin. It was once speculated that the otjize served as a form of sun protection and to ward off insects, however the women say it's purely for aesthetic reasons -- which makes sense, given that Himba men don't take part in the practice. Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Hamar, bull jumping \u2013 Herdsmen become hurdlers in the Omo Valley, Ethiopia. Young men of the Hamar tribe, one of many in the valley, prove their manhood by jumping on prize bulls and then running across their backs -- all while naked. The purpose? It's a coming of age ceremony, and only when the participant has traversed the bull run four times will he be allowed to marry. Slip and you risk a hard fall: "Because it's a manhood initiation ritual, [failure] is likely to affect the perception of someone's manhood and that of course can have all sorts of dire consequence," adds Dr Lewis. Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Xhosa, Ulwaluko \u2013 In Eastern Cape, South Africa, young Xhosa men take part in a coming of age initiation called Ulwaluko. The youths, known as abakhwetha, are first circumcised without anesthetic, before being sent away from their village and into the bush, with minimal supplies and wrapped in a blanket. Wearing white clay on their faces, initiates will fend for themselves for up to two months, living in a structure built by the village's adult community specifically for Ulwaluko. Upon their return they are no longer referred to as "boy" and receive a new blanket. The initiation has not been without its criticisms, due to complications and malpractice surrounding the circumcision process. Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Chewa, matriarchy \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOne thing Chewa women are shut out of is the Women of the Chewa tribe may not be quite on equal footing as men, but they do hold the key to one thing: inheritance. Descent and succession for the Bantu-speaking tribe, spread across Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique, is matrilineal, with property and land inherited from their mothers. "Although inheritance passes down the female line, which definitely gives women more power in society, it's still male-dominated and patriarchal in the sense that men are still at the apex of power," explains Lewis. "People have an assumption that matrilineal societies are somehow favorable to women -- and they are certainly more favorable than some of the extreme patrilineal societies -- but they're not societies that give women equal power."One thing Chewa women are shut out of is the Nyau brotherhood (pictured), a secretive society who can channel spirits and performs a ritual dance called Gule Wamkulu around harvest and at weddings and funeral. Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Maasai, spitting \u2013 Spittle is an essential part of life for the Maasai of East Africa, as it acts as a blessing. "People have different views about where the power and essence of somebody resides," explains Lewis. For some, "spit represents an essence of you as a person."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTo spit is "a way of blessing people by giving something of yourself; your own power to someone else." It starts at an early age, when newborn babies are spat on to wish them a good life. "If you leave a place, elders will come and spit on your head in order to bless your departure, and that whatever you do you're safe and kept well," adds Lewis. Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: San, healing dance \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLewis says that this tradition is under threat: "In some places in southern Africa the San now perform their traditional culture exclusively for tourists, because they've been forced out of all their territories as hunter-gatherers by conservationist organizations. This means that by extension... these performances are not the original initiations but a facsimile of them." The San of South Africa, Botswana, Angola and Namibia are, according to some researchers, the world's oldest people . Their hunter-gatherer culture stretches back tens of thousands of years, and integral to it is the trance dance, also known as the healing dance. Historically an all-night affair, the practice brings the whole community together, led by healers and elders dancing around a fire, chanting and breathing deeply until they induce a trance state. It offers the chance to commune with ancestral spirits of the departed and for healers, cure sickness within other dancers.Lewis says that this tradition is under threat: "In some places in southern Africa the San now perform their traditional culture exclusively for tourists, because they've been forced out of all their territories as hunter-gatherers by conservationist organizations. This means that by extension... these performances are not the original initiations but a facsimile of them." Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Bantu-speaking tribes, lobola \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"It's the cause of much conflict," says Lewis, "because in order for a man to get married he must provide often quite a substantial head of cattle, and so he's in indentured labor to his father until the herd he's caring for is big enough." In societies that are cattle based, men tend to marry in their mid-forties, he adds, explaining that "there's always a backlog of women who are available but unable to marry" because men of a similar age have not yet raised the required bridalwealth. A feature of marital affairs for many Bantu-speaking tribes in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, lobola is practiced by, among others, Zulus (pictured). Lobola is also referred to as "bridalwealth", with the prospective groom's family negotiating with the bride's for her hand in marriage. The dowry comes in many forms, including money, but some choose cattle. There were reports in 1998 that Nelson Mandela (of Thembu lineage) paid the marital lobola of 60 cows to the family of new wife Graca Machel."It's the cause of much conflict," says Lewis, "because in order for a man to get married he must provide often quite a substantial head of cattle, and so he's in indentured labor to his father until the herd he's caring for is big enough."

Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Tuareg, tangelmust \u2013 Tuaregs are the only tribal communities in which men wear veils instead of women . The tangelmust, a wrapped headdress up to eight meters in length, is ubiquitous among the "blue men of the desert." The name does not allude to the muslin headdress, dyed with indigo, but rather because the dye gradually leeches out into the skin of the wearer. Tuaregs use the tangelmust for practical reasons: it protects from the sun and sand, but men will still wear them at night, and even during meals. Men cover their faces with the tangelmust in front of strangers and women, while women are free to show their face. Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Bodi, Ka'el obesity pageant \u2013 Every June or July in the Omo Valley, Ethiopia, the Ka'el -- the Bodi lunar new year -- takes place. With it comes an extraordinary show of pageantry. In the months before the event men live in isolation and drink to excess a mixture of cow milk and cow blood for months in order to become vastly bloated and overweight. Each clan will then present an unmarried male to compete for the title of fattest man -- and with the glory, the greater chance of finding a wife. With stomachs swollen, balance and fatigue can be an issue, but once the event is over, contestants return to their normal size in a matter of weeks. Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Dassanech, recycled jewelry \u2013 "It's important to remember that tradition doesn't mean 'the same'," says Lewis, "cultures will adapt and add elements all the time." A perfect example of this is the Dassanech tribe, another group found in Ethiopia's Omo Valley on the border with Kenya. Rubbish of all manner, but particularly bottle tops, have begun to be recycled by Dassanech women, who weave the metal caps into vibrant jangly headdresses. Other women have adapted broken watches and trinkets for similar purposes -- and a sure fire way of getting yourself noticed. Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aThe baobab fruit is the staple of the Hadza diet, packed with vitamins, fat in the seeds, and, of course, significant amounts of fibre. We were surrounded by baobab trees stretching in the distance as far as I could see. Baobab fruit have a hard coconut-like shell that cracks easily to reveal a chalky flesh around a large, fat-rich seed. The high levels of vitamin C provided an unexpected citrus tang.\u000a\u000aThe Hadza mixed the chalky bits with water and whisked it vigorously for two to three minutes with a stick until it was a thick, milky porridge that was filtered -- somewhat -- into a mug for my breakfast. It was surprisingly pleasant and refreshing. As I wasn't sure what else I would be eating on my first day, I drank two mugs and suddenly felt very full.\u000a\u000aMy next snacks were the wild berries on many of the trees surrounding the camp -- the commonest were small Kongorobi berries. These refreshing and slightly sweet berries have 20 times the fibre and polyphenols compared with cultivated berries -- powerful fuel for my gut microbiome. I had a late lunch of a few high-fibre tubers dug up with a sharp stick by the female foragers and tossed on the fire. These were more effort to eat - like tough, earthy celery. I didn't go for seconds or feel hungry, probably because of my high-fibre breakfast. No one seemed concerned about dinner.\u000a\u000aHadza woman and child sitting at a fire, Lake Eyasi, Tanzania.\u000a\u000aA few hours later we were asked to join a hunting party to track down porcupine -- a rare delicacy. Even Jeff hadn't tasted this creature in his four years of field work.\u000a\u000aTwo 20kg nocturnal porcupines had been tracked to their tunnel system in a termite mound. After several hours of digging and tunnelling -- carefully avoiding the razor-sharp spines -- two porcupines were eventually speared and thrown to the surface. A fire was lit. The spines, skin and valuable organs were expertly dissected and the heart, lung and liver cooked and eaten straight away.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the fatty carcass was taken back to camp for communal eating. It tasted much like suckling pig. We had a similar menu the next two days, with the main dishes including hyrax -- a strange furry guinea-pig-like hoofed animal, weighing about 4kg -- a relative of the elephant, of all creatures.\u000a\u000aHarvested high from a baobab tree, our dessert was the best golden orange honey I could ever imagine -- with the bonus of honeycomb full of fat and protein from the larvae. The combination of fat and sugars made our dessert the most energy-dense food found anywhere in nature and may have competed with fire in terms of its evolutionary importance.\u000a\u000aIn Hadza-land nothing is wasted or killed unnecessarily, but they eat an amazing variety of plant and animal species (around 600, most of which are birds) compared with us in the West. My other lasting impression was how little time they spent getting food. It appeared as though it took just a few hours a day -- as simple as going round a large supermarket. Any direction you walked there was food -- above, on and below ground.\u000a\u000aMassive increase in microbiome diversity\u000a\u000aTwenty-four hours later Dan and I were back in London, him with his precious audio tapes and me with my cherished poo samples. After producing a few more, I sent them to the lab for testing.\u000a\u000aThe results showed clear differences between my starting sample and after three days of my forager diet. The good news was my gut microbal diversity increased a stunning 20%, including some totally novel African microbes, such as those of the phylum Synergistetes.

aVEach year, around 200 riders take to France's streets and mountains as a select few battle it out for the "maillot jaune."\u000a\u000aWith just two stages to go in the 2017 race, three-time winner Chris Froome is favorite to wear yellow when Le Tour finishes in Paris on Sunday. He leads by 23 seconds from Frenchman Romain Bardet, with Colombian Rigoberto Uran a further six seconds adrift.\u000a\u000aThe origin of the yellow jersey is a subject of much conjecture. The winner of the first Tour in 1903, Maurice Garin, wore a green armband but as the race's popularity increased, riders and journalists complained they couldn't pick out the leader.\u000a\u000aThe first mention of a yellow jersey being worn came from Belgian Philippe Thys who, when leading Le Tour in 1913, said he was asked to wear a colored top by race organizer Henri Desgrange.\u000a\u000aThys initially declined, arguing he would be too easily visible to chasing riders, only to change his mind when asked by the team manager at his sponsor Peugeot.\u000a\u000aAccording to official Tour de France records, the first yellow jersey was worn by race leader Eugène Christophe prior to the 11th stage of the 1919 edition.\u000a\u000aWith the stage getting underway at 2am, Desgrange decided Christophe needed to be easily identifiable in the dark.\u000a\u000aIn doing so, Desgrange inadvertently went on to create cycling's most iconic piece of clothing and since then, only a select few riders have got to frequently pull on the maillot jaune.\u000a\u000aFrenchman Jacques Anquetil, a five-time Tour de France winner, wore the jersey for 50 days between 1957 and 1964, before compatriot Bernard Hinault went on to wear it for 75 days between 1978 and 1986.\u000a\u000aThen came the turn of Eddy Merckx, widely regarded as the best rider of all time, who dominated for 96 days from 1969 to 1975.\u000a\u000aFinally, Spaniard and five-time Tour winner Miguel Indurain wore yellow for 60 days between 1991 and 1995.\u000a\u000aIn total, over 2,100 yellow jerseys have been awarded to nearly 300 riders.\u000a\u000aWill Froome hang onto it?\u000a\u000aPhotos: Tour de France 2017: Best photos Against the backdrop of the Arc de Triomphe, Britain's Chris Froome rides to his fourth Tour de France win.

She is also completing a Ph.D. in Renaissance literature, having been awarded a collaborative doctoral between Yale University and University College London. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000aLondon (CNN) Here in Britain, hardly a day has gone by this summer without a royal row. The 31st of August, a month from now, will mark the 20th anniversary of the premature death of Diana, Princess of Wales. For weeks already, the British broadcasters have scheduled extra programming, trailing tell-all documentaries, while Diana's sons, William and Harry, have organized carefully choreographed events and interviews designed to burnish their mother's memory as a humanitarian.\u000a\u000aKate Maltby\u000a\u000aEven Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, once mistress of Diana's husband, Charles, and now his second wife, has approved a series of soft-focus interviews and a semi-official biography, generating tabloid headlines like "Her Side of the Story" and "Wouldn't Wish It on My Enemy." The Camilla of this narrative was menaced by a vindictive and unstable Princess Diana, enduring every bit as a much tabloid harassment.\u000a\u000aThat Diana, who presumably was her worst enemy, suffered at least as much and largely at Camilla's hands, seems forgotten. But in royal exclusives, timing is never a coincidence. Indeed, it looks suspiciously like Camilla's new PR campaign is damage-control for a year in which Princes William and Harry have been determined to remind the British public why we loved Diana.\u000a\u000aThis week's controversy revolves around a series of tapes made in the mid-'90s by Princess Diana's speech coach, a man named Peter Settelen. Ostensibly created so Diana could hear her own vocal patterns played back to her and improve her public speaking, the tapes also captured the princess speaking frankly -- and angrily -- about both her relationship with her husband and Camilla.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Prince Harry's regret over mom's death (2016) Replay More Videos ...

The article was first published on 4 January.\u000a\u000aNimes, France (CNN) What present do you buy a man who has been in a coma for more than 30 years?\u000a\u000aThat's the question the family of former France international Jean-Pierre Adams, whose life was brutally turned upside down in 1982, asks itself every year on key anniversaries.\u000a\u000aThirty-four years ago the beefy footballer, then 34, walked into a Lyon hospital for some routine surgery to correct a troublesome knee.\u000a\u000aBy the time he left, he would never talk, walk or move any of his limbs again.\u000a\u000aHis wife Bernadette has tended to him ever since, barely missing a day's care over the last three decades.\u000a\u000a"No one ever forgets to give Jean-Pierre presents, whether it's his birthday, Christmas or Father's Day," Bernadette told CNN.\u000a\u000aThe 68-year-old can breathe on his own, without the assistance of a machine, and has his own room, where he spends most of the day in the type of modified bed normally found in a hospital.\u000a\u000a"We buy presents like a T-shirt or a jumper because I dress him in his bed -- he changes clothes every day," his wife explains at the family home near Nîmes, in the south of France, where Bernadette cares for Jean-Pierre.\u000a\u000a"I'll buy things so that he can have a nice room, such as pretty sheets, or some scent. He used to wear Paco Rabanne but his favorite one stopped so now I buy Sauvage by Dior."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Jean-Pierre and Bernadette Adams: A love like no other Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jean-Pierre and Bernadette Adams: A love like no other 03:13\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's disastrous surgery reduced a flamboyant character, who had risen from humble beginnings in Senegal, to one who has been in a persistent vegetative state ever since.\u000a\u000aA France international player in the 1970s, Jean-Pierre is now incapable of nearly all voluntary movement but can digest food as well as open and close his eyes.\u000a\u000aBernadette looks after her husband with an unfailing love -- dressing, feeding and bathing him, turning him over in his bed to avoid sores, and often losing her own sleep to ensure he gets his.\u000a\u000aIt's a measure of their bond that on the rare occasions Bernadette spends a night away from home, Jean-Pierre's carers notice his mood seems to change.\u000a\u000a"He senses that it is not me feeding him and looking after him," says his wife of 47 years. "It's the nurses who tell me, saying he is not the same.\u000a\u000a"I think he feels things. He must recognize the sound of my voice as well."\u000a\u000aThe period of enlightenment\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre and Bernadette may have been born in Senegal and France respectively, but their lives started to converge in the mid-1950s.\u000a\u000aThat was when Jean-Pierre's grandmother took him to Europe on a religious pilgrimage, enrolling the 10-year-old at a school in France as she did so.\u000a\u000aSoon adopted by a local French couple, his African existence rapidly started to disappear behind him.\u000a\u000aIt was in the late 1960s, that Jean-Pierre, then an amateur footballer, met Bernadette at a dance.\u000a\u000aIt was a time of change, with the uprising of May 1968 heralding a new era as students and workers altered France's cultural outlook as they challenged the conservative nature of General de Gaulle's government.\u000a\u000a"I can't hide the fact that it was very difficult for my family at the beginning," Bernadette recalls, reflecting on the challenges they faced as a mixed race couple.\u000a\u000a"At the time, a black man and a white woman being together wasn't well-regarded.\u000a\u000a"But we began to live together and then decided to marry. I wrote to my parents giving the news, the wedding date and an invitation, and my mother invited us to dinner.\u000a\u000a"After that, everything was fine and he was seen in a better light than me: 'Jean-Pierre, Jean-Pierre' -- they only spoke of Jean-Pierre!"\u000a\u000aThe couple first lived just south of Paris -- in Fontainebleu -- where Adams was helping the local side win its amateur championship, but shortly after their 1969 marriage, they moved to Nîmes as Jean-Pierre signed for the city's then first division side.\u000a\u000aWithin two years, not only had Nîmes finished runners-up but Jean-Pierre was playing for France -- one of the first black players to do so.\u000a\u000a"He was a force of nature, very strong physically, and he had great determination and willingness," Henri Michel, who played in Adams' first competitive France international in 1972, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"He was formidable, very patriotic and it was a pleasure to play with him," added a man who coached France at the 1986 World Cup. "He started as a forward but then played at the back."\u000a\u000aThere, Adams formed a central defensive partnership known as the "Garde Noire" -- "Black Guard" -- alongside Marius Trésor, a player the Brazilian Pele named, in 2004, among his 125 greatest living footballers.\u000a\u000a"Adams and Trésor have formed one of the best central defensive pairings in all of Europe," no less a figure than German World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer told French football magazine "Onze" at the time.\u000a\u000aArguably, along with previous black internationals like Larbi Ben Barek and Lucien Cossou, the "Garde Noire" helped pave the way for France's 1998 World Cup success. Key players such as Patrick Vieira, Marcel Desailly and Lilian Thuram were born in Senegal, Ghana and Guadeloupe respectively.\u000a\u000aIn total, Jean-Pierre won 22 caps and also played for Paris Saint-Germain and Nice, narrowly failing to win the French title with the latter (again), while also knocking Barcelona out of the 1973-4 UEFA Cup.\u000a\u000aLife was just good off the pitch.\u000a\u000aWith a love of music -- particularly from Brazil -- and a taste for cigars, clothing and bling, Jean-Pierre fully enjoyed 1970s life with Bernadette.\u000a\u000a"He was the 'joie de vivre' embodied in human form -- a laugher and joker who liked to go out," says Bernadette, who is dressed in an à la mode Desigual T-shirt and spotless white trousers on the day we met. "Really, a smile was always bursting out. He loved the good life and was loved by everybody as well."\u000a\u000aAs his career faded, dropping down the divisions, Adams decided he wanted to coach youths and one March day in 1982, he headed off to Dijon for three days of studying and training.\u000a\u000aHe damaged a tendon in his leg while there -- an innocuous injury that would ultimately cast a huge shadow over the Adams family.\u000a\u000aThe 'perfect storm'\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre traveled to the Édouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon for his X-ray.\u000a\u000a"From there, he was to come home," recalls Bernadette. "But he was walking along a corridor in the hospital -- where he knew no one -- when a doctor who knew all about football, since he looked after the Lyon team, walked past."\u000a\u000aStopping to talk, the doctor instantly offered to help and after an instant consultation, he decided upon surgery and booked Jean-Pierre in for an appointment: Wednesday 17 March 1982.\u000a\u000aWhen the date came around, there was a problem. The hospital staff were on strike.\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's case was far from urgent -- he could have soldiered on for a bit -- but the surgery went ahead nonetheless.\u000a\u000a"The female anesthetist was looking after eight patients, one after the other, like an assembly line," says Bernadette.\u000a\u000a"Jean-Pierre was supervised by a trainee, who was repeating a year, who later admitted in court: 'I was not up to the task I was entrusted with.'\u000a\u000a"Given it was not a vital operation, that the hospital was on strike, they were missing doctors and this woman was looking after eight patients, in two different rooms, someone should have called me to say they were going to delay the operation."\u000a\u000aThey never did -- and between the anesthetist and trainee, numerous errors were made.\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre was badly intubated, with one tube blocking the pathway to his lungs rather than ventilating them, meaning he was starved of oxygen whereupon he suffered a cardiac arrest.\u000a\u000a"I found him lying on a bed, tubes everywhere," she remembers after rushing to the hospital. "I didn't leave the hospital for five days. I thought he was going to wake up and that I needed to be there."\u000a\u000aWhen she felt fresh air again, the world had become a very different place.\u000a\u000aLife now\u000a\u000aAfter 15 months in hospital, local authorities suggested to Bernadette that the best place for her husband would be a nearby home for the elderly.\u000a\u000a"I don't think they knew how to look after him, so I said to myself: 'He will come home' and I've looked after him ever since," says Bernadette.\u000a\u000aEvery day, she wakes just before seven o'clock and has her breakfast -- precious minutes spent alone -- as she readies herself to care for her husband.\u000a\u000aIt's a mix of changing clothes, shaving, preparing food -- all of it blended -- and delivering it, which can take an hour, helping Jean-Pierre go to the toilet, while also helping the kinesiologist ensure his lungs are clean and his muscles exercised to avoid choking and atrophying.\u000a\u000aIf she is lucky her day finishes at eight, when Jean-Pierre might go to sleep.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes when the night goes badly, I'm up for the whole thing."\u000a\u000aThe round-the-clock care leaves little time to earn a living, but thankfully for the stoic Bernadette, she receives an annuity after a court ruled in her favor -- albeit after a decade-long legal battle.\u000a\u000a"The process lasted nearly 12 years. I think it's designed to discourage people," she ventures. "If I hadn't had the support of football, I would have been completely broke."\u000a\u000aThe French league, football federation and the Variety Club of France -- a club for former France internationals -- all rallied together to help with her legal fees.\u000a\u000aAlthough the accident occurred in 1982, it wasn't until 1989 that the medical staff were found guilty of 'involuntary injury' --- and even then, it still needed nearly five more years to decide the family's dues.\u000a\u000a"We've played five or six games over the years because we knew that Bernadette was in financial and psychological difficulty," Jacques Vendroux, the general manager of the Variety Club of France, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"Jean-Pierre was someone very appealing and deserved help. He is still alive and that is amazing."\u000a\u000aHe's also made to feel as much part of family life as possible, with his room adjoining the house's focal point, the kitchen-cum-living room.\u000a\u000a"I talk to him all the time -- about TV, what's in the mail, anything!" Bernadette says. "There is always movement around him. He is always next to us."\u000a\u000aWhen I ask whether she ever imagines conversations the pair might have had, the 72-year-old Bernadette momentarily chokes up -- a brief insight into the true cost of the accident for a proud and serene woman.\u000a\u000a"I don't know," she replied. "It's difficult to say. I say he doesn't understand my words but there might be moments when he has a flash. Perhaps for an instant, just an instant, he understands something."\u000a\u000aIt's unlikely though.\u000a\u000aGray hairs\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's brain was so starved of oxygen he suffered catastrophic brain damage, making the prospect of recovery very slim.\u000a\u000a"The more time that passes, the more bothered I get," she says. "His condition does not get any worse, so who knows? If one day, medical science evolves, then why not? Will there be a day when they'll know how to do something for him? I don't know."\u000a\u000aWhile she relentlessly hopes there is, she continues to preserve both his legacy and dignity.\u000a\u000aShe told me long before our meeting that no pictures of Jean-Pierre would be allowed and when I asked if I could photograph the entrance to his room, the answer was Bernadette pushing the door shut -- gently but firmly.\u000a\u000aBut she happily introduces me to Jean-Pierre, who turned 68 on 10 March, but he still looks very youthful -- with just a light sprinkle of gray hairs. He was sleeping, I was told, even though his eyes were open.\u000a\u000aOn his bed was a bright bedspread, a present from many years back, and in the corner a small TV.\u000a\u000aAt one point after he had woken up, Bernadette briefly left the room.\u000a\u000aI stood there awkwardly -- all notions of explaining how I once lived in Senegal pushed to one side as such inane conversation seemed so glib I fell into silence instead.\u000a\u000aWith Jean-Pierre's eyes unable to follow, I felt invisible and, given his situation, both sad and angry.\u000a\u000a"The hospital has never apologized," Bernadette had said just minutes earlier.\u000a\u000aFuture conditional\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's wife is troubled at present. By the future.\u000a\u000a"Imagine if I die before him, then what would become of him?" she asks.\u000a\u000a"He'll die without being looked after. He needs me to be able to eat, to meet his primary needs. If I don't do it, who will?"\u000a\u000aWhen I ask whether her sons -- Laurent and Frédéric, who were 11 and four respectively at the time of the accident -- could help, she revealed that she was desperate to spare them such a fate.\u000a\u000aHad she ever considered euthanasia for Jean-Pierre?\u000a\u000a"What do you want me to do -- deprive him of food? Let him die little by little? No, no, no," she railed.\u000a\u000aThirty-three years ago as Bernadette drove to Lyon that was also a question that haunted her, terrified she would be asked to agree to switch off the life support machine Jean-Pierre was then on.\u000a\u000a"I try not to think about the accident every day but I have no choice," says Bernadette, who is now a grandmother of three. "Every time I look at him, it is present in my head."\u000a\u000aIn the mid 1990s, when the court adjudicated on the case, both the anesthetist and trainee were given what would appear to be relatively light punishments: a one-month suspended sentence and a fine that translates to some 750 Euros ($815) today.\u000a\u000aDecades on, the Adams family are still paying a far heavier price.

aVPresident Obama\u2019s Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken told CNN Anchor Chris Cuomo that the Iran nuclear deal is the first step in stopping the advancement of its program. Blinken stressed that pressure on Iran \u201cis not going away\u201d and addressed why he thinks Israel and other nations may have a problem with the deal.\u000a\u000aBlinken said, \u201cIn terms of Israel, we understand Israel has the right to be skeptical. An Iranian bomb would present an existential threat to Israel. And we have the exactly the same goal, which is to prevent Iran from getting a bomb. There may be tactical differences in how we get there. I think Israel would\u2019ve preferred not to do this first step. If we could\u2019ve negotiated a comprehensive deal right away in a matter of days, we would\u2019ve done that. But because its complicated, because it takes time, we wanted to make sure that Iran couldn\u2019t use that time to advance its program. This stops the program in its tracks. Rolls it back, gives us time to see if we can negotiate a comprehensive deal.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2026 Some of our Arab friends, for example, are concerned that if we get a deal with Iran on its nuclear program, a comprehensive deal, then we\u2019ll be satisfied and we\u2019ll forget about all of the other things Iran does that they don\u2019t like and that we don\u2019t like,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cAnd the fact is we won\u2019t. We\u2019ll continue to confront what Iran is doing around the world that is a problem for us and a problem for some of our partners.

aV(CNN) A few years ago, Robert Cialdini found himself at a large appliance store, standing in front of a big-screen TV that he didn't particularly want and certainly didn't need. That said, it was a great deal on a model that had received high marks from a consumer group.\u000a\u000aHe recalls the salesman coming up to him and saying, "I can see you're interested in this model, at this price, and I can tell why. It's a great deal, but I have to tell you, that's our last one. And we just got a call from a woman who said she might be coming down to the store today to buy it."\u000a\u000aMinutes later, Cialdini -- the man who literally wrote the book on the power of persuasion -- was wheeling out of the store with a new TV in his shopping cart, wondering whether he'd been duped.\u000a\u000aScarcity is one of Cialdini's six "universal principles of influence." Along with the other five -- reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority and liking -- a good salesperson can talk someone into buying just about anything.\u000a\u000aCialdini, who has been studying the science of social influence for decades, presented new findings on his six principles Friday at the American Psychological Association 's annual convention in Washington.\u000a\u000a"We've always thought of successful persuasion as an art -- something that people are born with, a natural gift of saying just the right thing at just the right time," said Cialdini , professor emeritus of psychology and marketing at Arizona State University . "That's true, but what we haven't recognized traditionally is that it's also a science. It's something that can be taught and learned."\u000a\u000aThat, of course, is a double-edged sword. It means you could end up being talked into buying something you otherwise wouldn't. But it also means you can harness these principles to your own advantage, to get what you want.\u000a\u000aReciprocity\u000a\u000aWhat it is: "There is a rule in all human cultures that says you must not take without giving in return," Cialdini said, and this principle assures we do just that.\u000a\u000aHow it's used: Myriad studies have shown that receiving a free sample at the supermarket or food court makes us significantly more likely to purchase something from the store handing it out, though not necessarily the exact product we've tasted. This principle also comes into play with the tote bags, T-shirts and sheets of return address labels you get in the mail.\u000a\u000aOne caveat is that usefulness does matter, according to Cialdini. If what you're offered is cheap, unwanted or wasteful, you won't think of what you're receiving as a gift but rather as a trick -- and the tactic backfires.\u000a\u000aHow you can use it: Want to get better presents from your family? Buy them something thoughtful first, and they'll be more likely to reciprocate. Want someone to do you a favor? Start by lending them an unsolicited helping hand before you make your own request. Cialdini says the effect is amplified when what you give is meaningful, unexpected and personalized.\u000a\u000aCommitment\u000a\u000aWhat it is: People want to be consistent with what they've already said or done. "If someone tries to get you to take a small step in a particular direction -- so small that it seems trivial -- beware, because you'll now be much more likely to take a larger step in that direction ... when asked," Cialdini said.\u000a\u000aHow it's used: When you make a reservation at a restaurant, a simple change in the host or hostess' phraseology can make you much more likely to call back if your plans change, Cialdini says. Rather than telling you to "please call if you have to change or cancel your reservation," asking "will you please call if you have to change or cancel your reservation?" -- and waiting for an affirmative response -- results in far more compliance.\u000a\u000aHow you can use it: As any good lawyer might tell you, always get your offer in writing. Bonus points if you're able to get someone to promise you something voluntarily or in front of witnesses. And if you have more than one request, Cialdini says, always start with the larger one. If you get rejected or denied, you can counter with a lesser ask, which is then more likely to be granted.\u000a\u000aSocial proof\u000a\u000aWhat it is: "People want to follow the lead of what those around them, like them, have already done in a situation," Cialdini said. "That reduces our uncertainty about what we should do in that situation."\u000a\u000aHow it's used: Think of it like peer pressure or pack mentality. Cialdini conducted a study with hotel guests who were asked to reuse their towels to help the environment. When they were informed that most other guests chose to reuse their towels, people were 29% more likely to do it themselves. When they were told that the majority of guests who stayed in their particular room reused their towels, people were 39% more likely to do it, too.\u000a\u000aHow you can use it: This one's pretty simple. Want someone to do or buy something? Tell them -- or better yet, show them -- that others are doing it.\u000a\u000aAuthority\u000a\u000aWhat it is: "People prefer to say yes to those who can show them evidence that what is being recommended comes from legitimate ... authorities on the topic," Cialdini said. "If an expert says it, it must be true," according to his presentation.\u000a\u000aHow it's used: Look no further than the celebrity endorsement! These are particularly powerful if, for example, a professional athlete is pitching a product related to his or her sport. But, Cialdini says, if you simply dress someone up to look like an expert -- if you give them a suit and tie or eyeglasses -- that often works just as well.\u000a\u000aHow you can use it: Don't ever assume that people know what your specialty is, Cialdini says. Remind them, and underscore why they should listen to you over everyone else. Do you have experience solving the type of problem now at hand? Lay it all out on the table.\u000a\u000aLiking\u000a\u000aWhat it is: "We prefer to say yes to those who we like. That's not a surprise," Cialdini said. "What's interesting is how simple it can be for us to get somebody to like us by simply identifying a commonality that exists." Maybe you bond over a hobby, a taste in music or where you're from. Another thing that can get someone to like you? Giving them compliments. Flattery, it turns out, can get you just about anywhere.\u000a\u000aHow it's used: At one time or another, we've all fallen for a salesperson telling us we look great in an outfit -- even though, deep down, we know we don't. Or perhaps it's a questionable haircut that we grow to regret. Cialdini says hairdressers and barbers can increase their tips simply by telling their customers how good a certain style looks on them. Even if these compliments aren't sincere, people are more likely to respond affirmatively in the moment. But if you discover that someone isn't being sincere -- or worse, that they're being malicious -- you'll lose trust in them and experience a boomerang effect.\u000a\u000aHow you can use it: " How to Win Friends and Influence People " is one of the most popular self-help books of all time -- and with good reason. Dale Carnegie was on to something. Be nice, plain and simple. Get closer to someone by finding common ground. Compliment people, even when they don't necessarily deserve it, but be sincere and specific. Cialdini calls it "charm and disarm."\u000a\u000aScarcity\u000a\u000aWhat it is: You want what you can't have.\u000a\u000aHow it's used: Limited time offer! Call now! Operators are standing by! This principle works via the concept of anticipated regret, says Cialdini, in which you think about how bad you'll feel if you miss out on a purchase or experience. Sometimes, if you don't act immediately, you will miss out. Other times, these tactics work to convince you to buy -- or buy more -- of what you don't need. Research has shown that even limiting a product that is in abundant supply to a certain number per customer makes you want more than what you're being told you can have.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, if you're told that you're being offered information about scarcity exclusively, your drive to buy is even higher, because you feel as though you're getting an advantage over everybody else. "We notice ourselves paying concentrated attention to this information and assume that it must be warranted attention," Cialdini said.\u000a\u000aHow you can use it: Tell people that you've got inside information and that if they listen to you, they'll come out ahead.\u000a\u000aWhat's a consumer to do?\u000a\u000aAll six of these principles have an evolutionary purpose, Cialdini says: They allow people who receive certain information to decide whether to accept it and then whether to act.\u000a\u000a"These six principles generally steer people correctly into choices," Cialdini said. "That's why they've evolved to be the ones we're particularly sensitive to, in deciding how to choose."\u000a\u000aWhen does it all backfire? If you're not sincere and you get busted, if you don't reciprocate, if you go back on your word, if others aren't really doing what you say they're doing, if you're not the expert you claim to be, if your compliment is insincere, if there's ample supply of what you've said is scarce.\u000a\u000aThen, "you go from having a positive reaction to having a very negative reaction, in which you don't want to do business with and don't want to interact with that individual," Cialdini said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWhat about that TV Cialdini bought? As you might have expected, he went back to the store the next day to see whether the space on the shelf was filled with another TV -- and it wasn't.\u000a\u000aSince the salesman had been honest about the scarcity of the product, Cialdini went online and posted a positive review: reciprocating the purchase with praise, honoring his commitment to leave good feedback, offering online shoppers social proof of an honest transaction, establishing himself as an authority on this particular purchase and "liking" the salesman with a sincere compliment.\u000a\u000aFour years later, Cialdini still has the TV and says he likes it a lot.

aVStory highlights Tony Lai and Maggie Chan's miniatures faithfully document Hong Kong's fast disappearing heritage\u000a\u000aHours are spent on minute details to ensure realistic accuracy of the reproductions\u000a\u000aHong Kong (CNN) Tony Lai remembers visiting Hong Kong's Lamma Island as a child. Laundry hung from balconies, fishermen perched on the cliffside and dim lights illuminating rust-stained shacks.\u000a\u000aThese images left a deep impression on the artist. So, years later, Lai decided to recreate the scene in minute detail. His miniature artwork forms part of a project that hopes to preserve memories of the former British colony's disappearing past.\u000a\u000a"I took a lot of time researching, finding old photos, interviewing, sourcing materials and talking to people who used to live [on Lamma Island] to make sure we got everything right," Lai says in his new Hong Kong workshop, which he shares with fellow miniature artist Maggie Chan.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year the two artists opened TOMA Miniatures , a small studio where they offer classes and collaborate on new artworks. Miniatures of a barbershop, an old village and an herbal tea shop are on display alongside workstations littered with cutting boards, rulers and knives.\u000a\u000aThis scene depicts life on Lamma Island, with people going about their daily chores in the once dilapidated village.\u000a\u000aAs the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China nears, many Hong Kong residents have been recalling their homeland's past with a sense of nostalgia. But others fear that the city's heritage is disappearing, with historic sites being destroyed to make way for shopping malls and commercial high-rises.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVMel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. This commentary has been updated since its publication. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I just finished reading one of the most powerful things I've ever seen.\u000a\u000aIf you've already seen it, you likely feel the same way:\u000a\u000aIt is riveting. It's raw. I hung on every single word.\u000a\u000aIt is the 12-page victim impact statement written by a woman who was raped in January 2015 on the Stanford University campus after a night of drinking at a party.\u000a\u000aThe power of her words stood in stark contrast to those of the father of her attacker. He, too, wrote a letter to the judge who held his son's fate in his hands. It is deeply disturbing in its plainspoken and clueless banality, and tells you everything you need to know about why the crime of rape so frequently goes unpunished in America.\u000a\u000aThis is a case with no ambiguity. There were witnesses to her attack: two male Stanford students were riding their bikes across campus when they spotted Brock Allen Turner on top of a woman who wasn't moving. These men are among the heroes in her heartbreakingly sad story.\u000a\u000aThey chased him, tackled him and held him until the police came. The victim had no memory of the rape. She was unconscious behind a dumpster when Turner assaulted her. His defense: she consented.\u000a\u000aHe was convicted of all three felony accounts and will register as a sex offender. He faced 14 years in prison, and will only serve six months. (update: Turner was released from jail Friday after serving 3 months of his sentence.)\u000a\u000aAt the sentencing, the victim read her letter aloud and addressed Turner directly. In it, she gives a harrowing description of her rape and a jaw-dropping account of its aftermath. Reading it will expose you to the horror every rape victim faces as she is retraumatized over and over while society seeks "justice" against her rapist.\u000a\u000aI'm a parent. I was so moved that I printed out a copy. I wanted my family to read it. Not just our two daughters, but my husband and our son.\u000a\u000aThat's who should be reading this letter. Give it to your sons, your brothers and your mates.\u000a\u000aIf anything is going to change the culture of rape in our society, it will be a turnaround led by men like the two guys who stopped it that night and the Santa Clara county district attorney, Jeff Rosen, who called the sentence "unjust."\u000a\u000aRosen added that "the fact that the defendant preyed upon an intoxicated stranger on a college campus should not be viewed as less serious than if he assaulted an intoxicated stranger in downtown Palo Alto... Campus rape is no different than off-campus rape. Rape is rape."\u000a\u000aWe women know all too well about victim blaming, alcohol as an excuse for assault. It's not alcohol that's raping women; it is men.\u000a\u000aOur sons, all the young men in our lives need to be told: Alcohol is never an excuse\u000a\u000aAs the victim wrote: "Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked."\u000a\u000aIt's black and white: If a woman is drunk, she can't consent.\u000a\u000aAfter hearing from the victim, the judge also considered the appalling letter from the rapist's father, Dan Turner.\u000a\u000aIn it, he pleads with the judge for leniency for his son, explaining that his son should not have to go to prison for "20 minutes of action." The father describes how "this" has affected his son negatively\u2014he has lost his appetite and doesn't like eating "ribeye steak" anymore.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? 03:45\u000a\u000aHe writes, "The fact that he now has to register as a sexual offender for the rest of his life forever alters where he can live, visit, work, and interact with people and organization." He argues that his son's "life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve."\u000a\u000aIn the end, the judge sentenced Turner to six months in county prison, saying a harsher penalty would have a "severe impact" on the aspiring athlete. His sentence includes probation and his name in a sex offender registry.\u000a\u000aThat last part isn't to punish Turner -- it's to protect us all from him. You know why he has to register as a sexual offender? It's because he committed a sexual crime.\u000a\u000aEven after the trial. Even after the conviction, there is still denial -- Turner's dad writing that his son has "never been violent to anyone including the night of" the crime! Twelve jurors believed otherwise. And now the Turners will appeal.\u000a\u000aSocial media has been rightfully ablaze. The most compelling tweet I have seen is this one by Twitter user Jez Kemp, who edited the dad's letter to highlight the victim-blaming, swapping in female pronouns to illuminate the issue. Take a look:\u000a\u000aRape isn't a story about alcohol. It's one of choices. And every man has a choice. To rape or not. To rescue or ignore. To deliver justice or give someone a slap on the wrist.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that will change this is awareness by men. The good guys. That's why I'm asking you to share this letter with your sons, your brothers and your friends.

aVMore than 20 people have been detained by Turkish security forces for wearing a white T-shirt with the word "HERO" written on it in block letters.\u000a\u000aIn mid-July, chaos broke out in a courtroom in southwest Turkey when Gokhan Guclu -- a former soldier accused of his connections to an assassination attempt on President Tayyip Recep Erdogan during the 2016 failed military coup -- turned up to a court hearing in one of the T-shirts, prompting the session to be adjourned.\u000a\u000aGuclu is also accused of belonging to what the Turkish government refers to as the Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization (FETO). Gulen , the reclusive Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of hatching the military coup attempt, has said that his supporters could have been involved in the coup attempt but has always denied any direct connection.\u000a\u000aAn investigation into Guclu -- and his choice of courtroom clothing -- was soon launched.\u000a\u000aGuclu's sister sent him the T-shirt while he was in jail awaiting trial and prison authorities allowed Guclu to wear it to the hearing, according to state news media Anadolu.\u000a\u000aThe prosecutor's office is now investigating Guclu's sister and the government agencies responsible for running the prison where Guclu is incarcerated, according to Anadolu\u000a\u000aDarbeci askerin 'hero' ti\u015förtüne böyle yan\u0131t verdiler https://t.co/upgkazBzVT pic.twitter.com/jmCYEGNQ0c \u2014 CNN Türk (@cnnturk) July 14, 2017\u000a\u000aThe day following Guclu's court appearance, a crowd of Erdogan supporters gathered outside the courthouse where they hung another white T-shirt embroidered with the word "TRAITOR" on it from a noose.\u000a\u000aPolitical protest or fashion faux paux?\u000a\u000aThe "HERO" T-shirts were originally sold by a Turkish clothing store ubiquitous in shopping centers throughout the country.

aV(CNN) In a doctor's waiting room in South London sit three people of varying ages and ethnicities, waiting among a sea of empty green plastic chairs.\u000a\u000aIt's Tuesday afternoon in the Hetherington Group Practice, which serves more than 8,500 people from dozens of miles in every direction from its base in the bustling area of Brixton.\u000a\u000aAdorning the many notice boards on the walls are posters asking people to get flu vaccinations, to embrace more walking as part of their day to day and to speak up if they feel that they may have symptoms of bowel cancer.\u000a\u000aAnother poster informs that the Accident and Emergency room at the local hospital "won't kiss it better," appealing to people not to visit their local ER when something is not urgent.\u000a\u000aRecords from the National Health Service show that the numbers of people visiting an emergency room in England have risen from just over 4.5 million per quarter in 2004 to almost 6 million per quarter by the end of 2017 -- almost a 25% increase.\u000a\u000aThe "patient pod" at the Hetherington Group Practice allows those registered to monitor their vitals and their mood in their own time.\u000a\u000aIn the corner of the waiting room sits a "patient pod" consisting of a computer, a blood pressure machine and scale, for people to measure their vitals in their own time.\u000a\u000aThey can even monitor their mood by answering a series of questions about how they're feeling and what they're thinking. The practice has more than 230 patients registered with severe mental health problems, such as psychosis.\u000a\u000a"It's about managing demand," said Dr. Steve Mowle, one of the nine physicians at the practice and a spokesman for the Royal College of General Practitioners\u000a\u000aThis "pod" and the option of a phone consultation aren't the norm for all general practitioners' facilities but Mowle -- like any other GP in the United Kingdom -- has a budget to spend on his practice each year, based on a capitation, an amount paid from the government's budget per patient registered. He and his partners may use it how best they see fit to meet the multiple needs of their large patient base.\u000a\u000aDemand on the practice has increased significantly in recent years.\u000a\u000aUnusually, the rise is not in terms of patient numbers, which have in fact fallen, but by people living longer with greater numbers of increasingly complex conditions to manage. Each day, Mowle will have contact with 40 to 50 patients, he explained, with 60% of those in person and the rest through phone consultations.\u000a\u000a"My clinics are longer," Mowle said. A clinic represents a half-day of seeing patients and is meant to last three hours each. His clinics routinely last at least five hours.\u000a\u000aSteve Mowle works at the Hetherington Group Practice in London, contacting 50 patients, on average, each day.\u000a\u000a"Being a full-time GP is impossible," he said, adding that there is "more and more administration" on top of seeing patients.\u000a\u000aThe demographic of his patient base is as vast as the region the practice covers, ranging from the homeless, newly arrived refugees and blue-collar workers to high-earning middle-class and lawyers and bankers whose houses are worth millions. More than 140 languages are spoken locally.\u000a\u000aDespite their differences, the patients at this clinic -- and anywhere else in the UK -- have one thing in common: Not one of them will pay or receive a bill for the care they receive here.\u000a\u000aTheir health care is free and universal and has been since the formation of the country's National Health Service in 1948.\u000a\u000aThe population's health care is funded through tax and compulsory national insurance contributions deducted from income, which go toward many state benefits.\u000a\u000aBut as the demand for health care has increased across all levels of care -- primary, secondary and tertiary -- so has the strain on this once-coveted health system -- particularly on its finances.\u000a\u000aA changing climate for health care\u000a\u000aHealth care budgets in the UK have been plateauing, with only minor increases in spending, as percentages of gross domestic product spent on it have been declining.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Kings Fund, an independent health care charity, the National Health Service is halfway through its most austere decade ever. Figures from the World Bank reflect this: In 2009, the UK spent 9.8% of its GDP on health care; by 2014, it fell to 9.1%, according to the World Bank.\u000a\u000aAlong with this came more people, who are living longer and with multiple conditions like diabetes and heart disease that require treatments also rising in cost. Meanwhile, hospital bed numbers have fallen, numbers visiting emergency rooms have risen, and the demand for social care -- such as home care or equipment -- in the community has increased with limited services in place to provide it, again leaving more people with fewer hospital beds.\u000a\u000a"The current situation is unsustainable," said Dr. Ian Eardley, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK and practicing surgeon at a hospital in Leeds. "There are patients who are medically fit but can't get help in the community, or support, to leave hospital."\u000a\u000aAusterity has brought extended wait times for people seeking elective or routine treatments, such as knee or hip surgery, while emergency treatments for serious issues such as cancer or heart attacks continue to be treated promptly, as they should, according to Mowle.\u000a\u000aGuidance requires anyone in the UK with signs of cancer be seen within two weeks.\u000a\u000a"(But) you can't bring patients in for elective surgeries," said Eardley, who further stressed the complexities surrounding people living longer.\u000a\u000a"People often live longer with other medical problems being controlled and managed," he said, adding that greater expectations by patients today and the tendency to discuss cases in greater detail all add time and strain to an already overwhelmed system.\u000a\u000aAnother financial constraint is the increasing, but important, role of computing.\u000a\u000a"Most of these countries have seen a need for increased spending with changing technology," said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\u000a\u000aReal National Health Service spending in 2015-16 increased by just 1.6%, according to the Kings Fund.\u000a\u000a"The budget has been frozen for too long," McKee said.\u000a\u000aMore funding is needed, he said, to decrease the debt owed by hospitals whose budgets were not enough and to ensure a greater transition from care settings into the community.\u000a\u000aIs more spending better for health care?\u000a\u000aThe UK spring budget for 2017 announced last week pledged £2 billion ($2.5 billion) toward adult social care over the next three years to "ease pressure on the NHS."\u000a\u000a£425 million ($525 million) was also announced to be invested in the NHS in the next three years, with £100 million ($125 million) going to Accident and Emergency departments in 2017-18, to help them manage increasing demand.\u000a\u000aExperts like McKee and Eardley welcome the investment, but believe it will not be enough.\u000a\u000a"The UK is not exceptional," McKee said, adding that other countries have similar levels of health care coverage using a tax-based system, including Finland, Sweden, Portugal and Spain. "The broad model of tax-based funding is common in quite a few countries."\u000a\u000aA recent report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (PDF) highlighted that, although access to care in the UK is good, the quality of care is uneven and continues to lag behind that of many other countries.\u000a\u000aMcKee also highlighted Germany and France, which spent 11.3% and 11.5% of their GDPs on health care, respectively, in 2014 and have more beds per capita, more doctors per 1,000 people and longer life expectancies\u000a\u000aGermany and France use a social insurance model to pay for their health care: Deductions are taken from income, but unlike in the US, everyone is covered, and companies don't make a profit. Those contributing also "own" the organizations involved through boards and unions, McKee said.\u000a\u000aPeople pay a fee at the point of care, though it's just $5 to $11 in Germany and $25 in France, which is often reimbursed.\u000a\u000aThe Western country spending the most on its health care is the US, which spent 17.1% of its GDP on health care in 2014.\u000a\u000aYet a series of factors -- such as a lower life expectancy and uneven coverage -- highlight that increased expenditure alone is not always a good thing. A system to manage it best is key.\u000a\u000a"The US is an outlier internationally," McKee said. "No one would say the US (model) is good ... for the population."\u000a\u000aTreatments and new technologies for conditions such as cancer often lead from the US, but the key issues are access and the varying amounts that could be charged as a fee to provide them.\u000a\u000aMcKee added that the private insurance-based model in the US, covering only those who are insured, leads to companies in the industry working toward profit. "This leads to more division and less universal coverage," he said.\u000a\u000a"If you have lots of money, you get good care," Eardley said about US health care. "If you don't have money, you don't fit into the system," he added, calling such a system "wasteful."\u000a\u000aExperts in the UK are eager to stress the cost-efficiency of the National Health Service. According to the Royal College of General Practitioners, the UK pays the least per patient than most countries in the West.\u000a\u000aIn comparison with the US, Europe's universal coverage, with tax- and social-fund-based financing through contributions, spends less and has more care that's better, according to McKee.\u000a\u000aMany countries on the continent still have a small sector of patients using private insurance. In the UK, an estimated 11% of the population has private insurance, often through their employers. In Germany, top earners can opt out of the public system and pay privately instead, representing an estimated 10% of Germans.\u000a\u000aAt the core of the debate around health care, money alone is not the issue; it's the model of care.\u000a\u000aWhat is health care?\u000a\u000a"Health care should be free at the point of delivery," said Dr. Richard Kerr, a council member of the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK and consultant neurosurgeon at a large regional hospital in Oxford. "There is a fee structure behind it, but when a patient comes to see me ... the issue of money never comes into it."\u000a\u000aKerr believes countries worldwide can learn from those on mainland Europe, such as Germany and France, where the population receives great care, in his opinion, with good quality but pays more for it through taxes. "They are taxed higher but have much more investigative health care," Kerr said.\u000a\u000a"We should look at the different models of health care and take the good aspects of it ... without getting rid of the basics of what we've got," he added. "But what you get for your buck is more here."\u000a\u000aWith the UK being more cost-efficient, he ponders whether that is something to be proud of. "If you receive the same level of care with less money," that is indeed a point of pride. But with patient waiting times up to 20 weeks in some cases, he added, that is not the case.\u000a\u000aThe neuroscience department at his hospital in Oxford is the regional hospital, a point of tertiary care where patients requiring specialist procedures are referred from their district hospitals. It serves more than 2.8 million people across a 100-mile radius, said Kerr, with just 60 beds in his main ward and another 13 in the intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aThe building is just a decade old, light and airy in design, but as he walks through the wards, he highlights the shuffling he and his team do on a regular basis between main wards and the ICU to ensure that all patients can access a bed and undergo their procedures.\u000a\u000aStaffers borrow beds between the departments, he explains, so spare beds in the ICU will sometimes be used for his less severe cases. But he shows further frustration with the lack of social care resources for patients away from his hospital, such as the provision of home carers or equipment to keep them mobile, or changes to make their homes more accessible or to help them access day centers. These are crucial, he believes, particularly as the population continues to live longer.\u000a\u000aNeurosurgeon Richard Kerr faces the challenge of bed shortages in his hospital in Oxford most weeks.\u000a\u000aBetween 2014 to 2015, 72% of more than 1.8 million new requests for social care support requested from councils in England were clients aged 65 and over, according to NHS data\u000a\u000aIn addition to keeping beds unnecessarily occupied, resulting in a "domino effect," he explains that "if a patient has social care needs, a busy environment (like a hospital) isn't the best place for them," he said.\u000a\u000aNeurosurgical procedures vary also greatly, with some patients needing just 24 hours to recover while others have stayed as long as 100 days.\u000a\u000a"We have to cancel patients at short notice sometimes," he said, not only leaving patients untreated but leaving surgeons unable to do their jobs.\u000a\u000aDuring this visit, Kerr is smiling, as for once, he has some beds going spare on his wards. He is ready for whatever comes his way. This is not the norm, he said.\u000a\u000a"There is pressure on us now, but this is not new," he said of demands on the wards and his outpatient clinics. "My clinic overruns. It always does ... so there's frustration there."\u000a\u000aBut Kerr wants to carry these realities forward and kick-start a debate to get the UK government investing more for even greater efficiency, enabling greater capacity to deliver care.\u000a\u000a"When I'm old and crumbly, I don't want to have to wait," he said, thinking of his patients. He and others in the field want reform or restructuring to get people discussing what health care is, as its meaning has changed dramatically since the National Health Service's inception.\u000a\u000a"We need a commission," he said, stating a need to push for patients, cross-party politicians, policymakers and medical practitioners to come together to define health care.\u000a\u000aMowle agreed, adding that the separation of "health care" and "social care" is no longer acceptable and is what has led to the fragmentation of services in the UK.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We need a debate asking, what do you want out of health care?" Kerr said. "Do you want to continue treating everything? Yes, you do, but we can't do it under the current financial envelope."\u000a\u000aCurrently within the health service, certain conditions are not covered -- such as more cosmetic procedures -- leaving some patients unsatisfied.\u000a\u000aThe need to identify what people on each side of the debate believe health care to be, and which aspects they prioritize, will help manage expectations as well as resources, Kerr explains, not only in the UK, but also more globally.\u000a\u000aHe believes this will lead to a happier and more satisfied patient base, particularly among those left behind -- either waiting in the UK or uninsured in the US. But it won't be easy.\u000a\u000a"Health care is incredibly complex. ... The growing number of older people with multi-morbidities are having very very complex trajectories through the health and social care system," McKee said. "We shouldn't underestimate the challenges."

aV(CNN) China may be home to both the longest and highest bridges in the world, but neither is as pioneering as the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.\u000a\u000aBuilt during China's tumultuous Cultural Revolution, the double-decked bridge was considered groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 1968. But more importantly to some, it was also the first modern bridge to be designed and built by China without help from foreign architects.\u000a\u000aAs major repairs get underway ahead of next year's 50th anniversary, the bridge remains a source of pride in Nanjing, China's former capital. A project commissioned by railway officials hopes to secure the bridge's legacy by documenting its history, according to the initiative's head Lu Andong, a professor at Nanjing University's School of Architecture and Urban Planning.\u000a\u000a"The bridge was so important, and it's undoubtedly a symbol of the city," he said. "It is being repaired for transportation and safety purposes, but I would relish the chance to transform the bridge's tower and the affiliated park into places of memory."\u000a\u000aMade in China\u000a\u000aChina had initially hoped to build Nanjing's bridge with its communist allies, the USSR. Having already helped construct a crossing at Wuhan (about 280 miles up the river), the Soviets once again offered technical assistance. But soon after construction began in 1960, relations between the two nations soured.\u000a\u000aWang Shiqing is pictured with railway tickets featuring illustrations of the bridge, part of his vast collection.\u000a\u000aSoviet experts withdrew from the project ahead of the Sino-Soviet split -- the breakdown of relations between the world's largest communist powers from 1960. The bridge was nonetheless completed eight years later. China considered the accomplishment to be a major feat of engineering -- and a propaganda victory.\u000a\u000aAt over 5,000 feet long, the bridge carries both cars and trains. Its upper deck is a four-lane highway with sidewalks, while the railway tracks are now part of the Beijing-Shanghai train route.\u000a\u000a"Everybody loves the bridge," said Wang Shiqing, a longtime Nanjing resident who has collected over 1,000 pieces of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge memorabilia.

Trains passing through the city would have to be disassembled and loaded onto boats in order to continue their journey.\u000a\u000aUpon its completion, the bridge changed the lives of the city's residents."In terms of the function, it made people's lives so much easier," said Wang, who was born the same year the bridge was opened.

Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aThe bridge united visual expressions of technology and progress, according to Lu.\u000a\u000a"It is not just infrastructure but a piece of architecture," he said. "The bridge's form expressed speed, penetration and force-flow -- similar to what was seen in Italian futurism. The form of the bridge intends to express an inner flow of forces, as if the structure is merely a pipe of energy."\u000a\u000aBut on the ground, the spatial composition of the bridge's towers resorted to traditional architectural language: central access, a processional route and a podium.\u000a\u000a"This design became a canonical case of Chinese modern architecture and was extremely important. This formula had enduring impact."\u000a\u000aA 'pop icon of modernity'\u000a\u000aAs well as sculptures of peasants, workers and soldiers, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge also features Mao Zedong quotes and a 230-foot statue of the former leader.\u000a\u000a"The red flags and magnolia decorations are very Chinese," Wang said, referring to the three flag-shaped sculptures found at the top of the bridge's towers.\u000a\u000aThis particular design reflects the "Three Red Banners" -- a major propaganda campaign during the Cultural Revolution. The "banners" represented ideologies that called for the construction of a socialist state in China.\u000a\u000aThis poster was designed by the Nanjing Great Bridge Workers Creative Group and the Revolutionary Publishing Group of the Shanghai Publication System.\u000a\u000aThe bridge often appeared in propaganda posters, which were keen to imply that the structure represented a "great victory of Mao Zedong Thought" (the political theory known outside China as "Maoism"). One such poster featured a quote from Mao: "Chinese people have drive and strength -- we have to reach and overtake levels of advancement across the world."\u000a\u000aErected during a turbulent time in China's history, the bridge had far-reaching cultural impact, according to Lu.\u000a\u000a"This bridge is one of the most recognized achievements of the Cultural Revolution era," he said. "It is both a political monument and a symbol of technological and historical success. Its image appeared on cups, pencils, shoes, mirrors, cigarettes and bicycles nationwide -- the bridge became a pop icon of modernity."\u000a\u000aThe legacy of the bridge also lives on through the people who were named after it. According to Wang, many people in Nanjing named their firstborns Chang Jiang (Chinese for "Yangtze") and their second Da Qiao (which means "big bridge").\u000a\u000aRestoring former glories\u000a\u000aIn April 2016 the National Development and Reform Commission, China's state planning body, approved a 27-month program of repairs to the bridge. According to a government report, "safety and durability risks" were key factors in the decision.\u000a\u000aBut the structure will be getting a facelift too. A $160.7 million (RMB 1.09 billion) investment will be used to restore some of the iconic statues, including those found on nearby river banks. Sculptures on the bridge will be reinforced, with handrails and piers also undergoing renovations.\u000a\u000aWith younger generations less aware of the bridge's historical significance, Lu hopes that the renovations will restore not only the bridge, but the city's interest in it.\u000a\u000a"The older generation obviously takes more pride in the bridge," he said. "It is very important to re-access the memory of the bridge in a creative way, to allow people of all ages to experience and understand the memories of it.

aVParag Khanna is a senior research fellow at the Centre on Asia and Globalisation at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Much has been made recently of how the policies of the Trump administration clash with the global conventional wisdom -- and how these contrast with the new spirit of global leadership emanating from China.\u000a\u000aAs Trump touted protectionism and "America First," Chinese premier Xi Jinping defended globalization at Davos. While Trump was bashing the stinginess of the US' NATO on defense, China convened the "One Belt, One Road" summit of dozens of Eurasian nations to ratify the largest coordinated cross-border infrastructure spending initiative in human history.\u000a\u000aAnd no sooner had Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement than China and the EU signed a raft of new partnerships around clean energy.\u000a\u000aWith or without Trump, it is undeniable that a deep and broad strain in American society and leadership is skeptical about trade liberalization, multilateralism and binding global norms. Whereas once America was the missionary driver of all three, right now it formally rejects them.\u000a\u000aThis gap between America's preferred approaches and other stakeholders extends very strongly into the geopolitical arena as well.\u000a\u000aConsider the latest developments in the standoff with North Korea . After it demonstrated long-range ballistic missile capability and the potential to send nuclear warheads on a much further trajectory than previously estimated, Asian neighbors are ever more vocal that diplomacy with Pyongyang -- even recognition of the regime in exchange for a moratorium on further nuclear tests -- is the obvious path forward.\u000a\u000aYet still, America's national security adviser H.R. McMaster and UN ambassador Nikki Haley continue to insist that military options are on the table, including pre-emptive strikes.\u000a\u000aThen there is Russia. Germany's liberal FDP party leader Christian Lindner caused a stir last week by stating what was already on most Germans' minds: Antagonistic relations with Russia are not in Europe's interest, and reconciling may require accepting its 2014 seizure of Crimea.\u000a\u000aIndeed, the German government is irate about new US sanctions that are as much about promoting American LNG exports to Europe as they are about punishing Russia.\u000a\u000aAnd with respect to Iran, new sanctions in response to the country's expanding ballistic missile program have the immediate effect of pushing Iran and Russia closer together -- with Russia eager to expand its sales of tanks, jets and surface-to-air missiles to Tehran.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, of course, not removing sanctions on Iran would only give it greater incentive to accelerate its nuclear program, since its compliance with the Joint Plan of Action will have not been rewarded.\u000a\u000aAmerica's allies and partners don't just disagree with Washington's policies due to differences of opinion, but because US policies are backfiring nearly everywhere. America's abdication of credible global leadership is already resulting in significant shifts in how major domains of global activity are being managed by other powers.\u000a\u000aConsider that China is now the top trading partner of 124 countries, more than twice as many (52) for whom the US is the most significant trade relationship, according to IMF data.\u000a\u000aThe more than one decade long "supercycle" in which voracious Asian consumption fueled peak commodities prices and enabled Latin America and Africa to notch sustained high growth rates is attributable to Chinese and Indian demand, not America's open markets.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Gary Samore: Korea de-nuclearization unrealistic Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gary Samore: Korea de-nuclearization unrealistic 06:07\u000a\u000aThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), one of the principal multilateral platforms underwriting the new Silk Roads connecting Europe and Asia, is largely Chinese financed.\u000a\u000aThe AIIB is one major example of how Asian countries are aggressively reaching out across the world's major population centers to share their development models and establish partnerships for the long-term.\u000a\u000aWith this in mind, "leadership" needs to be defined as more than the American Navy patrolling the high seas, America's army boots on the ground in hotspots and American heads of state giving speeches at the Brandenburg Gate.\u000a\u000aLeadership today is about who provides the infrastructure financing, technical assistance, construction equipment and other essential underpinnings of the modernization most of the world still needs to achieve. Commentators who spend too much time inside the Beltway echo chamber and too little time out in the real world have been missing this irrefutable fact for the better part of the post-Cold War era.\u000a\u000aBut from the financial crisis to the election of Donald Trump, the past decade has delivered the rude awakening needed to spark a reinterpretation of this period.\u000a\u000aWestern democratic liberalism won't win 21st century admirers on the back of 20th century accomplishments unless they continue to bring the large-scale benefits heavily populous emerging markets need.\u000a\u000aThis is, of course, precisely what is no longer happening as America in particular becomes a land of a few "haves" and many "have-nots." No doubt rising powers want to import or steal Silicon Valley technology and creative mindsets, but there is precious little else that suits their current needs.\u000a\u000aAnd both China and India have long been inspired by Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore, the first world city-state now overseen by the great statesman's technocratic son Lee Hsien Loong.\u000a\u000aBear in mind that even the charismatic former US President Barack Obama did not fundamentally enhance America's global standing or reverse its relative decline. Personalities are a transient way to measure power -- and Trump proves how they are more likely to do lasting damage than memorable good.\u000a\u000aDespite Emmanuel Macron's victory in France and Angela Merkel's likely re-election in Germany, the West as a whole lacks any singular figure commanding global admiration or nation beckoning global followership.\u000a\u000aEven the emergence of a competent and compelling new face in Western politics -- not that there is one to speak of at the moment -- could not reverse these Eastern gains in the leadership arena.\u000a\u000aThe most powerful force in history is not American empire, but the law of supply and demand. In the marketplace for global order, today already it is the East that delivers what the world needs more than the West.

aVConcluding a dedicated week of CNN International programming on Italian Renaissance artist, Leonardo da Vinci, a half-hour special \u2018Leonardo \u2013 The Lost Painting\u2019 charts the amazing discovery of a newly-found Da Vinci painting.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year the art world made an extremely rare discovery: a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Experts believe only 15 paintings by the artist still exist, including the iconic \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019 and \u2018The Last Supper\u2019. The newly-discovered work \u2013 known as 'Salvator Mundi ' or \u2018Saviour of the World\u2019 \u2013 depicts the head and shoulders of Christ, and though 500 years old, after cleaning and restoration, is in remarkably good condition.\u000a\u000aCNN has gained rare access to this globally-significant find, as arts expert Nick Glass travels to New York and becomes one of the first few people on earth to see the painting first-hand.

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Published 18th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Every day, Emirates' airline catering facility prepares 180,000 meals to service its more than 400 daily flights around the globe. The Emirates facility is one of the world's biggest airline food factories, but there are similar operations across the world.\u000a\u000aThe scale of inflight catering is astonishing -- as is its waste problem.\u000a\u000aHalf-eaten meals, tossed beers, empty plastic water bottles, napkins, discarded packaging -- look around a cabin at the end of any flight and you can get a sense of the waste on a small scale.\u000a\u000aAnd the big picture? According to the International Air Transport Association, airlines produced 5.2 million tons of waste last year, and will produce over 10 million tons annually by 2030.\u000a\u000aWhile the statistic includes a host of disposable products -- from wine bottles to plastic toothbrushes -- a large chunk is directly related to food service. From harnessing behavioral data and using cups that can be composted to donating nonperishable food items and on-board recycling, here's what airlines are doing to divert cabin waste from landfills.\u000a\u000aWhat's the problem?\u000a\u000aThe problem is compounded by various factors: the sheer scale of the catering process, international health regulations, varying governmental waste policies and space constraints on board.\u000a\u000aAirlines must plan for food safety, hygiene, freshness and weight -- hence the vast amounts of plastic in every plane cabin.\u000a\u000a"Dining in the sky is quite different [than] popping down to your local café," Mark Ross-Smith, a big data specialist, airline consultant, and founder of Travel Data Daily, tells CNN Travel. "Individual wrapping is required to keep food fresh, hygienic and free from contamination. Anyone who has eaten a bread roll on a plane that has been out of wrapping for more than a few minutes can attest to how dry air affects food quality!"\u000a\u000aThere's also a concern about customer satisfaction, which leads airlines to stock more food than required on board flights.\u000a\u000a"Our fear of not serving all passengers results in an increased load, which increases waste," says Peter Lawrance, head chef of Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). "Airlines are often doing a best guess of how much passengers will buy or consume."\u000a\u000aA finely tuned computer system which can customize catering to changing needs is not yet standard, he adds. "This type of system often needs to be created from scratch."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 11 INSIDE THE FOOD FACTORY: The Emirates Flight Catering facility in Dubai is one of the world's largest airline food facilities, preparing up to 180,000 meals every day.\u000a\u000aDigesting data\u000a\u000aFlexible catering might not be commonplace now, but Ross-Smith says it's one way airlines could curb waste.\u000a\u000a"You can pretty much predict anything with data science -- from how much a hotel guest would be willing to pay for a suite upgrade and how you spend airline miles. The passenger experience will continue to be the focal point but on a deeper, more granular level. This is the type of stuff airlines can win awards for."\u000a\u000aHow does it work? By tracking passengers' online data -- from location to income, spending habits and consumption -- airlines can predict passenger behavior.\u000a\u000a"Businesses using data [that consumers have] published online is as common as having a cup of tea," explains Ross-Smith. "Companies use tools to [scrape data] and turn behavior into actionable insights. Once companies turn data into insights, they own that data. It's no longer yours."\u000a\u000aBut airlines don't necessarily need to trawl the Internet to learn what type of tea you like to drink. Ross-Smith says data can also be applied to behavioral patterns in flight. By tracking consumption over time, airlines could predict which meal type you're most likely to order on-board -- and adjust stock lists accordingly.\u000a\u000a"Based on history of sales and other flight information on specific routes, we are implementing our own developed tool to increase diverse loading instructions to match and predict the passenger needs on every specific route," says Lawrance.\u000a\u000aPay as you go\u000a\u000aAnother solution is the pay-as-you-go approach, where travelers order meals before a flight.\u000a\u000aThis is already the status quo for most low-cost carriers (LCCs) around the world, from HK Express in Hong Kong to Norwegian Air Shuttle. By providing this system -- where passengers buy meals using an app or website -- airlines can simultaneously meet demand and minimize waste.\u000a\u000a"One might argue that LCCs are more waste-efficient because they don't give free things to every passenger, so people only buy what they consume," says Ross-Smith.\u000a\u000a"Pre-ordering of meals also has obvious catering advantages. It lowers costs and weight on board, which translates to lower fuel burn."\u000a\u000aThis approach is becoming more widely embraced by full-service international airlines as well, with the likes of SAS, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Qantas creating online and mobile booking portals.\u000a\u000a"We are focusing more and more on pre-order food," says Lawrance. "We have made it easier to online pre-order your gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian or non-pork meals. This reduces waste and, in the end, cost. Ultimately we believe this will increase passenger satisfaction by offering the products our customer wants at the right time or flight."\u000a\u000aQantas is one of several airlines to introduce online and mobile booking portals.\u000a\u000aThat's a wrap\u000a\u000aReliance on plastic and paper also contribute to the issue, but some airlines are experimenting with recycling solutions and packaging alternatives to minimize waste.\u000a\u000aIn its 2016 Sustainability Report, SAS outlined a few ongoing initiatives: locally sourced food, with a "nose-to-tail" approach to limit waste; access to recycling on board; lightweight reusable plates and silverware; and recyclable or combustible disposable packaging.\u000a\u000aLikewise, Qantas has begun to use recycled materials for its packaging as well as plastic-free headsets. The airline has also partnered with OzHarvest -- a food rescue organization that collects 87 tons of food every week across Australia -- to donate unused perishables to those in need. With these changes, Qantas estimates that it will divert 350 tons of waste from landfills annually.\u000a\u000aEmirates has also introduced new measures to combat waste, including recycling facilities on board, for easy sorting of glass, plastic, aluminum, and paper products. In addition, the Dubai-based airline has also introduced eco-friendly blankets, made from recycled plastic bottles. The airline expects this amenity to rescue more than 12,000 tons of bottles from landfills by 2019.\u000a\u000aZero cabin waste?\u000a\u000aBut perhaps the broadest initiative is the European Union's "Life + Zero Cabin Waste" plan, which aims for 80% reduction in aircraft waste arriving at Madrid's Barajas airport by 2020.\u000a\u000aAn airline participant, Spain-based Iberia has introduced reusable utensils -- and soon, recycling bins attached to service trolleys -- so that in-flight waste can be easily sorted.\u000a\u000aBack on solid ground, the program has analyzed types of waste arriving at the airport, and redesigned existing waste management treatment procedures to be more effective.

aVHong Kong (CNN) North Korea's accelerated missile testing may pose a risk to passenger jets in the area, officials fear, as Pyongyang does not regularly give notice of its plans as required under international agreements.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that it says is capable of hitting the continental United States\u000a\u000aBut the missile may have posed a more immediate threat, flying within miles of the flight path that a passenger jet had just completed.\u000a\u000aThe missile came down 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of Okushiri Island at around 11:27 a.m. ET Friday, according to the Japanese military.\u000a\u000aAccording to data from FlightRadar24 and the Japanese Self Defense Forces, and reviewed by CNN, Air France Flight 293 passed just east of the splash down site roughly five to 10 minutes prior to the missile impacting the water. At the time of the splashdown, the Air France flight was approximately 60 to 70 miles north of where the missile landed, according to a review of the data.\u000a\u000aAn Air France spokesman said there were 332 people on board at the time, 316 passengers and 16 crew.\u000a\u000aTwo airways -- fixed routes established for navigation purposes -- pass within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of where the missile is believed to have landed.\u000a\u000aABC News first reported on the plane's potential proximity to the missile Tuesday.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has been steadily expanding the range of its missile tests away from its east coast into Japanese waters.\u000a\u000aThe North Korean missile reached a peak altitude of 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) before dropping into the sea near Okushiri. Passenger jets fly at around 9,000 to 12,000 meters (30,000 to 40,000 feet).\u000a\u000aIn a statement Wednesday, Air France said that "North Korea's missile test zones don't interfere in any way" with the airline's flight paths and that Flight 293 completed its flight "without any reported incident."\u000a\u000a"Air France constantly analyzes potentially dangerous flyover zones and adapts its flight plans accordingly," the statement said.\u000a\u000aFriday's test wasn't the first time North Korean missiles have been seen as a potential threat to aviation. After a July 4 test, US Defense Department spokesman Jeff Davis warned the "missile flew through busy airspace used by commercial airliners."\u000a\u000aSpeaking to CNN on Wednesday, Davis said "responsible nations" should give notice before conducting missile tests, adding not doing so put planes, ships and spacecraft at risk.\u000a\u000aWe did it with our ATACMS test, or ATACMS exercise that we did with the Republic of Korea Friday night ...," he said, referring to the Army's Tactical Missile System. "We did it for our THAAD test over the weekend.We did it with our ATACMS test, or ATACMS exercise that we did with the Republic of Korea Friday night ...," he said, referring to the Army's Tactical Missile System.\u000a\u000a"Irresponsible nations fire these things off without putting out notice."\u000a\u000aNo warnings\u000a\u000aThe chance of an unaimed missile striking a plane are "billions to one," according to CNN aviation safety analyst David Soucie, but the ramifications are potentially huge and create a difficult decision for airlines operating in the area.\u000a\u000a"Does it start a war? Is it an act of war? The impact of what could happen if that did occur are more than just a cost-benefit analysis," Soucie said.\u000a\u000aUnder guidelines issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization , a UN agency tasked with governing air safety and other matters, states have the "responsibility to issue risk advisories regarding any threats to the safety of civilian aircraft operating in their airspace."\u000a\u000a"Said threats may include, but are not limited to, armed conflicts, ash clouds due to volcanic eruptions, (and) missile tests and rocket launches," the guidelines state\u000a\u000aSouth Korea has warned since at least 2014 that North Korea fails to issue notices to airmen (NOTAM) regularly when conducting missile launches . Such notices are issued to warn pilots and airlines of potential risks during their flights.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is "clearly breaching international norms" by failing to issue notifications, said Peter Harbison, executive chairman of the Australia-based Centre for Aviation\u000a\u000aCNN reached out to North Korean officials for comment on the issue but hasn't received a response.\u000a\u000aJapan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it issued a warning to all vessels and aircraft operating within its exclusive economic zone eight minutes after the launch of the North Korean missile.\u000a\u000aAir France confirmed it received the warning, but the message "did not specify any indication or instruction requiring an operational action on the part" of the airline. Two NOTAM messages were published but not transmitted to the crew because "the event had already passed when they were sent by the Japanese authorities," the airline said.\u000a\u000aFailure to issue proper guidelines can result in tragedy. During the 2014 conflict in Ukraine, airlines were told to fly above 26,000 feet (7,900 meters), a level at which they were believed to safe from ground attack.\u000a\u000aHowever, according to a comprehensive report into the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 by Dutch authorities , the Ukrainians may have failed to take into account the presence of weaponry posing a risk to civil aviation in the conflict zone.\u000a\u000aThe report concluded a missile -- which had a far greater range than other weapons in the area -- brought down the plane, killing almost 300 people on board.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED MH17 report: plane downed by Russian-made missile Replay More Videos ...

It's quite a big threat."\u000a\u000aA decision to adjust flight paths to compensate for any potential risk from North Korean activity would likely be a costly and difficult one, said Soucie, the CNN analyst.\u000a\u000a"The bigger picture is the fact that no one really has the authority to mandate (a no-fly zone)," he said. "It's up to each airline to make that decision."\u000a\u000aSuch a decision by an airline would require a significant diversion from usual flight paths and airways, potentially racking up large fuel costs for long-haul flights such as those bound from Asia to Western Europe.\u000a\u000aThe Hong Kong pilot said it would likely force some flights to carry out "technical stops to land and refuel somewhere" to complete their routes.\u000a\u000aEditor's note: The original version of this story said the Air France flight passed near the splash down site around seven minutes before the missile landed. This figure has been removed because it can't be precisely calculated with the available information. The distance of the flight from the splash down site has been amended from 62 - 68 miles to 60 - 70 miles.

While achromatopsia (also known as "total" colorblindness) occurs in around 1 in 30,000 people globally, the incidence in Pingelap's small population is believed to be between four and ten percent\u000a\u000aThe condition has been traced back to a former king , one of around 20 islanders to survive a catastrophic tsunami in the late 18th century. With most of his subjects wiped out, the king is believed to have helped repopulate Pingelap by having numerous children.\u000a\u000aButmany of his descendants inherited a rare gene that causes achromatopsia . The hereditary condition continues to be passed down through generations.\u000a\u000aColor is 'just a word'\u000a\u000aFascinated with how genetics shape people and communities, De Wilde has published her extraordinary images in a new book, "The Island of the Colorblind ." The photographs were shot on Pingelap and a larger island called Pohnpei, almost 300 kilometers away.\u000a\u000a"The Pingelapese formed small communities on Pohnpei," De Wilde explained. "(But even) among the Pingelapese there, the percentage of achromatopsia is still very high."\u000a\u000aDe Wilde attempts to see through the eyes of its colorblind residents by manipulating the tones and hues of her images. In a monochrome world, color is "just a word" to those who cannot see it, she said.\u000a\u000aJaynard Robert, a colorblind child, climbs a tree in the garden, to pick fruits and play.\u000a\u000aIslanders claim to "see" red the most, so De Wilde accentuated and manipulated the color by shooting in infrared.\u000a\u000aOthers told her that green is their favorite color, though it is one of the shades they are least able to recognize. The photographer believes that this is the Pingelapese people's way of conveying love for the jungle vegetation around them.\u000a\u000aSeeing the world differently\u000a\u000aBorn in Antwerp, the 29-year-old photographer has won awards for profiling people who see the world differently -- or who are themselves perceived as different -- including her series on dwarfism in China.\u000a\u000aIn another series, titled "Samoa Kekea," she documented albinism in Samoa. De Wilde sees a connection between this project and her study of colorblindness in Pingelap.\u000a\u000a"Albinism is a genetic condition" she said. "And you could say that -- due to natural borders the sea creates -- genes circulate in small island communities."\u000a\u000aAfter talking about her Samoa photographs on the radio, De Wilde was contacted by a listener who told her about Pingelap. It had previously been the subject of a book by British neurologist Oliver Sacks, who died the week before the photographer flew to the island in 2015.\u000a\u000a'A tiny dot in the big blue'\u000a\u000a"It wasn't easy to get to Pingelap," De Wilde said. "It is a little atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. A tiny dot in the big blue.\u000a\u000a"I flew to the US, from the mainland to Hawaii, then hopped to the Marshall Islands. I eventually set foot on Pohnpei, one of the bigger islands of the Federate States of Micronesia. From there I took a four-seat charter plane to Pingelap."\u000a\u000aUpon arrival, she found one street and no shops or restaurants. Islanders live off coconuts and the fish they catch, living a life that De Wilde described as "very basic."\u000a\u000aEric, a colorblind inhabitant of Pingelap, poses for a portrait lit by flashlight.\u000a\u000a"(People with) achromatopsia are extremely light-sensitive, which is a burden on a super sunny, tropical island," she said. "In the daylight, the world looks like a burned-out image. They can hardly keep their eyes open when outside.\u000a\u000a"They don't see color at all. That's why everything appears to them in shades of grey -- everything in between black and white. I didn't change any colors. The infrared camera did. And the other images I just converted to black and white using Photoshop."

aVMark Foster is one of the most successful British swimmers of all time and a six-time world champion. Now retired, he's writing for CNN during the 2017 World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When you first get into a swimming pool, no one sets out to be a world champion.\u000a\u000aNot me, not Michael Phelps, not any of the swimmers currently at the World Championships in Budapest\u000a\u000aIt generally just starts with being taken to the swimming pool as a kid.\u000a\u000aI was sporty and my mum wanted to keep me busy, whether that was basketball or swimming or whatever.\u000a\u000aBut there comes a point in your life when your sport chooses you and, for me, it started to get serious when I was about 10 years old.\u000a\u000aMy mum would wake me up at 5:15 am and, I'm not going to lie, there were days I hoped she would sleep through the alarm. She never did.\u000a\u000aI'd eat breakfast on the way to the pool and I'd do two hours training before school.

They got their revenge; these days they call me "golden boy."\u000a\u000aBut there were sacrifices, for both my family and me, and that will be the same for the current crop of elite swimmers.\u000a\u000aThe one that still haunts me 25 years on is missing my sister's wedding.\u000a\u000aAt the time, there was a competition that was offering money and we agreed as a family that I'd compete.\u000a\u000aLooking back, did the money make much difference to my life? Maybe not but it seemed important at the time.\u000a\u000aMark Foster won six world championship gold medals between 1993 and 2004.\u000a\u000a'It's hardly going down a coal mine'\u000a\u000aAs for other sacrifices, I have never looked at swimming like that.\u000a\u000aI was 11 years old when I competed at my age group championships, winning five out of six events.\u000a\u000aI looked at similar results in the US, China and Australia in the Swimming Times and compared myself to the fastest in the world, which was pretty cool.\u000a\u000aAnd as I grew older and eventually turned professional, my morning starts, mercifully, became later -- 8am, which was very manageable.\u000a\u000aAnd when people talk about sacrifices, I used to go to Australia every January for a six-week training camp. It's hardly going down a coal mine, is it?!\u000a\u000aI didn't know any different.

I genuinely loved it.\u000a\u000aAnd that's the same for swimmers today. Much has changed from the early part of my career but a lot is still the same, too.\u000a\u000aThey still work in a four-year Olympic cycle and, outside of that, there are national, European and World Championships as well as the Commonwealth Games.\u000a\u000aAnd the current generation still have the same goals. Much of the day-to-day stuff remains the same and is still every bit as grueling.\u000a\u000aWhen I was younger, the training I struggled with most was swimming something like 60 or 80 kilometers in a week.\u000a\u000aI had a short attention span -- I still do -- so that's why sprinting suited me. It also played to my physiological strengths.\u000a\u000aI loved doing 25 or 50-meter sprints, then having a break before going back in.\u000a\u000aI know long-distance swimmers think the sprinters are lazy because it looks like we're standing around the pool talking a lot. Sure, that did happen, but in between short, intense bursts.\u000a\u000aFoster won his final world title in the 50m freestyle at the 2004 championships.\u000a\u000aTraining on the track with a world-class hurdler\u000a\u000aMy obsession was doing anything to get quicker.\u000a\u000aI would run on the track. World and Olympic champion hurdler Colin Jackson trained me for a time and I would run 200 meters in 25 seconds, not dissimilar to what I was doing in the pool.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, there's a greater sacrifice involved in being a distance swimmer, pounding length after length of the pool -- or "counting tiles," as I used to refer to it.\u000a\u000aI'm sure all distance swimmers would like to be sprinters but, if your body isn't made that way, there's not much you can do about it.\u000a\u000aTo me, all that mattered was 32 strokes in 21 seconds -- that's what my event was about.\u000a\u000aSo, I needed to get as much power as I could any way I could. But I had to balance being as strong as possible with being as light as possible.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED The sport that's 'like rugby in the water' Replay More Videos ...

That was one of mine, perhaps the darkest time as I failed to qualify for the Games.\u000a\u000aAnd sports psychology is more prevalent now for when those dark times arrive.\u000a\u000aI was always thought I didn't need a mental coach.

aV(CNN) Republicans may be jubilant that revamped health care legislation finally passed the House on Thursday, but many of the professional associations that represent America's health care workers are clearly unhappy.\u000a\u000aThe groups said they were "disappointed," "deeply disappointed" and "extremely disappointed" with legislation that is "unacceptable," "shameful," "harmful and irresponsible." Their reactions immediately followed the 217-213 House vote\u000a\u000aThe American Medical Association said in a statement that although change is needed in the health care system, people with pre-existing health conditions "face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question."\u000a\u000aThe American Cancer Society expressed concerns that the bill will leave cancer patients unable to pay for plans, arguing that the bill would make pre-existing condition protections "virtually meaningless." The legislation may bring back high-risk pools, which "have not historically been an adequate safety-net," according to the statement from Chris Hansen, president of the society's Cancer Action Network.\u000a\u000aThe American College of Physicians disagreed with a provision that will allow insurers to opt out of covering essential benefits like mental health care, maternal care and cancer screening. The group also took issue with cuts and caps on federal contributions to Medicaid and an end to Medicaid expansion, which they say will leave tens of millions without coverage.\u000a\u000aIn a statement from Dr. Jack Ende, the group's president, it vowed to fight for a better change to the health care system instead of this "harmful legislation."\u000a\u000a"The American Health Care Act (AHCA) plays Robin Hood in reverse. It fails to deliver better, cheaper health care for all Americans, instead giving massive tax cuts to the rich while causing 24 million people to lose coverage," the National Education Association said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIt too expressed concerns about funding cuts to Medicaid, which covers millions of students nationwide.\u000a\u000aThe Main Street Alliance , a group that works with small businesses on health care issues, called the vote "a shameful display of partisan politics at its worst" in a statement from its national director, Amanda Ballantyne. It added that the legislation would raise costs for all families while giving tax breaks to "the very wealthy and the big insurance and drug companies."\u000a\u000a"Today, the sunny, flamboyant promises of better health care at a lower cost during a political campaign gave way to the cold, dark realities of politics in America," said Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of Mental Health America, in a statement. He called it a "tragic day for all those dealing with or caring for someone with serious mental health concerns."\u000a\u000aIn an emailed statement, Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said: "Today the U.S. House of Representatives voted on the worst women's health legislation in a generation. It makes it harder to prevent unintended pregnancy, harder to have a healthy pregnancy, and harder to raise a family."\u000a\u000aPhysicians for Reproductive Health's statement argued that the bill is a "targeted attack against reproductive health care" and that it takes away health care from millions of Americans, disproportionally affecting low-income women and women of color.\u000a\u000a"It is appalling that the House would push forward legislation that offers no significant improvements to the bill that was rejected just last month," said a statement from Dr. Diane Horvath-Cosper, the reproductive health advocacy fellow at the association. "I am terrified for my patients and for the health of this country."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThere was at least one association that was applauding the passage of the legislation in the house. #ProtestPP , which stands for Protest Planned Parenthood Coalition. The group organizes rallies around the country in support of defunding Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000a"With today's vote in the House, our leaders in Congress have taken a giant step toward keeping the promise they made to voters last year to defund Planned Parenthood. Now it's time for the Senate and President Trump to get the job done," said Eric Scheidler, one of the association's national directors.\u000a\u000aThe office of the Health and Human Services secretary also sent out a statement on the legislation.

aV(CNN) Emotions run high across America as voters reflect upon President Donald Trump's first 100 days. Well let's face it, emotions have been running high since at least Election Day, and rightly so, as this is the future of the country and everyone in it. But that's where the unity ends. Stop and listen to people and you'll hear some speak of pride, strength and passion. Others point to bigotry, fear and divisiveness. But not necessarily in the places you might think.\u000a\u000aWe traveled to the reddest states that stood firmly behind Trump; to the states that swung from Obama to Trump and helped him win, and to blue states that stayed Democrat.\u000a\u000aWe traveled to listen, to hear how the first days of Trump's presidency have affected people's lives, thoughts and dreams. Here's what we found: hopes, fears and surprises.\u000a\u000aTrump country beams with pride\u000a\u000aPete MacGibbon could not be more proud of President Trump.\u000a\u000a"His first 100 days in office, I think he's done better than the last three presidents that we've had," he says with complete confidence. "Golly, I don't think anybody could ask anymore of him. ... I think the man's doing great. I'm very proud of him."\u000a\u000aThe retired General Motors worker lives in one of the reddest parts of Georgia, Dawson County, 90 minutes north of Atlanta. And he thinks Trump is exactly the man to take the country to the top.\u000a\u000a"He's done really well for himself, I figure he can do the same for us," MacGibbon says. "He sure is helping the American worker. Buy American, work American, America first. I agree with that 100 percent."\u000a\u000aBesides jobs, ensuring American strength is vital to many Trump supporters. They list Iran and North Korea as key threats, and they feel like finally someone is standing up to the leaders of those countries.\u000a\u000aTrump supporter Pete MacGibbon is hopeful for a two-term presidency.\u000a\u000aGordon Pirkle Sr., a former Democrat who now considers himself an independent, voted for Trump because he felt he was the right man to tackle domestic economic problems and foreign bullies.\u000a\u000a"We gotta show them ... we can't have every little bitty country over here that wants to blow the world up having the same kind of power we got. So we better protect that," he says, adding that tough talk could actually avoid another war.\u000a\u000aTrump's tough talk, specifically on Mexico, also attracted the attention of another voter, just one you might not expect.\u000a\u000aAlberto Alejandre teaches Spanish at a public school in Des Moines, Iowa. He was raised in Mexico, came to the United States illegally and with his family got amnesty under a Ronald Reagan program. Since then his parents had been devoted Republicans, until Trump disparaged Mexicans.\u000a\u000aBeing in America is not a right, it is a great privilege. Alberto Alejandre, Iowa Trump voter\u000a\u000aBut Alejandre was not put off.\u000a\u000a"He did say some negative things about Mexico, that unfortunately as Mexicans we have to be honest with ourselves and recognize as true," he says, referring to Trump's comments about Mexican political corruption, or some criminals crossing the border.\u000a\u000aAlejandre felt Trump went too far by insinuating most undocumented Mexican immigrants were trouble, but he does back deportation of criminals.\u000a\u000a"Being in America is not a right, it is a great privilege," Alejandre says.\u000a\u000aTrump's disrespectful talk and actions about women was almost too much for Stacey Moeller, a single mother, grandmother and coal miner in Wyoming. But his promise of jobs won her vote -- and would again today.\u000a\u000a"Nothing about him appealed to my personal sense, you know. And I was offended. But it was not about me. It was about the people I work with and the people I love and I had to make a choice that was bigger than me. And do what I did."\u000a\u000aSome people are surprised to learn who taxi driver Quinton Posey voted for. Finding a Trump voter in Alabama, even Birmingham, Alabama, is not hard. But Posey is gay. And black. Only 9% of African-Americans in the South voted for Trump. But Posey says Trump's promise of change resonated.\u000a\u000aWhat do we have to lose? Why not try something different? Quinton Posey, Alabama voter\u000a\u000a"I mean, what do we have to lose? Why not try something different?" he says, saying recent policies have created a "welfare state" where everyone expects a handout. Instead, he's hoping Republican values of personal responsibility can have an impact on urban communities changing themselves.\u000a\u000aHillary Clinton was never going to win his vote, he admits, as he blames her and former President Bill Clinton for mass incarceration of black Americans.\u000a\u000aAs for Trump?

Ducro, Ashtabula County, Ohio voter\u000a\u000aBut he is banking on the President's economic prowess to help bring resources to educate a younger workforce and give smaller companies tools to expand as the area tries to turn itself into more of a tourist destination.\u000a\u000a"I like that things are happening, I like that there's discussion," Ducro says of Trump's start in office.\u000a\u000aBut how would he grade Trump? "I think it's really too early to tell," he says.\u000a\u000aTony Debevc, a third-generation farmer and now owner of Debonne Vineyards in Ohio's wine country, says he knows Trump isn't perfect. But this registered Democrat still voted for Trump.\u000a\u000a"He was the only guy there that showed signs of change," Debevc says.\u000a\u000aHe believes Trump is beginning to send the right messages, but would prefer the President would "keep his mouth shut" and ego in check.\u000a\u000aThat's one thing John Brunn can agree with. He is the lone Democrat to win office in Lake County, Michigan, an area that swung heavily for Trump.\u000a\u000aJohn Brunn, 55, says he considers Trump a hypocrite who hasn't gotten much done in office.\u000a\u000aSo far, Brunn's assessment of the presidency is simple: "It's a disaster."\u000a\u000aBut even he would be swayed if Trump could deliver jobs -- especially well-paid ones -- to Lake County, one of the poorest areas in the state.\u000a\u000aKameelah Rashad also has strong concerns, that rhetoric from the President could begin to normalize bigotry and hatred because she now sees it coming from the highest office in the land.\u000a\u000aHis presidency actually, I believe, is a catalyst Kameelah Rashad, Pennsylvania voter\u000a\u000aRashad, the president of the Muslim Wellness Foundation in Philadelphia, may not harbor hopes that Trump will change, but she does think he brings opportunity.\u000a\u000a"His presidency actually, I believe, is a catalyst for many great opportunities for conversation," Rashad says.\u000a\u000aTrump gives many chances for that, she notes, "from racism to xenophobia to domestic issues that plague us around education and incarceration."\u000a\u000a"We can take advantage of the moment if we choose."\u000a\u000a'Resistance' in deep blue America\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Hopes and fears in Trump's blue states Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hopes and fears in Trump's blue states 01:09\u000a\u000aNot much can change the minds of those who vehemently still wish Donald Trump was not President. But he is, and so they watch his every move with intense interest.\u000a\u000aThe sign outside the Rev. Corey Sanderson's church in Greenfield, Massachusetts, says "Everyone is welcome." He wishes that was Trump's view. He fears for those of other faiths who talk of being harassed on the streets; Muslim children bullied in schools, insults hurled from cars and vandalism on temples nearby.\u000a\u000aThe administration is "trying to legislate this state-sanctioned bigotry," he says, when he speaks of the travel ban.\u000a\u000aHe may be underestimating the power in the people and the sense of resistance Rev. Corey Sanderson, Massachusetts voter\u000a\u000aThe reverend worries it normalizes hate. But Sanderson tries to replace fear with solidarity and focus on the positives, like increased political involvement and action among outraged voters.\u000a\u000a"He may be underestimating the power in the people and the sense of resistance against what he's been doing," Sanderson says.\u000a\u000aThere's also big concern across heavily blue states when it comes to immigration. Especially for farmer Joe Del Bosque, the son of Mexican migrant workers, who worked as a boy in the fields picking melons and driving the tractor.\u000a\u000aSometimes, Trump's language makes him cringe. He's worried about both his bottom line and his workers.\u000a\u000aBoth could be under attack, he fears. Up to 80% of agriculture jobs in California's Central Valley are held by undocumented workers; Del Bosque and other farmers say Americans won't leave the city to take the work.\u000a\u000aBut now those immigrants are worried, and not turning up to farms. Del Bosque gets that. "When I look at these people it's almost like looking at my ancestors," Del Bosque says.\u000a\u000aWithout people to pick, though, produce cannot get to the stores. Prices will rise either if supply drops or wages have to rise to attract Americans. And that will affect shoppers.\u000a\u000aWhich is why Del Bosque proposes Trump come to his farm to see what it takes to feed America. If perhaps the billionaire could see on a personal level what it takes, maybe it would change how he thinks about policy.\u000a\u000aMelissa Bagley\u000a\u000aMelissa Bagley also wishes Trump could consider her perspective.\u000a\u000aThe 34-year-old mother of five sons and one daughter sees a different crisis unfolding 3,000 miles away from Del Bosque's farms. Her vantage point is from the streets of Baltimore.\u000a\u000aShe sees a climbing murder rate and faltering relations between police and the community. Combine that with a lack of public funding and resources for youth and you've got the components for a disaster, Bagley says.\u000a\u000aWe're going to move forward with or without the President Melissa Bagley, Maryland voter\u000a\u000a"My city is screaming for help," she says.\u000a\u000aDonald Trump may not have been her pick for president. But when Trump promised on election night to be president for everyone, including the black community, she chose to take him at his word. She chose to be optimistic.\u000a\u000aHe hasn't kept his promise to be a president for all of America, Bagley says.\u000a\u000a"I don't think he's even addressed anything in the worlds of the black American people. I don't think he's taken the time," Bagley says, vowing to help her city heal anyway. "We're going to move forward with or without the President."\u000a\u000aA few words of advice for the President\u000a\u000aMoving forward remains a key goal for the voters we found, though they differ on policy and personality. But many did join in one message to the President, albeit with different reasonings: Stop tweeting and do the work.

Overall, the remaining states passed 133 bills on the issue in the first half of 2017 compared to 70 in 2016. The number of related resolutions increased to 195 from 159 the year before.\u000a\u000aPart of that, the authors of the report say, is a response to the overall increase of immigration as a talking point in national politics, in part due to President Donald Trump's campaign. But a lot of it is the continued inability of Congress to overhaul the nation's immigration system.\u000a\u000a"Since we don't have and we haven't had an immigration policy that works -- we haven't reformed the policy at a federal level -- a lot of this falls back to the states," said Florida state Sen.

aVJen Rose Smith, CNN \u2022 Updated 27th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 When WhistlePig 's Boss Hog IV "The Black Prince" rye whiskey won "best in show" at the prestigious 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition , it dominated a field of whiskeys from around the globe.\u000a\u000aFollow that $499 bottle back home and you'll find a picturesque farm in Vermont, where country roads are lined with red barns and apple orchards. It's an idyllic and mostly rural landscape, and a far cry from the whiskey powerhouses of Scotland, Ireland, Japan and Kentucky.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, Vermont has seen a quiet craft distilling revival, and the state's bars are lined with locally made bottles. But they're not always what they seem.\u000a\u000aDown-home distillers\u000a\u000aVermont is undergoing a distilling revival.\u000a\u000aDistilling is just one part of a broader artisanal movement in the state, with seemingly every dirt road leading to a tiny brewery, bakery or creamery.\u000a\u000aAnd throughout the Green Mountains, producers are firing up stills on farms, plucking ingredients from hillsides and crafting spirits using the harvest of the northern New England growing season.\u000a\u000aIt's not the first time that fires have crackled under country stills here -- Vermonters drank heavily through the Revolutionary era -- but until recently, the art of distilling had all but dried up, left behind by Prohibition and a changing food system.\u000a\u000aTwenty years ago there were no active distilleries in Vermont. Now there are 16 and growing, producing spirits using everything from maple syrup to pressed apples, milk and locally grown grain. Often self-taught and independently owned, these distillers are remaking a lost industry.\u000a\u000aAn early member of the distilling revival was Duncan Holaday, owner of Dunc's Mill , who crafts small batches of rum in Vermont's rural Northeast Kingdom.\u000a\u000aThe anthropologist-turned-distiller builds stills by hand, and infuses the smooth Elderflower Rum with blossoms picked from his rolling property. Visitors step into his distillery-studio to find shelves packed with experiments in progress, bottles marked with a cryptic shorthand of dates and ingredients.\u000a\u000aIn the first warm days of early spring, he collects sap from the trees in the surrounding forest, boiling it into syrup used to spike the aged Maple Rum.\u000a\u000aTours of Dunc's Mill are sometimes available upon request (622 Keyser Hill Rd., St. Johnsbury, Vermont, 802-745-9486, www.duncsmill.com ).\u000a\u000aHeading into the countryside\u000a\u000aCaledonia Spirits is the brainchild of a beekeeper.\u000a\u000aEven deeper into the countryside is Caledonia Spirits , a distillery that grew from a beekeeper's efforts to make spirits using his raw, organic honey.\u000a\u000aThe Caledonia Spirits Barr Hill Gin is infused with honey sweetness offset by a backbone of juniper.\u000a\u000aHead distiller Ryan Christensen was the first of this generation of distillers to experiment with aging spirits in Vermont wood -- a practice so outdated he had to find a stand of trees to harvest, send the timber to be specially milled then contract an upstate New York cooperage to make bespoke barrels.\u000a\u000aLaid to mellow in the Hardwick, Vermont distillery, the barrels now hold the aged version of Barr Hill Gin, called Tom Cat Gin, as well as whiskey made from the founder's own rye fields.\u000a\u000aVisit Caledonia Spirits at their Hardwick, Vermont distillery for tours and tastings (Log Yard Drive, Hardwick, Vermont, 802-472-8000, www.caledoniaspirits.com , open daily 12pm-5pm).\u000a\u000aTempest in a tumbler\u000a\u000aWhen WhistlePig founder Raj Bhakta, a former contestant on "The Apprentice," started the company on a sprawling farm in 2007, the view from the road was postcard Vermont. And these days, the farm is home to a heritage herd of Mangalitsa and Kunekune pigs, who graze alongside waving lines of rye and oats.\u000a\u000aBut there's an important difference between WhistlePig and its distillery neighbors -- this isn't where the winning whiskey was made from bushels of grain.\u000a\u000aWhile the company has now begun distilling some spirits onsite, WhistlePig came to the world stage with "sourced" whiskey, spirits made in places like Canada and Indiana, then finished and bottled on the Shoreham farm.\u000a\u000aIt's a common practice in the whiskey world, and one that inspires periodic screeds from purists, who point out a lack of transparency in labeling and marketing. And for some Vermonters, WhistlePig seemed to be trading on the state's reputation for artisans and agriculture without making anything from scratch.\u000a\u000aSpirits Symbiosis\u000a\u000aIn many ways, Vermont's small distillers couldn't be more different from operations like WhistlePig, with vast gaps in financing, culture and process.\u000a\u000aBut Reid Mitenbuler, the author of Bourbon Empire, suggests that the varied ways of making spirits aren't necessarily at odds.\u000a\u000a"I think there can be a symbiosis," he said, "for consumers, the best thing would be creating an environment where both can thrive."\u000a\u000a"Two hundred years ago, it was all just farmers distilling their surplus grains," said Mitenbuler, who argues that the final product of those early distillers may have been downright undrinkable.\u000a\u000aFollowing the Prohibition years, the needle swung the other way entirely.\u000a\u000a"By 2000, you had about a dozen big distilleries producing 99% of American spirits," Mitenbuler noted, adding that consolidation meant that there was less variety available, and less of a push to innovate.\u000a\u000aThe resurgence of craft distilling restored some balance, a transformation led by places like Dunc's Mill and Caledonia Spirits.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, sourcing and aging great whiskeys requires a nuanced palate and creative vision.\u000a\u000aDave Pickerell, the lead distiller at WhistlePig, has a resume that includes a long stint at Maker's Mark, and he's revered by many in the spirits world.\u000a\u000aAnd these days, WhistlePig is selling the product of their own farm. WhistlePig FarmStock Rye Whiskey blends the first crop of their Shoreham grown- and distilled-rye whiskey with sourced, aged vintages.\u000a\u000aIt's a step in the direction of the farm-focused movement that's driven Vermont's distilling revival. But it hasn't garnered the same attention as WhistlePig's older bottles of sourced whiskey, which are at the heart of the company's rise.\u000a\u000aWhich raises a spirited question. Is there room in the Green Mountains artisan-loving culture for sourced whiskeys to coexist with farm-based craft distillers? What if the whiskey is really good? Like, really good.\u000a\u000aThe proof is in the pour\u000a\u000aWhistle pig succeeded at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.\u000a\u000aBack at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, the judges didn't visit the picturesque WhistlePig farm and didn't weigh in on the sourcing controversy. In the subjective world of flavor the competition strives for objectivity, with a panel of expert drinkers undergoing a marathon of blind tasting.\u000a\u000aWearing snowy white smocks, they sat before a line of tiny glasses, each labeled with a randomly-assigned letter.\u000a\u000aWhistlePig's rye was one of dozens of whiskeys the judges tasted that day. But even in a crowded field, said judge and whiskey writer Fred Minnick, the WhistlePig rye was a standout.\u000a\u000a"It was complex," he recalled, "and it had nuance and fun flavors to it -- it just really stood out in the whiskey category."\u000a\u000aA Kentucky-based bourbon expert and veteran whiskey drinker, he's not the only one to fall for WhistlePig's silky smooth rye whiskeys. The bottles are aged for up to 15 years, far longer than the average rye.\u000a\u000aThe whiskeys themselves vary widely, from an "Old World" version finished in port, Sauternes and madeira casks to a spicy, 10-year rye that's redolent of oak and caramel.\u000a\u000aThat time in the barrel lends WhistlePig rye complex flavor and aroma. It's the kind of spirit that inspires long-winded odes, or at least a satisfied silence from appreciative drinkers.\u000a\u000aAnd as Minnick remembered tasting WhistlePig's competition-winning whiskey, he kept it succinct.

Or is that just too far afield, do you think? [JOHNSON] \u201cNo, no, I'm highly concerned about that, but not only in Europe. Look at the attack on the Metcalf power station in California. We have not solved that. That is a very disconcerting chain of events here. So, trust me, our critical infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber-attack, to potential terrorist attack. And we're not taking this threat seriously enough. It's highly concerning.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohnson on the threat of another ISIS attack in Europe: \u201cWell, we're being told there are no specific, credible threats. And I have to believe the officials. And it would make sense that there are probably more plots being hatched in Europe as we speak. Europe obviously is in greater danger. They're in closer proximity to the Middle East. We're seeing this surge of refugees. We now know that a couple of those terrorists came into Europe with that refugee flow. So what we're unraveling or what the officials in Europe are unraveling are these cells and these plots. And, unfortunately, this is exactly what Islamic terrorists are trying to sow, what you're seeing in Brussels today, the type of civil unrest. They're trying to destabilize different countries. And they're doing a pretty good job of it.\u000a\u000aJohnson on his strategy to defeat ISIS: \u201cWe need to just have a more robust effort. We need to assemble that coalition of the willing. And the reason we haven't assembled them is because we have not shown the leadership. President Obama took off the table that - the same day that he declared the goal, he basically took off the table the very ingredient that was going to be necessary. And that's American troops on the ground. Now, I don't think we have to have that many of them. We haven't heard out of this administration a real strategy for defeating ISIS. But we actually have to show the leadership, so that the coalition of the willing will actually assemble around us. And let's face it. I think Europe is probably a little bit more primed to really join that coalition. This has got to be a long-term effort. The historic blunder of President Obama was leaving Iraq. After all the sacrifice, after the stabilization of the Iraq, we bugged out. And as a result, that coalition disintegrated, and ISIS was able to rise from the ashes of what was a defeated al Qaeda in Iraq. We have to learn the lessons of histories. We have to be relentless in our pursuit of stamping out Islamic terror.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohnson on using torture as an interrogation technique: [TAPPER] \u201c\u2026Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, said this week he would have talked a lot faster with the torture. Do you agree?\u201d [JOHNSON] \u201cWhat we really need to do - and I have been down to Guantanamo Bay and I have talked to the people that do the interviews. And the way you actually gather intelligence that's effective is over a long period of time. And what this administration has done, in their quest to close down Guantanamo Bay, we stopped capturing, detaining and questioning Islamic terrorists. Now, we're doing some of that. We're starting to capture some of the Islamic terrorists, some of the ISIS operatives. Fortunately, we captured one that was a former Iraqi chemical weapons expert. And that individual apparently started to sing like a canary. So, we were able to take out some of those installations. But we need a long-term facility for long-term detention. And that's really how you gather intelligence, is capturing people, detaining them, and interviewing them over a long period of time, finding discrepancies between themselves - between their own testimony and that of their fellow operatives.\u201d\u000a\u000aFULL POST

aVMichael D'Antonio is the author of the new book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Having long ago committed himself to the proposition that there is no such thing as too much press, Donald Trump may be the most photographed, filmed and quoted man of our time.\u000a\u000aAdd his own words, offered in books, speeches, Facebook posts and Tweets, and you might conclude that there's little left for this man to share.\u000a\u000aBut think again. What if all those words were intended, not to reveal, but conceal? What if Trump talks so much because he wants to control the conversation?\u000a\u000aNow that Trump is the GOP's presumptive nominee for president, he'll face more intense scrutiny about his many claims to personal success, his political beliefs, his temperament and his character. In each case, the public record is filled with incidents and examples, but a skeptic finds little clarity.\u000a\u000aThis state of affairs may suffice for anyone buying a steak or an apartment from Trump the salesman, but voters contemplating Trump the candidate for president deserve better answers to the lingering questions.\u000a\u000aHere they are:\u000a\u000aWhat is Trump's temperament?\u000a\u000aTV audiences have been treated to more than 100 episodes of Trump's reality TV shows "The Apprentice" and "Celebrity Apprentice." The Trump depicted on air is the product of so much editing and consulting by producers and directors that it is no better than a cartoon. More useful is the cumulative Trump record, which includes as many negatives as positives.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aTo Trump's credit, he has shown himself to be resilient, coming back from failures that would have sent less confident men and women into business exile. Most notable, of course, is the crisis he experienced in the early 1990s when he was unable to pay personal and corporate debts in the neighborhood of $3.4 billion\u000a\u000aTrump is also a nimble entrepreneur, who looks for opportunities and seizes them decisively. Witness his ability to deal in real estate, entertainment and retail merchandising, all at the same time.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the ledger, open questions remain about his consistent record of cruelty and excess when dealing with critics and competitors. Trump's code begins with the belief that he's justified in "hitting back ten times harder" whenever he's offended. If our presidents believed in this approach, America would have engaged in shooting wars with untold numbers of countries that have, in recent decades, committed transgressions against the United States.\u000a\u000aWould Trump have hit back 10 times harder when North Korea detained the spy ship Pueblo? What about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over the territory of our ally Ukraine. U.S. intelligence indicates a Russia missile likely was responsible. Would Trump have responded by downing 10 Aeroflot planes?\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Keeping Them Honest: Trump on Afghanistan & gun control Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Keeping Them Honest: Trump on Afghanistan & gun control 03:48\u000a\u000aWe can ask additional questions about Trump's penchant for bullying. In some cases this trait has shown itself in mere words, as he has attempted to humiliate, disparage and marginalize others. In other instances he has sought to force innocent landowners off their properties to make way for his developments. This willingness to use any means necessary to get what he wants raises serious concern about Trump's ability to manage America's affairs in a complex world.\u000a\u000aWhat does Trump believe?\u000a\u000aMore than any political figure in modern times, Trump represents an ideological puzzle. Although he now claims the conservative Republican mantle, he has often associated himself with liberal and Democratic Party ideas. In 1999 he told CNN, "I've actually been an activist Democrat and Republican."\u000a\u000aIn the past, Trump said he is "totally pro-choice." Now he is against abortion rights, recently musing about punishing women who might violate a ban on the procedure.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary 02:02\u000a\u000aIn the past, Trump was in favor of levying a big tax on the rich , himself included, to pay down the federal deficit. Like banks, rich people have the money, and Trump reasoned that they could afford to help the country out. Today, Trump is in favor of big tax cuts for the wealthy.\u000a\u000aIn 2000 Trump proposed banning private ownership of assault weapons and increasing the waiting period for the purchase of guns. In the current campaign he has declared himself to be an ardent defender of gun rights, and he has even proposed eliminating gun-free zones near schools.\u000a\u000aThe list of Trump flip-flops is long and includes his positions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his regard for Hillary Clinton's performance as secretary of state. Voters, especially those conservatives who want a clear sense of what their standard-bearer will do as president, deserve explanations for these shifts.\u000a\u000aHow rich is he?\u000a\u000aThroughout his life Trump has cited his wealth as evidence of his excellence but without offering verifiable proof of his claims. In the 1970s he cruised Manhattan in a chauffeured limousine and gave others the impression that he was in control of the $200 million fortune amassed by his father.\u000a\u000aIn the 1980s, when he first made it onto the Forbes magazine list of America's wealthiest men and women, Trump complained often and loudly about how his holdings were underestimated. More recently he said he is worth some $10 billion.\u000a\u000aThe record produced by those who have looked closely at Trump's finances raises many questions. Writer Wayne Barrett reported in the 1980s that Trump's income as of 1978 was less than $100,000. In the 1993 biography of Trump called "Lost Tycoon," Harry Hurt III noted that during his divorce from his first wife, Ivana, her attorneys found that Trump had never been worth the billions of dollars he claimed. Hurt also reported that in March 1992, Trump's own lawyers said he could not afford to pay Ivana even half of the $20 million he had offered as a settlement.\u000a\u000aMore recently doubts about his wealth arose in 2005 when journalist Tim O'Brien wrote that Trump was probably worth between $150 million and $250 million. For a man who reveled in his image as a billionaire, O'Brien's estimate was too much to bear. Trump sued. The case was dismissed by the trial judge. Trump appealed. He lost\u000a\u000aWere Trump a more circumspect and well-mannered man, who never bragged about how rich he is, his wealth would be less of an issue. However Trump has made his fortune such an important part of his identity that voters deserve to know the truth. Many of the facts are contained in Trump's personal income tax filings, and it is now a campaign tradition for candidates to make these documents public. Clinton has made public all of her returns going back to 2000.\u000a\u000aSo far, Trump has refused to release his returns because, he says, he is undergoing an audit on returns filed in the last few years. Nothing in the law, or in federal regulations, would prohibit him from making the documents public now, but if he is uncomfortable with releasing those forms, he could simply match Clinton for those years that are settled.\u000a\u000aSuch a release would reassure the public that Trump is who he says he is -- a really rich man -- and allow a glimpse into other matters, including his charitable giving. It is a matter of conservative orthodoxy that the rich should be spared excessive taxation so they can support society freely with their philanthropy.\u000a\u000aIs he a man of character?\u000a\u000aPersonality, which can be seen in a smile, heard in a glib remark or felt when viewing a performance, is not the most important measure of a man or woman. Many people with winning personalities are, in fact, hucksters, con men, manipulators and deceivers. In fact, the false signals flashed by well-practiced performers, including politicians, compel us to look for the signs of the character beneath the personality.\u000a\u000aExperts in assessing character generally look for some traits such as autonomy and life purpose that Trump clearly possesses in abundance. But there are other areas of character , including positive relations with others, ethical behavior, empathy, honesty and humility where Trump would not achieve a very high score.\u000a\u000aIn his long and very public life, Trump has often shown he is willing to do things others consider wrong in order to get what he wants. This includes using a false identity to make claims about his success, carrying out a bitter divorce dispute in the tabloid press, criticizing the appearance of others and refusing to take the high road when offered the chance.\u000a\u000aThe most troubling aspect of Trump's character can be seen in his devotion to the so-called birther campaign that sought to delegitimize President Barack Obama. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, birthers led by Trump insisted that some mystery surrounded Obama's status as a citizen born in the United States.\u000a\u000aLong after documents were produced to settle this falsely posed question, Trump continued to raise doubts and thus signal his allegiance to those who considered the President to be an unworthy "other." The racism latent in the birther movement was documented in a study by University of Delaware psychologist Eric Heyman, but the link to prejudice was always plain to see. Rather than stand against birtherism, Trump built a following by exploiting it.\u000a\u000aIn fact, one can find precedent for Trump's birtherism in his previous provocative statements about racially sensitive subjects. Other evidence of his character can be found in his selective use of facts, his tendency to inflame conflict rather than cool it and his devotion to self-promotion.\u000a\u000aIn the past Trump's character has been well-suited to his pursuit of success as he defines it. But as revealed thus far, it would disqualify him when it comes to the presidency. We can only hope Trump has something better to show and will do it when placed under the pressure of the coming campaign.

aVBritain is running out of workers.\u000a\u000aEmployers have plenty of jobs to fill but potential hires are in short supply, according to a new report by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC).\u000a\u000aThe number of open permanent jobs grew at the fastest rate in 27 months in July. Meanwhile, the availability of both permanent and temporary workers fell sharply.\u000a\u000aIt's a trend that could accelerate ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union.\u000a\u000a"The parts of the economy most reliant on European workers are under even more pressure as many EU workers return home," said REC chief executive Kevin Green. "Employers are not just struggling to hire the brightest and the best but also people to fill roles such as chefs, drivers and warehouse workers."\u000a\u000aBritish businesses have been pressing the government for reassurances about their ability to hire EU citizens after March 2019. They play a vital role across the economy, from tech firms to banks, the health service, farms and the hospitality industry.\u000a\u000aRelated: Bank of England slashes its growth forecast (again)\u000a\u000aGreen said that London was being hit particularly hard. Hiring is still on the upswing in the capital city, but growth is slower than in any other region.\u000a\u000a"We can't ignore the importance of our relationship with the EU to employers," said Green. "If we want to keep our jobs market successful and vibrant, we must make it easier, not harder, for employers to access the people they need."\u000a\u000aEU citizens living in the U.K. are stuck in a legal limbo, because the British government and the EU have not yet reached an agreement on their post-Brexit rights.\u000a\u000aMany are not waiting for negotiations to conclude. The number of EU citizens leaving the U.K. jumped 36% in 2016, according to official government data.\u000a\u000aRelated: Brexit jobs tracker\u000a\u000aStill, the labor market dynamics could be good news for some workers.\u000a\u000aREC said the staff shortage was forcing some employers to offer higher starting salaries and wages.

aV(CNN) Millions of Americans are uncertain about their future as a new health care bill heads to the Senate.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would shake things up. It could open the door for insurers to charge sick people and pregnant women much higher premiums.\u000a\u000aUnder Obamacare, all insurers are required to charge everyone the same premium, despite their medical history. This new version of the bill would weaken protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\u000a\u000aWhat is a pre-existing condition?\u000a\u000aIt's a "health problem you had before the date that new health coverage starts," the US Department of Health and Human Services says.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 52 million of adults under 65 years have pre-existing health issues, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found.\u000a\u000aBut the term itself is vague and every insurance company has their own lists of "declinable" or "uninsurable" conditions.\u000a\u000aSome companies even considered domestic violence and rape a pre-existing condition before the Obamacare era.\u000a\u000aDo I have a pre-existing condition?\u000a\u000aMaybe. By law, there are not set parameters, and some insurers consider these as pre-existing conditions:\u000a\u000aAcne\u000a\u000aAnxiety\u000a\u000aAsthma\u000a\u000aBipolar disease\u000a\u000aDepression\u000a\u000aMenstrual irregularities\u000a\u000aSex reassignment\u000a\u000aSleep apnea\u000a\u000aTranssexualism\u000a\u000aThe list of pre-existing conditions could be endless. Three of the largest insurers in the US -- United Healthcare, Cigna and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield -- considered a person generally "uninsurable" and could decline coverage without reviewing any medical records if an applicant had a certain health issue. Insurance companies have listed the health issues but most reserved the right to add more conditions.\u000a\u000aHere are the health issues they called pre-existing conditions prior to Obamacare.

After nearly a decade of research showing that it makes mice live up to 60% longer, scientists are trying it out as an anti-aging drug in dogs and humans.\u000a\u000aRapamycin was discovered nearly 50 years ago in soil collected from Easter Island in the South Pacific and studied in a Canadian lab, and it's the most promising drug to fight aging that Arlan Richardson has ever seen.\u000a\u000aA professor at the Reynolds Oklahoma Center on Aging, Richardson has been doing this kind of research for 40 years.\u000a\u000a"It's the best bet we have," he said.\u000a\u000aNow, scientists are moving forward and testing the drug in dogs.\u000a\u000aResearchers at the University of Washington's Dog Aging Project gave rapamycin to 16 dogs and imaged their hearts.\u000a\u000a"It started to function better. It started to look like a more youthful heart," said Matt Kaeberlein, co-director of the Dog Aging Project, who has presented this research at conferences but hasn't yet published it.\u000a\u000aThose dogs took rapamycin for only 10 weeks. Here's what happened to Momo and his "brother," Sherman, who took it for much longer.\u000a\u000aSherman the Pomeranian\u000a\u000aSherman and Momo's story\u000a\u000aFor many years, Momo and Sherman were regular visitors to the Laguna Pet Spa in Laguna Hills, California, getting baths and haircuts.\u000a\u000aThen, on Christmas Eve 2010, their owner dropped them off and never came back.\u000a\u000aAnderson, who runs the spa, said she called the owner, but her phone had been disconnected.\u000a\u000aAnderson was horrified but not shocked. This was during Southern California's housing loan crisis, and this owner wasn't the first to abandon a dog to her care.\u000a\u000aBut this was more than a foreclosure. Sherman was sick, very sick.\u000a\u000aOn Christmas Day, the tiny 8-year-old Pomeranian was vomiting and howling in pain. Anderson rushed him to the emergency room. It was an attack of acute pancreatitis.\u000a\u000aAnderson nursed him back to health and became, in her words, "mom" to Sherman and Momo.\u000a\u000aThe dogs had another mom, too: Anderson's partner, Sarah Godfrey, who was then living in Northern California but moved a few years later to Laguna Hills to live with Anderson and "the boys."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Can dogs smell cancer? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Can dogs smell cancer? 02:21\u000a\u000aAll was well until one day in May 2015, when Sherman fell over. He'd had a stroke.\u000a\u000a"They gave him two weeks to live, unless he had surgery," Anderson remembers. Even with an operation, he had only a 20% chance of surviving.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Godfrey were wary of surgery for a fragile dog who was already 13 years old; that's equivalent to 68 years old for a human being, according to the American Kennel Club\u000a\u000aOver the years, the couple had sought help from an herbalist for people problems, and now they desperately turned to him for help with their pooch problem. The herbalist did some research and came up with a possible treatment: rapamycin.\u000a\u000aExcited but also skeptical, Anderson and Godfrey went online and ran across Kaeberlein and the Aging Dog Project, which was recruiting canine subjects for the rapamycin research.\u000a\u000aThey begged Kaeberlein to enroll Sherman, but the answer was no. Dogs had to be healthy and over 40 pounds. Sherman was neither.\u000a\u000aThe couple calculated their next step.\u000a\u000a"We knew we could go to Mexico and get rapamycin or order it online, but we wanted to be guided by a veterinarian, by a professional," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aThat proved to tougher than they thought.\u000a\u000aFive vets refused to prescribe the drug. Finally, a sixth vet agreed to prescribe rapamycin, but only after consulting with Kaeberlein to determine the best dose for Sherman.\u000a\u000aBy this point, a month after his stroke, Sherman was so weak, he had to be fed by hand and carried everywhere.\u000a\u000aBut rapamycin changed all that, Anderson and Godfrey said.\u000a\u000a"The third day after taking rapamycin, he could eat on his own. By the seventh day, he was walking on his own," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aSixteen months later, the dog who had been given two months to live is still alive, and while clearly old, he's still active and able to run around the yard.\u000a\u000aThat got the moms thinking about Momo. He wasn't sick like Sherman, but at 13, he was getting old and achy and losing stamina. The couple decided to try rapamycin on him, too.\u000a\u000a"Why not have your dog live longer if you can?" Godfrey said.\u000a\u000aShe said that within days of taking the drug, Momo was able to run for hours, whereas before, just a 30-minute walk would tire him out. On a hot summer day when CNN visited, he was able to keep up with Anderson's parents' dogs, who are 4 and 5 years old.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Godfrey couldn't be happier.\u000a\u000a"We call Sherman and Momo our rapamycin babies," Godfrey said.\u000a\u000aArlan Richardson with his Tibetan terrier, MoMo.\u000a\u000aBut there's a catch\u000a\u000aTake a look at the labels for Rapamune , made by Pfizer, and Afinitor (PDF), made by Novartis, two drugs that are essentially the same as rapamycin and are used to treat cancer patients and organ transplant recipients. The list of things that can go wrong is long and horrifying: cancer, diabetes, infections and more.\u000a\u000a"You have to be concerned about these side effects," Kaeberlein said. But that hasn't stopped him from doing research on the drug.\u000a\u000aFirst, Kaeberlein thinks the side effects seen in cancer patients and transplant recipients might not be because of rapamycin per se but because those patients were very sick to begin with, because they were taking a whole host of other drugs as well, or both.\u000a\u000aSecondly, he uses a much lower dose of the drug on his healthy dogs compared with the dose used on sick people.\u000a\u000aRichardson, the aging expert at the University of Oklahoma, agrees with Kaeberlein. He's so convinced that he gave a low dose of rapamycin to his own dog, coincidentally named MoMo.\u000a\u000aMoMo had a heart problem, and Richardson said it stabilized after he started taking rapamycin. He said the Tibetan terrier looks and acts younger than his 14 years, which would be around 80 or 90 in human years.\u000a\u000aPlus, he said, there have been no side effects.\u000a\u000a"We've been doing blood chemistries on her the whole time, and there's nothing bad," Richardson said.\u000a\u000aThe researcher was quick to note that one dog's experience did not constitute proven scientific data -- but he added that he's given rapamycin to tiny monkeys called marmosets and hasn't see any negative side effects for them, either.\u000a\u000aBut what about humans?\u000a\u000aRapamycin has had very limited testing in healthy humans. Novartis gave rapamycin to 218 elderly volunteers , and it enhanced their response to the flu vaccine by 20%.\u000a\u000aThe results "raise the possibility that (rapamycin) may have beneficial effects" on the decline in immune function that occurs naturally as we get older, the study authors wrote.\u000a\u000aThey reported that the side effects of rapamycin were "relatively well-tolerated." Severe side effects, they wrote, occurred at a "similar" rate as those experienced by the patients in the study who took a placebo, or a sugar pill.\u000a\u000aOf the 53 patients on the lowest dose of rapamycin, 22 suffered some side effect, most commonly mouth sores.\u000a\u000aDr. Monica Mita, who's done her own research with drugs like rapamycin, said she thinks the side effects can be managed.\u000a\u000a"It's really a matter of using the right dose and keeping an eye on the patients," said Mita, co-director of experimental therapeutics at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.\u000a\u000aThe future of rapamycin\u000a\u000aKaeberlein, the professor of pathology at the University of Washington, is nervous about this article.\u000a\u000aHe wants readers to know that Momo and Sherman's story is a tale of two dogs -- that's it -- and not scientific evidence in any way, shape or form, especially considering the placebo effect, meaning Momo and Sherman's owners might subconsciously be seeing what they want to see because they believe so much in rapamycin and fought so hard for it.\u000a\u000aHe doesn't want Momo and Sherman's seeming success to "encourage dog owners to go off to their veterinarians and demand rapamycin."\u000a\u000aAnd Kaeberlein, who's also president of the American Aging Association, is nervous for another reason, too.\u000a\u000aHe dislikes the term "anti-aging," as it conjures up images of snake oil salesmen peddling the fountain of youth.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aInstead, he prefers to think in terms of treatments that will delay the onset of diseases of aging, such as dementia or heart disease. In mice, rapamycin has been shown to slow these two types of declines, as well as several others.\u000a\u000aOver the next year, Kaeberlein will be studying rapamycin in a much larger group of dogs: about 150, compared with the 16 he studied earlier.\u000a\u000aHe said other groups are looking at doing more aging studies in rapamycin in humans, too.\u000a\u000aIt's been a long journey for the compound discovered more than half a century ago in the dirt of a South Pacific island.

Throughout that time, design has always been at the forefront of the nation's identity.\u000a\u000aIn 1917, when the country declared its independence from Russia, there was a strong desire to explore and articulate what it was to be Finnish.\u000a\u000aArchitects and designers became nation-builders, tasked with giving shape to the new homes and civic spaces that the country needed, as the economy grew and the once agrarian society began to industrialize. Their ambitious agenda was social, optimistic and forward-looking, and democratic design emerged as a significant characteristic of the fledgling country.\u000a\u000aLeading designers\u000a\u000aMaison Louis Carré by Alvar Aalto in Bazoches-sur-Guyonnes, France.\u000a\u000aMany people found great opportunity and creative stimulus in Finland's transition into an independent modern nation, perhaps none more than the internationally renowned architect Alvar Aalto. Over the course of his long career, he championed a revolutionary style of design that combined functionality with natural materials and organic forms.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Doctors are increasingly being held accountable -- some even facing murder charges -- when their patients overdose on opioid painkillers they prescribed .\u000a\u000aWeeks prior, a doctor in Oklahoma was charged with five counts of second-degree murder for prescribing "horrifyingly excessive amounts" of potent drugs, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said in a statement\u000a\u000aIn 2015, Dr. Hsiu-Ying "Lisa" Tseng became the first doctor to be convicted of murder for overprescribing painkillers. She was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison by a Los Angeles judge.\u000a\u000aThe number of doctors penalized by the US Drug Enforcement Administration has grown more than fivefold in recent years. The agency took action against 88 doctors in 2011 and 479 in 2016, according to an analysis of the National Practitioner Data Bank by Tony Yang , an associate professor of health administration and policy at George Mason University. Many other doctors have been sued in civil suits.\u000a\u000aWhile high-profile cases against doctors have brought yet another spotlight to the nation's ongoing opioid epidemic, experts say this is rare and overlooks the bigger picture.\u000a\u000a"The well-meaning doctors and dentists are the bigger part of our problem," said Dr. Andrew Kolodny , executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, an advocacy and education group . "They're inadvertently getting patients addicted, and they're also stocking homes with a highly addictive drugs."\u000a\u000aOnce a wonder drug\u000a\u000a"In the late '80s, early '90s, we were all told that we were too cautious and we were not appropriately treating patients' pain," said Sur, a professor of family medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, pharmaceutical companies aggressively marketed opioids to doctors, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote in an open letter last year. Doctors were taught that these medications were not addictive if patients were in "legitimate pain," he said. Multiple studies have shown this to be false.\u000a\u000a"That was a quote I heard regularly," said Sur, who has testified in cases in which doctors are accused of recklessly prescribing opioids.\u000a\u000aMore and more, Sur sees other doctors referring risky patients to pain specialists who might be better equipped to offer alternative treatments, screen for addiction and, when necessary, prescribe opioids safely.\u000a\u000aThe fear, she said, "is not just strictly about being sued; it's about harming somebody."\u000a\u000aThese doctors might be looking for pain specialists like Dr. Kimberly Curseen, a palliative care doctor at Emory Healthcare who works largely with cancer patients. But even she is acutely aware of the legal precedent being set against doctors.\u000a\u000a"Personally, it's very frightening ... when you're working with medications that are receiving this type of scrutiny," Curseen said.\u000a\u000aBut she said it's a risk that many doctors accept to help patients in need.\u000a\u000a"This is the profession that we chose," she said.\u000a\u000aScope of the problem\u000a\u000aIn 2010, doctors wrote enough prescriptions for hydrocodone to give every American adult a one-month supply, according to a report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u000a\u000aIn general, prescription opioid abusers tend to get pills from family and friends for free. Those at the greatest risk of overdosing, however, are more likely to get the drugs through their own doctor's prescription, according to the CDC.\u000a\u000aAnother study last year found that 91% of overdose survivors were still able to get another prescription for opioids.\u000a\u000aSome doctors may be more willing to write an opioid script than others. One study found that some emergency physicians were three times more likely to do so than other doctors at the same hospital. And their patients were more likely to be long-term users, too.\u000a\u000aBut some researchers have pushed back against the idea that a small number of doctors are responsible for the opioid epidemic.\u000a\u000aBut looking more broadly, a greater number of opioid prescriptions were written by general practitioners, such as family doctors, who see far more patients overall.\u000a\u000aNot all patients have access to pain specialists and comprehensive care in the first place, said Dr. Keith Humphreys , one of the authors of that paper and a professor of psychiatry at Stanford School of Medicine.\u000a\u000a"There's just not that many pain medicine specialists. They can't drive national prescribing patterns," said Humphreys, also a former White House drug policy adviser under Presidents Bush and Obama.\u000a\u000aHumphreys described criminal cases against doctors as "rare." Many doctors see these cases as outliers, which may also involve allegations of fraud, poor record-keeping and other misconduct.\u000a\u000aBut a number of doctors claim to have been falsely accused, and some of their investigations have ended in acquittals, dismissals or no charges at all.\u000a\u000aCNN reported on the DEA investigation of Dr. Lynn Webster -- a pain specialist who was considered an expert in safely prescribing opioids -- after a string of patient deaths. In 2010, a handful of DEA agents raided his clinic, occupying "every corner of every room," he told CNN.\u000a\u000aThe investigation lasted several years, but no charges were ever brought against him.\u000a\u000a"It's kind of like a scarlet letter that I will always carry with me," Webster said. "An investigation can be life-altering, but it can be career-ending."\u000a\u000aThe DEA has been putting more resources into investigating doctors and addressing the opioid crisis in general, according to Melvin Patterson, a DEA spokesman and agent of more than 20 years. For example, in 2015 the agency started rolling out its "360 Strategy," a program that educates doctors as part of a larger effort to fight illicit drug use in various pilot cities.\u000a\u000aPatterson, who has investigated opioid cases involving doctors, said the DEA has made the drug epidemic a priority in recent years. He said it is much easier to push these investigations forward than before.\u000a\u000a"There was a reluctance to really prosecute doctors" early in his career, he said. "That's being prosecuted all over the country right now. That's how far we've come."\u000a\u000aBut Patterson said that doctors shouldn't fear prescribing opioids if they're checking all the boxes. These investigations, widespread as they might be, represent a "small percentage" of doctors, he said.\u000a\u000a"When a doctor is acting responsibly ... opioids are one of the best things they could have to treat pain," he said. "But when it's irresponsible -- in other words, a doctor hasn't even examined the patients, and they're prescribing them -- that's what's killing people."\u000a\u000aWebster believes that "this is simply an approach to try to address the opioid crisis through legal channels" and continues to research pain therapies. He is vice president of scientific affairs at PRA Health Sciences , a company that conducts clinical research on a variety of therapeutic drugs, including opioids and opioid alternatives to pain\u000a\u000aWebster, who has spoken in defense of other doctors in criminal cases, said that colleagues were "stunned" that this could happen to him.\u000a\u000a"He's respected in our field," said Dr. Steven Stanos, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine , of which Webster was past president.\u000a\u000aBeyond legal concerns, Stanos said, doctors are acutely aware of a rising opioid death toll and powerful synthetic drugs hitting the streets, like fentanyl. Stanos said doctors are becoming "more worried" about prescribing opioids -- but that worry, he said, is not necessarily a bad thing.\u000a\u000a"They should be careful, and opioids aren't for every patient," Stanos said. "Opioids are just a small part of (pain) management."\u000a\u000aCutting down\u000a\u000aDoctors have been coming up with ways to avoid being put under the microscope themselves: by documenting their appointments meticulously, by following guidelines and by checking statewide prescription drug databases before taking out their pens.\u000a\u000aMany doctors even have formal "agreements" with their patients, Stanos said. This may involve taking occasional urine samples to check for other drugs.\u000a\u000aBut experts like Stanos have had to solve another looming question: What about all the patients who were put on high-dose opioids in the past?\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of cases involving doctors, some patients might be drug-dependent and have nowhere to go. Many face severe withdrawal symptoms and a heightened sensitivity to pain, a condition called hyperalgesia, Kolodny said. If those patients get their hands on opioids later on, they are more likely to overdose, having lost their tolerance.\u000a\u000aStanos, who is also the medical director of Swedish Pain Services in Seattle, has absorbed patients when nearby clinics have closed.\u000a\u000a"We took over a number of patients that were in clinics where ... I don't agree with what was done with them," Stanos said. "Those patients are at high risk."\u000a\u000aStanos said doctors who receive cases like these can learn a lot from the Veterans Health Administration, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Early on, the health care system heavily pushed opioid painkillers as part of its pain management approach. But over much of the past decade, the VA revamped its approach to pain , offering a wider variety of pain services and addiction treatment programs.\u000a\u000aThe impact of these measures -- including the 2013 rollout of the VA's Opioid Safety Initiative -- was a major cut in the number of opioids it prescribed.\u000a\u000a"You could call it a U-turn," Kolodny said.\u000a\u000a"The (VA) had one of the earliest and worst guidelines on opioid prescribing that I've ever seen," he added. "And in 2017, they put out the most conservative guideline that's ever been made to date -- which is, I think, a very good guideline."\u000a\u000aBut many veterans on high-dose painkillers suddenly had to cut down medications that their bodies were dependent on.\u000a\u000a"If you are getting a patient who's been put on chronic opioids, even though they never should've been started on it, that doesn't mean you should force them to come off rapidly," Kolodny said.\u000a\u000aLast week, a VA-funded study found that tapering down painkillers improves quality of life for chronic pain patients. Experts say that research and guidelines on opioid use for chronic pain is otherwise lacking and that the evidence is much clearer for short-term uses -- for example, after a major surgery.\u000a\u000aStanos said that the VA's interdisciplinary approach to pain has changed the field but that many unaffiliated doctors aren't able to offer the same array of alternative treatments and programs.\u000a\u000aThe VA "had to deal with this even sooner than the commercial payors, Medicare and Medicaid." Stanos said. "Now, they have some of the strongest treatment centers."\u000a\u000aFollowing suit\u000a\u000aIt's not just doctors who have been facing legal action for the opioid epidemic. A number of states have filed suit against pharmaceutical companies for their roles in the opioid epidemic.\u000a\u000aEven some pharmacy chains -- like Walmart, CVS and Walgreens -- have been named in lawsuits and investigations.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aMissouri Senator Claire McCaskill announced on Thursday that she was expanding her opioid investigation, which focuses on the relationship between prescription drugs and the opioid epidemic. She is requesting documents from opioid distributors, which were not previously part of the investigation, and she has also added new pharmaceutical companies to the mix.\u000a\u000aBut many physicians and advocates want to focus on the doctor's office in order to protect patients at risk.\u000a\u000a"If we're ever going to bring (the opioid epidemic) to an end ... we need these folks to prescribe much more cautiously," Kolodny said. "If you can get your patients off of opiates, that should be the goal."

aVThree months ago, CNNMoney examined six barometers of the economy to gauge how America was doing under President Trump.\u000a\u000aIt's time to take another look under the hood.\u000a\u000aThe good news for Trump is that many parts of the economy are still humming. Trump is taking credit particularly for strong job growth and record high stock prices. The housing market is another bright spot. And the trade deficit has narrowed.\u000a\u000aHere's a more detailed look at the economy, 200 days into the Trump presidency.\u000a\u000a1. Jobs\u000a\u000aIt's hard to find fault with the latest jobs numbers. The unemployment rate is 4.3%, a 16-year low. The economy has added more than 1 million jobs since Trump took office.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, wage growth has yet to really pick up. Employers still don't feel pressure to offer big salaries to attract the workers they need. Average hourly earnings have increased only 2.5% over the past 12 months. The Federal Reserve would rather see 3% to 3.4%.\u000a\u000aStill, because inflation is low, those wage gains are helping many Americans.\u000a\u000a2. Housing prices\u000a\u000aThey're red hot.\u000a\u000aThe average price for an existing home in June was a record $263,800, or 6.5% higher than a year ago. June was the 64th consecutive month of gains compared with a year earlier.\u000a\u000aAnd borrowing money to buy a house remains relatively affordable, despite recent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage is just 3.93%, according to Freddie Mac, down from 4.02% three months ago.\u000a\u000a3. Lending\u000a\u000aConsumers aren't borrowing just to buy homes. They're taking on debt for cars and using credit cards for lots of other things.\u000a\u000aAmericans had $3.843 trillion in loans outstanding in May, up from $3.766 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Fed.\u000a\u000aAnd businesses are borrowing more, reversing a trend from earlier this year. That could be a good sign for Trump and the economy. Consumers can't prop up the economy alone: Companies need to pull their weight and invest.\u000a\u000a4. Consumer spending\u000a\u000aBig stores including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and J.C. Penney (JCP) report earnings this week, and the results could be lousy.\u000a\u000aThe dominance of Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) is one reason. But Americans may also be spending less on clothes, toys and other smaller purchases -- even though they're taking out more loans.\u000a\u000aRetail sales fell 0.2% in June. Economists were expecting a slight increase. And overall consumer spending was up just 0.1% in June.\u000a\u000aSpending has increased 2.8% over the past 12 months, a bit below the 3% pace many experts feel is necessary to keep the economy on track.\u000a\u000a5. Trade\u000a\u000aTrump wants more consumers -- in the United States and around the globe -- to buy American. And it looks like that's starting to happen.\u000a\u000aThe trade deficit fell slightly in June from three months ago, to $43.6 billion. That's the lowest since just before the election.\u000a\u000aAmerica's suddenly vibrant oil industry is a big reason the balance is shifting. Thanks to technologies like fracking, the United States exported more crude in June and imported less.\u000a\u000aExports to Canada and Mexico rose in June, too, a possible sign that Trump's tough talk is working with America's two big North American trading partners.\u000a\u000aChina is still a sore spot. The U.S. trade deficit with China is up more than 6% this year.\u000a\u000a6. Stocks\u000a\u000aAn undeniable win for the president. Fears of a market collapse under Trump have proved to be misguided.\u000a\u000aThe Dow keeps hitting records and is up 12% this year.\u000a\u000aAnd the blue chips are lagging. The Nasdaq has surged nearly 20% thanks to big gains in Amazon, Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30).\u000a\u000aFor now, Wall Street is willing to ignore the turmoil in the Trump administration. Investors are hoping for eventual changes to the tax code and deregulation of the financial industry.\u000a\u000aStrong earnings don't hurt, either. Profits for the companies in the S&P 500 are up more than 10% from a year ago.

aVCh-ch-ch-ch-changes are sweeping through China's beloved pastime of karaoke.\u000a\u000aTraditionally, karaoke in China involves getting a group of friends together, booking a room at a karaoke bar and singing into the night.\u000a\u000aBut a bunch of companies are now enabling people to use their smartphones to unlock their inner divas anytime and anywhere.\u000a\u000aRelated: How a Chinese social media app made it big in the U.S.\u000a\u000aTiny, self-service karaoke booths from a company called M-Bar started popping up all over Beijing earlier this year.\u000a\u000aPeople can scan in using WeChat, China's most popular messaging app, and rock the mic for 15 minutes or an hour -- all in the privacy of a roughly 20-square-foot cubicle.\u000a\u000a"It's so convenient," said Ye Guancheng, 28, who was trying the karaoke booth out with his girlfriend. "You don't need to have an appointment like you do with traditional karaoke rooms."\u000a\u000aThe booths are also plugged into social media. Users can get recordings of their karaoke sessions sent to them via WeChat, where they can post their best hits -- kind of like an audio selfie.\u000a\u000aOther companies are also tapping into the desire for more personalized karaoke experiences.\u000a\u000aOne startup, Smule, connects users and karaoke enthusiasts with celebrities, letting them record duets with pop stars like Shawn Mendez or Charlie Puth on its Sing! Karaoke app. Famous artists upload audio to the platform for fans to sing along with.\u000a\u000aSmule is based in San Francisco, but most of its 52 million monthly active users are in Southeast Asia. Now, it's targeting China, securing $54 million in funding from investors including Chinese tech giant Tencent (TCEHY) last month. It will face stiff competition from other local karaoke apps with built-in social media platforms like ChangBa, and Tencent's own Quanmin.\u000a\u000aHow good is this?! Double tap if you like! \U0001f60d #smule #instasmule A post shared by Smule (@smule) on Apr 18, 2017 at 10:00am PDT\u000a\u000aThe proliferation of such apps has helped fuel the Tosing craze, which is yet another way to karaoke on the go.\u000a\u000aTosing is a portable contraption that is half microphone, half speaker. It connects to smartphones and other devices through Bluetooth. From there, users can open a karaoke app and sing to their heart's content.\u000a\u000aThe company sold about 3 million mics last year, mostly in mainland China and Hong Kong. The latest versions of the karaoke-to-go machine cost about $100, but are often sold for much less.\u000a\u000aRelated: 'Carpool Karaoke' fans kept waiting for Apple series\u000a\u000a"Singing used to be something people would do at a certain place, during a certain time," Tosing inventor You Guangguo said. "People are used to singing only on stage, or at a karaoke lounge or family gathering."\u000a\u000aYou invented the Tosing mic in part because he said he's a bad singer and often embarrassed to perform in front of others.\u000a\u000aWith Tosing, "you can sing on the streets, you can sing in bed, you can sing in a public space ... whether it's by yourself or with friends," he said.\u000a\u000a-- Yuli Yang and Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.

aVIt took three days, but J.K. Rowling says she's sorry.\u000a\u000aThe "Harry Potter" author apologized on Monday for a series of tweets that falsely accused President Donald Trump of refusing to shake the hand of a child in a wheelchair during an event last week.\u000a\u000aRowling said she was informed her tweets from Friday were "not a full or accurate representation" of what happened at last Monday's health care event at the White House and deleted them.\u000a\u000aShe also apologized on Twitter to the boy and his family, though she did not extend the same courtesy to Trump. A spokesperson for Rowling did not say whether she would issue an apology to the President.\u000a\u000aRe: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage, multiple /1 \u2014 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) July 31, 2017\u000a\u000aRowling on Friday tweeted out a video which was edited in a way that suggested Trump ignored the outstretched hand of 3-year-old Montgomery Weer.\u000a\u000aThe bestselling author wrote at the time that it was "stunning" and "horrible" Trump "cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President." The first in her series of seven tweets had racked up more than 75,000 retweets by Monday.\u000a\u000aUnedited video, however, showed Trump did, in fact, greet the boy, crouching down to eye level to shake his hand. Politifact declared Rowling's initial claim to have a "Pants on Fire" rating.\u000a\u000aRowling only deleted her tweets only after it attracted scrutiny from several news outlets, including former CNN host and Daily Mail columnist Piers Morgan, who wrote in a Monday column that the author's refusal to correct her tweets was "shameful."\u000a\u000aThe boy's mother, Marjorie, who was not available for a comment, also wrote in a weekend Facebook post that Trump "didn't snub" her son.

aVA woman crosses a street in Hamburg, Germany, in front of a performance piece orchestrated by the 1,000 Gestalten (1,000 Figures) on Wednesday, July 5. The zombie-like participants were caked in dusty gray clay before a single demonstrator shed his facade to reveal colorful clothes beneath. Then others began to follow suit and do the same. Organizers wanted to emphasize their belief that change can start with one person. "We cannot wait until change happens from the world's most powerful, we have to show political and social responsibility -- all of us -- now!" a group spokesman said in a statement. Hamburg is hosting many world leaders this week for the G20 summit.

aVStory highlights German photographer Felix von der Osten spent time at an Indian reservation in Montana\u000a\u000aHe set out to show the "beauty and richness of the culture" and arouse curiosity in viewers\u000a\u000a(CNN) Growing up in Germany, everything Felix von der Osten learned about Native Americans came from the books of 19th-century German writer Karl May.\u000a\u000aMay's most beloved characters, a noble Apache leader named Winnetou and his cowboy blood brother Old Shatterhand, are said to be more popular today in Germany than the works of Thomas Mann, the 20th-century Nobel Prize-winning author of "Death in Venice."\u000a\u000aIt wasn't until von der Osten drove through South Dakota last year, bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic Black Hills, that he realized how one-dimensional his perceptions were.\u000a\u000aIntrigued, the 25-year-old photographer began researching Native American history. What he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to Indian Country to capture the good, the bad and the ugly.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to show a slice of life (through) the beauty and richness of the culture," he said. "I didn't want to do reportage. I wanted to do slow and thoughtful photographs, like historical documents."\u000a\u000aRead More

She is the host of the podcast "Kill Me Now," available on CBS' play.it and iTunes or at judygold.com/podcast. Follow her on Twitter @JewdyGold. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000aHow are you? It must be so exhausting running for President. I hope you're taking good care of yourself.\u000a\u000aI happened to be flipping through the channels on Thursday night when I saw you talking to Donald Trump at the Republican debate about what you called "New York values." I wasn't sure at first what you meant, but then you explained: "I think most people know exactly what New York values are: socially liberal, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, focused on money and the media."\u000a\u000aFor a moment I actually thought Mr. Trump was speechless, but duh, he's a New Yorker like me, and nobody cherishes the First Amendment more than us!\u000a\u000aAnyway, it's a new day.\u000a\u000aAnd I just took a car service home from my fiance's apartment on the Upper East Side. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with the UES. It's in Manhattan on the opposite side of Central Park where you had that fundraiser at those two gay guys' apartment in April? I hope that while you were here, you and your wife had time to visit the Goldman Sachs' headquarters to thank them for that big loan they gave you.\u000a\u000aJudy Gold\u000a\u000aI bet you saw the building as your plane was landing; it's one of those huge towers downtown by ground zero. Maybe you didn't have enough time, since you never know how the traffic is going to be on the George Washington Bridge when you're driving in from the airport.\u000a\u000aI live on the Upper West Side and my girlfriend and I are planning to get married as soon as we can find a big enough apartment to comfortably fit all four of us (two kids included). Both our apartments are rent stabilized, so we're taking our time finding the right place. If you're not familiar with the rent laws in New York, you should check them out.\u000a\u000an 1997 , our Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, extended rent regulation laws after a big to-do with Republican State Sen. Joseph L. Bruno, who wanted them eliminated. Thank goodness, our mayor had two important allies: Republican State Sens. Roy Goodman of Manhattan and Frank Padavan of Queens, who both agreed with the Democratic-controlled State Assembly.\u000a\u000aHave you ever been to Queens, Ted? It's the most racially diverse county in the contiguous United States . My favorite Greek restaurant is in Astoria. Do you like Greek food? It's yummy. Asghar, my driver, and I were talking about how many great places there are to eat here in NYC. He was born in Pakistan, and moved here as a baby. He married a woman from Colombia and their two kids are just beautiful, and get this -- they're also tri-lingual! They speak English, Urdu and Spanish. I must admit that I'm a little jealous about that.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Republican presidential candidates line up on stage before a debate Thursday, January 14, in North Charleston, South Carolina. From left are Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Jeb Bush. It is the sixth GOP debate of this election cycle and the first of 2016. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Trump, who has been leading GOP polls for months, answers a question during the debate. "I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly, and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger," he said. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Cruz speaks during the debate. The senator from Texas opened the event by talking about the U.S. sailors recently detained by Iran. "Today," he said, "many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads. ... I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America." Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Bush waves to the audience. The former Florida governor has been trying to build momentum that he had in the early stages of his candidacy, and he went after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton early in the debate. "She's under investigation with the FBI right now," he said. "If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that." Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Rubio delivers an answer during the debate. He frequently attacked President Barack Obama. "When I become president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders," the senator from Florida said. "When I'm president of the United States, we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military." Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Carson promised this week he would "insinuate" himself into the conversation when needed. After a discussion between Rubio and Christie during the debate, Carson told moderator Neil Cavuto, "Neil I was mentioned too." Cavuto asked, "You were?" Carson quipped, "Yeah, he said everybody." On a more serious note, Carson noted the "divisiveness and the hatred" in today's society. "We have a war on virtually everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imagine, we have people at each other's throat," he said. "And our strength is actually in our unity." Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Kasich touted his economic record as governor of Ohio. "Our wages are growing faster than the national average," he said. "We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life." Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Christie, like most of the candidates on stage, continued to be tough on the current administration. "Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama," he said of the recent State of the Union address. Christie also said "you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership. I will not do that. If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House." Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston From left, Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina and Rick Santorum arrive for the "undercard" debate that took place a couple of hours before the main event. Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, delivers remarks during the debate. "The biggest reason that we're seeing the hollowing out of middle America is the breakdown of the American family," he said. "We have been too politically correct in this country because we don't want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children." Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Fiorina makes a point during the undercard debate. "The state of our economy is not strong," she said in her opening comments. "We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them. ... It's time to take our country back." Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Huckabee laughs during the debate, which was hosted by the Fox Business Network. His opening statement was much more serious. "There are a lot of people who are hurting today," said the former Arkansas governor. "I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way he's managing it." Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aHey, I heard that you are a huge fan of "The Princess Bride." Me, too!! Did you know that they are talking about bringing it to Broadway? That would be so amazing, because William Goldman wrote the book right here in NYC!\u000a\u000aHave you seen any Broadway shows recently? I think you would just LOVE "Hamilton." Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote it and it's very historical. He's from Washington Heights and he's so talented. I'm warning you that it's hard to get tickets, but I'm sure you have some "in" somewhere. And check out "Kinky Boots" and "Fun Home" if you can. You won't be sorry!\u000a\u000aI wish I had more time to write, but I have so much to do.

aVChicago (CNN) It was a little after 3 p.m. on Saturday here, the third day of the Democratic Socialists of America biannual convention, and it was time to vote. But the murmurs on the floor were growing louder and soon the problem became apparent. The student section of DSA, the Young Democratic Socialists, was absent.\u000a\u000aA motion came to recess for 10 minutes, until the YDS meeting wrapped and its delegates -- some of them salty over being rushed -- could make their way to the main hall.\u000a\u000aAt that, Laura, a DSA member from Buffalo, stood to register a point of information. Recognized, she asked: "Did the YDS choose to go over time democratically or not?" There was a beat, then the room -- which held about a thousand people -- broke up with quiet laughter.\u000a\u000a"They had an extended debate," the chair offered with a gamely stifled sigh, "that was not necessarily planned nor democratically decided." The motion to recess failed and it was back to work.\u000a\u000aOver 36 hours this weekend, the country's largest anti-capitalist organization would vote to leave the Socialist International, a mismash of parties from around the world that DSA has been affiliated with since its inception in 1982; to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel (one Congress is now considering legislation to criminalize, a juxtaposition that delighted many delegates); and resoundingly affirm the push for universal, single payer health care as the organization's defining fight.\u000a\u000a"Single payer is the first step to building a militant working class movement & a social democratic politics that builds power from below." pic.twitter.com/tin9yt1fSD \u2014 DSA East Bay (@DSAEastBay) August 4, 2017\u000a\u000aThe work of preaching socialism in the US, to say nothing of its successful practice, has been a historically dangerous task . Many countries have capitalist economies; few venerate the capitalists like Americans. Here there is virtue implied in the accumulation (or holding) of wealth, both in the prevailing cultural and political milieu. The businessman in the White House can attest.\u000a\u000aPushing back\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of President Donald Trump's election, DSA recruitment skyrocketed, from something like 8,000 in November 2016 to 25,000 dues-paying members on the even of the 2017 gathering in Chicago, according to organizers. As importantly, a new American left culture has found its spiritual home with the organization, growing up alongside and around DSA politics. If the 1960s political counterculture had rock music, the new socialists -- their affection for a good sing-song notwithstanding -- have podcasts, internet memes, and a vibrant independent media.\u000a\u000aBinding it all together in a single, recognizable package is Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent -- who identifies as a democratic socialist but is not a DSA member -- "brought single payer into the mainstream discourse and Trump (and the Republican effort to gut Obamacare) lit it on fire," said Jeremy Gong, a member of California's East Bay DSA, and newly elected member of the group's national political committee. But even before the first 2016 primary vote was cast, a New York Times/CBS News poll caught a snapshot of the rising tide, with 56% of Democratic primary voters surveyed saying they held a positive view of socialism.\u000a\u000aFor the many, not the few! #DSACon17 welcomes Marcus Barnett from U.K.'s Labour Party #BeautifulSocialists pic.twitter.com/mc9S8ZM4ti \u2014 Heart of Iowa DSA \U0001f339 (@HeartOfIowaDSA) August 6, 2017\u000a\u000aChris Maisano, an organized labor veteran from New York City, was also voted in for a two-year term on the NPC. Earlier in the weekend, he helped lead a breakout session called "Electoral Strategy for Socialists."\u000a\u000a"This was a big, boisterous and loud movement," he said, recalling the century-old heyday of Eugene V. Debs, a five-time Socialist Party presidential nominee. The road back to relevance was laden with tripwires. Cold War era crackdowns, open or implicit, Red-baiting, derailed opportunities to build a mass movement. Four decades of Democratic Party drift away from the policies of public control, often in favor of "market-based solutions," and the success of union-busting strategies on the right, has kept the far left on the back foot.\u000a\u000a"Sanders did a really great and tremendous job of opening the conversation and helping us get out of the closet a little bit," Maisano said. A campaign, especially one with the insurgent spirit of Sanders' 2016 bid, can galvanize support -- and inject immediacy into a movement -- in ways that meetings and readings and protests have failed. But the next steps will be more challenging. DSA, with its 25,000 members is both large, growing, and in the grand scheme of American politics, laughably small. The former, leaders say, will continue -- and the latter upended -- by one thing.\u000a\u000aWinning time\u000a\u000a"I'm serious about winning," said Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, the 28-year-old alderman from Chicago's 35th ward , who joined DSA and served as a Sanders delegate to the DNC. "I'm not dogmatic and I'm extremely pragmatic. We need to assess how it is that we can win and elect Democratic Socialist values and that's going to take different forms in different places. In the end, the Democratic Party is not an end unto itself, nor is a third party an end unto itself, a party whether it be the Democratic Party of a third party, is a means to an end."\u000a\u000aStood in solidarity with Mechanics' Union Local 701 picket in the @35th_Ward today. Their spirits are high! They will win! #UnionStrong #1u pic.twitter.com/oGFby6y7mY \u2014 Ald. Carlos Rosa \U0001f339 (@CDRosa) August 4, 2017\u000a\u000aGiven the chance to formally, and forcibly, extract themselves from any relationship with the Democrats, and promote a third party alternative, delegates in Chicago voted overwhelmingly against a call for the senator to establish his own. When faced with the question more broadly, a number of delegates and member observers I spoke to were openly skeptical. "We don't want to end up like the Green Party," one activist mused.\u000a\u000aHelping to secure victories for DSA-backed candidates, no matter their chosen ballot line, in even the smallest races is a key tactical priority for the organization's top officials.\u000a\u000a"As a historian and a movement person, I know that when people win, they are motivated, and when they lose, they are not motivated," said Maria Svart, DSA's national director. "So that's a big part of why we think it's really important to take that into account and be really pragmatic and realistic."\u000a\u000aThe last six months have brought enough victories to meet the thirst. In South Fulton, Georgia, khalid kamau, a Black Lives Matter activist and endorsed DSA member won a seat on his city council. John Grant, a housing organizer in Seattle, won a DSA endorsement and, last week, the second slot in a run-off for a city council seat.\u000a\u000apic.twitter.com/gpArG9Es09 \u2014 DSA \U0001f339 (@DemSocialists) August 6, 2017\u000a\u000aMike Sylvester, now in his first term in the Maine House of Representatives, was among DSA's first nationally backed candidates. His bona fides included years of union organizing down in Boston and, as evident in our conversation, the ability to drop the term "socialist analysis" seamlessly into otherwise light conversation.\u000a\u000a"The socialist organizations that I was in before (DSA) said you must believe these 15 dictums and these 59 subsections, otherwise you are tool of the capitalists," he said, laughing. "DSA has a much larger idea of what socialism is."\u000a\u000aSylvester is ambitious too and was one of the few on hand in Chicago to venture openly into discussion of DSA's place on the national electoral scene, as the 2018 midterms and 2020 general election come up on the horizon.\u000a\u000a"It's our role to hold the left, to have a socialist analysis, to ask candidates where they are in terms of that -- and not to move toward them," he said. "It's to say, we can't support you because you're not for single payer, you're not for "Medicare for all. That's a benchmark for us. A bottom-line issue."\u000a\u000aSingle-payer isn't just about health care\u000a\u000aIndeed, conversations around the University of Illinois-Chicago Forum and in smaller conference rooms at the school's student center returned inexorably to health care. It was a matter of both conscience and, as many explained, a growing savvy.\u000a\u000a"Politics is about identity whether we like it or not now," said East Bay DSA organizer Jess Dervin-Ackerman, who worked as a digital organizing manager at NextGen Climate during the 2016 campaign. "For me, it's about the issues. So when we go out and talk about single payer -- we chose that issue for a reason: it will help mostly working people and marginalized people more than everyone else."\u000a\u000aWhen I asked her colleague at the East Bay chapter, Jeremy Gong, how DSA planned to persuade Democrats that socialism could advance the ball on what many identify as social issues, he pointed to abortion -- and sought to frame it as a fundamentally economic one.\u000a\u000a"There is a false dichotomy between identity and class that has been leveraged by liberals (like those in the Clinton campaign)," Gong said. "We can say that abortion is legal, but unless they are free and universally provided, so people don't have to drive very far to get them, like they do in places like Texas, then they are not actually guaranteed."\u000a\u000aEven if that argument is destined to lose with establishment Democrats, who are knee-deep in their own internecine squabbling , DSA's optimism is rooted in true belief. The message will sell, or it won't.\u000a\u000aThe kids are all fight\u000a\u000aDelegates in Chicago and the members who followed along on social media for details are disproportionately young. For many, their participation in both the single payer campaign -- which included, for many, a place at the frontline in the fight to defend Obamacare -- and the DSA's internal politics has been their first foray into activism of any kind. Leadership wants that first taste to be sweet.\u000a\u000aSvart, the national director, made the point by recalling a pervasive debate from the early days of Occupy Wall Street, back in the fall of 2011. Even as media members pressed them, and trollish political opponents prodded, OWS protesters often clashed over whether to issues an official slate of "demands." (Some OWS outposts did; most didn't.)\u000a\u000a"People there didn't feel that the state was capable of responding to popular pressure. Young people tend have that perspective," Svart said. "They haven't lived through major social programs being created that changed the material reality of their lives."\u000a\u000aUltimately though, DSA wants to offer something more. And Svart believe it will define their destiny.\u000a\u000a"As socialists, the ideological piece is so important because it's a lens through which people can understand the world. And they're not getting that anywhere else," she said. "So they're pissed off. We want to be fighting to change people's everyday lives and we want to be fighting for what we can actually win. We have this north star."

aV(CNN) Can the sight of a greenish-brown color really be enough to deter smokers from reaching for their next pack of cigarettes?\u000a\u000aLawmakers in the UK hope the "world's ugliest color" will be helpful in lowering smoking rates in their country. In May, previously passed legislation will go into effect requiring all packs of cigarettes to be standardized. Tobaccos products will be stripped of brightly colored branding and replaced with a sludge-like color.\u000a\u000aBut does the stripped-down, "ugly" packaging really reduce smoking?\u000a\u000aResearchers from the UK and Canada summarized several studies that look at the impact of tobacco packaging on consumer attitudes and behavior. Their findings were published today in a Cochrane Review\u000a\u000aJamie Hartmann-Boyce of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, co-author of the review, noted that "the evidence we have so far suggests that standardized packaging may reduce smoking prevalence and increase quit attempts."\u000a\u000aThe UK law, passed last year, is similar to a cigarette standardization plan Australia enacted in 2012, which also features graphic health warnings and standardized fonts.\u000a\u000aThe muddy color -- Pantone 448C -- was chosen after marketing research company GfK Bluemoon was commissioned to develop ideas for unappealing cigarette packing. The agency asked Australian smokers about colors they found unappealing and overwhelming. Pantone 448 C was later named "the world's ugliest color."\u000a\u000aRespondents reportedly associated the color with the words "dirty," "tar" and "death."\u000a\u000aI used to feature so much in all your 70s couches, curtains and wallpapers. What did I do to deserve this? \u2014 Pantone 448 C (@Pantone448C) August 17, 2012\u000a\u000aDeterring bathroom breaks\u000a\u000aCigarette and tobacco packaging is not the first time the murky shade has been used in an attempt to turn people away from certain behaviors. According to Angela Wright, a color consultant and author of "The Beginner's Guide to Colour Psychology," the technique has been around for decades.\u000a\u000aShe cites American color consultant Faber Birren, who in the 1960s devised a way to stop department store employees from taking lengthy bathroom breaks.\u000a\u000a"The company asked him, 'Can you improve the working area so they don't have to leave all the time and use the restrooms?' " Wright said.\u000a\u000a"Birren actually took a different view and painted the restrooms in a color similar to Pantone 448C. And nobody wanted to spend time in the restrooms after that."\u000a\u000aThis is just one of the many examples that the "world's ugliest color" has been used to minimize appeal to control human behavior.\u000a\u000aIs Pantone 448C really that bad?\u000a\u000aWhat makes Pantone 448C so off-putting? Wright said she believes it's the association with human waste.\u000a\u000a"It makes perfect sense that smoking packets would use a vile green that looks like bodily fluids and makes people feel slightly nauseated," she said.\u000a\u000aBut not everyone agrees.\u000a\u000aFrance will also introduce plain cigarette packaging.\u000a\u000a"I actually quite like the color," said psychologist Dr. Carolyn Mair of the London College of Fashion, UAL. "It's an earthy, muted, rich color, very much of nature. But then I also don't smoke."\u000a\u000aColor in advertising\u000a\u000aThe use of color can play a key role in brand perception among the public.\u000a\u000a"Blue is often used in services such as banking and law because of its association with loyalty, honesty and reliability," Mair said. Red meanwhile "raises the pulse rate ... and communicates strength and high energy," Wright said.\u000a\u000aColor associations Red: Strength, energy, passion Blue: Focus, loyalty, calmness Yellow: Ego, optimism, openness Green: Balance, youth, eco-friendly Purple: Luxury, femininity, glamour Sources: Angela Wright, Carolyn Mair\u000a\u000a"Football teams who have red uniforms are giving themselves more physical energy but also communicating to the opposite team that they are powerful and strong."\u000a\u000aAnd purple has connotations with luxury, Mair said.\u000a\u000a"Think of Cadbury chocolate (which has a purple logo). At least when it started out, it had the association with a glamorous, smooth, feminine brand," she added.\u000a\u000aColor combinations can also have powerful connotations.\u000a\u000aIn the UK, the Esso petrol logo features red, white and blue -- much like many national flags, including those of the United States, Great Britain and France.\u000a\u000a"So this combination can result in an instinctive loyalty," Wright said.\u000a\u000aThe eye of the beholder\u000a\u000aThat said, perception also plays a huge role -- as seen in Wright's and Mair's different responses to Pantone 448C.\u000a\u000a"Red could be seen as aggressive and demanding -- or as exhilarating and exciting," Wright said. "Similarly, blue could be perceived as calming and well-thought-through -- or excessively bureaucratic and emotionless."\u000a\u000aWright sees the overwhelming color of our times as a bleak gray.\u000a\u000a"Gray is the color of austerity," Wright said. "And we're going to keep wearing gray until we feel better financially."\u000a\u000aThat is, unless you feel compelled to lighten things with a splash of Pantone 448C.

aVCaracas, Venezuela (CNN) Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly held its first session Saturday and issued its first order of business: the immediate removal of Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz.\u000a\u000aIn a unanimous vote, the newly-elected legislative body fired Ortega. In addition to barring her from ever seeking public office again in Venezuela, lawmakers prohibited her from leaving the country and froze her assets.\u000a\u000aIn a live broadcast on state TV, the assembly's president said Ortega would be removed and legal action would be brought against her. The news was met with applause by the more than 500 members of the legislative body, known as the Constituents.\u000a\u000aIt came after Ortega said she would open an investigation into fraud allegations surrounding last Sunday's election, which led to the creation of the controversial new legislative body.\u000a\u000aThe National Constituent Assembly is expected eventually to take the place of the opposition-led National Assembly in a move that critics fear will erode democracy.\u000a\u000aThe new assembly, which has wide-ranging powers and is expected to rewrite the Venezuelan Constitution at the behest of leftist President Nicolas Maduro, had its first session televised live on state television.\u000a\u000aJust before Ortega was fired, government troops prevented her and some of her subordinates from entering her Caracas office building.\u000a\u000aAn image distributed by Ortega's press office shows troops outside her office in the capital, Caracas.\u000a\u000aMore than three dozen troops stood outside the building Saturday, pictures released by her press office show.\u000a\u000a"This is a dictatorship -- the abuse that is being experienced in Venezuela, the repression," Ortega told reporters there.\u000a\u000aThe firing defied the regional Organization of American States, whose human rights commission Saturday warned the Venezuelan government to guarantee Ortega's safety and allow her to continue as attorney general.\u000a\u000aIt cited what it said were comments by "high-ranking officials" indicating Ortega may face prosecution by Maduro's regime.\u000a\u000aWith the ouster, Ortega has lost immunity from prosecution that Venezuelan government officials enjoy. Venezuela's Supreme Court issued a statement that she will be investigated over what it called serious violations and offenses as attorney general.\u000a\u000aThe new attorney general's office\u000a\u000aThe assembly proposed a "restructuring" of the attorney general's office and nominated Tarek William Saab , a Maduro ally and former ombudsman, to be the interim attorney general.\u000a\u000aHe was sworn in late Saturday afternoon to a rousing applause from the Constituent Assembly.\u000a\u000aDuring his swearing-in speech, Saab blamed the inaction of the attorney general's office for the wave of violence that has gripped the country.\u000a\u000a"The attorney general's office allowed for there to be an approximate number of 100 victims for the lack of justice, for not acting early on, for allowing violent groups to gain unworthy control of territories that need to be liberated for the peace of all citizens."\u000a\u000aThe US Treasury Department issued sanctions in July against Saab and 12 other Maduro loyalists.\u000a\u000a"As President Trump has made clear, the United States will not ignore the Maduro regime's ongoing efforts to undermine democracy, freedom, and the rule of law," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the time.\u000a\u000a"As our sanctions demonstrate, the United States is standing by the Venezuelan people in their quest to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy. Anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly should know that their role in undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela could expose them to potential US sanctions."\u000a\u000aSaab has also been openly criticized by many people around the country, including his son Yibram, who condemned the deaths of young protesters on a YouTube video that went viral.\u000a\u000aOrtega had been a target in recent months\u000a\u000aOnce a staunch supporter of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's leftist movement, Ortega recently became a critic of the government under Maduro, Chavez's handpicked successor.\u000a\u000aIn recent months she has spoken out against the Venezuelan national guard and the Maduro government over human rights abuses committed against protesters. She has also opposed the National Constituent Assembly.\u000a\u000aFor months, Ortega has denounced the Venezuelan National Guard and the National Police for using excessive force against protesters. She has been at odds with the government, accusing high-ranking current and former members of the country's law enforcement branches of committing human rights abuses.\u000a\u000aOrtega had also recently accused Maduro's government of committing "state terrorism" by stripping citizens of their right to protest, trying them in military courts and carrying out raids without consulting courts.\u000a\u000a"We continue to witness the rupture of the constitutional order. The constitution keeps on being violated, and the government institutions are being dismantled," she said in June.\u000a\u000aHours after being fired, Ortega issued a statement saying that the work by the Constituent Assembly is a coup on the constitution, and she vowed to not surrender to the government.\u000a\u000a"I will continue to fight for all Venezuelans, for their liberties and their rights, until my last breath and in whatever position I might be in."\u000a\u000aMonths of strife\u000a\u000aVenezuela has struggled with a collapsing economy for many years. Maduro's opponents attempted to hold a referendum vote to remove him from office after they won a National Assembly majority in 2015, but the Supreme Court, stacked with government supporters, blocked all attempts to remove him.\u000a\u000aMaduro has also delayed local and state elections.\u000a\u000aThe National Constituent Assembly's election follows months of sometimes deadly anti-regime protests and an economic crisis that led many to leave Venezuela in search of easier access to food and medicine. This latest wave of unrest started after the Supreme Court of Venezuela attempted to dissolve the opposition-led National Assembly.\u000a\u000aFor his part, Maduro has said the election of this constituent body was needed to help establish order and peace in the country.\u000a\u000aHis opponents, meanwhile, say the new assembly could erase the last traces of democracy in the South American country. Opposition leaders say it was a last-ditch effort by Maduro to get rid of the opposition and the checks and balances between the branches of government.\u000a\u000aThe opposition-led National Assembly has indicated it will continue meeting -- raising prospects that two camps may claim to be the country's legitimate government\u000a\u000aInternational reaction\u000a\u000aSaturday, South America's trade bloc, Mercosur, decided to suspend Venezuela indefinitely from the group until there was a "re-establishment of democratic order." The Organization of American States applauded that decision.\u000a\u000aMercosur's decision is mostly symbolic and will not impact trade or the free movement of Venezuelans among Mercosur countries.\u000a\u000aBrazil's state-run news agency quoted Brazilian Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes Ferreira as saying that the Mercosur decision is of a "serious political nature," but that they took into consideration "the concern of not creating greater problems for the Venezuelan people. Venezuelans who want to come to Brazil will be welcomed."Both Maduro and Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza rejected the decision by the block.\u000a\u000aUS State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this week that the United States won't recognize the National Constituent Assembly because "the process was rigged from the start" and "the election lacked credible international observation."\u000a\u000aAssembly's next steps\u000a\u000aSaturday's session was a busy one for the newly established body. Not only did members restructure the attorney general's office, but they also unanimously approved extending to two years the time the assembly will stay in power. Currently, the constitution allows for only six months.\u000a\u000aAssembly leader Delcy Rodriguez, a former Venezuelan foreign minister, warned Friday that "justice will come" to some members of the opposition. Saturday, she announced that the Constitutional Assembly would create a "truth, justice and peace commission" to investigate the violence in the country in the past few months.\u000a\u000aMinutes after announcing the commission, Rodriguez also attacked Ortega, saying she had used her office to destabilize the country.\u000a\u000a"She opened the door for foreign interference in Venezuela. She also opened the door for the fascist right to act with impunity, assassinating and bringing violence to our youth."\u000a\u000aRodriguez plans to lead the truth, justice and peace commission in its first meeting Sunday.\u000a\u000aThen, on Tuesday, the full assembly is expected to convene for its second meeting.

aV(CNN) Intense and disturbing, "Detroit" aspires to present-day relevance by chronicling a tale of racial injustice that's a half-century old. Yet the line drawn from those harrowing events to today is partially muddled by a misplaced focus, dwelling on a night of brutal police violence but shortchanging its equally significant aftermath.\u000a\u000aDirector Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal bring the same visceral style that informed their war collaborations "The Hurt Locker" and "Zero Dark Thirty" to Detroit in 1967. In interviews, Bigelow has cited the Michael Brown killing and subsequent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri as inspiration.\u000a\u000aThe story on which the movie is based, doubtless unfamiliar to many, is horrifying. After days of rioting and looting, police -- skittish about reports of snipers -- terrorized and killed African-Americans unluckily brought together at the Algiers Motel, as complicit National Guardsmen stood by.\u000a\u000aThe film has pieced together its own version of that history, incorporating a closing disclaimer that acknowledges elements of dramatization in areas where the record is murky.\u000a\u000aThe known facts, however, are terrible enough that Hollywood embellishment isn't responsible for 'Detroit's" shortcomings; rather, the film dwells so long on the ordeal experienced by those held at gunpoint -- as police vainly sought a perpetrator where none existed -- that the bigger picture nearly gets lost in the unsettling circumstances of what transpired.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVStory highlights Peggy Drexler: The "ugliness premium" is a phenomenon linked to the human tendency to favor the underdog\u000a\u000aBut this is also a problematic form of intra-gender sexism -- clear and troubling evidence of female misogyny, she writes\u000a\u000aPeggy Drexler is the author of "Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family" and "Raising Boys Without Men." She is an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and a former gender scholar at Stanford University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) For years, scientific studies have proven that human beings respond more positively to beautiful people. We like, trust and value them more. Good-looking people, we've been told time and again, get better jobs, receive higher pay and have an easier time in life. Evolutionarily speaking, pretty people win.\u000a\u000aPeggy Drexler\u000a\u000aWhile all this remains true , according to a new study, the very ugly don't do so badly either, and they may even have an advantage. A recent piece published in the Journal of Business and Psychology found, despite conventional thought, pretty people don't have all the power. In a survey of workers, those rated "very unattractive" earned more than any other category, including those judged "most attractive." This "ugliness premium" meant that the least attractive 3% of the population out-earned the 50% who are only sort of ugly or just average looking.\u000a\u000aYou might say: But isn't beauty in the eye of the beholder? Maybe. But maybe not. The researchers also write that "ratings of physical attractiveness by human judges are known to be highly correlated with measures of bilateral facial symmetry by a computer program and are intersubjectively stable."\u000a\u000aThe study authors had some thoughts about why this was. One of the theories suggested that the very ugly were simply more intelligent or better educated than their relatively more attractive counterparts. But other studies have shown a link between intelligence and attractiveness.\u000a\u000aMy two cents -- the ugliness premium has to do with the human tendency to favor the underdog, a tendency especially apparent among women. And it's not a noble act. Instead, it's a form of intra-gender sexism, or clear and troubling evidence of female misogyny.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Filmmaker Judy Kibinge has been hand-picked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences to join the ranks of voting members.\u000a\u000aShe follows in the footsteps of fellow Kenyan Lupita Nyong'o, who joined Hollywood's most prestigious club after winning an Oscar three years ago.\u000a\u000aKibinge hasn't won an Oscar (yet). She was one of 774 new members invited to join the Academy's "Class of 2017 " as the organization takes steps to recover from the #OscarsSoWhite controversy and diversify its predominantly white, male membership.\u000a\u000a"I was really surprised, really taken aback" Kibinge said upon learning the news, describing it as "something really special."\u000a\u000a"I think it shows the world is really beginning to question the content they watch. They're beginning to want films and documentaries and features that reflect the diversity in the world," she said.\u000a\u000aKibinge's invitation to the Academy is a validation of African talent on the world stage, something she said is "buzzing" right now.\u000a\u000a"There are people enabled to do things by just the beauty of having mobile phones and to create content that travels.\u000a\u000a"Younger Africans and Kenyans are this eclectic mix of a new confidence about being African mixed with not feeling like you have to completely reject things of the West. Really realizing, hey we're on the continent, we're here to stay and we can create things we can relate to."\u000a\u000aKibinge didn't start in film. Straight out of college she began a career in advertising and then one day she decided to pack it all in so she could see her own stories come to life on the big screen. Since then, she's racked up director, writer and producer credits on some 10 films, including "Something Necessary," "Project daddy" and "Dangerous Affair."\u000a\u000aShe also founded Docubox , a Nairobi-based film fund that provides grants and support for African filmmakers. She credits the work coming out of Docubox as the reason she came to the Academy's attention.\u000a\u000a"A few years ago after making a few different feature films of my own, I really began to notice, to really notice how difficult it was to raise funding, how difficult it was to find a sense of community amongst filmmakers back home in Kenya. By founding and starting Docubox I was able, with my colleagues, to raise funding first of all, make a call and in quite a curated process, select a number of independent documentary filmmakers who over the past four years have been doing a lot of grueling work making these incredible films that are going to be seen come the beginning of the end of this year."\u000a\u000aWhile Docubox primarily supports independent documentary filmmakers from Kenya, it has also supported filmmakers from across the continent, including Tanzania and Uganda. Docubox also collaborated with "docsociety" to host a film competition called " Good Pitch, " helping filmmakers from farther afield, including South Africa and one from Sierra Leone.\u000a\u000aAlthough Africa is a huge continent, boasting many diverse countries and languages, Kibinge cites some common themes among the pitches she receives.\u000a\u000a"Often many filmmakers will want to tackle something that has to do with corruption. Many want to touch upon things that are happening to them, issues of drug taking and so on. Others want to express themselves as musicians and to accept themselves as individuals."\u000a\u000aHer advice to up and coming filmmakers?\u000a\u000a"Take notice of the new wave of filmmaking coming out of the continent" she says, referring to the more accessible ways of creating content, and "start writing stories."\u000a\u000a"It's one of the most remarkable times to be African" she added.\u000a\u000aKibinge will be one of the Academy judges for the categories of documentary, international features and animation, the results of which we'll all find out on the much anticipated Oscars night early next year.

aVHackers can unlock a high-tech Tesla car door by using the same run-of-the-mill techniques they use to crack open computers.\u000a\u000aThat's according to security researcher Nitesh Dhanjani, who spoke about his findings at a recent hacker conference in Singapore. All it takes is cracking a six-character password, considered low-hanging fruit in the cyber security world.\u000a\u000aAnd if it can happen to a Tesla (TSLA), other cars may also be susceptible. After all, many modern cars made by others like Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) can also be controlled via computer and mobile phone apps and come equipped with wireless connections that tap into Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell phone networks.\u000a\u000a"We now have ways of accessing our cars we never did before, and consumers aren't quite aware of that. Hackers will try to take advantage of that lack of awareness," said Erik Cabetas, managing partner at the consulting firm Include Security.\u000a\u000aDhanjani said today's cars should be held to a higher security standard than the average laptop. Not only are they more expensive, but losing control of a car can put lives in danger.\u000a\u000a"We can't attempt to secure our vehicles the way we have attempted to secure our workstations at home," Dhanjani, who advises companies on computer security, said in a blog post. "The implications to physical security and privacy in this context have raised stakes to the next level."\u000a\u000aRelated story: Tesla and Audi to become AT&T cars\u000a\u000aDhanjani was especially worried about Teslas.\u000a\u000aTesla owners must create a password-protected online account, which lets them use a smartphone app to access car locks, locate a car, and also see how much its batteries are charged. A single password gives complete access to an account, which is a problem, according to Dhanjani.\u000a\u000aHe also found that Tesla's website didn't lock users out even if someone typed several incorrect passwords. That opens up the site to what's known as "brute-force attacks," where a computer tries thousands of passwords per second until it breaks in. On Monday afternoon, Tesla updated its requirements, locking out users after five incorrect attempts, Dhanjani said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aDhanjani learned about this firsthand when he bought his own Tesla Model S P85+ three weeks ago. He noticed the single password requirements, and decided to test the system by submitting a wrong password 150 times straight. It never locked him out, nor did it ask for the jumbled letters that keeps automated hacker attacks at bay.\u000a\u000aRelated story: Tesla reaches deal to keep selling in New York\u000a\u000aDespite the findings, Dhanjani said he isn't uneasy about his own car and can't wait to get back from vacation to drive the Model S parked at home in Bellevue, Wa.\u000a\u000aHowever, he's concerned about the security of a Tesla, especially if it were to be the security standard for electric cars.\u000a\u000a"The time is right now for Tesla to fix this," Dhanjani said. "As other car manufacturers draw inspiration from Tesla's design and architecture, there will be more people to compromise and launch attacks against."

aV(CNN) Few athletes break world records. Fewer manage to do it twice -- on the same day.\u000a\u000aBut Adam Peaty is no normal athlete.\u000a\u000aAged just 22, the British swimmer picked up two gold medals in the 50 and 100m breaststroke events at the recent World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, and a silver in the 4x100m freestyle relay.\u000a\u000aIt was his 50m performances that really caught the eye, as Peaty broke his own world record first in the semifinals, and then again in the final, becoming the first man ever to go sub 26 seconds in the process.\u000a\u000a"It's unreal," Peaty, who also won gold in the 100m breaststroke at last year's Olympics, told CNN World Sport.\u000a\u000a"I got there in the morning and was quite tired from the 100m. I just dived in and when I touched the other side, I was like 'Oh my God, I've just gone under 26 seconds. I've just smashed my world record from two years ago.'\u000a\u000a"I was just so tired from semifinal, but I got this urge from what I wanted and just took myself back to what I wanted from the sport and thought: 'I've come this far, why not push on again?'"\u000a\u000aAnd push on he did.\u000a\u000aDespite narrowly missing out on a world record in the 100m, Peaty's dominance of the event is such that he has now recorded each of the 10 fastest-ever times over the distance.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The best of Budapest The Swimming World Aquatics Championships got underway on July 14 in Budapest.

aVWith nearly half a million subscribers on YouTube, Sajer (pictured below) is part of a media revolution that has seen the Kingdom achieve the highest YouTube watch time per capita of any country in the world, according to analytics agency Tubular Labs\u000a\u000aIn a country where movie theaters are illegal and music concerts are seldom permitted, young Saudis are increasingly relying on social media for entertainment.\u000a\u000aMore women, in particular, are using YouTube to express their views -- their videos have become so popular that consumption of female-related content in the Kingdom increased by 75% since last year, according to Google.\u000a\u000aAs a result of this surge in Arabic content on YouTube, watch time has increased not only within the Kingdom but throughout the entire Middle East and North Africa region.\u000a\u000aPeter Salisbury , associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank, tells CNN that Saudi Arabia is at a unique juncture where citizens -- particularly the elite -- are pushing the boundaries of socially conservative norms.\u000a\u000aAnd YouTube, it seems, is providing them with the perfect platform.\u000a\u000aSaudis on YouTube\u000a\u000aMost of the female vloggers CNN spoke to admitted to initially being hesitant about appearing on camera -- some still won't reveal their face.\u000a\u000a"At the beginning I was afraid to appear on screen ... it was rare for a Saudi girl to appear on social media platforms and talk about things, (but) with time the fear disappeared, thanks to my family's support," Hessa Al Awad , another influential Saudi vlogger, tells CNN.\u000a\u000aIn the make-up tutorials Al Awad (above) posts, she sticks to Saudi convention by wearing the niqab. Despite the fact she's never revealed her face, her subscribers continue to grow.\u000a\u000aCooking vlogger, Amal Elmziryahi , who was born in Morocco but is based in Saudi Arabia, also generally refrains from revealing her face.\u000a\u000aHessa Al Awad is a 24-year old Saudi beauty creator based in Damam and an avid fan of Japanese pop culture.\u000a\u000a"(I) decided to stick to recording my voice while filming my hands as they did the work," she tells CNN. "I thank god that people liked my channel despite my face not appearing in my videos."\u000a\u000aHatoon Kadi, on the other hand, has become the face of female comedy in the Kingdom with more than 313,000 subscribers.\u000a\u000a"I just seized the opportunity, (because) female perspective is lacking," she tells CNN, adding that it was important to her that her video content never offended anyone.\u000a\u000a"I will never insult anyone (and) I will never talk about sensitive issues like religion or politics, it's not me. So we just keep to the social issues," she says.\u000a\u000aLifestyle and comedy vlogger Njoud al Shammari , 21, (pictured right) reveals her full identity, and in doing so has exposed herself to criticism for being a woman on YouTube, she says.\u000a\u000a"I was attacked by those around me to the degree that my brothers lost some of their friends," she tells CNN.\u000a\u000aBut clearly there are others who support her posts.\u000a\u000aIn one year on YouTube, she's attracted more than 890,000 subscribers and Tubular Labs recently listed both her and Sajer among the top five most influential Saudi female YouTubers\u000a\u000a"(YouTube) gives me the power to have a voice, not only to express myself but also express what (other women) need and what they feel (needs) challenging ... in our society," she says.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia is a 'dynamic society'\u000a\u000aThe rise of Saudi women on YouTube coincides with the nation's ambitious "Vision 2030" program, which promises a wave of cultural reforms to diversify the kingdom's oil-dependent economy.\u000a\u000aWith more than half of the Saudi population below the age of 25 , Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been at the forefront of efforts to radically transform the Kingdom, particularly as chairman of Saudi Arabia's Council for Economic and Development Affairs.\u000a\u000aDeputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has risen to among Saudi Arabia's most influential figures since being named second-in-line to the throne in 2015.\u000a\u000aBin Salman says he envisions Saudi Arabia to be a "tolerant country with Islam as its constitution and moderation as its method."\u000a\u000aSalisbury, of Chatham House, tells CNN: "We tend to see Saudi Arabia as incredibly conservative and incredibly static, but as long as there has been a Saudi Arabia it's quite a dynamic society."\u000a\u000aHe adds that the workings of Saudi society that have long been kept behind closed doors are finally leaking out into the public sphere, thanks to platforms such as YouTube and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"That's confusing for us because in an external perspective it seems like a country lost in time, but when in fact you chip away below the surface -- and we're talking about an urban elite level -- there is change happening.\u000a\u000a"And change has been happening for a long time."

aVIslamabad, Pakistan (CNN) Pakistan's Parliament on Tuesday elevated a former petroleum minister as prime minister after the country ousted former leader Nawaz Sharif over corruption allegations.\u000a\u000aThe Sharif family, however, is unlikely to lose its grip on power for long.\u000a\u000aShahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was elected by Parliament with a majority of 221 votes, is seen as a temporary placeholder for Shahbaz Sharif, the younger brother of Nawaz Sharif.\u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court ruled last week that Nawaz Sharif had been dishonest to Parliament and to the judicial system and was no longer fit for office. He stepped down, quickly selecting his brother to replace him.\u000a\u000aSpeaking after the vote, Abbasi denied he was only a temporary prime minister. "They say, 'Oh he's only here for 45 days.' I say I may be here for 45 days or 45 hours, but I'm not here to keep the seat warm," he told reporters.\u000a\u000a"I intend to work and get some important things done if the cabinet supports me in this."\u000a\u000aThe younger Sharif, who is currently serving as the chief minister of Punjab, can't take office immediately as he isn't yet a member of Parliament.\u000a\u000aHe's expected to run in -- and win, handily -- a September by-election for the former prime minister's seat in Punjab, in a district loyal to his brother's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. The vote is similar to a special election in the United States.\u000a\u000aOpposition leader Imran Khan, a cricketer-turned-politician, has criticized the nominations of Sharif and Abbasi, calling them both corrupt and called for cases of corruption against them to be reopened.\u000a\u000aPunjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif poses with his father's friends in 2013.\u000a\u000aShoo-in\u000a\u000aSo, while Shahbaz Sharif waits to be elected to Parliament, in steps Abbasi.\u000a\u000aHe needed a simple majority, and as the PML-N, which nominated him, holds 188 of the Parliament's 342 seats, he was expected to win easily.\u000a\u000aFollowing his confirmation, Abbasi will now nominate a cabinet, to replace the one that was dissolved on Friday by the courts.\u000a\u000aAnalysts say Abbassi, a party loyalist, is unlikely to object to a short-lived stint in the top job, with this kind of horse-trading common in Pakistani politics.\u000a\u000a"He'll step up to the plate. He's a politician's politician," said Ahsan Butt, an assistant professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government, George Mason University in Virginia.\u000a\u000a"(He's a) reliable character as far as the PML-N is concerned," added Butt.\u000a\u000aPakistan's then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif speaks to media after appearing before an anti-corruption commission at the Federal Judicial Academy in Islamabad on June 15, 2017.\u000a\u000aClean sweep\u000a\u000aJust as Abbasi's elevation to the job was considered a foregone conclusion, so is the Punjab by-election.\u000a\u000aIt's a fairly safe PML-N seat so, barring any surprises, the younger Sharif is expected to coast to victory there.\u000a\u000a"The PML-N is very strong in that region, they've controlled it even when they're not in control nationally," says Butt.\u000a\u000a"It's a traditional party stronghold. One or two opposition parties will field candidates, but they'd be lambs to the slaughter."\u000a\u000aSupporters of ousted Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif stand next to a banner featuring images of Sharif (L) and his brother Shahbaz Sharif (C) on July 29.\u000a\u000aFollowing the election, Parliament can confirm him as the new leader, with the US-educated Abbasi stepping aside.\u000a\u000aAs a sweetener, the short-term replacement could be offered another cabinet position, or his existing role -- until last week he was the minister of petroleum and natural resources.\u000a\u000aHe could even keep the portfolio during his brief tenure as Prime Minister, says Butt.\u000a\u000aGeneral elections, to be held next year, could then see the younger Sharif returned to power.\u000a\u000aIf he is re-elected and sees out a full term, he would be the first civilian prime minister in Pakistan ever to do so.\u000a\u000aDynasty diverted\u000a\u000aSix months ago, the obvious successor to Nawaz Sharif, who had ruled the country since 2013, was his daughter, Maryam Sharif.\u000a\u000aBut her elevation to power looks to have been scuppered by the corruption scandal that brought down her father.\u000a\u000aThe investigation focused on Sharif's alleged links to offshore accounts and overseas properties owned by three of his adult children. The assets, though not declared on his family's wealth statement, were revealed in the Panama Papers leak in April 2016.\u000a\u000aThe leak sparked mass protests in Pakistan and calls from opposition political groups for a panel to investigate Sharif and his children over their alleged offshore accounts, eventually bringing him down.\u000a\u000aAnd the ongoing investigation into Maryam, her husband Safdar Awan, and her brothers Hassan and Hussain, is likely to extend past the deadline for nominations for next April's general election. They have denied any wrongdoing.\u000a\u000aAnalysts say her uncle, who will likely already be Prime Minister by then, will stand and, given the ongoing popularity of the PML-N, win the vote.\u000a\u000aThe Sharif name has already proven to be remarkably resilient.\u000a\u000aThe recently-deposed Sharif has served as prime minister twice before. He saw his first term end prematurely amid allegations of corruption, and his second end in a military coup which saw him jailed, then exiled, before returning to perform yet another political comeback.\u000a\u000aNow it seems likely that his brother will keep the name relevant in Pakistan's power circles, and political analyst Butt says it would be foolish to rule out a comeback for Maryam at some point.\u000a\u000a"I won't say (her political career is) dead in the water. In Pakistan politics, forever is a long time."

aVAn action film bursting with patriotic zeal just broke the Chinese box office.\u000a\u000a"Wolf Warrior 2" has raked in 3.5 billion yuan ($520 million) at theaters as of Tuesday, according to Beijing-based movie industry site MTime. That makes it China's highest grossing film to date.\u000a\u000aThe movie takes place in an unnamed African country, where an elite Chinese soldier ventures into a war zone to save trapped Chinese workers. It's loosely based on several true stories involving military evacuations of Chinese workers from Libya back in 2011 and from Yemen in 2015, according to local media reports.\u000a\u000aRelated: Box office slump is hurting AMC theaters\u000a\u000aWith "Captain America" directors Joe and Anthony Russo reported to have consulted on "Wolf Warrior 2," the movie has the look and feel of a typical Hollywood action flick. The difference is it features a Chinese hero saving Chinese citizens.\u000a\u000a"People know Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger, why don't we have this type of actor representing China?" Wu Jing, the movie's lead actor and director said in comments aired on state-run broadcaster CCTV.\u000a\u000aWu also starred and directed in the first "Wolf Warrior" movie, which was far less popular among domestic moviegoers, pulling in just 545 million yuan ($80 million) in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe sequel, however, has succeeded in tapping into audiences' patriotism. It premiered just ahead of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.\u000a\u000aWith the tagline "Whoever offends China will be hunted down and punished wherever they are," the movie was panned as "jingoistic" by RogerEbert.com. The LA Times, however, found its patriotic fervor "bracing."\u000a\u000aThe closing image of "Wolf Warrior 2" is a Chinese passport with a message scrawled across the back: "The citizens of the People's Republic of China: When you encounter danger overseas, do not give up! Please remember, right behind you, there is a powerful motherland!"\u000a\u000aSome moviegoers took to Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, to heap praise on the film.\u000a\u000aRelated: OJ, Netflix and 'Dunkirk': Your summer guide to media and entertainment\u000a\u000a"I'm so proud to hold a Chinese passport," wrote one Weibo user.

aVEsther Schor, a professor of English and a poet, is the inaugural Behrman Professor in the Humanities Council at Princeton University and Acting director of the council. She is the author of a biography of Emma Lazarus. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Unlike Stephen Miller, the 31-year-old senior adviser to the President, who protested that he didn't want to "get off into a whole thing about history," when it comes to immigration, the Statue of Liberty and Emma Lazarus' poem, "The New Colossus," I'm eager to do so.\u000a\u000aAs Lazarus's biographer, I've been receiving Google alerts for "huddled masses" at least daily since Donald Trump launched his anti-immigrant presidential campaign. In Wednesday's heated exchange between Miller and CNN's Jim Acosta, the nation watched these famous lines become "fighting words," but in fact, they have been just that for years.\u000a\u000aAcosta, himself the son of a Cuban immigrant, rattled Miller, the great-grandson of Yiddish-speaking immigrants , by charging that the Raise Act's immigration reforms, which favor English-speakers in granting admission to the United States, are "not in keeping with American tradition."\u000a\u000a"The Statue of Liberty," he reminded Miller , "says, 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,'" adding, correctly, "It doesn't say anything about speaking English or being able to be a computer programmer."\u000a\u000aIn his now-infamous retort, Miller dismissed the poem: "[T]he Statue of Liberty is a symbol of liberty enlightening the world. It's a symbol of American liberty lighting the world. The poem that you're referring to was added later, is not actually a part of the original Statue of Liberty." Miller went on to mock Acosta, drilling him on what Miller called the "The Statue of Liberty poem law of the land."\u000a\u000aI agree with Miller that "this [was] an amazing moment" but not because of Acosta's putative "cosmopolitanism" ( itself a historically loaded term). No; this was an amazing recitation of fake history, a Trump apologist telling a reporter that a revered American poem must be dismissed on the ground that it's a fake law (Miller baited Acosta repeatedly about different moments in immigration history, asking "is that violating or not violating the Statue of Liberty law of the land?")\u000a\u000aOn one count, Miller's history was correct: Lazarus' poem, though written several years before the statue was dedicated in 1886, was "added later." In 1903, 15 years after Lazarus' death at 38 from cancer, a friend had the poem cast on a bronze plaque and donated it to the statue.\u000a\u000aBut on two counts, Miller was dead wrong. First, saying the poem was physically "added later" reduces the statue to a copper effigy and the poem to an inert plaque. The Statue of Liberty, covered with verdigris and weathered by more than a century of wind and salt, is no more the gleaming copper monument it was in 1886 than the poem is a bunch of lines inscribed on a piece of bronze.\u000a\u000aSecond, the statue was never "a symbol of American liberty lighting (sic) the world." It was the brainchild of French historian and abolitionist Édouard René de Laboulaye, and like many monuments, it had a complex genesis.\u000a\u000aInspired by the 1865 US emancipation of slaves (the French had finally emancipated theirs in 1848), Laboulaye in 1875 commissioned a statue that would link the emancipation of slaves with the values of the French Enlightenment, newly revived in the Third Republic of 1870.\u000a\u000a"Liberty Enlightening the World" would show the world that, in the wake of the repressive Second Empire, France and liberty were, again, one. The French people would fund the statue, while the Americans agreed to pay for the construction of the pedestal.\u000a\u000aTo most Americans of the time, it was a very French affair, and they took little interest in the cause. In a last-ditch effort to raise the money before the statue arrived, a Pedestal Fund auction was set up and it was for this event that Emma Lazarus wrote the sonnet that would utterly recast the meaning of a statue she had never seen.\u000a\u000aShe imagined it as a symbol of America's renunciation of conquest, empire, and pompous aristocracy. Enlightenment, in her view, was still "imprisoned," as long as persecutions persisted, sending the oppressed in search of refuge.\u000a\u000aDubbing the statue a "New Colossus," she saw in it a "Mother of exiles" whose "mild eyes" and lifted torch would welcome the poor and downtrodden from all lands. (Did Lazarus know that sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi had modeled the statue's face on his mother's?) Lazarus, a wealthy fourth- or fifth-generation American, had been deeply involved in the cause of Jewish exiles fleeing persecution in Russia, and her work with impoverished refugees had convinced her that the task of welcoming immigrants lay with the entire nation.\u000a\u000aEven after the poem was placed inside the pedestal, it was several decades before pro-immigrationists in the 1930s seized upon "The New Colossus" to promote their cause.

aVHong Kong (CNN) Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized the Communist Party's control over the military as he prepares for a key leadership reshuffle later this year.\u000a\u000aSpeaking Tuesday at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Xi said the military should "carry forward and implement the Party's absolute leadership."\u000a\u000a"As comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out, our principle is to have the Party command the military, not the military command the Party," Xi said.\u000a\u000aHis words came after a major display of military force Sunday in a grand parade at a base in Inner Mongolia, on China's northern border, in which 12,000 troops, and more than 100 planes took part\u000a\u000aPower play\u000a\u000aAnalysts say Xi has taken advantage of the PLA anniversary to firmly establish his personal authority ahead of a Party Congress around November, during which the next Politburo Standing Committee -- the most powerful governing body in China, headed by Xi -- will be revealed. An exact date for the congress has not been announced.\u000a\u000aSpeaking after the parade Sunday, Yvonne Chiu, an assistant politics professor at the University of Hong Kong, said Xi wanted to "remind the military that they pledge loyalty to the Party, not the country" and to send a message to the country "that the military is firmly onside with him, especially as they're still pursuing the anti-corruption campaign, which continues to shake things up and cause uneasiness among the elite."\u000a\u000aWhile the congress will almost certainly give the 64-year-old Xi another five years as China's top leader, it has been rumored he will seek to buck an established norm that leaders retire after two terms.\u000a\u000aXi was designated the Party's "core leader" in October last year , a powerfully symbolic title that was not granted to his predecessor Hu Jintao, who relied on a more consensus-building governance style compared to the all-powerful Xi.\u000a\u000a"The importance of the Party's control over the military is an oft-repeated phrase, but Xi has emphasized it heavily during his tenure," said Tom Rafferty, China manager at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\u000a\u000aHe added Xi has sought the backing of "a younger generation of military officers" for his reforms, even as former top generals have fallen foul of corruption investigations.\u000a\u000aChinese soldiers carry the flags of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army during a military parade in China's northern Inner Mongolia region on July 30, 2017.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, a wide-reaching and highly popular anti-corruption campaign has brought down many of Xi's rivals or potential successors. Typically the next Chinese leader would be obvious by the time of the Party Congress, as Xi was in 2007.\u000a\u000aLast month however, Sun Zhengcai, widely seen as a rising star in the Party, was abruptly sacked as boss of Chongqing and placed under investigation for corruption. At 53, Sun was one of only a handful of senior Chinese officials capable of succeeding Xi under the current informal retirement age of 68.\u000a\u000aWhile some have predicted Xi will break with the age cap norm -- upheld during the last three leadership turnovers -- as to allow himself and his allies to stay on, Chinese leadership analyst Bo Zhiyue told CNN in April that attempting to serve a third term might be more difficult.\u000a\u000a"(Even if) he wants to be like Putin in Russia, to stay beyond his second term, we don't know if this can be realized," Bo said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED US-China tensions rising Replay More Videos ...

aVWashington (CNN) A suite of pressures on the policy that protects young undocumented immigrants is brewing -- and it could mean the program soon either becomes permanent or disappears entirely.\u000a\u000aNext month, the Trump administration faces both an ultimatum from challengers to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA, and a potentially nasty government funding fight that could require an 11th hour deal to avert a shutdown.\u000a\u000aLast week, the administration's biggest defender of DACA moved much closer to the President, who has also spoken about being sympathetic to DACA recipients. Gen. John Kelly is now the White House chief of staff, and as homeland security secretary, he spoke frequently about preserving the program under this administration.\u000a\u000aBut the move also takes him out of the department that was responsible for issuing permits under the Obama administration policy -- and he recently warned Democrats on the Hill that the program's prospects are dim.\u000a\u000aWhen Congress wraps up its August recess, members will return to a consequential month -- one in which they may be forced to act whether they want to or not.\u000a\u000aThe earliest trigger will be September 5. That's the deadline in an ultimatum issued by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other state attorneys general to the Trump administration: Rescind DACA or we will challenge it in an unfriendly court. They have already succeeded in stopping a similar program to protect the parents of childhood arrivals to the US.\u000a\u000aTrump said the ultimate decision on what to do will be made by him.\u000a\u000a"It's a decision that I make and it's a decision that's very, very hard to make. I really understand the situation now," Trump said in a conversation with reporters on Air Force One last month. "I understand the situation very well. What I'd like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan. But our country and political forces are not ready yet."\u000a\u000aTrump has spoken recently about having compassion for recipients of the policy, which protects undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation and allows them to work and study in the US. But he also pledged to end the program "immediately" on the campaign trail, and his base strongly opposes the Obama administration policy they call an "amnesty."\u000a\u000aThat could make punting the issue to Congress an appealing solution for the administration.\u000a\u000a"My assumption is that the cleanest thing they can do, though they'll take the vast majority of the blame for ending the program, is simply announce come September 5 a sunset of the program, that they'll stop approving applications, and then invite Congress to work on legislation," said a Democratic congressional staffer familiar with the issue who spoke on condition of anonymity to be candid.\u000a\u000aCongress forced to act?\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Congress will have to pass a funding bill in September to keep the government open past the end of the month and raise the debt ceiling -- and the White House is once again pushing for money for its promised border wall.\u000a\u000aDemocrats have signaled they won't allow that to happen, setting up a potential government shutdown standoff.\u000a\u000aRepublicans could look for a sweetener to get the border money, and if the administration ends DACA, there could be a clamor to pass legislation that enshrines it permanently.\u000a\u000aCongress has multiple solutions to choose from. There are bipartisan options from Sens. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, who have introduced both the Bridge Act, which would protect people currently under the program, and the Dream Act, which would create a path to citizenship in the future for those eligible. Those two also have House counterparts.\u000a\u000aDACA-supporting Republicans have lined up behind a bill from Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, the Recognizing America's Children Act, and Democrats have largely signed onto Illinois Rep. Luis Gutiérrez's American Hope Act.\u000a\u000aThere are likely enough Republicans who would support such bills with Democrats to pass them -- but the question remains what they would get in return to placate the part of the Republican base who would decry even allowing a vote on the bills by leadership. And Democrats would also have to agree to the asking price for a compromise, which may be equally tough for their base to swallow.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration has also already said it would be "likely" to oppose the Dream Act, according to a briefing with legislative director Marc Short.\u000a\u000aThus far, leadership is keeping their cards close to the vest.\u000a\u000a"I think it's really important to talk about securing the borders and enforcing the law," Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said when asked Thursday about DACA at an announcement for his border security bill.\u000a\u000aAdvocacy groups on high alert\u000a\u000aAdvocacy groups that support DACA have been holding press conferences, events and rallies in recent weeks in anticipation of a potential opening to save the program.\u000a\u000aDemocratic state attorneys general have launched their own effort to protect DACA, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has preemptively petitioned the court to not consider any move to include DACA in the ongoing litigation.\u000a\u000aOn the other side, right-wing groups that oppose what they consider an "amnesty" for undocumented immigrants are mobilizing to ensure Republicans hold firm -- and preparing to punish any that would allow for a deal on DACA without a massive concession from Democrats.\u000a\u000aThe Democratic staffer acknowledged that the issue may be unresolvable, as both sides are going to be unhappy with the deal the other wants to strike.\u000a\u000a"This idea that we can reach some kind of bipartisan compromise, that used to be true, but the groups on both sides are so dug in. ... These are two groups that hate each other and they can't talk to each other, and there's nothing in between," the staffer said.

I\u2019m not sure arming is the right answer here mainly because of we\u2019re just not exactly sure who the bad guys are, who the good guys are right now in Syria. So you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re giving weapons to.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe continues, \u201cWell, you know, a big part of it is, [Syria is] Russia's last toehold in the Middle East and I think there is attachment to the notion that\u2026 [Assad\u2019s] going to win and they're going to have the toehold in the Middle East through Syria. We need to change that dynamic. I think we need to convince our Russians this is not in their best interests, that some of this slaughtering of women and children is going to get on them as well, and that's just not the place they want to be in the world. And they need, again a little public pressure, a little bilateral effort from the United States and others, other European allies, I think can turn Russia on what's happening. I don't think they want to be on the wrong side of a slaughter in a town like Houla. We need to put the question to them, where do you want to be when this is over? We'd like you to be with the rest of the world. They also have huge weapon sales going into Syria, another big problem we have to deal with.\u201d\u000a\u000aStarting Point with Soledad O\u2019Brien airs weekday mornings from 7-9am ET on CNN.

Hide Caption 2 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity has temperature and humidity sensors mounted on its mast. Calculations in 2015 based on Curiosity's measurements indicate that Mars could be dotted with tiny puddles of salty water at night. Hide Caption 3 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The Mars rover Curiosity does a test drill on a rock dubbed "Bonanza King" to determine whether it would be a good place to dig deeper and take a sample. But after the rock shifted, the test was stopped. Hide Caption 4 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Wheel tracks from Curiosity are seen on the sandy floor of a lowland area dubbed "Hidden Valley" in this image. Hide Caption 5 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover recently encountered this iron meteorite, which NASA named "Lebanon." This find is similar in shape and luster to iron meteorites found on Mars by the previous generation of rovers. A portion of the rock was outlined by NASA scientists. Hide Caption 6 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity took this nighttime photo of a hole it drilled May 5 to collect soil samples. NASA said this image combines eight exposures taken after dark on May 13. Hide Caption 7 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity This view of the twilight sky and Martian horizon, taken by Curiosity, includes Earth as the brightest point of light in the night sky. Earth is a little left of center in the image, and our moon is just below Earth. A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright "evening stars." Hide Caption 8 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The lower slopes of "Mount Sharp" are visible at the top of this image, taken on July 9, 2013. The turret of tools at the end of the rover's arm, including the rock-sampling drill in the lower left corner, can also be seen. Hide Caption 9 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The rock on the left, called "Wopmay," was discovered by the rover Opportunity, which arrived in 2004 on a different part of Mars. Iron-bearing sulfates indicate that this rock was once in acidic waters. On the right are rocks from "Yellowknife Bay," where rover Curiosity was situated. These rocks are suggestive of water with a neutral pH, which is hospitable to life formation. Hide Caption 10 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity shows the first sample of powdered rock extracted by the rover's drill.

Hide Caption 18 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity This image shows what the rover team has determined to be a piece of debris from the spacecraft, possibly shed during the landing. Hide Caption 19 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity The rover's scoop contains larger soil particles that were too big to filter through a sample-processing sieve. After a full-scoop sample had been vibrated over the sieve, this portion was returned to the scoop for inspection by the rover's mast camera. Hide Caption 20 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity cut a wheel scuff mark into a wind-formed ripple at the "Rocknest" site on October 3, 2012. This gave researchers a better opportunity to examine the particle-size distribution of the material forming the ripple. Hide Caption 21 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here. The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team. The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water. The grains are too large to have been moved by wind. Hide Caption 22 of 56\u000a\u000aPhotos: Mars rover Curiosity Curiosity completed its longest drive to date on September 26, 2012. The rover moved about 160 feet east toward the area known as "Glenelg." As of that day the rover had moved about a quarter-mile from its landing site.

aV(CNN) Scientists are getting one step closer to snipping inherited genetic diseases out of human offspring using a gene-editing technique called CRISPR.\u000a\u000aFor the first time, scientists said, they corrected a gene mutation linked to inherited heart conditions in human embryos using the approach. A study demonstrating the technique was published in the journal Nature on Wednesday (PDF).\u000a\u000aLast week, the MIT Technology Review released the first news of this scientific feat, describing the research as the first-known attempt at creating genetically modified human embryos in the United States.\u000a\u000aHowever, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a co-author of the study, described it as the first in the world to demonstrate gene-editing to be safe, accurate and efficient in correcting a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos. Previous attempts by Chinese researchers were unsuccessful at achieving this without safety concerns.\u000a\u000a"This is the first that has been demonstrated as safe and working," said Belmonte, a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies' gene expression laboratory in La Jolla, California.\u000a\u000a"All cells of the embryo were corrected," he said. "It seems to be working from these samples that we have chosen, but we need to do much more basic research with many other genes."\u000a\u000aThe study was a collaboration between the Salk Institute, the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland and Korea's Institute for Basic Science.\u000a\u000aScientists estimate that more than 10,000 human diseases may result from mutations to a single gene occurring in all cells of the body, according to the World Health Organization\u000a\u000aCutting and correcting gene mutations\u000a\u000aThe study used 75 human zygotes in which the father carried a mutation on the MYBPC3 gene, Belmonte said. The eggs used to produce the zygotes did not carry that gene mutation. The researchers noted that they received informed consent from the donors of the eggs, sperm and embryos used in the study.\u000a\u000aHypertrophic cardiomyopathy also is thought to be the most common inherited or genetic heart disease in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u000a\u000aNewly fertilized eggs before gene editing, left, and embryos after gene editing and a few rounds of cell division.\u000a\u000aIn a lab dish, the researchers used CRISPR, a gene-editing technique, to remove the harmful MYBPC3 mutation from the human zygotes. Then, the zygotes' own DNA-repair mechanism replaced what was cut out with a copy of a MYBPC3 gene from the mother, which did not carry a mutation, Belmonte said.\u000a\u000a"A male research subject known to be heterozygous for this gene mutation was recruited for the study, as were several healthy young egg donors," Dr. Paula Amato, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Oregon Health & Science University, said Tuesday. She was a co-author of the study.\u000a\u000a"CRISPR was introduced at the time of sperm injection," she said. "Then, DNA repair of the embryos was assessed."\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that about 72% of zygotes were properly and safely corrected on the MYBPC3 gene, Belmonte said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED On China: Genetically modifying human embryos Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH On China: Genetically modifying human embryos 01:44\u000a\u000aThis method significantly differed from studies in which scientists used the CRISPR tool to replace what was cut out with whatever the scientists desired.\u000a\u000a"The previous human studies done in China had very small numbers, and one of them used abnormal embryos," Amato said. "So we think this is the first, largest study from which you could draw some reasonable conclusions."\u000a\u000aSome gene-editing attempts in human embryos have been problematic, resulting in an issue called mosaicism , in which the corrections made in one gene failed to replicate once that cell divided into two cells, those two cells divided into four cells and so on.\u000a\u000a"So when the baby is born, all the cells do not have the mutation anymore. ... This study, it shows that we can correct the embryo and then, after the division, all the cells are corrected, so there's not what we call mosaicism," said Belmonte, who is also a member of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine's committee on human gene editing.\u000a\u000aThis year, the academies published a report on human genome editing that addressed potential applications of the technology, including the possible prevention or treatment of inherited diseases or conditions.\u000a\u000aThe future of gene editing\u000a\u000aThough the researchers have expressed enthusiasm around their new study, they also noted that the findings must be replicated in followup research before this gene-editing approach can move forward to clinical trials.\u000a\u000a"The fact that it is, apparently, a new and poorly understood mechanism and it is not the now standard CRISPR 'cut and replace' method adds to the time needed for research into its safety and effectiveness," said Hank Greely, professor of law and genetics at Stanford University, who was not involved in the new study.\u000a\u000aYet future research can come with some political challenges, Amato said.\u000a\u000a"First of all, there are regulations regarding use of federal funds for embryo research, so the (US National Institutes of Health) does not currently support embryo research, so that's one barrier. The other barrier is, the (US Food and Drug Administration) is prohibited from considering any clinical trials related to germline genetic modification," she said.\u000a\u000aIn this new study the embryos were only allowed to mature to day three after fertilization before they were disaggregated, or isolated into various components, for further analysis.\u000a\u000aIn the far-off future, a clinical trial could include transplanting corrected embryos into a uterus with the goal of establishing pregnancy and then monitoring the embryos as they develop into children.\u000a\u000aStill, "it is way too early to contemplate implanting the edited embryos for the purpose of actually establishing a pregnancy," said Dana Carroll, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Utah who was not involved in the new study but has used CRISPR in his own research.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED On GPS: Are designer babies in our future?

"There is still a lot of work to do to understand repair processes in very early embryos and to optimize the use of the CRISPR reagents, but this study makes a valuable contribution."\u000a\u000aSome CRISPR critics have argued that gene editing may give way to eugenics and to allowing embryos to be edited with certain features in order to develop so-called designer babies\u000a\u000aHowever, the researchers wrote in their study that they hope CRISPR could be considered as an alternative option to preimplantation genetic diagnosis, also known as PGD, for couples at risk of passing on an inherited disease.\u000a\u000a'This opens up the possibility for those embryos'\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What to make of 'Designer Babies' Replay More Videos ...

Selectively, the parents' doctor would chose the healthy embryos to be implanted and discard the embryos with the mutations, Belmonte said.\u000a\u000aSometimes, "a couple that wants to have a baby and they have a mutation, they may not have enough embryos to choose from," he said. This is when CRISPR can come in.\u000a\u000a"This technology, independent of the embryos that are there, it would go on and correct all of them. ... This opens up the possibility for those embryos," he said. "That's important because after the first implantation, if it doesn't work, you can do it again."\u000a\u000aThe researchers wrote in their study, "PGD may be a viable option for heterozygous couples at risk of producing affected offspring. In cases when only one parent carries a heterozygous mutation, 50% of embryos should be mutant. In contrast, targeted gene correction can potentially rescue a substantial portion of mutant human embryos, thus increasing the number of embryos available for transfer."\u000a\u000aNonetheless, using CRISPR in that way remains a long way off.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aShoukhrat Mitalipov, director of the Oregon Health & Science University's Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy, helped lead the new study.

In 2007, a research team led by Mitalipov announced that they created the first cloned monkey embryo and extracted stem cells from it.\u000a\u000aNow, when it comes to using CRISPR to correct gene mutations in embryos, Mitalipov said Tuesday, "We've done some ground work. ...

aVTom Barrack, executive chairman and founder of Colony Northstar, an international investment firm, was the chairman of the presidential Inaugural Committee. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) As a very young man barely rounding the corner on 30, I had the opportunity to witness and view the Reagan revolution by serving as an enthusiastic and blindly optimistic apprentice in his administration. Now at the opposite bookend of my life, I have the challenge and honor of providing tiny bits of advice and counsel to my friend, the President of the United States, Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aLike President Reagan before him, President Trump is beginning a White House journey with a rocky and tumultuous introduction in the midst of great division, discontent and confusion among a very diverse and conflicted American and foreign constituency. I cannot help but reflect on the parallels of these two administrations as a compass for clarity and direction.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump is not only changing the tapestry of policy but is maneuvering the manner in which it is woven and the threads of its composition. His campaign was unconventional and disruptive, and he is now tackling Washington in an unconventional and disruptive way. It was Reagan who famously responded to a question from a Washington veteran on doing things unconventionally, "Well, isn't that why we are here?"\u000a\u000aThe arrival of President Trump is causing many legacy institutions to feel challenged as they scramble with the change that he is stewarding. The inertia and momentum of the government does not naturally lend itself to new methods of communication, thinking and negotiation.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the stable, recurring patterns of the Washington bureaucracy are designed to be immune from a consistent changing of the deck chairs, and become agitated by the need to acclimate to new circumstances. President Trump is facing the same opposition that President Reagan did almost four decades ago from the fixtures of the Washington and the global geopolitical scene. The bureaucracy is not the enemy but an essential ingredient to our success.\u000a\u000aWithout an unwavering entrenched establishment providing bureaucratic stability, our democratic system would cease to function in the ever-changing winds of temporal political shifts. An entrenched establishment is a safeguard, not a terminal illness. However, the bureaucracy must be amended, adopted, nourished, realigned, incentivized and held accountable. If not, the machinery itself, not the people who run it, become corroded and corrupt. Without constant supervision and monitoring, the bureaucracy will both grow in size and diminish in efficacy.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED On GPS: Can Trump meet his 4% growth goal? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH On GPS: Can Trump meet his 4% growth goal? 01:15\u000a\u000aThe President's policies were clear and distinct in his campaign and continue to be his priorities into his second month of governing: tax policy, job growth, immigration reform, a reworked health care system, a renewed national security alignment, a strengthened military and a re-engineered trade practice and policy. If the President is able to take advantage of an aligned Congress and executive branch to enact even half of these policies within the first year of administration, he will accomplish more than any other president in history.\u000a\u000aThe difficulty and challenge is the implementation of the President's policies into action by the agencies that are built to preserve the status quo and prevent abrupt movement. Aligning the leadership and bureaucracy of the Cabinet agencies with the policy initiatives of the President is a managerial nightmare.\u000a\u000aThe agencies are manned by political Schedule C appointees (individuals who report to presidential appointees), and an army of civil servants working hand in hand. Either group operating in isolation without the other is ineffective and somewhat dangerous. A little more than 30 days since the inauguration, the administration still has 2,000 vacancies, many of which require Senate confirmation, a process which is antagonistically slow and politically charged. These appointees are the nano-engines that will realign the bureaucracy to appropriately adapt to the President's and Congress's direction and practices. Without them, it will be status quo, "for better or worse."\u000a\u000aThe press is not the enemy, the intelligence community is the not the enemy, and even leaks in the new world of instantaneous information and social media are not the enemy. The enemies are time and confused expectations.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump still has to fill nearly 2,000 vacancies Replay More Videos ...

Leaks to the press, death by bureaucratic sabotage and rogue cables from within the State Department are nothing new under the sun; in fact, they are celebrated traditions and were even more demonstrable during the era of the Reagan administration.\u000a\u000aAmerica is a vast tapestry of millions of threads, a multitude of colors and a diverse and distinguished array of fabric. What is truly important to the mastery of the artistry is a process that melds all these diverse elements into an understandable and lucid portrait.\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan is not remembered for the initial confusions as he first began to set the pace. In fact, the first year of the contrarian Reagan revolution was anything but seamless. Reagan is remembered for his effective policies -- tax reform, deregulation, reinvigorating our military, bringing down the Berlin Wall -- accomplishments which were not achieved in his first year and in fact, were the result of a lengthy processes requiring significant time in the saddle, and incredible perseverance in the face of opposition.\u000a\u000aThe bottom line is the debate, the dialogue, the concern, the bickering, the parrying and thrusting all contribute to the process of American democracy.

The art of journalism is now about adding perspective and point of view to widely available facts that were once scarce and only disseminated to mainstream media.

President Trump is a great man, and the most effective action we can take as Americans is to give him a chance.\u000a\u000aWith our help, he will find the same trajectory as that of President Reagan, and the nation and the world will soon look through his abrupt, blunt and esoteric style to find bold substance, compassion, implementation of his policies, global respect and admiration, and a rebalancing of the attributes that truly make America great.

aVPart one Investment\u000a\u000aIslamabad\u2019s Chinatown\u000a\u000aHow Pakistanis view China and the US (Source: Pew Research Center 2015)\u000a\u000aIslamabad, Pakistan -- In a bustling street in Pakistan\u2019s capital the air is thick with the familiar smell of mutton sizzling on charcoal. The plumes of smoke rising into the night sky are illuminated by something once uncommon here -- the blinking red neon of a sign bearing the restaurant\u2019s name in Chinese.\u000a\u000aGulab Khan Shinwari, the owner, stands at its entrance welcoming a steady stream of Chinese customers. \u201cMy restaurant is called Khyber Shinwari but everyone here calls it the CPEC Hotel, since so many Chinese customers have started arriving since the deal was announced.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, popularly known by its acronym of CPEC, has become a buzzword for longed-for economic prosperity in Pakistan. An integral part of China\u2019s One Belt, One Road initiative, the corridor is a combination of projects ranging from road networks, a fiber optic cable project, railway lines, a deep-sea port, coal mines and solar farms that Pakistan views as a huge opportunity to develop its economy.\u000a\u000aMeet the Pakistani kids learning Chinese.\u000a\u000aFollowing the ancient Silk Road that stretches from the Himalayas in Pakistan\u2019s northern border with China all the way down to the Arabian Sea, the corridor was announced with much fanfare in 2015 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad and announced a $46 billion investment plan, roughly 20% of Pakistan\u2019s economic output.\u000a\u000aWith the implementation of these projects and their promised riches, Pakistan has seen the influx of a large expat community, roughly 20,000, according to Mustafa Hyder, chief executive of the Pakistan-China Institute.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a community whose influence is slowly trickling into Pakistan\u2019s daily life.\u000a\u000aIn April, a commercial released by Shan Foods, a Pakistani company that sells spice mixes, showed Pakistani and Chinese neighbors bonding over a shared love for biryani, a popular rice and meat dish. The ad immediately went viral, with more than 59,000 shares on Facebook in the first week of its release.\u000a\u000aThe sleeping dragon has finally awoken\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the ad might not have initially been made with CPEC in mind, there\u2019s no doubt the foreigners Pakistanis interact with most on a daily basis are Chinese. \u201cThey\u2019re our best neighbor,\u201d says Humayun Farooq, marketing general manager for Shan Foods.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this ad has given CPEC a human face then I am glad for that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAcross town, Pakistanis discreetly sip cheap Chinese beer and wolf down dumplings made by Amber Shen, from China\u2019s Anhui province. Shen and other Chinese expats do their shopping from a handful of Chinese grocery stores that have sprung up in Islamabad. Popular American treats, like Chips Ahoy and Skittles, with Chinese packaging and even cans of stewed pork, a meat banned in Pakistan, are all available.\u000a\u000aLast year, a bilingual newspaper called Huashang Weekly launched with a staff of both Chinese and Pakistani journalists. It publishes and distributes 30,000 copies each week to Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi.\u000a\u000aPakistan movie theaters are showing \u201cChalay Thay Saath,\u201d which is about a Chinese man finding his roots in Pakistan.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot of curiosity amongst private Chinese investors about the potential in Pakistani markets, there's just the language barrier that I wanted to erase through Huashang Weekly so these investors can have an understanding of what's happening in Pakistan. These are very interesting times," says Derrick Wang, the paper's publisher who came to Pakistan five years ago.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile in cinemas, one of the latest movies \u201cChalay Thay Saath\u201d (Together We Went), stars a Chinese-Canadian lead actor and is about a Chinese man finding his roots in Pakistan.\u000a\u000aIn Islamabad, a city that has never really had a Chinatown, these developments are unusual. But China\u2019s embrace of Pakistan has risks attached. Analysts say Pakistan will owe China $90 billion if all the planned projects go ahead. But criticisms about Chinese investment aren\u2019t evident on the streets of Islamabad.\u000a\u000aTimes are changing and Pakistan must keep up, says Sabina Zakir, an administrator at the Roots millennium schools, an education system that has introduced compulsory Mandarin lessons for all students starting at age 8 and going all the way up to middle school.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sleeping dragon has finally awoken,\u201d she says about the country\u2019s northern neighbor. \u201cAnd our children, the custodians of our future, must be prepared to deal with this new roaring beast!\u201d

aVIn case you haven't heard, it's not safe to look directly at the sun.\u000a\u000aTo safely view the epic solar eclipse that will cut a dramatic shadow across the United States on August 21, you'll need a special pair of ultra-dark sunglasses. Without glasses, the sun's rays could cause permanent damage to your eyes.\u000a\u000aBut as demand for these glasses has skyrocketed, scams have entered the market.\u000a\u000aThe American Astronomical Society said earlier this week that it updated its safety advice "in response to alarming reports" of unsafe "eclipse viewers" popping up online.\u000a\u000aThe organization says buyers should be skeptical of glasses even if they're stamped with an ISO seal -- which has been used in the past to indicate which glasses comply with standards set by the International Organization for Standardization.\u000a\u000a"It now appears that some companies are printing the ISO logo and certification label on fake eclipse glasses and handheld solar viewers made with materials that do not block enough [light]," AAS said.\u000a\u000aRelated: What you need to know about the eclipse\u000a\u000aSome vendors are even going so far as to put falsified test results on their websites to support their bogus claims, AAS said.\u000a\u000aTo help combat the fraudsters, the organization posted a list of vendors from which you can snag a pair of glasses that are guaranteed to work.\u000a\u000aSome of the places AAS recommends to shop online are EclipseGlasses.com, Celestron, Explore Scientific and Meade Instruments.\u000a\u000aThe organization also has a list of retailers that stock glasses made by verified manufacturers at some (but not all) of their locations. They include 7-Eleven, Best Buy, Lowe's and Walmart.\u000a\u000aMost eclipse viewers are priced at around $2 or $3.\u000a\u000aRelated: Where to see the solar eclipse\u000a\u000aAAS spokesperson Rick Fienberg pointed out that products not included on the list aren't necessarily unsafe -- they just haven't been vetted by AAS experts.\u000a\u000aIf you've already purchased a pair of specs, AAS has a tip for testing them out.\u000a\u000aWhen you put them on, "you shouldn't be able to see anything...except the sun itself," the organizations says.\u000a\u000a"If you can see lights of more ordinary brightness through your eclipse glasses or handheld viewer, and you're not sure the product came from a reputable vendor, it's no good," AAS said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe group also warns against using some eclipse-viewing home remedies -- such as sunglasses or wearing a welding mask.\u000a\u000aOrdinary sunglasses are not up to snuff.\u000a\u000a"Even very dark ones are not safe for looking directly at the sun; they transmit many thousands of times too much sunlight," AAS says.\u000a\u000aThe group recommends only using a welding mask if you're certain of its "shade number," an indication of how dark the mask's tint is. To view the eclipse, you'll need something at a 12, 13 or 14. A shade number of 13 is ideal, AAS says, but those are hard to come by.\u000a\u000aRelated: See the path of the solar eclipse\u000a\u000aMassive crowds are expected at viewing spots across America when the moon passes in front of the sun, blocking its light, the morning of August 21.\u000a\u000aThe 70-mile-wide swath of land where the full spectacle can be seen stretches from Oregon to South Carolina, with 12 states in its path.\u000a\u000aThe last time a total solar eclipse was visible from the continental U.S. was about 40 years ago, on February 26, 1979. And it's been nearly a century since a total solar eclipse was visible coast to coast.

aVDavid M. Drucker is a senior political correspondent for the Washington Examiner and a CNN political analyst. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Just like that, Barack Obama weakened Mitt Romney and solidified his lead in a presidential contest that just a few weeks earlier had threatened to spin out of his control.\u000a\u000aIn a line of attack that has assumed a mythology all its own, Obama early in his third prime time debate with Romney cut down the Republican nominee for something he had written in his 2010 book, "No Apology: The Case for American Greatness."\u000a\u000a"When you were asked, what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said 'Russia.' Not Al-Qaeda; you said Russia," Obama charged . "And, the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because, the Cold War's been over for 20 years."\u000a\u000aEvery debate has a defining moment ; for instance, Ronald Reagan's "there you go again" in his 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter. In 2012's debate on foreign policy, Obama's barb, and Romney's failure to recover, was it. Romney's momentum evaporated in an instant.\u000a\u000aNormally, that would be the end of the story. But then Americans elected Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThe New York Republican's unusual embrace of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, during the campaign and since he entered the White House, has kept Washington's fraught relationship with Moscow on the front burner.\u000a\u000aTrump seems intent in following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Obama, and his Democratic opponent for the presidency, Hillary Clinton. He's instigated his own "Russian reset" despite grave warnings from Republicans in Congress, famously crystalized by Romney, to get tough with Putin.\u000a\u000aIronically, Trump briefly considered nominating Romney for secretary of state. The hire might have signaled a reversal, leading to a Russia policy grounded in the understanding that Moscow continues to aggressively undermine US interests and a first meeting between Trump and Putin at the G-20 in Hamburg, Germany, that addressed that fact.\u000a\u000aInstead, Trump continues to cozy up to Putin and ignore Russia's belligerence, escalated during Obama's second term, dismissing the legitimacy of multiple investigations into Kremlin meddling in the 2016 campaign to boost the Republican over Clinton.\u000a\u000aThe President claims, counter to US intelligence community reports , that it's unclear who did the meddling -- if there was any meddling at all. After all, as Putin told him, if Russia did it, it never would have been detected by American intelligence.\u000a\u000a"Somebody said later to me, which was interesting. Said, let me tell you, if they were involved, you wouldn't have found out about it. Okay, which is a very interesting point," Trump told reporters on July 12, just after news broke that his son, Donald Trump Jr. held a previously undisclosed meeting in June 2016 with Russian individuals that was attended by his campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and top White House advisor.\u000a\u000aAnd so there's a new appreciation for Romney among a previously skeptical political press corps. Some Democrats have even apologized for mocking and ignoring Romney's assertion that Moscow is the biggest geopolitical threat to US interests.\u000a\u000a"Bravo @MaxBoot for calling out Putin lovers in Trump's GOP. We Dems erred in '12 by mocking Boot/Romney Russia worry." Brian Fallon, a Democratic operative (and CNN contributor) who served on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and is a veteran of the Obama Justice Department, offered that concession via Twitter\u000a\u000aSaid Jon Favreau, a former Obama speechwriter a few days later on an episode of "Pod Save America," a podcast he hosts with other Obama alumni: "I'm willing to say that in 2012, when we all scoffed at Mitt for saying that ... Russia was our No. 1 geopolitical foe -- I think we were a little off there."\u000a\u000aWhat Romney camp feared\u000a\u000aThe Romney campaign anticipated plenty of attacks on the former Massachusetts governor heading into the fall general election debates.\u000a\u000aCallous businessman, made millions buying and selling companies, sometimes approving massive layoffs to make them profitable? Check. Flip-flopped on key positions? Check. Twitter uproar over some gaffe or another -- real or deemed so by the media? Check.\u000a\u000aRomney's carefully calibrated -- and consistently held -- position that Russia was an international menace? It didn't even warrant special attention during the governor's intense debate prep session, say Republican operatives who worked on his campaign.\u000a\u000aThe one-term ex-governor and former venture capitalist didn't have a lot of hands-on foreign policy experience, which Obama clearly aimed to exploit. "I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy..." the President said at one point.\u000a\u000aBut Romney had given the matter serious thought -- and never wavered.\u000a\u000aAs was his habit, he had studied the issue. So meticulously crafted was the language he used to frame his foreign policy views about Russia that it wasn't happenstance that he referred to Moscow as the greatest geopolitical "foe" and not greatest geopolitical something else.\u000a\u000aLanhee Chen, Romney's top policy advisor from the 2012 campaign, explained it to me in a telephone interview from Palo Alto, California, where he works as a Hoover Institution fellow and Stanford University professor.\u000a\u000a"Gov. Romney was very careful with his words," he said. "He chose the term 'geopolitical foe' deliberately, because he wanted to differentiate the challenge posed by Russia from other significant national security threats, like radical Islamic terror or North Korea's nuclear weapons program. The phrase 'geopolitical foe' was meant to evoke a game of Chess, where an opponent is trying to counteract or block every move you make. That's what he was trying to convey by characterizing our relationship with Russia in that way."\u000a\u000a"By the time we got to debate prep, he already felt very strongly about this," Chen added.\u000a\u000aBlindsided\u000a\u000aThe Romney campaign was blindsided by the reaction.\u000a\u000aThey entered the spin room that evening on the campus of Lynn University, in Boca Raton, Florida , figuring that Obama's dismissive attitude toward Putin underscored his weakness on national security and provided them an opening.\u000a\u000aIt didn't work out that way, as they soon discovered.\u000a\u000aThe press corps covering the campaign, print, television and otherwise, saw Obama as the winner of the exchange -- the clip played as a sort of endless Romney bloopers loop for days afterward -- and, well, voters tended to agree.\u000a\u000aWhile Romney's team disagreed, they also felt that the issue ultimately wasn't central to the outcome of the race.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aFive years later, the Romney alumni can occasionally be caught enjoying a sense of satisfaction watching Democrats evolve into staunch Russia hawks, which they take as vindication for the candidate and the campaign that they poured so much of their heart and soul into.\u000a\u000aAfter Russia blocked in the United Nations Security Council a US proposal to stiffen sanctions on North Korea, I tweeted , "Imagine that, Russia is not our friend. Who knew?" To which Stuart Stevens, Romney's top political strategist on the 2012 campaign replied : "I know a guy who pointed this out in 2012."\u000a\u000aCorrection: The debate at which Barack Obama challenged Mitt Romney on Russia was the third presidential debate in 2012; an earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed it to an earlier debate.

He had been considered "armed and dangerous."\u000a\u000aAfter a weekend of combing for clues, police located Powell in the basement crawl space of his parent's home in a rural area of Antwerp on Monday around 6 p.m. They attempted to bring him out.\u000a\u000a"However, Powell did not comply with those efforts. Branden Lee Powell chose to take his own life by gunshot at approximately 9:30 pm," said Paulding County Sheriff's Jason Landers in a statement.\u000a\u000aLocal, state and federal authorities, including the FBI and US Marshal Services, had been involved in the search.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) One of the breakout success stories of Kenya's tech ecosystem has been plunged into crisis.\u000a\u000aMapping platform Ushahidi reached global prominence when it was used to monitor the 2016 US election by allowing voters to report irregularities. The technology has been used to track war crimes in Syria and forest fires in Italy. The company has won prestigious prizes and gained heavyweight investors\u000a\u000aBut Ushahidi -- which means "testimony" in Swahili -- has been rocked by damaging allegations of sexual harassment against a senior executive, and fierce criticism of the company's response.\u000a\u000aDirector fired\u000a\u000aOn July 21, Ushahidi announced that Executive Director Daudi Were had been dismissed with immediate effect, following "exhaustive consideration of the testimonies and evidence tabled by the respective parties in a sexual harassment claim."\u000a\u000aWere has not been charged with any crime, the company confirmed. The former director did not respond to a CNN request for comment.\u000a\u000aIn a separate statement , Ushahidi apologized to alleged victim Angela Kabari, a former employee.\u000a\u000a"Sexual harassment is abhorred anywhere, and we are devastated that it happened here at Ushahidi," the statement read. "We are sorry that this happened to you."\u000a\u000aThe statements followed an article by Kabari herself on July 20 that details her experience of harassment by Were at a company retreat in January 2017.\u000a\u000aThe former employee also attacked the company for a slow and "opaque" investigation, accused senior colleagues of seeking to protect Were, and expressed disappointment at a lack of compassion from the company as her health deteriorated following the January incident, which resulted in her eventual departure.\u000a\u000a"In order to begin the healing process within the company, and for the world to begin to regain confidence in Ushahidi, the Board should resign in its entirety," Kabari concluded.\u000a\u000aUshahidi provides a range of mapping services including tracking natural disasters.\u000a\u000aCommunity campaign\u000a\u000aThere is widespread support for Kabari across Kenya's "Silicon Savannah" tech scene, and pressure has been mounting on Ushahidi for months. The company received the original harassment allegation on May 4.\u000a\u000aOn July 11, Ushahidi's former Executive Director Ory Okolloh published a blog criticizing the company's "unacceptable response" and demanding greater transparency around the investigation.\u000a\u000aProminent personalities within the industry have called on donors to stop funding Ushahidi, and a group of Kenyan entrepreneurs demanded a new code of conduct on sexual harassment.\u000a\u000aIf Ushahidi doesn't act, then what? We petition their funders IMO. \u2014 Gatwiri (@RookieKE) July 12, 2017\u000a\u000aNeither Ushahidi's apology nor the removal of Were are likely to resolve an episode that has caused outrage across the tech industry.\u000a\u000a"I don't think it was a real apology and they need to try again," says Clara Wanjiku Odero, a consultant for African startups who also writes about the tech scene, and supports Kabari's call for the board to resign.\u000a\u000a"The simple fact is they will never have the moral authority to run the company," says Odero. "They failed to witness what was happening and to treat it with the seriousness it deserved. They were covering their behinds not taking care of their employee and for that reason I think they should leave."\u000a\u000aSupporters of Kabari are continuing to lobby donors and partners, which may be having an effect.\u000a\u000aThe Institute of Development Studies (IDS), part of the "Making all voices count" consortium with Ushahidi, expressed " deep concern " over the harassment case and said its consortium partners would be "liaising closely with donors regarding this matter."\u000a\u000aUshahidi staff working in their Nairobi offices.\u000a\u000aBouncing back\u000a\u000aUshahidi is hoping to draw a line under this episode and press on with its work.\u000a\u000aFormer Chief Operating Officer Nat Manning has been appointed as interim executive director, and the company will be busy monitoring the upcoming general election in Kenya on August 8.\u000a\u000aThe company rejects calls for the board to resign and stands by its investigation.\u000a\u000a"The Ushahidi board, which is made up of two women and two men, took very seriously its responsibility to guarantee that justice was served," Manning told CNN. "Every personal and professional effort was made to ensure that the parties were treated fairly and that the trauma of the process was minimized. The unequivocal dismissal of Mr. Were indicates that the board has done its job in good faith."\u000a\u000aThe new executive director hopes that the company will soon be generating positive headlines again.\u000a\u000aBut it may be a struggle to restore the shine that has come off one of the Silicon Savannah's brightest stars.

aV(CNN) They became known as "the real 'Fault in Our Stars' couple" and soon became nearly as famous as the couple in the novel and movie.\u000a\u000aKatie Donovan and Dalton Prager -- like Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters, the teenagers in the 2014 film -- fell in love even though they knew the other could die at any time.\u000a\u000aThe real-life couple also shared a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Adding to their drama was the fact that Katie's doctors had directed her not to meet up with Dalton, because he had a highly contagious infection, and if she caught it, her life could be drastically shortened.\u000a\u000aShe defied her doctors and went on a date with Dalton, and two years later, they married when they were both 20.\u000a\u000aKatie did catch Dalton's infection. She died September 22. Dalton died on September 17.\u000a\u000aTheir love story captivated readers.\u000a\u000aBut their story was more than just a touching and tragic tale that went viral on the Internet. Katie and Dalton's story teaches us lessons about love and medicine.\u000a\u000aYou get to make a choice that might hasten your death\u000a\u000aFor the most part, online bystanders were supportive of Katie and Dalton, wishing them well and praying for them after they died. But there were also haters, because of Katie's choice to meet up with Dalton even though he had that infection.\u000a\u000aThe average life expectancy for a cystic fibrosis patient who reaches adulthood is 37, according to the National Library of Medicine . Katie died at 26.\u000a\u000a"There's bullies behind names on the Internet that are like, 'You're so stupid,' " she said.\u000a\u000aLess than a week before she died, Katie sat down for an interview with CNN at her home in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, and said she never regretted meeting up with Dalton.\u000a\u000a"I'd rather have five years of being in love and just really completely happy than 20 years of not having anybody and just having nothing," she said.\u000a\u000aDr. Chris Feudtner, an ethicist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the haters are wrong, and Katie had the right to make a decision that would probably shorten her life.\u000a\u000a"We honor people's ability to make decisions for themselves," he said.\u000a\u000aHe mentioned that his elderly mother, for example, wants to stay alone in her home instead of moving into assisted living, even though living at home increases the chances she could fall and no one would be immediately available to help her. He said his family is still working it out, but his mother might get her wish.\u000a\u000a"We let people make decisions about how they want to live even in the face of pretty substantial risk," he said.\u000a\u000aMedicaid sometimes fails the very sick\u000a\u000aCNN first brought Katie and Dalton's story to light in April 2015 because she was having trouble getting a lung transplant.\u000a\u000aDoctors in her home state of Kentucky were reluctant to give her the transplant. They wanted her to go to a larger program at the University of Pittsburgh that had more experience performing transplants for people with infections.\u000a\u000aKentucky Medicaid had refused to pay for her to have a lung transplant in another state. It agreed after CNN published its story.\u000a\u000aDr. Pam Shaw, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Kansas Medical Center, said Medicaid, which operates independently in each state, often won't pay for care in another state, even when it's clear the patient would be much better off.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, this is quite common," said Shaw, a member of the board of the directors of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\u000a\u000a"Our hospital is 1,000 feet from the Missouri state line, and we won't accept Missouri Medicaid, even though for some medical problems, we have the best services for children," she said. "It just breaks my heart to tell a family 'I can't take care of you because you live in Missouri.' "\u000a\u000aShaw suggested that the government change Medicaid so it's more like Medicare, the insurance program for the elderly that's run by the federal government, not state governments.\u000a\u000a"I know that's pie in the sky, but it would be a lot better for patients, their families and the physicians who care for them," she said.\u000a\u000aIt's a real phenomenon: Spouses often die close together\u000a\u000aKatie and Dalton died just five days apart, and several studies show this isn't unusual. Researchers call it "the widowhood effect."\u000a\u000aStudies have found that an elderly person's chance of dying increases by as much as 90% in the three months after his or her spouse dies, according to a 2008 study by researchers at Harvard and the University of Wisconsin.\u000a\u000aThe physiological reason for this -- what actually is happening inside someone's body -- is pretty much a mystery.\u000a\u000aBroken heart syndrome ," technically called stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is one explanation. It's the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones that can be caused by the loss of a loved one, a divorce, a betrayal or any similar traumatic event.\u000a\u000aBut not all spouses die of this particular problem. The 2008 study found that after losing a spouse, people die within just a few months of all sorts of diseases, including diabetes, infections and cancer.\u000a\u000aPart of it might be practical, said Dr. Eric DeJonge, director of Total Elder Care at Medstar Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Georgetown University Hospital.\u000a\u000a"Elderly couples often become 'co-dependent' on each other for cognitive or physical daily functions," he wrote in an email. "When that support gets knocked out, it can destabilize the survivor."\u000a\u000aDr. Christine Todd, an assistant professor of internal medicine and chairwoman of the department of medical humanities at Southern Illinois University, said she thinks it also has to do with the effect that emotions have on the immune system, especially on someone who's already in fragile health.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Grief plus depression has a very dynamic effect," she said. "Stress hormones and depression affect all your organs; it's enough to shut things down."\u000a\u000aThe tragic end of the Pragers' love story touched millions around the world.\u000a\u000aDalton was doing relatively well after his transplant in November 2014. But just as Katie's health was declining this fall, he caught pneumonia.\u000a\u000aStill, his family hoped he'd beat the infection and get out of the hospital in time to visit Katie at home before she died.\u000a\u000aFamily members never expected he would die before her, and when he did, Katie was "devasted," said her mother, Debra Donovan.\u000a\u000a"She's just in shock," Donovan said the day Dalton died. "And she hasn't felt well today."

aVBelow is an excerpt from forensic pathologist Dr. Judy Melinek 's 2014 memoir "Working Stiff," co-authored by her husband, writer T.J. Mitchell. "Working Stiff: Two Years, 267 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner" is available in bookstores worldwide and online. (The names of victims were changed in the book.)\u000a\u000a(CNN) "Remember: This can only end badly." That's what my husband says anytime I start a story. He's right.\u000a\u000aSo. This carpenter is sitting on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan with his buddies, half a dozen subcontractors in hard hats sipping their coffees before the morning shift gets started.\u000a\u000aThe remains of a hurricane blew over the city the day before, halting construction, but now it's back to business on the office tower they've been building for eight months.\u000a\u000aAs the sun comes up and the traffic din grows, a new noise punctures the hum of taxis and buses: a metallic creak, not immediately menacing.\u000a\u000aThe creak turns into a groan, and somebody yells.\u000a\u000aJudy Melinek\u000a\u000aThe workers can't hear too well over the diesel noise and gusting wind, but they can tell the voice is directed at them. The groan sharpens to a screech. The men look up -- then jump to their feet and sprint off, their coffee flying everywhere. The carpenter chooses the wrong direction.\u000a\u000aWith an earthshaking crash, the derrick of a 383-foot-tall construction crane slams down on James Friarson's head. I arrived at this gruesome scene two hours later with a team of MLIs, medicolegal investigators from the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner.\u000a\u000aThe crane had fallen directly across a busy intersection at rush hour and the police had shut it down, snarling traffic in all directions.\u000a\u000aThe MLI driving the morgue van cursed like a sailor as he inched us the last few blocks to the cordon line. Medicolegal investigators are the medical examiner's first responders, going to the site of an untimely death, examining and documenting everything there, and transporting the body back to the city morgue for autopsy.\u000a\u000aI was starting a monthlong program designed to introduce young doctors to the world of forensic death investigation and had never worked outside a hospital.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED He's collected nearly 13,000 bodies Replay More Videos ...

Yesterday all we had to do was scoop up one little old lady from Beth Israel ER." Today, we get this."\u000a\u000a"Watch your step," a police officer warned when I got out of the van. The steel boom had punched a foot-deep hole in the sidewalk when it came down on Friarson. A hard hat was still there, lying on its side in a pool of blood and brains, coffee and doughnuts.\u000a\u000aI had spent the previous four years training as a hospital pathologist in a fluorescent-lit world of sterile labs and blue scrubs.

I'm a guileless, sunny optimist, in fact. When I first started training in death investigation, my husband, T.J., worried my new job would change the way I looked at the world. He feared that after a few months of hearing about the myriad ways New Yorkers die, the two of us would start looking up nervously for window air conditioners to fall on our heads.\u000a\u000aMaybe we'd steer our toddler son's stroller around sidewalk grates instead of rolling over them. We would, he was sure, never again set foot in murderous Central Park. "You're going to turn me into one of those crazy people who leaves the house wearing a surgical mask and gloves," T.J. declared during a West Nile virus scare.\u000a\u000aInstead, my experience had the opposite effect\u2014it freed us from our six o'clock news phobias.\u000a\u000aOnce I became an eyewitness to death, I found that nearly every unexpected fatality I investigated was either the result of something dangerously mundane, or of something predictably hazardous.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 'This is the only thing to show for his life' Replay More Videos ...

It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Mostly. As I would also learn at the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, undetected anatomical defects do occasionally cause otherwise healthy people to drop dead.\u000a\u000aOne-in-a-million fatal diseases crop up, and New York has eight million people. There are open manholes. Stray bullets. There are crane accidents.\u000a\u000a"I don't understand how you can do it," friends\u2014even fellow physicians\u2014tell me. But all doctors learn to objectify their patients to a certain extent. You have to suppress your emotional responses or you wouldn't be able to do your job. In some ways it's easier for me, because a dead body really is an object, no longer a person at all. More important, that dead body is not my only patient.\u000a\u000aThe survivors are the ones who really matter. I work for them too.\u000a\u000aFrom WORKING STIFF by Judy Melinek and T.J. Mitchell.

aVIt's an idea that intrigues German-born photographer Corinna Kern , who moved into a squatted commercial building for several months in order to document the uncommon lifestyle unfolding behind its walls.\u000a\u000aShe first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who don't own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master's degree.\u000a\u000aThe notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled "A Place Called Home," in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place.\u000a\u000aHaving moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that's both transient and close-knit.\u000a\u000aThrough the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.\u000a\u000a"As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe," she said. "The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project."\u000a\u000aAll the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.\u000a\u000aI came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe. Corinna Kern\u000a\u000aWith housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.\u000a\u000a"What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living," she writes in the text accompanying her images.\u000a\u000a"The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt."\u000a\u000aThe squatters' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aThe Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says.\u000a\u000aBut since it's now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London's disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term.\u000a\u000aWhen squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern's photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric.\u000a\u000aOther images show "The Castle," a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked.\u000a\u000aAnother of Kern's photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood.\u000a\u000aFor her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. "The use of natural light adds to a candid feel," she said, adding to the authenticity of the images.\u000a\u000a"I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home."\u000a\u000aFar from encountering resistance as she ventured into people's intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.\u000a\u000a"My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me," she said.\u000a\u000a"The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs."\u000a\u000aDespite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first.\u000a\u000aFrom her images and her words, it's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience.\u000a\u000a"You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views," she writes. "You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them. You may have to move 10 times a year, but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life, turning it into anything but ordinary."

"It was really tough growing up and getting involved in sports."\u000a\u000aOver time, her vision continued to deteriorate.

aVVal Lauder, a former reporter for the Chicago Daily News and lecturer at the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, is the author of "The Back Page: The Personal Face of History." The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I spent my childhood summers with my maternal grandparents, who had a cottage on one of the lakes outside Ann Arbor, Michigan and a home in town on Packard Street. At the lake, it was lazy summer days. Daily swims, Grandma Mann watching over me. Weekends, Grandpa Mann took me to get rainbow ice cream cones. Mondays, sometimes we went back to town with Grandpa Mann, but always the week the circus came to town.\u000a\u000aThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey announcement of its final performance this May has brought back memories of those circus visits \u2014 mixed nicely with joy and wonder \u2014 wrapped in nostalgia for the form of entertainment that brought pleasure to millions for more than 200 years.\u000a\u000aPresident George Washington was one of the first . He attended a performance of the first circus of its kind in America, the John Ricketts Circus, in Philadelphia, then the nation's capital, April 24, 1793.\u000a\u000aFor the record -- granted, it's not quite as historical -- Grandma Mann and I went in the early and mid 1930s.\u000a\u000aIt felt like the circus came to me. The route to the fairground went down Packard Street, past Grandma and Grandpa's house. I could watch the parade from the big picture window in the parlor or the front porch; it was high enough that I had a perfect view.\u000a\u000aEveryone was intrigued by the grand display of the parade.\u000a\u000a"Gaily painted circus wagons carrying huge tents," said the Ann Arbor News on August 13, 1935, "and others bearing the menagerie of all types of wild animals travelled through the city streets this morning between the Michigan Central railroad and the Packard St. show grounds as the Al G. Barnes Circus arrived for performances this afternoon and tonight."\u000a\u000aRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey owned the Barnes Circus, but it still traveled under its own name. Its posters proclaimed: A REAL RAILROAD CIRCUS ... Travels on 2 Special Trains ... 18 ELEPHANTS, COUNT 'EM. It boasted a menagerie and traveling zoo that included zebras, tigers, lions, camels, leopards, hippos, panthers, bears, hyenas, monkeys, sea lions, "and other creatures."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Life after the circus Replay More Videos ...

Back and forth they paced with nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aBecause Grandpa Mann put a circus poster in his store window, he was given free tickets, and Grandma Mann and I went to the afternoon performance. We walked through the midway of special attractions and food stands, a staple of circuses in those days, and Grandma Mann firmly clutched my hand so she wouldn't lose me. And I, as children do, had to skip to keep up. The smell of popcorn and sawdust was in the air.\u000a\u000aWe stopped at the pink cotton candy stand and watched the man swirling a cardboard cone along the sides of the big copper bowl.

aVWhile home prices in other parts of the country are still 20% below their housing boom peak, demand for large, luxury apartments has helped home prices in Manhattan almost fully recover from the housing bust.\u000a\u000aDuring the first quarter, the median sales price for a condo or co-op in Manhattan rose 18.5% year-over-year to $972,000, according to Douglas Elliman.\u000a\u000aThat's more than four times the median U.S. home price of $205,000. Yet, in most parts of the country $972,000 will typically buy you a sprawling three or four-bedroom with a backyard and a garage. Buyers in Manhattan, however, are willing to shell out that amount for one bedrooms with less than 1,000 square feet of living space.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, prices are expected to continue to climb. Manhattan's home sales are still below the $1.025 million peak set in the second quarter of 2008, said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who calculates the market data for Elliman. But he believes, "we'll probably get there in the second quarter of 2014."\u000a\u000aRelated: Hong Kong buyers send London real estate soaring\u000a\u000aElliman, along with brokers Halstead Property and Corcoran Group, have all reported that sales volume in Manhattan was up 25% or more in the first quarter. And inventory still remains very tight, with homes often being snapped up in bidding wars.\u000a\u000aMiller said 38% of all sales were either at or above asking price and that has caused a big spike in prices.\u000a\u000aAll three brokers reported that they saw high demand in luxury and high-end sales.\u000a\u000aWith little new residential construction happening, there's not enough homes available to handle all of this buyer demand. Only 367 newly built apartments were sold during the quarter. Many were in ultra-luxury buildings catering to an international clientele of Chinese industrialists, Russian oil billionaires and other foreign tycoons.\u000a\u000aAlso boosting prices: Families seeking large apartments of three bedrooms or more, said Diane Ramirez, the CEO of Halstead.\u000a\u000a"Manhattan was often for a segment of your life before you started a family or after you downsized in retirement," she said. "No longer. Now, it's where you want to raise your kids."\u000a\u000aCorcoran reported that 31% of new development closings during the first quarter were for units that had three bedrooms or more.\u000a\u000aRelated: Million dollar housing markets\u000a\u000aManhattan's housing shortage has sent many home seekers further afield to the outer boroughs, New Jersey and Long Island.\u000a\u000aBrooklyn is starting to become even hotter than Manhattan.

aVSimran Jeet Singh is a professor of religion at Trinity University and senior religion fellow for the Sikh Coalition . He also is the Henry R. Luce fellow for religion in international affairs at New York University's Center for Religion and Media . The views expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) On August 5, 2012, a known white supremacist entered a Sikh place of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and opened fire on the congregation. Wade Michael Page's murderous rampage , which ultimately took six innocent lives, was the deadliest attack on Sikh Americans in our nation's history.\u000a\u000aFor minorities, the event served as a reminder that not even our houses of worship are safe from hate -- a notion that has been reinforced throughout history. In 1963, three members of the Ku Klux Klan bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, murdering four young girls and injuring 22 others. In 2015, white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine black Americans during a prayer service in Charleston, South Carolina, in one of America's oldest black churches.\u000a\u000aToday the violent manifestations of white nationalism loom over our country even more ominously. Recent rhetoric from our political leaders has emboldened white supremacists to act on their feelings of prejudice. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, following the election of President Donald Trump, America experienced a sharp spike in hate incidents around the country and a continued growth in the number of far-right hate groups\u000a\u000aRight-wing extremism accounts for a significant share of deadly terrorism, yet it does not receive enough attention from law enforcement. This disconnect between reality and the way our government is addressing threats to our security is even more alarming when you look at the resources being dedicated to combating both foreign and domestic threats.\u000a\u000aAccording to Gordon Adams, a national security budget expert, we spend at least $100 billion annually on counterterrorism efforts , while a report from the Government Accountability Office estimates that the Department of Homeland Security only spent about $50 million last year to counter the growth of violent extremism of all kinds in the United States.\u000a\u000aThese fund allocations are misguided. Yes, we should take seriously the threats from international terror groups, but by failing to devote sufficient resources to combat the equally serious threat of white supremacy, we neglect the danger facing minorities in our own communities. If we treated hate groups with the seriousness and urgency that they deserve, we could potentially prevent the next Dylann Roof or the next Wade Michael Page from extinguishing innocent lives.\u000a\u000aA contributing factor to this problem is our conceptual language -- we tend to reserve the term "terrorist" for people who have an affiliation with Islam. When a significant attack takes place, we all know what authorities mean when they say they are investigating whether or not it was an act of terrorism. In today's parlance, "terrorist" has become racially coded.\u000a\u000aAs a turbaned Sikh American, I can attest that there is a deep sense of discomfort that comes with being constantly perceived as a suspect -- whether it is being racially profiled by airport security or seeing mothers hold their children closer when I walk by.\u000a\u000aIt is difficult for people to look past my turban , beard and brown skin because we have all been conditioned to fear people who look like me. I fit squarely into the stereotype of a terrorist, so it comes as no surprise that people often treat me as the enemy. But if they could look beyond my appearance, they would realize they have no reason to fear me.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThe racial profiling of anyone Muslim or perceived to be Muslim has taken an immense toll on us all. Until we change our conception of what constitutes terror, hate groups will continue to grow and white supremacist extremists will continue to murder innocent Americans. The first step in combating this hate: closing the gap between what facts show as the actual threat and where we focus our attention and resources. Only then can we create a society that is safe for us all.

aV(CNN) Although the details are scarce, President Donald Trump's proposed budget, "America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again" (PDF) , paints a dramatic picture for the American science and medical communities that is facing huge potential budget cuts.\u000a\u000aIf it's been a while since you've had a civics class, the Constitution states that it's Congress that gets to decide how to spend the government's money and how to tax its citizens, so this proposal is not the final word on what goes and what stays. But a President essentially starts the conversation, and for many scientists, it's not a happy topic.\u000a\u000aThe National Institutes of Health budget would be cut by $5.8 billion, meaning it would lose about 20%. The Environmental Protection Agency would face $2.6 billion in cuts, that's 31% of the agency's budget. The Department of Energy would lose $900 million, or about 20% of its budget. Health and Human Services would see a $15.1 billion or 18% budget cut; as part of that, it shifts costs to industry from the Food and Drug Administration budget. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would face an 18% budget cut.\u000a\u000aIt's unclear what would happen to the National Science Foundation . That agency gives out more than $7 billion annually in research grants, accounting for about 20% of federal support to academic institutions for basic research, but didn't get a mention in the budget.\u000a\u000aNASA would see a smaller cut by comparison -- a 0.8% decrease from the 2017 budget -- but its Earth Sciences projects would lose about $200 million, and its Office of Education would be dropped.\u000a\u000aThe budget also would eliminate entire programs, such as $403 million in health professionals and nursing training programs. It would kill the Global Climate Change Initiative (PDF) and eliminate payments to the United Nations' efforts to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aIt also would eliminate the fund that is helping clean up Chesapeake Bay . That program was the largest restoration effort for a body of water in American history and is only halfway through.\u000a\u000aThe budget suggests that states should shoulder those costs.\u000a\u000aThe proposal doesn't give a specific funding figure for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it says it would reform the CDC to give states more control over public health by creating a $500 million block grant that would "increase state flexibility and focus on the leading public health challenges to each state." Experts say that could suggest that states would get the funding, as opposed to the federal agency.\u000a\u000aTrump's budget proposal spells out a plan to create a Federal Emergency Response Fund for a rapid response to public health threats like Zika. There's a $20 million increase for the mitigation of lead-based paint in low-income homes, although the budget eliminates the LIHEAP program , which provides heating and cooling assistance to homes in those same communities.\u000a\u000aThe proposal includes $500 million to expand opioid abuse prevention and treatment efforts, $900 million for the Department of the Interior's US Geological Survey to "focus investments in essential science programs" and a billion for water management efforts. There's a $4.4 billion request for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a 6% increase from its current funding. There's also a mention of an investment in "mental health activities" but no specifics.\u000a\u000aThe budget would include some money for international health efforts with a promise to support Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , which works to increase access all over the world. There's also funding for the fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS.\u000a\u000aCongress can accept or reject Trump's budget, and lawmakers have the ability to pick and choose what they like from it.\u000a\u000aAs far as budgets go, Trump's has been compared to President Ronald Reagan's in its conservatism, but Reagan's had a little more "carrot with its stick; this is all stick," budget expert David Wessel said.\u000a\u000aAnd this proposal is a little unusual.\u000a\u000a"It's an interesting first chapter, but I'm disappointed we don't have the rest of it," said Wessel , who is a senior fellow of economic studies with the independent Brookings Institution. The document doesn't come with the usual pages and pages of tables that Congress will use in its conversation on enacting the budget; that part is only 62 pages (PDF). Without detail on taxes and other plans, it's hard to know how the proposed budget would work. "This is more like a bumper sticker than a budget."\u000a\u000aWessel believes the proposal will have a hard time getting through Congress as it stands now because it cuts programs many constituents depend on and programs Congress has increased, like its effort to increase the National Institutes of Health budget last year.\u000a\u000aScience and medical professionals watching the Trump budget process closely had predicted that it could be a tough pill to swallow, but they said they didn't know it would be this hard.\u000a\u000a"I read it a few times again this morning and had to take a few pauses -- to bang my head on the table," said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy with the Union of Concerned Scientists.\u000a\u000a"As scientists, we make decisions based on evidence. What this budget does is ignore evidence and undermine our very ability to collect it across the board," he said.\u000a\u000aRosenberg disagrees with shifting the responsibility to do scientific research. States don't have the capacity, he said, and industry doesn't have the interest or financial incentive to do basic and even some of the applied research the government does. He thinks the proposed budget could hurt the government's mission as an international leader in science.\u000a\u000a"You are telling young, really talented scientists, scientists we need, that you shouldn't go into government, and you are signaling to the senior scientists who have the good experience and knowledge, we need to leave," Rosenberg said. "It sends a really chilling signal across the federal government, and while the public doesn't see a lot of what people in government do, they are doing public service that helps them and has a real impact on their lives."\u000a\u000aSeveral scientific and medical associations also criticized the budget. The American Chemical Society wrote that it "finds these potential cuts extremely concerning because robust, sustained and predictable investments in non-defense research have proven to be critical to the nation's innovation infrastructure, job creation and economic growth."\u000a\u000aThe Alliance for a Stronger FDA appreciated that the proposal "recognizes that FDA's process for reviewing medical products needs resources at least as great as the current level of funding." However, it suggested that the funding mechanism of cutting more than a third of the agency's appropriation and offsetting it with medical product industry user fees "is neither wise nor realistic."\u000a\u000aThe American Medical Association "has grave concerns with proposed deep cuts to the NIH and their impact on patient health. Patients across the country who benefit from NIH research and advancements can attest to its value," said Dr. Andrew W. Gurman, president of the association, in a statement. "NIH conducts vital research into cancer, chronic diseases, and other illnesses, all of which are major drivers of health care costs."\u000a\u000a"The proposed reduction in NIH funding of $5.8 billion would represent a significant setback for millions of American cancer patients, survivors and their families. It would also dramatically constrain the prospect for breakthrough American medical innovation -- an essential American economic driver," said a statement from Chris Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network. "We are at the cusp of tremendous breakthroughs in cancer research, making it exactly the wrong moment to turn back the clock on progress against a disease that continues to kill more than 1,650 people a day in this country."\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, this budget proposal fails to make those investments (in biomedical and health services research) and would make America less great by undermining our commitment to science, medical and health services research, medical education, and research on climate change," a statement from the American College of Physicians said.\u000a\u000aAmerica's Essential Hospitals, one of the professional associations that represents health systems and hospitals, was also critical. "The cumulative effect of this budget and the (GOP health care bill) could be to undermine the ability of essential hospitals to meet their commitment to patients and communities and weaken efforts to respond to existing and emerging threats to the public health," the statement said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aSome federal agencies sent out releases expressing support of the plan. "HHS is dedicated to fulfilling our department's mission to improve the health and well-being of the American people," a statement from Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price said.

aVToday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, spoke to CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger in an exclusive interview about the events shaping current domestic and global politics including the Israeli election, the Iran nuclear talks, the terror threats throughout the Middle East, and the nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General.\u000a\u000aTEXT HIGHLIGHTS\u000a\u000aMcCain on President Obama\u2019s reaction to the Israeli election: \u201cthere was a free and fair democratic election, the only nation in the region that will have such a thing. The president should get over it. Get over your temper tantrum, Mr. President. It's time that we work together with our Israeli friends and try to stem this tide of ISIS and Iranian movement throughout the region, which is threatening the very fabric of the region. The least of your problems is what Bibi Netanyahu said during an election campaign. If every politician were held to everything they say in a political campaign, obviously, that would be a topic of long discussion. But the point is, is the J.V., as the president described them, is just moving over into Yemen. We see this horrible situation in Libya. We see ISIS everywhere in the world. We see the Iranians now backing the Shia militias in Tikrit, where they're going to - where they're going to massacre a number of Sunnis. And it is - the guy in charge is a guy named Suleimani, who - who imported - excuse me - I will catch up here - Suleimani moved thousands of copper-tipped IEDs into Iraq and killed hundreds of American soldiers and Marines. And the president of the United States is praising the mullahs and their behavior in the region.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain on President Obama\u2019s message to the Iranian people: \u201cI wish he had spoken to the people of Iran in 2009, when they rose up against a corrupt election and he refused to speak out on their behalf while they were chanting \u2018Obama, Obama, are you with us or are you with them?\u2019 Again, does anyone - does he believe that anyone in Iran is able to speak up? Are they able to speak up for anything that the mullahs disagree with? They're either jailed or killed. Again, this is a view, a world view the president has which is totally divorced from reality.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain on Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination and the issue of race: \u201cMy response is that you can't erase history. These same Democrats led by Senator Durbin filibustered Janice Rogers Brown, the first African-American to the seat on that court - on that court. They filibustered Miguel Estrada. This has nothing to do with race. It has everything to do with trying to get legislation through which would prevent - or help prevent this horrible issue of sexual trafficking that is going on. And also I will add to that, I will not vote for her because she has said she would uphold the president's unconstitutional executive orders concerning immigration.\u201d\u000a\u000aTRANSCRIPT FULL POST

The veterinarian told his owners, Gary Walters and Amanda Giese, that they had two options: euthanize Duncan or remove his legs.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe got out of the amputation surgery and 30 minutes later, he was up walking around,\u201d Walters recalls. \u201cWe let him heal and strapped him to a wheelchair but he looked at us like we were crazy.

aV(CNN) Threats, bribes and stuffed ballot boxes may sound like a political drama, but these are all real issues that Africans face during national elections, a public opinion study has revealed.\u000a\u000aThe results, published by pan-African research institute Afrobarometer paint a dire picture of trust in the democratic process on the continent, where less than half (44%) of people across the 36 countries surveyed say they trust their national electoral commission only somewhat or a lot.\u000a\u000aPeople in countries with upcoming elections, or who have had elections recently, expressed some of the lowest levels of trust, says lead author Peter Penar, a researcher and lecturer in political science at Michigan State University.\u000a\u000a'Alarming numbers'\u000a\u000aTake Gabon for example, which has seen post election protests and unrest this month after opposition leader Jean Ping lost by less than 6,000 votes.\u000a\u000aThere, 51% have no trust at all in their election commission, and a mere 25% say they trust them a lot or somewhat.\u000a\u000a"Those are all very alarming numbers and, it shows an extreme lack of confidence," Penar says.\u000a\u000aThe survey was based on face-to-face interviews with between 1,200 and 2,400 people in each of the 36 countries.\u000a\u000aWhile individuals' responses are not published, the researchers have identified a number of key factors contributing to the lack of trust.\u000a\u000aA checkered history\u000a\u000aA history of vote manipulation entrenched in people's memories, lack of transparency of election monitoring bodies and corruption all influence people's trust in the system and many are afraid when casting their vote, the researchers found.\u000a\u000aBut what worries people the most is the counting of votes, Penar says, with 38% of Africans believing votes are only sometimes, or even never counted.\u000a\u000aVote counts can be tampered with in many ways, according to Penar.\u000a\u000a"[This happens] at the polling stations. Stuffing ballots, double voting, multiple voting."\u000a\u000aMethods for swaying voters may also include threats, actual violence and bribery.\u000a\u000aHow much for your vote?\u000a\u000aBribery is commonplace in some countries, the study showed.\u000a\u000aThe practice is illegal, and so rather than asking people whether they have accepted bribes, researchers posed the more indirect question of how often people in the country face bribery around election time.\u000a\u000aOn average, 43% of Africans said people are often or always bribed, with nearly 70% saying voters were bribed at least sometimes.\u000a\u000aSome countries returned startlingly high numbers. In Mali, 78% of people said voters were often or always bribed, and in Senegal the figure was 68%.\u000a\u000aThe bribes may range from giving a little money at the polling stations to being offered seeds or medicines during campaigns, Penar says.\u000a\u000aThreats of violence at the polls\u000a\u000aVoter intimidation is also key, the researchers found, with 44% of those surveyed saying they are sometimes, often or always threatened with violence when voting.\u000a\u000a"That's incredibly high," says Penar.\u000a\u000a"This makes people afraid of going to the polls and expressing an autonomous and personal choice of who they want to win."\u000a\u000aSurprising findings\u000a\u000aAmong the most surprising findings, according to Penar, was the lack of trust in Ghana, which goes to the polls in December this year.\u000a\u000a"We think of Ghana as a country that's really improved in terms of electoral competition and having alternation of power."\u000a\u000aStill, 37% of Ghanaians say they don't trust the national electoral commission at all.\u000a\u000aThe picture looks different across the Atlantic. A 2016 Pew study showed that 78% of US citizens are confident, or very confident, that their vote will be counted fairly in the upcoming election.\u000a\u000aIn Africa, the Afrobarometer study showed that an average 54% across the 36 countries believe that, votes are often or always counted fairly in their country.\u000a\u000aCan digital save the day?\u000a\u000aNew digital tools such as using fingerprints and digital imaging to identify voters is changing the way elections are run in Africa, which may improve the process in the future.\u000a\u000aSouth African voters having their ID checked digitally at a polling station\u000a\u000aIn Namibia, a new system appears to have boosted voters' trust, Penar says.\u000a\u000a"Namibia has invested in an electronic voting system. Interestingly one of the best countries in terms of trust in their election commission is Namibia, at 74%."\u000a\u000aBut while new digital tools can make it harder to tamper with votes, they can also create problems as they require electricity and technical know-how at the polling stations, something not to be taken for granted in rural areas, Penar adds.\u000a\u000aAnd while election processes could be improved by storing and counting votes digitally, issues with corruption may remain.\u000a\u000a"The servers on which the results data is stored may be owned by a friend of the president or a relative of an election commission. That happens."

aVStory highlights Venezuela attorney general: Probe needed after allegations of inflated voting numbers\u000a\u000aNew body set to take place of smaller opposition-led National Assembly\u000a\u000aCaracas, Venezuela (CNN) Venezuela's attorney general has initiated an investigation into potential voter fraud in Sunday's election following allegations the government may have inflated voter numbers significantly.\u000a\u000aLuisa Ortega Diaz, in an interview Wednesday to CNN en Español, said she has appointed two prosecutors to investigate the directors of the National Electoral Council "for this very scandalous act that could generate more violence in the country than what we have already experienced."\u000a\u000aVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro called for last weekend's vote, which led to the creation of a controversial new legislative body, the National Constituent Assembly. The body takes the place of the opposition-led National Assembly in a move that critics fear will erode democracy.\u000a\u000aLondon-based Smartmatic, which provided the voting technology for the controversial vote, said Wednesday that the National Electoral Council voting numbers of more than 8 million people -- about 41.53% of registered voters -- are off by 1 million votes.\u000a\u000aThe opposition had boycotted the election, calling it fraudulent, and said the National Constituent Assembly will have the power to rewrite the Venezuelan Constitution.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Some people love the taste, and some hate it. But there is no debate that coconut water has boomed in popularity over the past decade.\u000a\u000aCoconut water is a liquid that is drained from the center of coconuts and then packaged and sold in stores. Some companies add fruit juice or coffee to it.\u000a\u000aSo what is the truth about this trendy beverage, often marketed for its hydrating benefits and praised as a hangover cure?\u000a\u000aLet's take a look at what the experts had to say.\u000a\u000aIs it more hydrating than water or a sports drink?\u000a\u000aThe research says no. Two studies showed that coconut water on its own provided a minimal difference in hydration in humans, compared with water and sports drinks.\u000a\u000aLisa Drayer, a registered dietitian, agrees with the research. But she said it's important to consider that the first study was funded by VitaCoco, a coconut water brand, so it was in the best interest of the company.\u000a\u000aAlso, although this study showed that some participants experienced bloating and an upset stomach from the beverage, the other study's participants did not have these side effects. If there are negative effects, it's probably on an individual basis, Drayer said.\u000a\u000a"My advice would be to try coconut water before you use it for exercise," she said.\u000a\u000aIn terms of helping with hangovers, Drayer said, there is no valuable research that suggests it is any more beneficial than drinking water.\u000a\u000aDoes it have benefits during pregnancy?\u000a\u000aSome websites tout the advantages of drinking coconut water while pregnant. If you're a rat , it might help protect you against high-fat-diet-induced changes, one study says. But if you're a pregnant human, you probably shouldn't use it as a replacement for other foods, Drayer said.\u000a\u000a"When I look at the nutritional profile for coconut water, it basically has no iron, no protein, hardly any calcium, no omega-3s because it's fat-free, and no folic acid," she said. "It's not a good source of important pregnancy nutrients."\u000a\u000aIt's important for pregnant women to stay hydrated, Drayer said, so if coconut water is going to help them get more fluids, she would recommend it.\u000a\u000aAlthough coconut water doesn't yield a lot of calcium, eating an entire raw coconut could provide a good amount of the nutrient. But it's still no comparison to a cup of milk, which has six times as much calcium as a whole coconut and more protein, she said.\u000a\u000aWhat about weight loss?\u000a\u000a"I don't think there's anything special about coconut water that will help boost your metabolism. If you're dehydrated, that might slow your metabolism," Drayer said. "I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for weight loss. In fact, it has more calories than water."\u000a\u000aCoconut waters typically have 5 to 7 calories and 1 gram of sugar per ounce. A lot of people who are watching their weight may not want to drink their calories, Drayer said. But for those who are exercising and feel like they can afford the calories, it shouldn't be an issue.\u000a\u000aThere has been some talk on the Internet that drinking coconut water on an empty stomach in the morning can stimulate metabolism, as well as boost immunity and reduce bad cholesterol. Jason Ewoldt, registered dietitian and wellness dietitian at the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program, said the research would not support this.\u000a\u000a"It seems like there's always some new breaking thing that you have to eat in the morning on an empty stomach to help with weight loss or energy or what have you," Ewoldt said. "There's nothing special about coconut water. It's essentially water with some electrolytes, which you could do in the morning by drinking a glass of water and having a banana."\u000a\u000aPotassium benefits\u000a\u000aPotassium is a mineral that plays a key role in maintaining the body's heartbeat, muscle contractions, cholesterol and nerve impulses. Coconut water has more potassium than a medium banana.\u000a\u000a"When I look at coconut water, the biggest benefit is coming from the fact that it's a high or nice source of potassium," Ewoldt said. "But we can do the same thing by eating foods that have a high source of potassium, like potatoes or kidney beans or spinach. It would be a heck of a lot cheaper, and ultimately, we'd be getting a lot more nutrition that just with potassium."\u000a\u000aIf you want to kill two birds with one stone nutritionally, coconut water is probably not the way to go.\u000a\u000aWhat about coconut oil and coconut milk?\u000a\u000aCoconut oil had a healthy image among "foodies" for a while, often as a central cooking ingredient. A recent report by the American Heart Association shut this down, stating that coconut oil has a higher percentage of saturated fat than butter, palm oil and lard. It referenced multiple studies finding that the oil increases LDL -- also known as "bad" cholesterol -- which causes heart disease.\u000a\u000aEwoldt agrees with the association's conclusion and is unsure why some consider coconut oil to be a health food, he said. But he doesn't think extreme caution needs to be taken. It can be eaten in moderation as an addition to a healthy diet, he said. "Should we be eating it thinking it's healthy? No."\u000a\u000aPeople are better off eating foods with unsaturated fats, like avocados and olive oil, he said. Unsaturated fats have been shown to have cardiovascular protective effects.\u000a\u000aCoconut milk is also higher in saturated fat and calories, he said. It has much less potassium than coconut water and very little fiber. However, it makes a nice substitution for people who are lactose intolerant, he said.\u000a\u000aThe verdict on coconut water\u000a\u000aDrayer said coconut water has hydrating benefits, but she saw nothing special about it nutritionally, compared with whole foods.\u000a\u000a"It can help to hydrate you and make sure you're meeting your fluid needs," Drayer said. "But I don't think there's anything magical about it. I don't think there's anything that you wouldn't find in whole foods that it contains. And the studies that link it to various health claims certainly haven't been rigorous enough."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aEwoldt warned against any assumptions that coconut water may have special health properties, especially if it's leading to heavy spending.\u000a\u000a"Overall, I would say if you're looking for a different beverage to help with hydration, coconut water can be that beverage. Is it better than drinking water or eating fruits and vegetables? Absolutely not," he said. "If you're aware of the amount you're drinking coconut water and you're having a healthy balanced diet, it can be an addition to a diet as anything can. But if you're looking at it from the point of 'it's a magical elixir,' you're spending a lot of money on something that's doing very little."

aV(CNN) Huang Xuejing broke away from the kingdom he once called home six years ago. At just 130 centimeters -- a little over 4 feet -- Huang's height permitted him entry into the kingdom in 2009.\u000a\u000aHis physical growth was limited when he injured his spine in a fall at age 8. Having been warned that surgery to restart his growth could lead to paralysis, his family chose to not take the risk.\u000a\u000aAfter studying graphic design at a school for the disabled in China, Huang found his talents to be of use in the Kingdom of the Little People, a small theme park where about 100 people of short stature, including some with dwarfism, live and perform dances and songs for tourists each day.\u000a\u000aThe maximum height for workers there is 130 centimeters, meaning Huang just made the cut. He soon found himself working behind the scenes as a manager.\u000a\u000aBut life wasn't quite what he had been promised.\u000a\u000aExploring the kingdom\u000a\u000aAn hour's drive east of the city of Kunming in southwest China, the park has been branded a disgrace by some overseas, stoking debate about the treatment of people with disabilities in China.\u000a\u000aThe US-based dwarfism support group Little People of America highlight that opinions vary about whether dwarfism/short stature is actually a disability and believe the kingdom was comparable to a zoo.\u000a\u000aThe kingdom is billed as a tourist attraction, by its owner, real estate mogul Chen Mingjing. Now, seven years after opening its doors, the kingdom remains open, but few tourists seem to be buying into the fairy tale. Just 15 customers, mainly families with young children, could be counted on one recent day, most of them Chinese.\u000a\u000aAfter paying the 100 yuan ($15) entry fee, customers sit in front of the main stage to watch the morning performances. On this day, 30 performers in pink and red coats dance while a "king" character, complete with a cloak and crown, swans around regally. Shortly afterward, an all-female dance team performed a Bollywood-style routine.\u000a\u000aThe tone is cute and quirky, with a karaoke feel to the songs sung between dance routines. Another regular performance involves male dancers dressed in female ballerina outfits and pirouetting to "Swan Lake" music.\u000a\u000aIt's like any other show performed in jest, but with a much shorter cast.\u000a\u000aLife in -- and out of -- the kingdom\u000a\u000aHuang joined the work force in the theme park after having been enticed by its owner, Chen, who was impressed by Huang's abilities and sold him his dream for the kingdom, Huang said.\u000a\u000a"He was very keen and sincere," Huang said in his small but impeccably tidy studio apartment in central Kunming. "He explained that he wanted to make the kingdom the biggest in the world."\u000a\u000aHuang Xuejing, in the red jacket, used to work in the kingdom as a manager but left six years ago to work as a freelance performer in Kunming.\u000a\u000aChen explained to Huang that managing a team of people with height impediments would be best by someone who understands their perspective.\u000a\u000a"That was why he wanted me," said Huang, who in turn felt that a job helping people like himself might be more meaningful.h\u000a\u000aThe kingdom provides accommodation for staffers, who live in a cluster of dormitory blocks a short walk from the performance area. Many workers move there straight after leaving school, as managers regularly advertise jobs in schools for disabled people in Kunming and find them as students, like Huang.\u000a\u000aThe workers sleep on bunk beds in shared rooms cluttered with clothes, stuffed animals and phone chargers. A strong constitution is required to visit the separate toilet building, and the roof of one of the blocks serves as a dining area where the staffers prepare and eat communal meals. It's rustic but liveable.f\u000a\u000aBut after 3½ years, Huang chose to set out and work as a freelance performer in Kunming. He wanted to earn more and found life in the kingdom too isolated, despite regular travel to Kunming, his hometown.\u000a\u000a"I prefer more lively places; it was too far traveling between the kingdom and city," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang said he largely enjoyed the experience, despite initially being concerned that the shows his colleagues performed were demeaning. "Gradually, I began to feel that it's not a bad thing for (short people) to have a place to work, a career to look forward to and an environment to stay together."\u000a\u000aHe felt comfortable knowing that everyone else was the same. "They were all together; they didn't have pressure (of interacting in mainstream society)," he said.\u000a\u000aBut he wanted more.\u000a\u000aThese days, "I host, sing rock music in bars and attend launch ceremonies and weddings," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang earns 5,000 to 20,000 yuan ($740 to $3,000) a month. He didn't want to reveal how much he earned inside the kingdom but said his current salary was "a lot more."\u000a\u000aEarning a (good) living\u000a\u000a"People like us have to save for the future," said Yang Qianjun, a former colleague of Huang's at the Kingdom of the Little People who also ventured out in search of more lucrative employment.\u000a\u000aYang, 30, is 125 centimeters (about 4 feet) tall and worked in the kingdom as a performer until he left four years ago.\u000a\u000aHe says he was initially paid 800 yuan ($120) a month at the kingdom, later rising to 1,200 yuan ($180) with deductions for food. "It wasn't enough," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen asked whether the wages and location made the kingdom hard to leave, Yang was quick to reply: "Yes. Indeed." He then explained that most of his colleagues still inside were struggling. "Money would be spent the day it was given to us, on daily essentials. We couldn't save anything."\u000a\u000aYang Qianjun used to work as a performer in the kingdom but left to become a restaurant host in the city of Kunming.\u000a\u000aCharismatic and talkative, Yang now works as a host in Kunming at a Cultural Revolution-themed eatery plastered with Mao Zedong imagery and staffed by waiters in soldier uniforms.\u000a\u000aHe earns about 3,000 yuan ($440) a month and says he rarely is discriminated against for his height -- something he had feared while in the safety net of the park. "People around here are really nice," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang also said he seldom faces discrimination in public life, and on the rare occasions he does, he simply brushes it off. "Sometimes people watch me, but never adults, only kids," he said, adding that the attention never gets more serious than children whispering about him.\u000a\u000aHiding away in the kingdom\u000a\u000aBut in China, especially in rural areas, attitudes about disabled people bringing "shame" to families can often persist.\u000a\u000aSome workers still living and performing in the kingdom said they'd had more negative experiences in public.\u000a\u000a"In the outside world, people look at me differently, like I'm some kind of monster," said singer Li Jia, who has worked in the park for six years and has no plans to leave.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes, when I walked alone on streets, it made me uncomfortable and embarrassed when people stare at me," he said while refueling with a bowl of noodles before his next performance.\u000a\u000aNeither he nor his colleagues was eager to discuss in detail the discrimination they had been subject to, but they revealed glimpses.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I got pointed and laughed at by kids. I didn't like it," said Lin Zheng Xio, 24, another performer who specializes in singing. He says the struggle for people considered disabled, such as himself, to get work is all too real.\u000a\u000aLi Juan, a dancer who is also 24, added, "People would say, 'Why are you so short?' and would call me dwarf."\u000a\u000aLi Jia explained that he saw the kingdom as a safe haven. "I chose to come here because everyone here is the same. I feel like it's a big family," he said. He believes there is a future for him in the park.\u000a\u000a"Some people find love here and get married. We have two married couples, each with two children, plus four or five couples. I met my girlfriend here," he said.\u000a\u000aIn 2006, the China Disabled Persons' Federation estimated the number of people with disabilities in the country to be 83 million, a number including anyone who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and who has lost -- wholly or in part -- the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal, according to the International Labor Organization.\u000a\u000aAn opportunity for some?\u000a\u000aChinese legislation requires that all public and private employers reserve at least 1.5% of their job opportunities for people with disabilities. However, according to Cindy Zhang, an employment lawyer with Shanghai's Conshine Law Firm, companies often choose to pay fines for not hitting the target instead.\u000a\u000aIt is often difficult to get cases regarding disability discrimination in the workplace to court, she said, and even if cases are successful, compensation payouts are low. Zhang said many lawyers in China advise against pursuing them at all.\u000a\u000a"A lot of factories don't want us because we're not able to finish assignments that 'normal' people can finish," Li Jia said, adding that the park is a draw for those without many qualifications. Many of those who work in the park are from poor backgrounds. "A lot of us can't get office jobs because we don't have enough education."\u000a\u000aThe Cultural Revolution-themed restaurant where Yang Qianjun works.\u000a\u000aFor those who do manage to get jobs outside the park, problems remain. "When I worked in a noodle restaurant with taller people before, they wouldn't let me do some of the work because they didn't think I'd be able to," said Li Bao Xing, 46, a cleaner working in the kingdom.\u000a\u000aAll the staffers interviewed at the kingdom said they were generally happy to work there.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I feel it sometimes, but work is work," Li Jia said with a shrug when asked whether tourists treated his shows like a joke.\u000a\u000aLi Juan, who had little experience performing before joining the kingdom, said she found strength in numbers. "At first, I wasn't used to it, but gradually, I got used to it. After all, there is a group of us here."\u000a\u000aHuang's assessment is that his kingdom experience was worthwhile, if not quite the life-changing revelation Chen promised. "During the years I was there, it was not bad: not too fast nor slow," he said nonchalantly. "Working there was fine."\u000a\u000aThough content with her current life in the kingdom, Li Juan hopes to one day emulate Huang and leave, as she dreams of working in a shadow puppet theater. For now, however, she is not ready to venture into the unknown or leave the security of the park.\u000a\u000a"I wasn't feeling secure before. That's why I found a job with colleagues who are the same as me," she said. "We respect and care for each other."

aV(CNN) Horse racing and K-pop might not be traditional bedfellows but, then again, you don't often see an equine theme park in the center of a racecourse.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea is doing things differently and, one hundred years on from its first authorized thoroughbred race, the nation hopes to become a major player in the sport.\u000a\u000aA two-way process of "internationalization" is underway, with leading foreign jockeys and trainers employed domestically and Korean runners beginning to attend major race meetings overseas.\u000a\u000aWhat started with small, unstandardized pony races has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.\u000a\u000aThe grand plan\u000a\u000a"Right now thoroughbred racing is very popular," says Yang Tae Park, executive director of the Korea Racing Authority\u000a\u000a"If our process of internationalization succeeds, we can change the perception of horse racing from not just a means of gambling, but a sport."\u000a\u000aWith a new quarantine protocol, the Korea Racing Authority (KRA) plans to stage some of the biggest events on the horse racing calendar within five years.\u000a\u000aA long-term plan has been put in place to ensure the incremental development of both the Korea Cup and Korea Sprint, from International Grade Three races to Grade One.\u000a\u000aThe Korea Sprint and Cup are currently worth KRW 1 billion ($890k) and KRW 0.7 billion ($623K) respectively.\u000a\u000aBy April 2022, to mark the centenary of South Korean thoroughbred racing, their value is set to increase threefold to KRW 3 billion ($2.7m) and KRW 2 billion ($1.8m).\u000a\u000a'Well ahead of football'\u000a\u000aAs a former insurance worker who fell in love with Korean horse racing, started a website , became a race caller, and eventually a member of the Korea Racing Authority, Englishman Alastair Middleton brings a unique perspective.\u000a\u000a"In terms of attendance, horse racing is right up there with baseball and well ahead of the domestic football league," he says.\u000a\u000a"Internationalization is so important but also so challenging, because it is really difficult to measure progress or success.\u000a\u000a"It's more qualitative than quantitative but in the time I've been following Korean racing, I've seen significant development and yes, I would say the foreign influence has played a major part."\u000a\u000a'The world's top horses'\u000a\u000aThe KRA visited the United States for the Pan America Racing Conference this May.\u000a\u000aNo US-trained horse has ever raced in South Korea, but officials are confident such a breakthrough is imminent \u2014 approaching several trainers with a view to entering September's Korean Cup.\u000a\u000a"We are inviting high-quality horses from overseas so Korean-bred horses can compete with foreign horses," says Tae Park, contending the move will raise standards.\u000a\u000aThe infrastructure and interest are certainly there.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's three main venues \u2014 situated in the Seoul suburb of Gwacheon, Busan and Jeju \u2014 have seen total annual attendances exceed 15 million in recent years.\u000a\u000aTwo decades on from hosting equestrian events at the 1988 Olympics, LetsRun Park Seoul features towering grandstands, called Happy Ville and Lucky Ville, capable of accommodating 77,000 people.\u000a\u000aAccording to Tae Park, the domestic industry already boasts an annual turnover 6.4 billion dollars \u2014 the seventh largest in the world -- and it's only going to get bigger.\u000a\u000a"Right now, the racing surface is sand and that is off-putting to many of the world's top horses," says Middleton.

Many media outlets carried news of his victory."\u000a\u000aTriple Nine, another South Korean runner, was second behind Hunting Ground in the 2000-meter handicap earlier in the night.\u000a\u000aThis, Tae Park contends, is just a sign of things to come.\u000a\u000aBy the year 2019, the KRA claims it will send its horses to all-weather track races in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aBy 2022, Tae Park foresees Korean runners competing in the best EU turf races and best dirt track races in the States.\u000a\u000aMiddleton admits Korea is starting from "a long way behind the leading countries" but says significant progress is already being made and compares the influence of international runners to that of stars in baseball and football.\u000a\u000a"Korean sports fans love seeing the likes of [LA Dodgers pitcher] Ryu Hyun-jin and [Tottenham Hotspur footballer] Son Heung-min performing well in overseas leagues," says Middleton. "Hopefully they will start to follow Korean horses too."\u000a\u000aWhinny World\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, the KRA is striving to reach new demographics in South Korea.\u000a\u000aIf race days have traditionally enticed an older, male audience -- with many regarding the sport as a medium for betting -- the KRA is "endeavoring to attract young people and ladies."\u000a\u000aTo that end, a horse theme park, situated in the center of the Seoul Racecourse, opened its doors in September 2016 -- playing host to a number of K-pop acts, including girl group I.O.I.\u000a\u000aThe attraction, named Whinny World, claims to offer guests an "interactive and inspirational experience," educating young families about Korea's horse racing tradition.\u000a\u000aWith pony riding, racing simulation machines and ice rinks in winter, there's hope it can persuade people who wouldn't ordinarily consider visiting the racecourse to attend.\u000a\u000a"Right now horse racing has a bad perception among some Korean people," says Tae park.

aVStory highlights Orlando mass killing fits grim pattern of homegrown terrorism, writes Peter Bergen\u000a\u000aSince 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes\u000a\u000aPeter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book "United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists."\u000a\u000a(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.\u000a\u000aBecause 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.\u000a\u000aBut Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aIn fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.\u000a\u000aIn other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) He is the undoubted superstar of athletics, a man who has transcended his sport and will be remembered as a great. But eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt has warned that one individual cannot save his sport once he has retired.\u000a\u000aBolt, the 100m and 200m world record holder, has been the dominant figure in athletics for almost a decade. But he will be competing for the last time at the World Athletics Championships in London, which begin Friday.\u000a\u000a"It's all about the athletes. The athletes really understand where the sport is at and what they have to do it'll be fine," Bolt told CNN.\u000a\u000aIn tipping Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk as track and field's next superstar, he also cautioned that other athletes must take up the mantle he will leave behind.\u000a\u000a"Wayde has really picked up, is breaking world records, he's running fast, he's doing a lot for the sport at such a young age.\u000a\u000a"He's just 24 so, for me, he will take over without a doubt and he says he wants to be a sprinter.\u000a\u000a"If he runs 100m and 200m, hopefully, he'll run fast times and get some energy back and other athletes can see where they can also help," added Bolt.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Usain Bolt's legacy Replay More Videos ...

Now we're in the transition phase, the sport is looking for somebody else and if they don't understand that and they start going backwards then the sport will be in terrible trouble.\u000a\u000a"But if they go forward with the performance, and make people enjoy watching with laughter and fun, the sport will develop and get better and more and more athletes will start producing and everybody will enjoy the sport."\u000a\u000aBolt's achievements are unparalleled. He is the first man to win the 100m Olympic title three times, while no-one can match his 11 World Championship gold medals.\u000a\u000aHe ended the Rio Olympics having achieved the "triple triple" of sprint events (100m, 200m and 4x100m.)\u000a\u000aBut the relay gold won in 2008 was taken away from him this year after teammate Nesta Carter tested positive for a banned substance.\u000a\u000aBolt's dominance is such that he is unbeaten since 2013, when American Justin Gatlin crossed the line before him in a 100m Diamond League race in Rome.\u000a\u000aThe sprinter, however, has not been at his best this season, dipping under 10 seconds just once over 100m.\u000a\u000aDefiant, he told reporters he would end his career as the 100m world champion.\u000a\u000aBolt was in good spirits at his press conference ahead of the 2017 World Athletics Championships\u000a\u000a"If I show up at a championship you know I'm fully confident and ready to go," he said.\u000a\u000a"I'm confident in my abilities always because I know when I'm out there I'm ready to go. I'm not worried.\u000a\u000a"It's a championship, it's a final. It's all about who can keep their nerves. I've been here many times. I know I'm ready. It's go time."

aVStarre Vartan, CNN \u2022 Updated 7th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Bats used to be thought of as spooky flying creatures, denizens of nightmares and scary stories -- but now we know that they are an incredibly important part of their local ecosystems.\u000a\u000aThey pollinate crops, devour pests (especially mosquitoes) and their guano is a valuable fertilizer. On top of all that, many types of bats put on a spectacular show every evening as they emerge from their caves, twirling and whirling into the evening sky.\u000a\u000aThe next time you find yourself in Austin, Texas, you can witness this for yourself, right in town.\u000a\u000aThere, you can see Mexican Freetail bats fly out from their "cave" -- the concrete undercarriage of the Congress Avenue Bridge, where their evening exit flight is a popular local attraction. At sundown they zip out from under the bridge and fly east along the river, to Texas' capitol building.\u000a\u000a"Austin loves its bats," says Mylea Bayless, a senior director at Bat Conservation International.\u000a\u000aIt's that love that leads true devotees to Bracken Cave, a half-moon shaped slit in the earth about 70 miles south of Austin.\u000a\u000aThere, bat fans can experience "...one of the most spectacular wildlife events that you can see anywhere," says Bayless. "It's the largest congregation of bats in the world, and they come out of this cave by the millions."\u000a\u000aThe bats will keep flying out of the cave for hours -- so many that it takes 3-4 hours before they all exit their cozy home beneath the ground.\u000a\u000a"They'll circle up like a giant tornado into the sky, and they'll fly out over the corn and cotton fields eating agricultural pests," says Bayless.\u000a\u000aVisitors can watch as more than 30 million of the tiny dancers zoom out of the cave at high speed -- and will hear the special clicks as they use their echolocation abilities to expertly avoid flying into each other.\u000a\u000aBayless calls most of the common fears about bats -- that they will get tangled in your hair, that they will run into you, that they all carry rabies -- myths and misconceptions.\u000a\u000aShe encourages people to come out and see the bats and how they behave for themselves, and make judgments about them after experiencing their nightly show and learning a bit about them.\u000a\u000aThe best times to visit Bracken Cave are July and August when days are longer, and also because baby bats are born in June and start flying in July.

So when we see him, we\u2019re immediately elevated to the things beyond, the eternal truth and to the man who described himself as the truth \u2013 Jesus Christ\u2026. That\u2019s sort of thewhat you might call the supernatural characteristics that you look for. St. Thomas says grace builds on nature. What are the natural characteristics that we\u2019re looking for? Well, you need a good pastor, somebody\u2019s who\u2019s good with people like Jesus was. You need somebody who is thoroughly versed in the tradition and the profound theology of our Catholic wisdom. Number three, you need somebody savvy about the church universal, who kind of is aware and conscious of the diverse needs of the Catholic family. Number four you need somebody who can get by in at least English and Italian and preferably some other languages, too.\u201d He adds that he\u2019s looking for someone with governing capacity.

aV(CNN) It has split opinion across the Formula One paddock -- and among motorsport fans -- but two-time world champion Fernando Alonso believes adopting the divisive "halo" cockpit safety system for the 2018 season is the right decision.\u000a\u000aThe McLaren driver concedes that the head protection device -- attached to the cockpit of each car to protect drivers from flying debris and other potential hazards -- may not look attractive but says that shouldn't detract from its value in saving lives.\u000a\u000a"I know that, from the aesthetic point of view, it's a big impact, it's a change, but I don't want to have any more fatal injuries," Alonso told CNN's The Circuit.\u000a\u000a"I don't want to have any more friends struggling after accidents like Jules (Bianchi) or Justin (Wilson). I want to make the most horrible (looking) car if it is safe and will save one life."\u000a\u000aSebastian Vettel in his Ferrari, fitted with the halo, during practice for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2016\u000a\u000aBianchi died in July 2015 from head injuries sustained at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix the previous October. The 25-year-old Frenchman's death was quickly followed by Justin Wilson, who was killed when flying debris hit his helmet during an IndyCar race at the Pocono Speedway in Pennsylvania in August 2015.\u000a\u000aAlonso is no stranger to life-threatening crashes himself. At the 2016 Australian Grand Prix the 35-year-old emerged with only minor injuries after his McLaren car went tumbling into the barriers following a collision with Esteban Gutierrez.\u000a\u000aPrior to that, at Spa, the Spaniard narrowly avoided catastrophe when Romain Grosjean's out-of-control Lotus came within inches of his head at the start of the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix.\u000a\u000aAlonso tested the Halo at last year's Singapore Grand Prix and says he is "happy with a halo or no halo."\u000a\u000a"We need to test it at more circuits, with more different type of corners. Maybe we have to test it in wet conditions so there is still some things we need to improve," he said.\u000a\u000aRomain Grosjean's Lotus car narrowly avoids Fernando Alonso at the 2012 Belgium Grand Prix.\u000a\u000aThe announcement that all 20 cars on the 2018 grid will be fitted with the safety device was confirmed by motorsport's world governing body, the FIA, on July 26.\u000a\u000aA number of F1 drivers have spoken out in opposition to the halo -- Dutchman Max Verstappen said there needed to be a "certain element of risk" in the sport -- but four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel offered his support, saying the sport would be "ignorant and stupid" to ignore it.\u000a\u000aUncertain future\u000a\u000aWhile the halo is a certainty for next year, Alonso's future at his current team McLaren is far from settled.\u000a\u000a"I haven't made a decision yet," said Alonso\u000a\u000a"I'm talking to McLaren, of course, because it's my team and I think we have unfinished business together to win in F1."\u000a\u000aPhotos: Fernando Alonso: The highs and lows McLaren's Fernando Alonso in action at the recent British Grand Prix.

aVCopenhagen is a bustling city full of ambitious professionals and young families. Yet working long hours here is frowned upon.\u000a\u000aJust 2% of employees in Copenhagen work 40 hours a week or more, according to an OECD report, freeing them up to spend time with family, join organized sports, volunteer or participate in other community programs.\u000a\u000aThe cost to participate in those programs, which range from laughter yoga in the park to basket weaving? Free. This helps encourage residents to get involved.\u000a\u000aTheir ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down, it gives them a happiness boost. Studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed. That\u2019s one reason Denmark takes the top spot as the happiest nation in the annual World Happiness Report commissioned by the United Nations.\u000a\u000aOther things play into Copenhagen's relaxed atmosphere. Residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries. There are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city.\u000a\u000aMen cycle to work in their slim-fit suits, and women don\u2019t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels. The city has 249 miles of bike paths, which makes biking an easy and safe option. And people use them: Nearly half of commuters in Copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day.\u000a\u000aThough parks and bike paths are plentiful, the government is upping its efforts. By 2015, all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than 15 minutes, according to a new official municipal policy. Many of the new parks created will be \u201cpocket parks,\u201d or small green spaces for city residents. The hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for Denmark: Ninety-six percent of residents in Copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need.\u000a\u000aThis supportive society is just another reason Copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest (and happiest) cities.

aVPhoenix (CNN) The voters who carried Donald Trump to victory in Arizona increasingly see the President as just another politician -- and one who is running out of time to deliver on his campaign promises.\u000a\u000aRepublicans in focus groups held here last week by the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA largely said they are giving Trump between six months and a year before they run out of patience. Some said they have already decided against voting for him again.\u000a\u000a"I loved him because he was different, and I thought that he really was going to do a lot of change -- good changes," one Republican woman said. "I hated Obama, so I was ready for a change."\u000a\u000aNow, she said, she has much less confidence in Trump's ability to change Washington.\u000a\u000a"Whether it's the tweets or just some of the things -- like the thing he just said about the cops," she said, in a reference to Trump urging police officers not to be "too nice" when putting suspected criminals into " the back of a paddy wagon " during a recent speech.\u000a\u000a"Somebody needs to just rein him in," she said. "Before I felt like he could do it all, and now -- if somebody could just control him a little bit."\u000a\u000aHere in the desert -- where the housing crisis took a deep and lasting toll on homes' values -- voters aren't sweating the economy as much as they are in Rust Belt states. Most point to an influx of new and expanding businesses and say they are relatively optimistic about their own upward mobility. Even those who opposed Trump in 2016 see the stock market climbing.\u000a\u000aBut his failure to deliver on his campaign promises -- better health care at a cheaper price, in particular -- have rankled his supporters.\u000a\u000aAnd Democratic criticisms of Trump's plans for tax reform, as well as his proposed budget cuts, also carry the potential to put Republicans in danger headed into 2018's midterm elections.\u000a\u000aThose were the clear lessons that emerged from focus groups of nearly 30 voters. The voters who participated were paid, but were not told which organization had convened the groups. At the end of one, several incorrectly suspected they had been brought together in order to provide insights that would help right Trump's political ship.\u000a\u000aPriorities USA invited CNN to observe the focus groups on the condition that the participants be described by their voting history and affiliation and the groups into which they fit rather than using their names. Each of the three focus group discussions -- one of Republicans, one of millennials and one of Hispanic voters -- lasted two hours.\u000a\u000aThe Phoenix focus groups, as well as earlier groups in Orlando, Florida, and Cleveland, Ohio, reflected a drop in support for Trump among independents and moderate Republicans.\u000a\u000aThe Republican group in Phoenix reflected a sense that Trump's allegiances aren't with the middle class. Nine in 10 said he sides with corporations over regular people. Everyone in this focus group said congressional Republicans side with corporations, as well, while eight of the 10 said Democrats side with corporations.\u000a\u000aTrump's pledges to overhaul US trade deals and stem the tide of outsourcing haven't come to fruition, the Republican voters said -- pointing to Indianapolis air conditioning manufacturer Carrier laying off hundreds of employees , as planned, despite Trump having declared victory in getting the company to keep some jobs in the United States rather than moving them to Mexico.\u000a\u000a"There shouldn't be any outsourcing. I thought we were going to turn the faucet off," one Republican man said.\u000a\u000aSome of those Republicans, who condemned Obamacare, also criticized the GOP plan to repeal and replace it. And they didn't fault home-state Sen. John McCain for casting a deciding vote against that GOP effort . Some cited Trump's attacks on McCain's war hero status in 2015.\u000a\u000a"I think it also goes back to the bickering in politics, because Trump had some pretty harsh things to say about McCain," one Trump voter said. "So, you know, touché."\u000a\u000a"America should not be voting at 2 in the morning. That's last call," another Republican man said.\u000a\u000aMost voters across all groups said they were concerned by some of the messages presented to describe the benefits and drawbacks of Trump's tax reform effort. The most potent: That corporations would pay lower tax rates than individuals.\u000a\u000aThe view of Trump is especially important in Arizona -- a state where 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton made a late play, but Trump won easily.\u000a\u000aIn 2018, Sen. Jeff Flake -- a Republican who recently wrote a book condemning Trump's effect on the GOP -- is up for re-election and could face a primary challenge from a Trump ally. That has positioned the state as a testing ground of Trump's support within the party and among independents, who can vote in the GOP primary.\u000a\u000aDemocrats also face hurdles\u000a\u000aThe focus groups also showed clearer signs of danger for Democrats.\u000a\u000aThe party's leadership is rolling out its "A Better Deal" economic populist platform headed into the midterms. But voters in the focus groups -- one of Hispanics, one of millennials and one of Republicans who had voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, McCain for re-election in 2016 and, in all but one case, Trump -- drew few clear distinctions between congressional Republicans and Democrats.\u000a\u000a"It's just a game at this point. Republicans and Democrats -- 'I'm better,' 'you're better,'" one millennial man said.\u000a\u000a"I think that they're out for themselves. They're politicians. They are playing a game with all of our livelihoods," another millennial man said.\u000a\u000a"Everybody's selfish," said a millennial woman.\u000a\u000aJefrey Pollock, the Democratic pollster who led two of the three groups, said Democrats "cannot take for granted the midterms."\u000a\u000a"There was a lot of mush" in voters' perceptions of the two parties, Pollock said. "There's plenty of, sort of, 'It's all crap.'"\u000a\u000aHe said between the focus groups, the chaos of the last two weeks -- with Trump's White House going through the entire Anthony Scaramucci era and with chief of staff Reince Priebus's departure -- was evident in Republican voters' souring on Trump.\u000a\u000a"Today, it is different," Pollock said. "You can only reset so many times before it all gets tuned out."\u000a\u000aHispanic voters show no support for Trump but praise business background\u000a\u000aThe good news for Trump: His business background still gives some voters confidence in his economic capabilities.\u000a\u000aIn the Hispanic focus group -- where no one supported Trump -- the eight participants were asked how much confidence they had in Trump on economic issues. Five said none. The three who said "a little" or "some" cited his business background.\u000a\u000aBut the group broadly complained that Trump hasn't delved into any measure of specifics on policy as President.\u000a\u000a"You're just making general statements, so it's all smoke and mirrors," one Latino man said.\u000a\u000aAnother Latino man also used the phrase "smoke and mirrors," saying that "anything (Trump) says is just almost for shock value."\u000a\u000a"I don't think he has good advisers," said a third Latino man. "He doesn't know how to hire 'em cause he keeps on firing 'em."

aVNew CNN Special Report Premieres Monday, August 7 at 9:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S. and CNN International\u000a\u000aDonald Trump\u2019s victory on Nov. 8, 2016, shocked the American political establishment. WHY TRUMP WON, tells the story of the signals many missed, but were there all along. Fareed Zakaria points to himself \u2013 \u201cI got it wrong,\u201d he says \u2013 as he explores the cultural forces that propelled Trump towards his historic presidential win in a new CNN Special Report, WHY TRUMP WON, that will premiere Monday, Aug. 7 at 9:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S. and CNN International.\u000a\u000aWHY TRUMP WON shows how Trump has worked towards closing the ultimate deal \u2013 winning the White House \u2013 for decades. Trump attended his first Republican National convention in 1988 and competed for the Reform Party nomination in 1999. And, through print ads, television interviews, and social media, Trump has carefully tailored his political messages over the years and ultimately persuaded millions to join his powerful political army.\u000a\u000aIn WHY TRUMP WON, Zakaria reports on families falling apart: depression, drugs, desperation, and finally resentment taking root in some American communities, supplanting what had been flourishing middle class optimism. Under a veneer of rosy 2016 stock market and jobs statistics, was a decades-long crumbling of middle class culture and a long-simmering loss of faith in institutions.\u000a\u000aDavid Betras, chairman of Ohio\u2019s Mahoning County Democratic Party, is frustrated that \u201ca man who [uses] gold-plated toilets\u201d became the political bannerman for middle America, but Betras feels Hillary Clinton and the Democrats lost as definitively as Donald Trump won in 2016. Betras says working class people in Mahoning felt Democrats, the \u201cparty of the people,\u201d had left them. And, they channeled their frustrations into electoral victories last year for Donald Trump that were decisive in what some described as an earthquake of an election.\u000a\u000aOthers with insights into Trump's historic vanquishing include conservative culture columnist and author, David Brooks ( The Road to Character , 2016); political historian and author, Thomas Frank ( Listen, Liberal: Or, What Every Happened to the Party of the People? , 2017); journalist and author George Packer ( The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America , 2014); Trump ghost writer Tony Schwartz ( Trump: The Art of the Deal , 1989), and statistician and author Nate Silver ( The Signal and the Noise , 2012)\u000a\u000aWHY TRUMP WON will encore Friday, Aug. 11 at 10:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S.. In addition to the telecasts, WHY TRUMP WON will also stream live for subscribers via CNNgo (at www.CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV, and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android. Beginning Tuesday, Aug. 8, this Fareed Zakaria CNN Special Report will also be available on demand via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms, and CNN mobile apps.\u000a\u000a*****\u000a\u000aAbout CNN\u000a\u000aCNN Worldwide is the most honored brand in cable news, reaching more individuals on television, the web and mobile devices than any other cable news organization in the United States.

I mean, that's been proven that you can't change the world in a day. But we - we cannot be intimidated. We cannot be pushed aside. We cannot be told that this fight has been fought before, and that we're just one more grieving family trying to do something. I - I\u2019ve looked in the camera on other interviews and I\u2019ve said, if you were a parent, if you're a mother, if you have children, can you look your child in the eye and say, we are willing to allow you to be collateral damage in order to keep what some people perceive as their constitutional rights? If we as a society are willing to accept that, what kind of society are we?\u201d\u000a\u000aAndy Parker: "Alison would be really mad at me if I didn't take this on, and I promise you - and I\u2019ve said this time and again - these people are messing with the wrong family. We are going to effect a change, and it's going to happen. And we need people like Senator Murphy and Governor McAuliffe who are courageous enough to stand with us. And we will effect a change."\u000a\u000aBarbara Parker on those that say "If Sandy Hook couldn't deliver a change, nothing will\u201d: "You think that how could that many children be killed and nothing happen, for it to be ignored? But what we have to do, there are people out there whose minds we will never change. They are the people that are unimportant in this fight. The people who are important are the silent majority who feel the way we do, that some kind of gun control measures are necessary \u2014"\u000a\u000aPlease Credit and Reference \u201cCNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow\u201d

aVThe CNN Freedom Project wants to amplify the voices of the victims of modern-day slavery, highlight success stories and help unravel the tangle of criminal enterprises trading in human life.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When Kieu was 12, her mother asked her to take a job. But not just any job. Kieu was first examined by a doctor, who issued her a "certificate of virginity." She was then delivered to a hotel, where a man raped her for two days.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the Freedom Project went to Cambodia with Oscar-winning actress and UNODC Goodwill Ambassador against Human Trafficking, Mira Sorvino . The result was "Every Day in Cambodia: A CNN Freedom Project Documentary," which looked at child sex trafficking in the country.\u000a\u000aIn Svay Pak, a notorious child sex trafficking hub in Phnom Penh, Sorvino met Kieu, who was then around 14 years old. She had been rescued from sex trafficking by Agape International Missions (AIM), a non-profit for trafficked and at risk children and teenagers.\u000a\u000aKieu told of how she had been sold aged 12 by her mother to a Khmer man of "maybe more than 50" who had three children of his own, Sorvino explained in her Cambodia journal : "The price set in advance for her virginity: $1,500, though she was ultimately only given $1,000, of which she had to give $400 to the woman who brought her to the man. Her mother used the money to pay down a debt and for food for the fish they raise under their floating house -- their primary income source.\u000a\u000a"Beforehand, Kieu said, 'I did not know what the job was and whether it was good for me. I had no idea what to expect. But now I know the job was not good for me.' After she lost her virginity to the man, she felt 'very heartbroken.' Her mother supposedly felt bad too, but still sent her to work in a brothel. Kieu said she did not want to go, but had to. She said, 'They held me like I was in prison.'"\u000a\u000aShe was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border. When she learned her mother was planning to sell her again, this time for a six-month stretch, she realized she needed to flee her home.\u000a\u000aHer story is all too common in Svay Pak; she was just one of the girls whose stories were told in the film. Fast forward to 2015 and "Everyday in Cambodia" was named "outstanding documentary" by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation , winning a Gracie Allen award.\u000a\u000aSorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue of child sex trafficking in Svay Pak and Cambodia, helping to raise funds for AIM to build a school that, when completed, will offer hope for more than 1,000 children in the region.\u000a\u000a"Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking," she says. "It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited."\u000a\u000aAIM also now works with an "incorruptible" police SWAT team to raid brothels where children are working.\u000a\u000aBut Sorvino adds that it's not just about helping the victims. "The demand side really needs to be addressed," she says. "If people weren't trying to buy child sex it wouldn't be being sold."

aVStory highlights A group of experts suggests traditional advice on completing antibiotics could do more harm than good\u000a\u000aOther doctors say it's too early to urge patients to change behavior on antibiotics\u000a\u000a(CNN) The standing argument that failing to complete a course of antibiotics could fuel the rise of antibiotic resistance has little evidence, a group of United Kingdom researchers argue in a new paper. In an analysis published in the medical journal the BMJ on Thursday, they say that completing a course of antibiotics may instead increase the risk of resistance.\u000a\u000aThe "complete the course" advice given to patients taking antibiotics is "fallacious" and backed by little evidence, they state in their article, and could lead to antibiotic overuse -- and further resistance.\u000a\u000aBut other doctors urge caution, and say they aren't ready to change standard advice around taking antibiotics.\u000a\u000aThe opinion piece suggests that an alternative message, such as "stop when you feel better" could be developed. But the authors accept that more research is needed before this is implemented -- and that this may not apply to all infections.\u000a\u000a"We're not at all saying that patients should stop when they feel like it or that patients should ignore their doctor's advice," Tim Peto, professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and a co-author of the article, told CNN.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) When photographer Richard Ross wants to talk to a child at a juvenile detention center, he knocks on their cell door. He asks them if he can come inside.\u000a\u000aThe 67-year-old Californian is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes, so he does the same in a cell.\u000a\u000a"Most of the kids, they've never had that kind of respect," he said. "But I give it to them, I give them the power. I sit on the floor so they're looking down on me."\u000a\u000aRoss doesn't begin by hammering them with questions. He wants to have a conversation.\u000a\u000a"I say, 'What's gone on in your life?' "\u000a\u000aThe result of that tenderness and patience is Ross' latest collection of photos, "Girls in Justice."\u000a\u000aThe images are unflinching. They convey the ugliness of a young person's life behind bars. The pictures are replete with the unique loneliness, anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center. But the girls also tell their stories alongside the images.\u000a\u000aPhotographer Richard Ross\u000a\u000aOne photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit, hand on her head, sitting alone in a drab, cavernous room.\u000a\u000a"I've been here 17 times," one girl says.\u000a\u000aMany of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them.\u000a\u000a"Mom's a stripper. Dad was an alcoholic, drug addict, murdered last year," said one girl explaining her past. "They took my brother and I away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down. I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do."\u000a\u000aThe photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks, staring at the wall. Some struggle with mental illness. The girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera. That works to protect their identities, but it also evokes shame. Ross seems to be saying the shame isn't the girls' -- it's ours as a society for jailing children.\u000a\u000aHis images aren't always literal. A photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire. A straight-forward photo, of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors, turns the stomach after reading the caption -- the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aRoss recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him, "I can't wait to get out of here so I can kill myself."\u000a\u000a"She was just a kid, but she was at that place where you have no hope," he said. "I feel all these stories, but that one just hit me hard. I was sobbing. You want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that."\u000a\u000aRoss, the son of a New York City police officer, had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means. He got into a decent amount of trouble growing up, and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system.\u000a\u000aBut times were different then, he said, and there's been a cultural turn in America toward criminalizing a child's bad behavior.\u000a\u000aHe recalls a detention-center director in Reno, Nevada, who asked him to visit and take photos. At intake, he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class.\u000a\u000aYou want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that. Richard Ross\u000a\u000a"This fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle," Ross recalled. "He was drinking warm milk, like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk. I can still smell that milk. That intake area smelled like elementary school."\u000a\u000aThe child's single mother couldn't pick him up for hours. She was holding down a job that wouldn't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m.\u000a\u000aThe detention-center director sent Ross' photo to every principal in the area to make a point: Children do not belong in lockup, so find another solution.\u000a\u000aRoss is adamant that he's making photographs to bring about "immediate change."\u000a\u000aHe speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates. His work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing.\u000a\u000a"I'm trying to wake people up, make them realize there are lives at stake," he said. "At the same time, I don't, I can't, position myself as the great hope. I might not be able to do much but listen. But I think I'm a good listener, and I think these kids deserve to tell their stories."

aV(CNN) Dr. Jerome Adams was confirmed as the US surgeon general this week, pledging to take on the country's opioid epidemic. Adams, who was nominated for the role by President Donald Trump, is the 20th surgeon general to hold the position.\u000a\u000a"To be confirmed as the 20th US Surgeon General is truly an indescribable honor," Adams tweeted Thursday.\u000a\u000aAdams is an anesthesiologist who previously served as the Indiana state health commissioner -- "in essence the Surgeon General for Indiana," he said in a statement to the Senate committee . Prior to that, he served as a staff anesthesiologist and assistant professor of anesthesia at the Indiana University School of Medicine, where he completed his medical degree. He earned undergraduate degrees in biochemistry and biopsychology and a master's degree in public health.\u000a\u000a"The addictive properties of prescription opioids is a scourge in America and it must be stopped," wrote Adams in his nomination committee statement . He added that he shared US Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price's top priorities, including "the opioid epidemic, and untreated mental illness, which lie at the root of much of the current situation."\u000a\u000a"I bring to this discussion a unique perspective, and a proven track record of bringing together various groups to address the problem," Adams wrote in his statement. In May 2015, he revealed that his brother is an addict during testimony at a House Energy and Commerce Committee.\u000a\u000aThat same year, Adams dealt with the lasting effects of drug use as health commissioner. Two-hundred nineteen people were infected with HIV in Southeast Indiana as a result of injecting the prescription opioid Opana. A needle exchange program was put into place to slow the outbreak.\u000a\u000aAdams also vowed to make "wellness and community and employer engagement a centerpiece of my agenda." He said the opioid epidemic, obesity, healthcare access and cost will not be successfully tackled if the nation continues to focus on handling these problems only "after they've taken hold."\u000a\u000aAdams takes over for the current Acting Surgeon General, Rear Admiral Sylvia Trent-Adams. She has been in the role since Dr. Vivek Murthy resigned at the request of the White House in April. The position of surgeon general was first created in 1871 to head the Marine Hospital Service, intended to relieve "sick and disabled seamen," according to Rutgers School of Public Health. The surgeon general, who is nominated by the president for a four-year term and confirmed by Congress, oversees the Health Corp , within the US Department of Health and Human Services.\u000a\u000a"Many people call the US Surgeon General the nation's 'Top Doctor,' " Adams wrote in his statement. He said the moniker doesn't do justice to the many professions within the Health Corps, including nurses, pharmacists, therapists and scientists, and insinuates that one person can be "all things to health" -- but doesn't give "proper consideration to the vital role partnerships play."\u000a\u000aAdams tweeted: "The wonderful people of Indiana trusted and supported me, and ultimately this appointment is about what we've all accomplished together."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAdams noted at his hearing that he is a father to three children, ages 7, 11 and 13 years old.\u000a\u000a"When making decisions, I literally have no choice but to think about both the immediate impact on our nation's children -- my own children included -- and the world I am leaving for future generations," he said at that time.\u000a\u000a"I hope to make America healthier," wrote Adams in his statement. "Healthy people and communities are more productive, and profitable, and in turn attract more jobs and prosperity."

aV(CNN) It was in the final years of the 1990s that British columnist David Aaronovitch experienced that inevitable moment that befalls all parents of small children. Watching a news program on the unprecedented spectacle of an American president facing impeachment over his lies about liaisons with a White House intern, he heard the presenter utter the phrase, "oral sex in the vestibule." Turning nervously to his adolescent daughter by his side, Aaronovitch felt an unexpected mixture of surprise and relief when he was met with the question, "Daddy, what's a vestibule?"\u000a\u000aSome years later, Dick Cheney faced critical comments from Sen. Patrick Leahy about his former company Halliburton's involvement in Iraq's reconstruction. "Go f--- yourself," the vice president told the Vermont Democrat, during a class photo session on the Senate floor. The imperative was printed unbowdlerized in several national outlets and Cheney later recalled it as "sort of the best thing I ever did" \u2014 a judgment historians might actually find persuasive.\u000a\u000aLast Thursday, incoming, and now outgoing, White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci suggested that, unlike one of his colleagues, he was not trying to fellate himself, an observation delivered in a colorful diatribe to the New Yorker in reaction to the steady trickle of rumors and innuendo emanating from the Trump aide. Scaramucci used a downtown phrase to describe an underground feat of dexterous self-pleasure, which has creatively taxed the translation teams of several foreign newspapers, cost him a 10 day-old job and made him even more of a punch line on social media platforms and late-night talk shows than he had been.\u000a\u000aBut it has also led to vaporous commentary about the supposed debasement of our political "discourse," which wasn't entirely lofty when Adams and Jefferson stalked the nation's capital \u2014 with their surrogates accusing each other of having ambiguous anatomy and pedigree \u2014 much less so when LBJ and Nixon did.\u000a\u000aWhen he was just a junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama described the man who would be his future White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, thus: "I think, as many of you were aware, he was working at a deli, [had an] accident with a meat slicing machine, he lost part of his middle finger, and as a result of this, this rendered him practically mute."\u000a\u000aAnother way of stating the obvious would be to say that American politics has never enjoyed much civility, as much as we nostalgically like to pretend otherwise in these periodic moments of righteous pique.\u000a\u000aScaramucci fit in perfectly with the Trump ethos and might still be in a job if he hadn't been declared FUBAR by John Kelly, a retired no-nonsense four-star Marine and now Trump's chief of staff. The presumptuous Beltway outsider figured he could buck the rules of the Washington game, by stabbing his enemies in the front rather than in the back. And what's wrong with that?\u000a\u000a"I think a lot of people are clutching their pearls," Christina Greer, a professor of political science at Fordham University, told the New York Daily News last Saturday. "One, because it is so vulgar. Two, because this is a person that is a representative of the President of the United States."\u000a\u000aFew American voters have got pearls to clutch or can profess themselves shocked to discover that a stubby Long Islander with big hair and ring jewelry really does sound like Joe Pesci in "Casino." And raise your hand, please, if you thought that a President who boasts of his own familiarity with other people's genitals and begs journalists to relate how intelligent and well-liked and financially savvy he is was likely to find such phone chatter anything other than absolutely disarming.\u000a\u000aIn fact, as The New York Times reported , Trump was initially delighted with Scaramucci's put-downs of Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon. He only soured on the denunciations, the Times noted, when he realized his newest hire's outsize ego and press were beginning to eclipse his own.\u000a\u000aNew York's outer borough poetry\u000a\u000aOne of the core ironies of the 2016 election is that the professional political observers who were an Uber ride away from JFK Airport were precisely the ones to miss the appeal of this type of New Yorker to middle America.\u000a\u000aThere is a kind of mournful, Freudian poetry to the patois of the outer boroughs, of which Scaramucci is now, for better or worse, the global embodiment. Even as on-paper specimens of the so-called "establishment," they can never feel as if they've truly made it and so they behave as outcasts of the American dream rather than as realizations of it.\u000a\u000a"Anyone who thinks money is ever just money, Dick, couldn't have much of it," Charles Van Doren tells Richard Goodwin, the special counsel to the House Legislative Oversight Committee who eventually unravels the racket that was "Twenty One" in the movie "Quiz Show." And anyone who makes money after coming from nothing knows what it can never quite buy: the acceptance of the Sutton Place and Hyannis Port sets.\u000a\u000aScaramucci grew up the son of an Italian-American plumber but in Port Washington, the model upon which Fitzgerald based East Egg in "The Great Gatsby," which is certainly one way to inculcate permanent class anxiety.\u000a\u000aI spent the formative years of my life surrounded by people who talk exactly as the Mooch does, and overcompensate for modest beginnings in the same spirit of desperation and defiance. It's difficult some days to tell where my aunt's Thanksgiving dinners in Far Rockaway end and the leadership of the free world begins.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Bye bye, Mooch Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bye bye, Mooch 01:56\u000a\u000aNotice how Scaramucci name-checks Harvard Law School, an alma mater that evidently thought he was dead until recently, at the least relevant moments in news conferences and TV appearances. (If he were really to the manner born, he'd only ever say that he went to "school in Boston.") By doing this, he isn't reminding you of his legal erudition, which would be obnoxious enough, but of his worthiness to be talking to you in the first place. In literature, this is the stuff of pathos, not comedy.\u000a\u000aTrump's a different story\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aTrump, too, weirdly suffers from the same pathology of self-perception, even though he has absolutely no reason to. He was born a millionaire scion of a real estate magnate \u2014 granted, in Queens, not Manhattan. His boorishness is true-blue, but his autobiography of a self-made man is, unlike Scaramucci's, completely invented.\u000a\u000aEven still, it is remarkable how long Trump has carried this image of himself as a beggar at the feast, a working-class stiff gatecrashing the country club. In 1990, he was interviewed by Vanity Fair \u2014 of all magazines \u2014 and came away sounding more like a social conservative from the deep South distinguishing "real America" from the coastal Gomorrahs rather than the mogul whose extramarital affair made tabloid headlines . "There are two publics as far as I'm concerned," Trump said. "The real public and then there's the New York society horses---. The real public has always liked Donald Trump. The real public feels that Donald Trump is going through Trump-bashing. When I go out now, forget about it. I'm mobbed. It's bedlam."\u000a\u000aSeveral bankruptcies, comebacks and an Electoral College vote later, and his tune hasn't changed a note.\u000a\u000aThe Mooch, unlike his former boss, is the more genuine Everyman raging in his gilt tower.

aV(CNN) The park bench is a familiar and often overlooked design that exists in cities across the world. Typically designed to have mass appeal, and manufactured from materials that can withstand frequent use, constant exposure to the elements and vandalism, these seats provide a valuable but perhaps unrecognized service.\u000a\u000aAs part of a development project aimed at revitalizing Stockholm's Järfälla suburb, 10 leading international designers were invited to create alternative benches for the neighborhood's neglected Kvarnbacken park. The outcomes of the Superbenches project challenge the conventional notion of public seating and vary drastically in their execution, ranging from playful outdoor lounge furniture to a curving mini amphitheater.\u000a\u000aSuperbenches forms part of a wider two-year research and communication initiative called Kalejdohill , which was launched by property developers HSB, Veidekke Bostad and Einar Mattsson to help reactivate Kvarnbacken park as an attractive meeting place for local residents.\u000a\u000aFollowing an announcement that several hundred new homes will be built in the area, the developers invited curators Andreas Angelidakis and Mia Lundstrom to oversee a series of events and interventions to foster a sense of pride in the neighborhood. The project also encourages current residents to contribute ideas and suggestions that will ultimately help to shape the planning process.\u000a\u000aA close-up of "Cushy" by Hagglund & Gripner\u000a\u000aNew York-based creative director and writer Felix Burrichter was brought in to select the designers for the Superbenches installation, and set a brief that urged them to break away from preconceived notions of what a park bench should look like.\u000a\u000a"I was hoping we would achieve a great variety of different benches and that's certainly the case," said Burrichter at the project's launch. "Some of them aren't even benches in the classic sense, but what many of them do is foster the community of the overall park, as well as creating moments of leisure and pleasure and different kinds of use."\u000a\u000aPhotos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of Photos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere, the town's cultural association invited seven world-class architects, including Pritzker Prize winners Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu, to design shelters along the local bus route, offering nothing more than a week's free holiday in the region.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRemarkably, the architects accepted, and the construction was funded entirely through local community's donations, with no public money spent at all.

Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of The area in which Krumbach lies has long been known for its superb quality of craftsmanship, which was one of the main draws for the Norwegian studio Rintala Eggertsson Architects , creators of the shelter shown above. "All this talk about star architects is funny to us," says Dagur Eggertsson, "because for us it was all about meeting the star craftsmen of the region. They have embraced all the modern technology while also preserving their tradition and heritage," he adds.

Debora Mesa and Anton Garcia-Abril of Ensemble Studio , who were behind this rustic looking bus stop, say that they were intrigued by the extravagant nature of the commission: "It's an experimental idea. We were curious to see the outcome and be part of it."

The shelters are like temples of the bus system, and the people of the region have built it by themselves, for themselves" he explains.Russian superstar of architecture Alexander Brodsky presented his vision in the form of a watch tower -- there is even a bench and a table for waiting in comfort in case the famously punctual Austrian bus service is late.

Hide Caption 7 of 7\u000a\u000aBurrichter also encouraged the designers to consider the idea of the folly -- an architectural intervention created purely for decorative purposes -- when coming up with their proposals for the benches. This inspiration is most evident in London-based designer Philippe Malouin' s brutalist-inflected cylindrical seating structure.\u000a\u000aDutch studio Scholten & Baijings and LA-based designer Jonathan Olivares both sought to improve the park's existing infrastructure, with the former applying colored gradients to the wooden seats and backs of five existing benches, and the latter placing a curving bench alongside a pair of renovated boules courts.\u000a\u000aAppropriately for a project aimed at engaging with the local community, the inhabitants of Järfälla will be asked in a year's time to decide which, if any, of the Superbenches they want to remain in the park. Feedback from residents at the opening event was predominantly positive, meaning these alternative benches might well become a permanent part of Kvarnbacken's future.

aVOn the evening of July 29, 2007, the streets of Baghdad, Iraq, echoed to the sound of gunfire.\u000a\u000aFar from an uncommon occurrence, the rattle of bullets usually signaled the latest manifestation of sectarian violence that had engulfed the country in the wake of the US and allied invasion of 2003.\u000a\u000aYet on this particular evening thousands filled the streets, dancing and waving flags as cars honked their horns in delight.\u000a\u000aThe gunfire, far from being malicious, was a sign of celebration as Iraqis fired their weapons into the air to salute an unlikely group of soccer heroes.\u000a\u000aBy defeating Saudi Arabia 1-0 in the Asian Cup final in Jakarta, Indonesia, Iraq's national team had confounded the odds and claimed the continent's most prestigious competition for the first time.\u000a\u000aThey had also, however briefly, united a nation that was tearing itself apart.\u000a\u000aLooking back at that period, Iraqi midfielder Hawar Mulla Mohammed who played in all six games of the 2007 tournament finds it hard to comprehend just how violent his country had become both during and after the invasion.\u000a\u000a"The national security HQ was close to where I lived and when it got bombed the building would swing left and right," Mohammed said. "It was indescribable, we used to practice while the airstrikes were going on."\u000a\u000aMohammed said that between 50 and 60 people from his clan, including five of his cousins, died as a result of the Iraq conflict and its aftermath.\u000a\u000aIn 2007 alone, more than 26,000 civilians were killed according to figures from the Iraq Body Count monitoring group.\u000a\u000aA history of violence\u000a\u000aYet violence was nothing new for the Iraqi national football team. They'd been ruled by fear from within their own locker-room for many years.\u000a\u000aUday Hussein, eldest son of Iraq's late tyrannical dictator Saddam Hussein, ensured that the consequences for failure on the field were brutal.\u000a\u000aTales of his cruelty were legion: beatings, torture, imprisonment. But by 2007, Uday was long gone -- killed along with his brother Qusay in 2003.\u000a\u000aStill, on the eve of the Asian Cup four years later, the Iraqi national team was in disarray. With just weeks to go until the start of the tournament, they didn't even have a coach.\u000a\u000aThe Brazilian journeyman Jorvan Vieira was a last-minute call-up.\u000a\u000aAccording to Salih Sadir, who played in the early rounds of the 2007 tournament and was an unused substitute in the final, such haphazard preparation ensured expectations remained low.\u000a\u000a"We were expecting that it would be mere participation and then we'd leave the competition," Sadir said casting his mind back.\u000a\u000aAn opening match draw against unfancied Thailand did little to alter that theory.\u000a\u000aBut in the second game against Australia everything changed. A 3-1 defeat of the pre-tournament favorite transformed the belief among the Iraqi players. More importantly, it made people back home take notice.\u000a\u000a"Every time we won, we return(ed to the dressing room) to listen and watch the response, and reaction from our families," Sadir said.\u000a\u000aAs the tournament progressed, that response became increasingly excited.\u000a\u000aUnity and togetherness\u000a\u000aIn a country that was fracturing along religious and ethnic lines, its soccer stars had begun to offer an example of how Iraqis could work together.\u000a\u000aA team of Sunnis, Shias and Kurds could easily have been divided, just like their countrymen. But the players agreed to leave religion at the door.\u000a\u000aThey found a way to unite. Not only that, they inspired. "People's support for us started increasing. We started seeing that we are unifying the people," Sadir said. As such, "the players became determined to bring the cup back to Baghdad."\u000a\u000aJames Montague, a journalist and author of the book " When Friday Comes: Football, War and Revolution in the Middle Eas t," spent some time with the team before they flew out for the tournament.\u000a\u000aHe recalls a group of players who had all been deeply impacted by the conflict in their homeland. "Many had lost loved ones while some had threats of violence directed against them or their families by insurgents. There was also the threat of kidnap by criminal gangs," he said.\u000a\u000aBut Montague also detected a strong determination among the players to put aside religious and cultural differences. He describes a camaraderie, humor and unity between teammates.\u000a\u000aOn top of this, Coach Vieira had decreed that the players would not pray together in the dressing room before the game or at half-time, something teams from the Middle East commonly do, Montague said.\u000a\u000aYet small measures such as this were only part of the reason this Iraqi team would write an underdog story more unlikely than " Leicester City winning the English Premier League or the Red Sox breaking the 'Curse of the Bambino,'" Montague added.\u000a\u000a'Giving happiness to the people'\u000a\u000aIraq finished top of their group, and a win against Vietnam in the last eight took them into the semi-finals.\u000a\u000aA virtual unknown when he arrived, coach Vieira had worked wonders to bring his charges even this far.\u000a\u000aThe Brazilian had been able to instill a belief and togetherness in his squad. Living in each other's pockets as they prepared and trained certainly helped.\u000a\u000aBut as the tournament progressed, Vieira began to understand what he described in 2007 as his players' "pain" and desire to "give happiness to their people" who were suffering back home.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Emotional coach recalls Iraqi sporting triumph Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Emotional coach recalls Iraqi sporting triumph 04:34\u000a\u000aTalking to CNN again earlier this week, Vieira said "it was very difficult to manage the psychological side of things" given the situation back in Iraq.\u000a\u000aVieira recalled that before the competition began when the team was preparing in Jordan, the team's physiotherapist had requested to go home to Iraq be with his wife who was due to give birth. As he went to collect his ticket to return to be with the team, he was killed by a car bomb.\u000a\u000aWhen something like that happens "you don't know (whether) to cry with them, to try to explain to them to be strong," Vieira said.\u000a\u000aSadir describes a manager strongly focused on the emotional side of the game.\u000a\u000a"He was very close to the players, that was his main thing," Sadir said. "Not the tactics or the physical status, his main focus was how to get to be close to the players, make them love him and support him. He was very successful in doing so."\u000a\u000aBy the time of the semi-final against South Korea, Iraq were the darlings of the competition and support for their pursuit of the trophy had spread around the world.\u000a\u000aWhen they beat the Koreans in a penalty shoot-out, it seemed that nothing could stop them -- except, perhaps, a violent jolt of reality.\u000a\u000aPhotos: How Iraq's footballers beat bombs and bullets An Iraqi fan cheers for her team at the 2007 Asian Cup.

A short while later, in the southeastern neighborhood of Ghadir, a second car bomb killed 20 and wounded at least 60.\u000a\u000aIt was rumored that some of the players didn't want to go on, considering the risk of further bloodshed a price too high for a simple football trophy.\u000a\u000aYet Sadir cites the reaction of one bereaved mother, whose son was killed while supporting the team, as providing the motivation for those who doubted whether they could play in the final.\u000a\u000aThis particular woman had appeared on Iraqi television after her son's death and refused to bury her child until Iraq had returned home as champions.\u000a\u000a"The biggest thing that impacted our morale and persistence and confidence to continue playing for the team ... was the incident that took place, the woman who lost her son," Sadir said. "This was a turning point."\u000a\u000aVieira becomes emotional, shedding a tear when he recalls the players meeting after hearing the words of this bereaved mother. Despite the doubts and difficulties, "we decided to continue (and that) we had to win this competition," he said.\u000a\u000aAnd so, on 29 July 2007, Iraq took on regional heavyweights and three-time Asian Cup champions, Saudi Arabia, for the biggest prize in the country's sporting history.\u000a\u000aThroughout the tournament, Iraq had been defensively sound, conceding only two goals. In the final, they were again resolute. But it wasn't until the 72nd minute when they scored the crucial and historic goal.\u000a\u000aA header from team captain, Younis Mahmoud, after Saudi keeper Yasser Al Mosailem misjudged a cross, sparked emotional celebrations among Iraq players and fans in the stadium.\u000a\u000aMahmoud took off, with teammates chasing him beyond the advertising hoardings and along the running track which surrounded the pitch at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.\u000a\u000aParty in the streets\u000a\u000aThe joy was just as unrestrained back home.\u000a\u000aPeople took to the streets despite the fatal bombings just a few days previous.\u000a\u000aAmong those present was CNN's senior international correspondent Arwa Damon who describes the day as one of her "best moments" in reporting from Iraq.\u000a\u000aDamon found herself witnessing scenes of happiness she had barely thought possible until that point.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Arwa Damon recalls Iraq's 2007 Asian Cup win Replay More Videos ...

Iraq continues to be a dangerous, violent and divided place.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, the emergence of ISIS has plunged major cities like Mosul and large swathes of the country into chaos.\u000a\u000aThe sectarian murders have also continued with 15,000 people killed in 2014 alone.\u000a\u000aAccording to Iraq Body Count, there were 4,000 violent incidents across the country in 2016.

Ten years on, it's a story still generates powerful emotions for those involved.\u000a\u000a"There was fire inside each of us," Mohammed said.

First question, senator, is do you support the idea that convention delegates should be able to vote their conscience, be unbound if they are currently bound to vote for Donald trump? [JOHNSON] Well, good morning, Dana. I'm not a delegate. I really do not know. Nobody can really predict what's going to be the outcome of our nomination process. I know there's a number of movements afoot. I'm not part of that process. I have my own race here in Wisconsin. I\u2019m going to concentrate on the areas of agreement, growing our economy, strengthening our military, defeating ISIS, securing our borders, making sure that we have judges appointed to the Supreme Court. So those are the issues, you know, economic growth so that we have - create better opportunities for the American public for the folks here in Wisconsin. I mean, that\u2019s the think I\u2019m going to concentrate on.\u000a\u000aJohnson on if he will support Donald Trump: [BASH] According to a paper from your home state you said just before an event last month "I\u2019m going to certainly endorse the Republican nominee and obviously it looks like that will be Mr. Trump." Have you endorsed him? [JOHNSON] It has been my intention to support the Republican nominee. And again nobody can predict the outcome of this thing. So I think things remain reasonably uncertain. But is my intention to support \u2013 [BASH] So are you endorsing Mr. Trump right now? [JOHNSON] I intend to support the Republican nominee and certainly support the areas of agreement, growing our economy, defeating ISIS, strengthening our military, securing our border. I mean, those - no two people agree 100 percent on everything. So I'll support the areas of agreement? [BASH] Support but not endorse, what's the difference? [JOHNSON] Well to me endorsement is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything. That's not necessarily be the case with our nominee, so I\u2019ll certainly be an independent voice where I disagree with a particular nominee. I'll voice it, whether it's Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or anybody else. I'll voice those disagreements and I\u2019ll certainly support the areas of agreement.\u000a\u000aJohnson on Facebook\u2019s cooperation on terror investigations : [BASH] And senator, three days after the Orlando shootings last week you wrote a letter to Facebook to CEO Mark Zuckerberg - Zuckerberg, forgive me - and you asked the company to turn over material relating to the accounts linked to the Orlando shooter because he was posting on that site during the attack. Has Mark Zuckerberg or anybody from Facebook responded? [JOHNSON] Yes. I\u2019m sure Facebook is going to be cooperative. They've been cooperative in the past. They've been doing very innovative - taking very innovative efforts trying to counter ISIS' vile and barbaric use of social media. So I view Facebook as a real partner in this.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFULL POST

aV(CNN) As of July 31, the number of children across the United States who have died of heatstroke when left in hot cars was at a record high.\u000a\u000aThis year, 29 children have died of heatstroke after being left in a vehicle. That's more than at this point in previous years, according to Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist with the Department of Meteorology & Climate Science at San Jose State University.\u000a\u000aThis "is the highest we've ever had," said Null, who logs these and other statistics on noheatstroke.org\u000a\u000aThe previous record as of July 31 was 28 deaths in 2010, he explained, "a year where we ended up with 49 deaths for the year."\u000a\u000aThe past week's total of 11 deaths is not a record, said Null, who gathers his numbers primarily from media reports because official sources are less accurate, due to the use of codes.\u000a\u000a"If it's not coded exactly right, it doesn't get counted," he said. Official reports come up with only about half the numbers you find in the media, he explained.\u000a\u000a"All my numbers are conservative," said Null, who has been a meteorologist for 40 years. "There are several more each year that go under the radar."\u000a\u000aDIY data\u000a\u000aNull began to track these sad occurrences in 2001, when local media asked him, after the death of a child in a car, how hot it could have gotten inside. Not knowing the answer, he said he'd look around and found nothing, so he decided to conduct his own research.\u000a\u000aHe put a remote thermometer in a vehicle to capture the internal temperature while an outside thermometer recorded the ambient temperature. (Null records temperatures in Fahrenheit for his website.)\u000a\u000a"One of the really surprising things when I started looking at this is the amount of rise per time," Null said. "This is as if you had the air conditioner running, you've driven into a parking spot, parked the car, turned it off, closed the door -- the time starts. In the first 10 minutes, the average rise is 19 degrees."\u000a\u000aThis effect is almost identical if you start at 70 degrees or 90 degrees, Null said. If you start at 70, in 10 minutes, it will be 89°F. If you start at 90, in 10 minutes, it will be 109°F.\u000a\u000a"You get to these very high temperatures very rapidly," he said. "How hot it got was one surprise," but how fast it got to a "deadly temperature" was even more unexpected.\u000a\u000aMedical professionals generally use 104-degree body temperature to measure heatstroke, and death can occur when body temperatures reach the 107-degree range, Null noted.\u000a\u000a"Even on an 80-degree day -- which is a mild summer day for most of the country -- you're at 109 in 20 minutes" inside a car, he said.\u000a\u000aEven when outside temperatures are as low as 57 degrees Fahrenheit , the temperature within a car can climb to 110, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- based, of course, on data provided by Null.\u000a\u000aHow heat kills kids\u000a\u000aThe central nervous system is not fully developed in children, and this makes their bodies less able to cope with temperature changes, according to the Mayo Clinic . Children have difficulty remaining hydrated for this same reason. And a child's core body temperature can rise five times more quickly than that of an adult.\u000a\u000aWhen body temperature rises, heatstroke may occur. Also referred to as hyperthermia and heat illness, it can cause alterations in consciousness and lead to permanent brain, heart and kidney damage. In a worst-case scenario, heatstroke places a person -- child or adult -- at risk of death.\u000a\u000a"We normally get rid of excess body heat by sweating, and we evaporate, and we lose heat via evaporation," said Dr. Corey Slovis, a professor and chairman of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. With dehydration, though, we "lose the ability to sweat, the body loses the ability to get rid of heat, and so body temperature rapidly rises."\u000a\u000aThe two things that increase the likelihood of heat-related illness are inability to sweat and increasing humidity and heat.\u000a\u000a"If you're in a hot container, as body temp rises, as humidity rises inside there, you cannot dissipate heat," Slovis said.\u000a\u000aVehicle safety\u000a\u000aOn average, 37 children die each year after being left in a car, says Null, who counts 729 such deaths overall since 1998.\u000a\u000aTo end at least some of these unnecessary fatalities, cars may someday include a safety feature.\u000a\u000aSens. Richard Blumenthal and Al Franken introduced legislation Monday requiring all new passenger vehicles to be equipped with a child safety alert system. The technology alerts drivers if a child is left in the back seat once the car is turned off.\u000a\u000aThe Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seat Act ( HOT CARS Act ) is intended to prevent heatstroke deaths when children are left alone in vehicles.\u000a\u000aAlong with requirements for new cars, the HOT CARS Act would direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to study options for retrofitting older vehicles with a visual and auditory alert system.\u000a\u000a"The HOT CAR Act is only really going to impact that 54% of children who are forgotten," Null said. Another 28% of deaths occur when children gain access to a car on their own and then are overcome by the heat. Another 17% of deaths happen "when a parent makes a bad decision to leave a child in a car while they go do something else," he said.\u000a\u000aTogether, the 28% and 17% make up what Null calls "the forgotten 45%," which would not be protected under the HOT CARS Act.\u000a\u000a"Nobody is talking about those," he said. "There needs to be other ongoing continuing efforts -- continuing education and awareness efforts."\u000a\u000a"We commend Senators Blumenthal and Franken for their leadership on this very important safety issue," Megan Soule, a spokeswoman for General Motors Corp., wrote in an email.\u000a\u000aAhead of the game, General Motors has introduced alert technology to remind parents to check the back seat before leaving a vehicle: the Rear Seat Reminder. The feature does not detect objects or people in the rear seat, Soule said; instead, it monitors rear door usage.\u000a\u000a"GM engineers developed this system to provide a simple, extra reminder for the driver to look in the rear seat when exiting the vehicle, regardless of what may be back there," Soule said.\u000a\u000aNull believes that the proposed law and technology safety features will not protect all children. He suggests that people always keep their cars locked, remind children that cars are not a play area, and keep keys and remote access devices away from kids.\u000a\u000a"When a child goes missing, the screaming message needs to be, check the pool first and then all vehicles," Null said.\u000a\u000aLast weekend, a 7-month-old boy and a 1-year-old boy died of heatstroke in separate incidents after being left alone in cars in Phoenix. The investigations are ongoing, yet in a statement Monday reported on azcentral.com , police said they believe the two deaths are accidental.\u000a\u000aNull keeps statistics for each state, and Arizona has some of the highest numbers. It is one of 15 states with proposed laws that make it illegal to leave a child unattended in a vehicle, according to the nonprofit Kids and Cars ; 19 states have legislation in place to protect kids.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Texas, by far and away, is the worst as far as numbers. The worst when we look at per capita is Mississippi," Null said, noting that the states with the highest numbers of hot car deaths are also some of the warmest.\u000a\u000aA previous version of this story incorrectly stated the number of children who died in a single week in July. A total of 11 children died in hot cars during the month of July 2017.

aV(CNN) Marvel's powerful track record in movies is no secret, but until now, the studio has largely avoided producing traditional superhero shows for television. "Agents of SHIELD" was only peripherally connected to the Avengers franchise, while the studio's "street level" dramas for Netflix -- including the upcoming "The Defenders" -- feature a gritty, almost film-noir style.\u000a\u000aThat changes with "Marvel's Inhumans," a new ABC series that the company will launch with a theatrical Imax release prior to its Sept. 29 premiere. And if DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. have suffered from a sort-of Marvel envy theatrically, given the popularity of DC shows like the CW's "The Flash" and "Arrow," "Inhumans" appears to represent an attempt to flip that script -- or at least gain greater parity -- in television.\u000a\u000aThe implications for Marvel and ABC look significant. With the former bringing titles like "Captain Marvel" and "Black Panther" to the movies, how "Inhumans" does will likely impact whether more second-tier costumed characters might be steered to TV, and ABC in particular.\u000a\u000aUntil now, ABC has been surprisingly slow to cash in on Marvel properties, despite their shared parentage as units of the Walt Disney Co. Attempts to expand on "SHIELD" have fizzled, as "Agent Carter" was canceled and a pilot featuring spun-off characters wasn't picked up as a series.\u000a\u000aThe main distinction in defining the new show, compared with other Marvel TV properties, is between superheroes and conjuring a drama around people who happen to have powers.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVText by Kate Springer, CNN \u2022 Published 6th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Surrounded by lush rice terraces and undulating landscape, the mountain village of Buscalan is home to just 200 or so households. It rests in the Kalinga province of the Philippines and is about a 15-hour drive north of Manila.\u000a\u000aYet thousands of tourists come here every year to meet Whang Od Oggay, the Philippines' oldest mambabatok -- or traditional Kalinga tattooist. Roughly 100 years old, Whang Od has been performing the ancient art of hand-tapped tattoos since she was 15.\u000a\u000a"The tradition will continue as long as people keep coming to get tattoos," Whang Od tells CNN Travel. "As long as I can see well, I will keep giving tattoos. I'll stop once my vision gets blurry."\u000a\u000aA symbol of beauty and strength\u000a\u000aTraditionally, the hand-tapped tattoos were earned by indigenous Butbut warriors.\u000a\u000a"Once they've killed someone, they are eligible for a tattoo," explains Whang Od. "Everyone knew when one of the warriors has killed someone because he would announce it to everyone."\u000a\u000aAnd for women? Tattoos were considered an aesthetic accessory.\u000a\u000a"Back then they would say: 'Go get a tattoo so you would look beautiful,' " recalls Whang Od of her teenage years, when friends covered her arms and legs in tattoo sleeves.\u000a\u000aBut now that the warriors have died out, the hand-tapped tattoos are open to anyone -- and Whang Od sees a steady stream of international clients, etching about eight tattoos a day. Each symbol -- ranging from lines to circles, animals and tribal prints -- carries a deeper meaning. Some designs represent the mountains or the sun, others fertility and strength.\u000a\u000a"I like it when tourists and visitors come here because it helps us out [financially]," says Whang Od. "I hope visitors keep coming."\u000a\u000aHow she does it\u000a\u000aWhang Od follows a millenniums-old technique, using just a few tools: a thorn from a pomelo tree, a foot-long bamboo stick, coal scraped off a pot, and water.\u000a\u000aThat's it.\u000a\u000aWith intense concentration, she paints a design on the skin using the homemade coal-water ink. Tap by tap, she uses the thorn and bamboo stick to push ink deep into the skin, drawing blood. With this simple technique, Whang Od creates meaningful geometric designs -- but not without the pain commonly associated with modern tattoos.\u000a\u000aTattooing the future\u000a\u000aKeeping the art alive is more complicated than it seems. The art can only be passed down to blood relatives, following the belief that the tattoos will become infected otherwise. Though she doesn't have children of her own, Whang Od has been training her grandnieces Elyang Wigan and Grace Palicas for several years.\u000a\u000a"[My friends who gave tattoos] have all passed away," says Whang Od. "I'm the only one left alive that's still giving tattoos. But I'm not afraid that the tradition will end because [I'm training] the next tattoos masters."\u000a\u000aEven though the art is in good hands, the centenarian doesn't plan to go anywhere anytime soon.\u000a\u000aHer secret to living to 100? "I don't eat canned goods, foods with oil, foods with preservatives," Whang Od says. "I only eat organic foods like leafy vegetables and beans."

aVHoward Slutsken, CNN \u2022 Updated 27th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 There are few pop culture icons better known on both sides of the Pacific than Jackie Chan. The action-movie star's work across US and Asian film made him an obvious choice to represent Hong Kong Airlines and fly on the airline's first flight to North America.\u000a\u000aThe Hong Kong-based airline -- as its name suggests -- had its maiden flight to YVR Vancouver International Airport on June 30, its first destination outside of Asia and Australia.\u000a\u000aThe carrier's flight is just the latest inaugural flight to YVR from mainland China and Hong Kong. Unlikely as it seems, Vancouver is the epicenter for the international expansion of Asian carriers.\u000a\u000aGeographically blessed\u000a\u000aIt seems a surprising hub, but consider its geographical advantage -- all its Chinese destinations are closer to Vancouver than to any other major North American city.\u000a\u000a"We have more direct mainland Chinese flights than any other airport in North America or Europe," says YVR CEO Craig Richmond. "To put that in perspective, our relatively small, 23 million passenger-per-year airport has more Chinese flights than Heathrow, JFK, Los Angeles or San Francisco. When I tell people that, they're surprised!"\u000a\u000aCathay Pacific Airways, Air China and Air Canada have linked Vancouver with Hong Kong and China for decades, but over the past few years, the number of Chinese airlines flying to Canada's West Coast has exploded.\u000a\u000aChina Eastern, China Southern, Xiamen Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Beijing Capital Airlines have started service to YVR from major and second-tier cities in China.\u000a\u000aHong Kong Airlines, which is mostly owned by Chinese industrial conglomerate HNA Group, joined that growing list on June 30.\u000a\u000a118 direct flights\u000a\u000aComing off the plane was the usual inaugural flight group of airline and airport executives, and travelers heading to YVR -- but the crowds in the terminal cheered when the airline's "ambassador," Chan, bounded off the plane.\u000a\u000aTopping off the arrival, Chan and Richmond held a mock kung fu fight to the delight of the audience and a large group of Chinese- and English-language media.\u000a\u000aHong Kong Airlines' arrival ups the total to 118 weekly direct flights to Hong Kong and China, with over 26,000 available seats between Vancouver and Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, and smaller cities including Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen.\u000a\u000aLarge Asian population\u000a\u000a"We have so many ex-pats from Hong Kong living and working in Vancouver. In recent years, more and more Mainland Chinese have come here to live, to work, and to study," says George Liu, chief marketing officer for Hong Kong Airlines.\u000a\u000a"We have also built a very extensive regional network that will support our customers and travelers going to Hong Kong. We can take them to any place they want to go to in Asia," says Liu.\u000a\u000aAnd that's in part because Vancouver also holds the title of the " most Asian city outside of Asia ," consisting mainly of Chinese, Indians and Filipinos, according to Canadian census data. In 2017, Statistics Canada projected that by 2036 around 78% of immigrants in Vancouver would be from Asia.\u000a\u000aVancouver has become such a popular destination for Chinese investors looking to spend their money abroad that the provincial government in 2016 levied a 15% tax on foreign home buyers.\u000a\u000aThe Fairmont Vancouver Airport hotel offers dramatic views of the North Shore Mountains and runway.\u000a\u000aAirplanes of choice\u000a\u000aWith its huge Chinese population base, Vancouver is at the forefront of connecting to China, which is set to become the largest air travel market on the planet by 2030. And that's driving a buying spree by Chinese airlines who are taking new long-range jets from Boeing and Airbus that efficiently connect the continents.\u000a\u000aYVR is easily within the range of the workhorse twin-aisle Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s that are in the fleets of many Asian carriers.\u000a\u000aAnd the newest generation of airliners, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350, are being used by these airlines to establish new "long and thin" routes -- with long distances, but lower passenger demand -- like those from the second- and third-tier Chinese cities to Vancouver.\u000a\u000a"These airplanes also provide these Chinese carriers with the prestige they need to compete shoulder to shoulder with Air Canada and any other airline flying not just from Canada to China, but from the US as well," according to travel analyst Henry Harteveldt, Atmosphere Research Group.\u000a\u000aAppeal of the familiar\u000a\u000aWith a massive market of Chinese passengers wanting to travel to and from Vancouver, the option of flying on a "home airline" may be appealing. Travelers tend to prefer flying on airlines of their home country.\u000a\u000a"The airline may accept their preferred form of payment, there are people who speak their home language on the plane, and travelers know that meals, beverages and the in-flight entertainment is more likely to please them," says Harteveldt.\u000a\u000aPassengers who connect to or from the United States will find the process at YVR simple and swift.\u000a\u000aThose coming in from the United States can bypass Canada Border Services and Immigration, and go directly to their international departure gate. Passengers transiting to the US from other countries also bypass Canada Border Services and proceed directly to US Preclearance.\u000a\u000aAs with all major Canadian airports, passengers clear US Customs and Border Protection before they board their US-bound flights. Travelers arrive at their US destination as if it's a US domestic flight.\u000a\u000a"It's easy to make those connections," says YVR's Richmond. "We have to continuously improve on making things frictionless for the passenger."\u000a\u000aAnd the airport wins high marks from travelers. It was voted Best Airport in North America for the eighth consecutive year at the Skytrax World Airport Awards.\u000a\u000aHong Kong Airlines might be the most recent carrier to choose Vancouver as a destination, but it won't be the last. Richmond hints that another Chinese carrier will announce service to YVR "later this year."\u000a\u000aVancouver is only the start of North American flights for Hong Kong Airlines.\u000a\u000aLos Angeles is next, with the airline beginning service in December with its soon-to-be-delivered Airbus A350s.

aVGabriel O'Rorke, CNN \u2022 Updated 5th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Buenos Aires has been known to captivate many a visitor, providing such ample entertainment that many find themselves stripped of the will to leave.\u000a\u000aA large portion of the Argentine capital's ability to charm comes down to its outstanding cuisine -- here are some of its best eateries:\u000a\u000a1. Café Dorrego\u000a\u000aThe bustling Plaza Dorrego, the location of Cafe Dorrego.\u000a\u000aCrusty, flaky. The men at Cafe Dorrego wouldn't want to be called that, but their croissants would. On the corner of Plaza Dorrego in the heart of San Telmo, this traditional cafe is full of character and old men sipping espressos -- like them, you'll appreciate the typical Argentine pick-me-up: coffee and medialunas ("half moons" or croissants).\u000a\u000aPeanut shells litter the harlequin floor tiles, old gin bottles line the walls and well-worn tables are scarred with the signatures of bygone guests. Best for people-watching on Sundays when the square springs to life with the hustle of 200 antiques stalls.\u000a\u000a2. La Cabrera\u000a\u000aSteak and a bottle of Malbec here -- perfection.\u000a\u000aA rare moment of repose at bustling La Cabrera. So well known is La Cabrera for its "steak so tender you can cut it with a spoon" that even with a reservation you have to stand in line before being rewarded with a table.\u000a\u000aOnce inside, waiters in crisp white shirts and berets (known as "boinas") deliver enormous slabs of grilled meat on wooden boards.\u000a\u000aFor the Argentine steakhouse experience par excellence, nothing beats the Bife de Chorizo accompanied by a bottle of Malbec. Hard-core eaters can take on the Volcan de Chocolate for dessert.\u000a\u000a3. Astrid & Gastón\u000a\u000aMouthwatering ceviche at Astrid & Gastón.\u000a\u000aColonial romance. And Peruvian excellence. The global spread of Peruvian food is echoed in the growth of Astrid & Gaston -- first opened in Lima in 1994, it has now spread to Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Spain, Mexico and Argentina.\u000a\u000aIn a colonial townhouse, the red and gold paneling makes for a romantic setting. The full experience includes pisco sours followed by the seven-course tasting menu, which ranges from Peruvian classics like ceviche and cuy (guinea pig), to seafood, soup, beef and, lastly, baked apple topped with dulce de leche.\u000a\u000a4. Casa Saltshaker\u000a\u000aDuck breast with smoked eggplant puree and mango chutney at Casa Saltshaker . Reading the menu is a treat in itself. Puerta cerrada ("closed door") restaurants are a hit in Buenos Aires. At Casa Saltshaker the concept is simple: guests book online and turn up at chef Dan Perlman's house for a five-course meal en famille.\u000a\u000aThe food is often inspired by global events -- for example, a hint of Asia on Chinese New Year. Dan's motto is "Food and Conversation," making this a good option if you're traveling alone or fancy meeting new people.\u000a\u000a5. Casa Coupage\u000a\u000aCasa Coupage is another underground restaurant, but here the focus is wine tasting. There are separate dining tables, so it's more like being in a restaurant than someone's house. Two sommeliers take center court guiding guests through the pairing of Argentine wines and food --- this is a good option for wine lovers.\u000a\u000a6. Faena Hotel\u000a\u000aFancy suites at Faena Hotel.\u000a\u000aPhilippe Stark's renovation of a red brick 1900s grain store into Faena Hotel includes no fewer than six restaurants and bars.\u000a\u000aThere's the all-white El Bistro with its macrobiotic menu (grains, vegetables, fish); El Mercado with its brick patio and traditional Argentine fare (steak and chips); and the seductive El Cabaret, where dinner is a warmup for the Rojo Tango show.\u000a\u000a7. Elena, Four Seasons\u000a\u000aChic Elena at Four Seasons Buenos Aires.\u000a\u000aSundays at the Four Seasons are known as best of the bunch for brunch, and the experience at Elena -- the hotel's brand new restaurant -- lives up to its reputation.\u000a\u000aIt's hard to imagine more meat, cheese, pasta, sushi, pancakes, chocolate, sweeties and ice cream gracing one buffet -- it's like combining Whole Foods with Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. And it's not just for tourists. Sunday Brunch here is something of a right of passage for well-heeled Porteños.\u000a\u000a8. The Argentine Experience\u000a\u000aLooking for an introduction to the thriving Buenos Aires food scene? Look no further.\u000a\u000aAt The Argentine Experience , the patrons learn how to make their own empanadas and how to order the best steaks -- pretty important: they serve some stunning steaks here! Several TripAdvisor punters call the restaurant a highlight of their trip to Buenos Aires. What more are you looking for?\u000a\u000a9. El Obrero\u000a\u000aEl Obrero is the real deal: a traditional Argentinian bodegon showcasing traditional local ingredients and delicious dishes.\u000a\u000aWatch our for the decor: pictures of famous visitors (U2's Bono and Francis Ford Coppola, to name just two) past and present adorn the walls. What's the appeal? The beef (fairly cheap and always scrumptious) and the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a10. i Latina\u000a\u000aFine-dining, Buenos Aires style at i Latina, which is also a good option for veggies. Fantastic wines complement brilliant flavors, not to mention the A+ presentation.

aVThe Friday, Sept. 28th edition of Amanpour, host Christiane Amanpour will include an interview with Brigadier General Manaf Tlass. General Tlass, formerly a life-long friend of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, defected from the Syrian Republican Guard this summer. In this advance excerpt from the interview that will air today on CNN International, he speaks to Amanpour about the moment he knew he could no longer serve his president:\u000a\u000aAMANPOUR: Bashar al-Assad was your friend. Describe him. Describe his character.\u000a\u000aTLASS: This question is really embarrassing because I defected because I started to feel the feelings of a citizen.\u000a\u000aI remember very well how I defected. I cannot speak in that light. Because I remember that video that I saw when they stepped on the head of a Syrian citizen in Banias. I could no longer call Bashar al-Assad a friend. But when I told him after seeing that video, that person who stepped on the head of the Syrian citizen must be punished, ever since then I can no longer be a friend of Bashar's.\u000a\u000aHe has different qualities, he is humble. He loves people. But he has changed. The crisis has changed him.\u000a\u000aThe full transcript for this interview will be posted here.\u000a\u000aAmanpour airs weekdays on CNN International at 3:00pm with a replay at 5:00pm Eastern in the U.S. In Europe, Amanpour airs on CNN Internatioanl at 21:00 CET, with a replay at 23:00 CET.\u000a\u000a###

aV(CNN) Travel advisories warn you to carefully consider visiting certain places. Reasons typically range from severe weather to government instability, from civil war to terrorism.\u000a\u000aThe US State Department issues such advisories on a regular basis. Earlier this month it warned Americans against traveling to Somalia because of widespread terrorist and criminal activity, including kidnappings, bombings and murders.\u000a\u000aLast week, the NAACP issued a travel advisory of its own, warning people of color that their civil rights could be violated in the state of Missouri.\u000a\u000aThe advisory, issued by the Missouri NAACP State Conference and endorsed by the national organization, is the first of its kind in the civil rights organization's 108-year history. "Individuals traveling in the state are advised to travel with extreme CAUTION," the advisory says .

"That's a first. That's different."\u000a\u000aThe ACLU of Missouri praised Chapel's "visionary leadership during this shameful act in Missouri's history."\u000a\u000a"We are saddened the Missouri Legislature chose to continue its mistreatment of people of color and women by passing Senate Bill 43," ACLU executive director Jeffrey Mittman said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"Senate Bill 43 guts the Missouri Human Rights Act -- a piece of legislation that was both innovative, inclusive and modeled what our democracy should champion: equal rights for all."\u000a\u000aThe legislature passed the controversial bill in June. Gov. Eric Greitens signed it into law. Greitens and other supporters said the law puts Missouri's standards for lawsuits in line with other states.\u000a\u000a"None of those other jurisdictions say that individuals that discriminate and harass other folks have immunity," Chapel said.\u000a\u000aThe governor's office has not commented on the advisory, but acknowledged that Greitens met with "passionate advocates" on both sides of the issue.\u000a\u000aThe Missouri Division of Tourism has not responded to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aDiscrimination and 'looming danger'\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Mizzou president steps down amidst racism controversy Replay More Videos ...

However, he was involved in two altercations with jail personnel in his cell, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told CNN affiliate WKRN .

aVChinese billionaire Wang Jianlin is fighting back against talk that his sprawling business empire is in trouble.\u000a\u000aWang's Dalian Wanda Group is one of China's biggest conglomerates, with several international acquisitions under its belt. Less than a year ago, Wang was promising to become the world leader in real estate, tourism, entertainment and sports.\u000a\u000aNow he's on the defensive. Last week Dalian Wanda sold several theme parks and dozens of hotels for $9.3 billion, marking the end of Wang's dream to defeat Disney (DIS) in China. The billionaire said the deal would reduce his company's debt burden.\u000a\u000aIt followed several reports that Beijing regulators were investigating some of Wanda's overseas deals for breaching investment rules, and that they had warned state banks not to lend to the company.\u000a\u000aWanda has not responded to CNNMoney's requests for comment on these reports, and the Chinese government has declined to comment.\u000a\u000aBut Wang used a speech in Beijing on Wednesday to defend the heart of his real estate business, Wanda Commercial Properties.\u000a\u000a"Many people are concerned about the liabilities of Wanda Commercial. However, while most of them care about it out of real concern, a few spread rumors and attempt to make trouble," he said.\u000a\u000aRelated: China's richest man gives up on plans to beat Disney\u000a\u000aWanda Commercial had decided to pay off most of its bank loans, Wang said, adding it has cash of more than $25 billion and for-sale properties on its books worth $19 billion.\u000a\u000a"It is projected that, in terms of rent, Wanda Commercial will enjoy an average annual growth rate of approximately 20% over the coming five years. Is Wanda Commercial running a good business? You can make your own judgment," Wang added.\u000a\u000aBut uncertainty about the conglomerate has spooked investors in other Wanda companies. Shares in Wanda Film Holdings were suspended earlier this month due to "major events" and haven't traded since.\u000a\u000aAnd after its shares plunged 10% this week, American movie theater chain AMC Entertainment, (AMC) which is controlled by Wanda, issued a statement saying it does not depend on financing from its parent company.\u000a\u000a"Dalian Wanda has never been a source of acquisition funding for AMC," the company said. AMC has also "never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose, including for acquisitions."\u000a\u000aWanda's global expansion had stalled earlier this year. In March, a $1 billion deal to buy Dick Clark Productions was terminated after Wanda "failed to honor its contractual obligations," the production company's owner Eldridge Industries said.\u000a\u000aRelated: China's richest man still wants to buy a Hollywood studio\u000a\u000aWang's remarks came at an event to announce an abrupt reworking of the deal to offload Wanda's theme parks and 76 hotels to Sunac Holdings, one of China's top real estate firms.\u000a\u000aUnder the new terms, Wanda is selling the hotel portfolio (now 77 in total) to R&F Properties for $2.9 billion. Sunac will still buy the theme parks and has already made a down payment, the companies said.\u000a\u000aWanda said the "object and total amount of the transaction are basically the same" as the original deal.\u000a\u000aBut the hasty new agreement has raised more questions about Wanda's finances.\u000a\u000aRelated: Billionaire: Chinese real estates is the 'biggest bubble in history'\u000a\u000aIn the original agreement, Wanda Commercial was going to lend Sunac billions of dollars to help it finance the purchase, according to a public filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange.\u000a\u000aUnder the new structure, Sunac no longer needs the loan, so Wanda will receive more cash from the deal.\u000a\u000a"From a cash flow perspective it's a bit better for Dalian Wanda," said Franco Leung, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aMoody's has a negative outlook on Wanda Commercial's credit rating, which it downgraded earlier this year. The negative outlook means the agency could further lower the company's rating in the medium term.\u000a\u000a"The company is still having relatively high debt leverage, and that's why we have a negative ratings outlook," said Leung.\u000a\u000aWang has seen his fortune shrink amid the turmoil.\u000a\u000aThe billionaire was China's richest man, according to the most recent annual rankings, with an estimated net worth of around $30 billion. Based on current estimates, he's falling behind tech tycoons Jack Ma of Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) and "Pony" Ma Huateng of Tencent (TCEHY).

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) With nearly all-black, female-led casts, both HBO's "Insecure" and feature film "Girls Trip" are clearly breaking all types of color and gender barriers. But it's what's happening behind the scenes that is changing the game on a more interesting frontier. Female writers like "Insecure's" Issa Rae and Erica Rivinoja and Tracy Oliver of "Girls Trip," are leveling the playing field when it comes to male and female nudity, by putting more naked men on our screens. It's just what Hollywood needs.\u000a\u000aFor far too long, naked women have become such a staple in TV and film that it's hard to notice, much less quantify, the inequality unfolding right before our eyes. But a recent study from Mount Saint Mary's University did just that and found that actresses are almost three times as likely as their male counterparts to be required to strip to their unmentionables.\u000a\u000aRaVal Davis\u000a\u000aUndoubtedly, female nudity has become an accomplice to get viewers through bad plotlines and awkward acting. And sometimes it's just the cherry atop the box office sundae. But why is female nudity so much more ubiquitous than male nudity? And what does this say about the role of women in the world?\u000a\u000aAccording to a 2005 University of Pennsylvania study , 57% of US teenagers, ages 14 to 16, identified television, film and other media as the primary source of information about sex and gender. In a post-#ImWithHer era, are we really still OK with such widespread and normalized objectification of the female body?\u000a\u000aBut it's not only an issue for the viewer. It's an even larger issue for the actress being asked to display her body. As a new actress trying my best to break into episodic television, I have to admit I cringe every time I read those typical female character breakdowns. You know the ones: The waitress in the club who has no more than five lines but happens to have sex with the main male character. She's totally inconsequential to the plot but helps move the episode along somehow. And, of course, NUDITY REQUIRED or MUST BE OK WITH NUDITY is bolded at the bottom of the script. It's degrading but seemingly sometimes a necessary evil for actresses to make their way above the five-line mark.\u000a\u000aRead More

"They do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk," Trump declared . "We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!"\u000a\u000aBeijing may have temporarily mollified the Trump administration, which was pleased by Chinese support for tighter UN sanctions against North Korea. But despite Washington's hopes, China won't solve the North Korea problem, regardless of how often the Trump administration insists that it can or must.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, Beijing has leverage over Pyongyang; trade with China comprises 90% of North Korea's trade, including vital imports such as food and oil. Furthermore, North Korean businesses have set up joint ventures with Chinese firms, which allow Pyongyang access to the global economy. Beijing could crack down on these relationships.\u000a\u000aWhile China has leverage, it won't use it to pressure North Korea. As I found in recent conversations with scholars and government officials in Beijing, the Chinese diagnose the problem and its solution very differently, and have very different interests at stake.\u000a\u000aThe Americans see North Korea as a dangerous rogue state that broke international law to acquire nuclear weapons. But China sees North Korea as motivated by insecurity. The Chinese say that because the United States and South Korea are so much more powerful, and because the United States goes around the world toppling governments, it's no wonder that Pyongyang wants nuclear weapons. In their view, North Korea is not the menacing rogue state; America is. "You need to understand," several people in Beijing told me, "the Americans are the source of their fear."\u000a\u000aHow to solve the problem? The Chinese feel "unfairly burdened" (as a recent China Daily op-ed said) at being seen as the key to a solution. In their view, Washington, not Beijing, is the key; only the Americans (by reducing North Korea's fear) can influence Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese urge the United States to stop the military exercises with South Korea that frighten the North, give security assurances to Pyongyang, and withdraw military forces from South Korea. (Washington does not see these as bargaining chips but as essential for maintaining readiness and deterrence on the peninsula.)\u000a\u000aChina also has very different interests at stake. While North Korea's intercontinental nuclear capability is a game-changer for the Americans, it isn't for the Chinese, who have already been living with North Korean nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aChina worries most about political stability on the Korean peninsula. The Chinese fear that serious economic pressure would risk causing Kim Jong Un's regime to collapse, which could unleash chaos on the peninsula, and usher in a variety of long-term problems.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese worry that North Korean regime collapse would send refugees flooding across their border, and are alarmed by the prospect of military intervention by South Korea and the United States. Bruce W. Bennett of RAND and I modeled the requirements for military missions in a post-collapse North Korea: for example, humanitarian relief, border control operations, and missions to find "loose nukes." Performing these missions would require hundreds of thousands of troops.\u000a\u000aImagine this scenario from China's perspective: the prospect of serious instability, and massive military intervention by two powerful armies, right on its border. Because China intends to intervene as well, this scenario has the potential for dangerous escalation. This -- not a North Korean intercontinental strike capability -- is Beijing's nightmare.\u000a\u000aThen there are the longer-term concerns. The Chinese face a potential demographic problem in Jilin province, in Yanbian autonomous prefecture, where a substantial amount of the population is ethnically Korean. (Many North Koreans fled there during the years of famine.) Beijing worries that the area's demographics will become too Korean, encouraging secessionist feeling. The Chinese Communist Party already has enough of this on its hands in Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan.\u000a\u000aNorth Korean collapse, and Korean unification, also have implications for the broader military competition between China and the United States. North Korea currently provides a buffer between China and American troops in South Korea.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese fear that if Korea unifies, American troops would remain, and China would lose this buffer. The Chinese also say that they like that North Korea preoccupies US diplomacy, military planning, and force structure: that without the North Korean thorn in the American side, Washington might turn its gaze toward Taiwan and the South China Sea.\u000a\u000aThus while the Chinese certainly would prefer that North Korea not have nuclear weapons, their greatest fear is regime collapse. "At times China will probably put more pressure on North Korea," one Chinese scholar told me, "but we will not fundamentally change our position."\u000a\u000aGetting Beijing to act against its own interests will be hard, if not impossible, and will require more than frustrated tweets ( dismissed by China's state media as "emotional venting"). To get China to act against its own interests, the Trump administration would have to make a deal. What does China want that Washington could give it?\u000a\u000aBut a deal acceptable to both sides probably doesn't exist. The sorts of carrots, capitulations, or concessions that Washington would have to dangle at Beijing would have to be big -- really big (perhaps related to the US-Japan alliance, South China Sea, or Taiwan). But, with its many treaty allies and interests in East Asia, Washington would be unwilling to offer that kind of carrot.\u000a\u000aWhich brings us to sticks. The Trump administration could try to convince Beijing that Washington simply will not live in a world with a North Korean intercontinental strike capability: that if Beijing won't help try economic coercion, the administration will use force against North Korea.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

Overseen by the Chimpanzee Trust, the Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary's approach helps the apes stay fed and watered, but in the daytime they're free to roam and claim the island as their own.\u000a\u000aNgamba's chimp population has endured difficult previous lives: orphaned, kept as pets, some used in circuses.

aV(CNN) It is the jewel in the crown of the FIM Endurance World Championship -- and the most important race on the calendar for Japanese motorcycle manufacturers.\u000a\u000aThis weekend the Suzuka 8 Hours -- the final race of the 2017 Endurance World Championship -- celebrates its 40th anniversary. Expect local rivalries to be as fierce as ever.\u000a\u000aIt is arguably Japan's biggest motorsport race and unique in that both MotoGP and World Superbike riders pit their wits against one another.\u000a\u000aFor the likes of Honda and Yamaha the marathon race which runs for 220 laps is almost as important as winning a MotoGP championship.\u000a\u000aFor the riders the race presents one of the biggest physical and mental challenges they face all season.\u000a\u000aLast year, Alex Lowes was part of the winning Yamaha entry and the Englishman is clear about what makes Suzuka uniquely challenging.\u000a\u000aBritish rider Alex Lowes is racing for Yamaha in the 2017 race.\u000a\u000a"Suzuka is unlike anything else that we do," Lowes told CNN.\u000a\u000a"Typically we wait on the grid for fifteen minutes before a race and you try to focus on the task at hand. In this race though we're on the grid for one hour because they go through the national anthems and the pageantry of the event.\u000a\u000a"You are standing there in all of your leathers in 30\u02daC and high humidity. The sweat is dripping off your back and down your leathers. It's the most unpleasant moment of the entire season!"\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, the enormity of the event hit Lowes as he led the field into the pit straight on the opening lap of the race.\u000a\u000a"Coming across the line I could see a mass of pitboards, tens of thousands of people in the grandstands and I knew that this was one of the most magical moments of my career."\u000a\u000aLowes' start to the race may have been "magical" but his joy turned out to be short-lived as Yamaha went on to clinch its first win since 1996 with the team of Bradley Smith, Pol Espargaro and Katsuyuki Nakasuga.\u000a\u000aThe following year, he was luckier, replacing Smith at Yamaha who were victorious once again.\u000a\u000aRiders rush towards thier motorbikes at the start of the 2016 Suzuka 8 Hours race.\u000a\u000aCan Honda challenge Yamaha?\u000a\u000aChasing three in a row is a massive target for Yamaha and with Lowes and Nakasuga this year joined by Michael van der Mark, a two-time winner, they have an enviable rider lineup.\u000a\u000aStanding in the way of victory will be Honda, winners of the race a record 27 times since its inception in 1978.\u000a\u000aWhile their all-new-for-2017 Fireblade has endured disastrous campaigns in WorldSBK (World Superbike) -- they are bottom of the manufacturers' championship -- Honda is still expected to be a major contender at Suzuka.\u000a\u000aMotoGP race winner Jack Miller will be one of the star attractions for Honda and having tested the bike, he can't wait to get started.\u000a\u000a"I'm really excited to get the opportunity to race over there," said the Australian. "Suzuka is something I've wanted to do for a while and to go over there with one of the best teams, it's a big opportunity for me.\u000a\u000aAustralian rider Jack Miller is competing for the Honda team in the 2017 Suzuka 8 Hours race\u000a\u000a"I'm looking forward to the challenge. It's going to be a long, hot summer for me but it's going to be good!"\u000a\u000aRacing alongside three-time winner Takumi Takahashi and Moto2 race winner Takaaki Nakagami, Miller will be part of a strong team.\u000a\u000aFormer Moto2 world champion Stefan Bradl will also be on the grid for Honda. The WorldSBK racer has struggled on a Superbike this year but enlisting his services shows that Honda are doing all they can to make sure all bases are covered to be able to take the fight to Yamaha.\u000a\u000aKawasaki and Suzuki are both doing the same with their rider lineups.\u000a\u000aKawasaki don't put quite the same level of resources into their Suzuka program as some rivals, but with Leon Haslam paired with Kazuma Watanabe, the Team Green effort could be a good outside bet.\u000a\u000aHaslam, a two-time Suzuka winner, has bags of experience and plenty of confidence having been a podium man as a wild card in WorldSBK, in addition to winning in the British Superbike Championship.\u000a\u000aSuzuki will have their all-new GSXR-1000 on track and with Josh Brookes, Vincent Philippe, Josh Waters and the factory's MotoGP test rider, Takuya Tsuda, riding they have the potential to challenge for a podium finish.\u000a\u000aThe victorious Yamaha team celebrate on top of the podium at the 2016 race.\u000a\u000aTheir biggest name on a Suzuki will be 2014 WorldSBK champion Sylvain Guintoli, with the Frenchman adding Endurance duty to a season that has already seen him line up on the grid in British Superbikes and MotoGP.\u000a\u000aSuzuka is a challenge unlike any other. One of the most important things for teams and riders is to have as many of their bases covered as possible prior to the start of the event.\u000a\u000aWith testing completed, the key task becomes maximizing productivity during practice and qualifying before the start of the race.\u000a\u000aA lot can happen in two minutes on a racetrack, and over the course of eight hours, 1,300 kilometers and 220 laps, another compelling chapter in motorcycling history will be written in the heat of the Japanese summer.

aV(CNN) When Phil Southerland was 7 months old, he had symptoms of the flu, was urinating frequently and had an unquenchable thirst.\u000a\u000a"My mom took me to one doctor who said, 'Your kid has got the flu. Come back in one week,'" he said.\u000a\u000aWithin days, Southerland's weight plummeted. His mom rushed him to the hospital.\u000a\u000a"They said, 'Ma'am, we've got good news, and we've got bad news. The good news is your son's gonna live for now. The bad news is, he's got diabetes. He's got to take shots of insulin, and most likely he'll be dead by 25. If not, he'll either be blind or have renal failure,'" he said.\u000a\u000aRacing uphill\u000a\u000aAs he grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, Southerland was determined not to let this death sentence stop him. At 6, he was already managing his Type 1 diabetes on his own.\u000a\u000a"For me, it was all I ever knew. I knew I had to breathe, I knew I had to eat and I knew I had to check my blood sugar and give myself insulin shots."\u000a\u000aHis parents stored only healthy food in the house to keep him from making bad choices. But at 12, Southerland disobeyed the rules and ate a candy bar. That decision would change his life.\u000a\u000a"I figured OK, I don't want to wait two hours for my insulin to kick in. I do want to eat these candy bars. How can I do it?" he recalled.\u000a\u000aSo he hopped on his bike and rode through the neighborhood until his legs got tired.\u000a\u000a"That was my journey to start riding," he said. "The bike for me was freedom."\u000a\u000aThe more he exercised, the less insulin he needed, and the easier it was to manage the disease.\u000a\u000a"The bike gave me the discipline and motivation I needed to control my diabetes," he added.\u000a\u000aSoutherland started competing and won a lot of cycling races. In college, he got the idea to start a nonprofit called Team Type 1 Foundation , based in Atlanta, to empower other athletes with the disease.\u000a\u000aThe first sporting goal of the organization was to have a team of athletes compete in the Race Across America, a 3,000-mile bike trek through 12 states.\u000a\u000aSoutherland leads his first all-diabetic cycling team for Team Type 1.\u000a\u000a"We lost the race by three minutes," Southerland said. "So we came back the next year a little smarter in how we manage diabetes, a little more experienced in the race, and we set a world record of 5 days, 15 hours and 43 minutes."\u000a\u000aTo ensure safety, the organization provides a medical team to support riders during a race. Cyclists undergo a stringent testing regime in the three hours leading up to a race. They also use continuous glucose monitoring, which will sound an alarm if their levels get too high or too low.\u000a\u000aCheating death\u000a\u000aIn 2008, Southerland created a professional team of diabetic cyclists.\u000a\u000a"I was supposed to be dead when we started Team Type 1 as a professional cycling team," he said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aBut he was far from it.

Their parents were all in tears because their kids have this tool, which is gonna help them live," he added. "It ripped my heart out."\u000a\u000aEvery year since then, the organization has continued to send supplies to Rwanda.\u000a\u000a"I want every kid with diabetes to know that they are the hero.

And margaritas.\u201d\u000a\u000aMs. Soffer, a former producer at \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d said of the site, \u201cYou have to have a sense of humor.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother mourning site speaking to the younger generation is Lisa Frank Mixtape, promising \u201c90s Music, 21st Century Grief.\u201d Its founder, Zoe Feldman, 29, solicits essays about human loss (sorry, no pets), sending her contributors a mix tape in return for submitting an essay about a human loss they have experienced. Named after the company Lisa Frank, known for its brightly colored products that Ms. Feldman said are to her the antithesis of grief, the venture was inspired after her former girlfriend and Smith College classmate, Rebecca Rosenthal, known as Becca, died in October 2012 at age 27.\u000a\u000a\u201cI went to a Shaman, a healer and every psychiatrist in Manhattan, and the only thing that helped me was talking to people my age who had experienced some devastating loss,\u201d said Ms. Feldman, who works on business strategy for PepsiCo in New York and has mailed around 50 mixtape cassettes (she will burn a CD for those who don\u2019t have a tape player). \u201cOne person wrote and said it\u2019s like being part of a weird, sad tribe,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThose who are accustomed to social media as a way to tout how fabulous your life is, beware: these sites can be unflinchingly graphic and wrenching. In November, K. H. (submitters use their initials on Lisa Frank Mixtape) wrote, \u201cMy dad passed away on May 31, 2003 in my arms as I tried to give him CPR.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aMs. Doughty, the author of a forthcoming book \u201cSmoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons From the Crematory,\u201d to be published by W. W. Norton in September, said she is seeing a cultural shift happening around what she calls \u201cdeath awareness.\u201d Her peers are engaging in more-open and public discussions about mortality and loss, a movement of which her \u201cAsk a Mortician\u201d channel on YouTube is on the frontier.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThe series has received over a million views since 2011, fielding questions such as: \u201cHow do you become a mortician?\u201d (Go to mortuary school) and \u201cCan you bake cremated remains into a chocolate cake?\u201d (Yes, but it\u2019s kind of gross.) On Ms. Doughty\u2019s blog, contributors discuss issues like, \u201cWhat do dead bodies really look like?\u201d and \u201cSuicide is the cause of death. Do you share?\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, \u201cGirls,\u201d the HBO show about young people making their way in modern-day Brooklyn, has twice tackled the issue of grief and death this season, first when Hannah Horvath\u2019s e-book editor, David, is found dead in the Hudson River. \u201cDo you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?\u201d Ms. Horvath asks her editor\u2019s widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, \u2018look at me\u2019 behavior.\u201d On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, \u201d said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.\u000a\u000aThen there\u2019s the lingua franca of social media \u2014 the like button \u2014 that\u2019s totally discordant with death. \u201cMy God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing \u2018136 people like this\u2019 underneath?\u201d Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a \u201csympathize button,\u201d something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company. (Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, but allows friends and family, depending on privacy setting, to leave posts on the timeline.)\u000a\u000aThe fact that the Internet is perhaps not the best channel for grief (with gaffes immortalized in cyberspace) is why David Fajgenbaum, 28, the founder of National Students of AMF, a support network for college students with sick or deceased parents, said his organization of 40 chapters on campuses has been cautious about integrating an online component. \u201cSomeone could say the wrong thing online, and could really hurt someone,\u201d said Mr. Fajgenbaum, who started the support group in his mother\u2019s memory while an undergraduate at Georgetown.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aMiss Manners, a.k.a. Judith Martin, writes rather unequivocally on the matter. \u201cLetters of condolence should be written by hand,\u201d she said. \u201cBurdensome as it may be, it offers the comfort of knowing that one is representing the deceased to those who cared about him.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut as Mr. Fajgenbaum acknowledged, young people are eager for that virtual connection; after all, technology and the Internet are a ubiquitous part of their existence. That\u2019s what Jason Feifer, 33, creator of the instantly viral Tumblr \u201cSelfies at Funerals,\u201d discovered when he posted a few dozen photos of teenagers taking pictures of themselves at funerals. In doing so, Mr. Feifer, an editor at Fast Company magazine, said he was documenting a newfangled mourning practice. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the older generation to see more than disrespect and to see some kind of genuine communication,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, though, some of the images made him cringe, in particular the young woman who wrote: \u201cLove my hair today. Hate why I\u2019m dressed up #funeral.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Feifer said, \u201cI think there are a lot of kids who saw this Tumblr and will not take a selfie at a funeral, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the kids who did take these photos don\u2019t know how to grieve.\u201d

aVIn 2014 the country opened the largest wind farm in Africa, valued at $1.4 billion, in the southwest near the city of Tarfaya. Then, in early 2016, it switched on the first facility of the world's largest concentrated solar plant, Noor-1 , on the fringe of the Sahara desert. When completed in 2018, it will power one million homes and make Morocco a solar superpower.\u000a\u000aAnd while the country is still heavily reliant on energy imports (90 percent in 2013, according to the World Bank ), it plans to generate 40 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020.\u000a\u000aFollowing this road has led to Morocco hosting the UN's 2016 summit on climate change, COP22 , in Marrakech. So what lies ahead?\u000a\u000aCutting the energy bill\u000a\u000aMorocco ranks seventh in the world in the 2016 Climate Change Performance Index , and is the only non-European country in the top 20.\u000a\u000aIt's also one of only five countries to have achieved a "sufficient" rating for its efforts to keep warming below 2°C in the Climate Action Tracker (no country has achieved the "role model" rating as of yet, so "sufficient" is currently the best grade).\u000a\u000aAn aerial view of the solar mirrors at the Noor 1 Concentrated Solar Power plant, 12.5 miles outside the central Moroccan town of Ouarzazate.\u000a\u000aHow did it get there? "We started with a question: How can we decrease our energy bill?" Said Mouline, director of the National Agency for the Development of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"Morocco is a very energy dependent country. In 2009, that bill amounted to $10 billion."\u000a\u000aSo, in 2011, Morocco altered its constitution to include sustainable development, stopped subsidizing fossil fuels to make renewables more competitive, and started welcoming private investments in the clean energy sector.\u000a\u000aEfficiency is key\u000a\u000a"This transition has two paths, and renewables are just one. The other is energy efficiency. Both need to be developed at the same time," Mouline said.\u000a\u000aOne key action is reducing waste: the electricity state utility, ONEE, has started a program to replace old incandescent light bulbs in Moroccan households with 10 million compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), which are far more efficient.\u000a\u000aTo offset the initial cost -- CFLs are six time more expensive -- the utility allows users to pay for them in installments through the bill, which itself is lowered by the better efficiency.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Environment Program estimates that by switching just 40 percent of households, power consumption would drop by 20 percent, cutting 2.74 million tons of CO2 emission by the end of 2021 -- as much as would be created by consuming 308 million gallons of gasoline, according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Calculator.\u000a\u000aAs part of its efforts for a greener future, Morocco has also started to transition its 15,000 mosques to renewable energy, and in July it banned the production, sale and use of plastic bags, of which it used three billion each year.\u000a\u000aA $3.5 billion economy boost\u000a\u000aMouline, who's also a member of the Steering Committee of COP22, says energy efficiency is the cheapest way for countries to meet their targets under the Paris agreement.\u000a\u000a"The government set some ambitious goals. Fifty two percent of our energy capacity must come from renewables by 2030, and by the same date we must achieve 20 percent better energy efficiency in all sectors: transport, housing, agriculture.\u000a\u000aThe wind farm in Melloussa, 21 miles from Tangiers in northern Morocco, has 165 turbines, with a production capacity of 140 megawatts.\u000a\u000a"That means that if our energy consumption doubles by 2030, we want to actually consume 20 percent less than that. We want to stop wasting energy," he said.\u000a\u000aAnd the country could run entirely on green energy by 2050, according to a study by Stanford University on the energy roadmap of 139 countries.\u000a\u000aThis would contribute about $3.5 billion to the economy and add over 88,000 permanent jobs, the study predicts.\u000a\u000aAn example for Africa\u000a\u000aAt an event held at COP22 in 2016 promoting solar energy in Africa, Morocco's efforts were used as an example of how Sub-Saharan Africa can capitalize on the highest irradiation rates in the world, even though solar power only makes up approximately 0.5% of energy production in the area.\u000a\u000aThe event highlighted the World Bank and International Finance Corporation's efforts to raise $16 billion for solar, hydro, and geothermal energy projects throughout the continent.\u000a\u000aAccording to Mouline, this transition will be inevitable: "We are switching, all over the world. Last year more money was invested in clean energy than fossil fuels for the first time. Look at how many new jobs renewables, energy storage and electric mobility have created."\u000a\u000aMorocco's wind farm in Tarfaya, which produces 850MW, has created an new industry in the country, as 70 percent of the spare parts for the turbines are manufactured locally.\u000a\u000a"Making electricity is only a part of a larger strategy."\u000a\u000aWater security\u000a\u000aAs a country made up of 78 percent desert or dry zones, according to FAO estimates , Morocco faces special challenges in the fight against climate change.\u000a\u000a"At the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, Morocco was one of the first countries to ratify the agreement on biodiversity, desertification and climate change," said Abdelâdim Lhafi, High Commissioner for Water, Forests and the Fight Against Desertification of Morocco.\u000a\u000a"Before 1992 and starting in the 1960s there were strong policies about water, and Morocco now has about 140 dams with a total storage of 18 billion cubic meters (635 billion cubic feet), which is crucial for a country that is severely hit by droughts."\u000a\u000aDue to increased demand, demographic changes and tourism, some areas of the country now experience water scarcity: "But we've made a lot of progress in the use of water, especially in agriculture which absorbs 85 percent of our supply. That's why we're looking at new technologies for our 1.2 million hectares of irrigated areas, to preserve our food security," Lhafi said.\u000a\u000a"We've done a lot, but we still have a lot to do in the coming years."

aV(CNN) It's not every day that medical studies say alcohol could be good for you. People who drink moderately often have a lower risk of developing diabetes than those who never drink, according to a new study published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.\u000a\u000aMen and women who hoist a few glasses three to four days a week have the lowest risks of developing diabetes, Danish researchers found. Compared to people drinking less than one day each week, men who drink frequently had a 27% lower risk while women had a 32% lower risk, the researchers said.\u000a\u000aDiabetes is a disease in which blood glucose -- sugar -- levels are high. When we eat, most of our food is turned into glucose to be burned as energy, with a hormone called insulin helping our cells absorb glucose. People who have diabetes either don't make enough insulin or don't use it effectively. As a result, sugar builds up in their blood, leading to health problems.\u000a\u000aPast studies consistently showed that light to moderate drinking carried a lower risk of diabetes compared to sobriety, while heavy drinking had an equal or greater risk. Though the World Health Organization reports " harmful use of alcohol " contributes to more than 200 diseases and injuries, it also acknowledges that light to moderate drinking may be beneficial with respect to diabetes.\u000a\u000aSince an important relationship exists between drinking and diabetes, Professor Janne Tolstrup and her colleagues from the National Institute of Public Health of the University of Southern Denmark studied the specifics.\u000a\u000aHow the study worked\u000a\u000aThey began by gathering data from Danish citizens 18 years old or older who completed the Danish Health Examination Survey. The data set included 28,704 men and 41,847 women -- more than 70,000 participants total -- who self-reported their drinking habits and other lifestyle details beginning in 2007-2008 and continuing through 2012.\u000a\u000aDuring the study period, 859 men and 887 women developed diabetes.\u000a\u000aOverall, those with the lowest risk of developing diabetes were people who drank moderately on a weekly basis, Tolstrup's analysis showed.\u000a\u000aIn terms of volume, 14 alcoholic beverages each week for men and nine beverages each week for women yielded the best results: a 43% and 58% lower risk, respectively, compared to non-drinkers, the researchers found.\u000a\u000a"In principle we can only say something about the five-year risk from this study," said Tolstrup in an email. "However, there is no reason to think that results would be different had we had more years of follow-up." A very long follow-up, for instance, 10 years, would result in drinking and other habits changing and this could "cause more 'noise' in results," said Tolstrup.\u000a\u000aIn terms of frequency, the lowest risk of diabetes was found among those who drank three to four days each week.\u000a\u000aThe team also looked at diabetes risk in relation to what people drank.\u000a\u000aWhen it came to beer, men who drank between one and six each week reduced their risk of diabetes by 21% compared to men hoisting less than one beer each week.\u000a\u000aFor women, the association between beer and diabetes risk was not clear and the same was true for men and spirits. Women, though, appear to have a problematic relationship with spirits. Seven or more drinks of liquor each week was associated with an 83% increased risk of diabetes for women, when compared to women drinking less than one drink of spirits.\u000a\u000aThere shouldn't be much emphasis placed on the results for spirits, Tolstrup said, "because few people were drinking a lot of spirits, most were drinking wine and beer." With 70% of all alcohol drunk by women being wine, the beer results for women are also "unsure."\u000a\u000aThe 'French paradox'\u000a\u000aCrunching the numbers for wine drinkers, the team found that moderate to high wine drinking was associated with a lower risk of diabetes.\u000a\u000aMen and women who drank seven or more glasses of wine each week had a 25% to 30% lower risk of diabetes compared with those who drank less than one glass.\u000a\u000aDr. Etto Eringa and Dr. EH Serné of VU University Medical Center Amsterdam said "moderate consumption of red wine has been shown to be related to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (and cardiovascular disease)" in other population studies, as well.\u000a\u000aEringa and Serné, who have researched how red wine relates to insulin resistance , were not involved in the current study.\u000a\u000a"The potential benefit of red wine on diabetes and heart attacks has been proposed as a solution to the so-called 'French paradox,' the lower risk of heart attacks and diabetes in France despite high consumption of saturated fats (e.g. French cheese)," Eringa and Serné wrote in an email. Studies examining the effects of red wine components on risk factors for type 2 diabetes (such as glucose absorption by muscle tissue) have "largely produced negative results. Therefore the relationship between red wine and health can be explained by a healthier life style of people who drink in a disciplined manner, by unhealthy effects of non-alcoholic beverages such as soda or juices, or both."\u000a\u000aEringa and Serné believe it is the healthier lifestyle of drinkers, rather than lower consumption of juice and soda, that accounts for the "French paradox."\u000a\u000a"People in the Danish study that drank alcohol more frequently had a healthier diet and had a lower BMI," they observed.\u000a\u000aSince few participants reported binging, the researchers say their finding of no clear link between binge drinking and diabetes risk may be due to low statistical power.\u000a\u000aA medical 'dictum'\u000a\u000aDr. William T. Cefalu, chief scientific, medical and mission officer of the American Diabetes Association, said the new study's strengths include the large number of people surveyed, but its weaknesses include an inability to control for other risk factors such as diet. Among people with diabetes, excessive drinking increases the risk of high blood sugar and weight gain, he said.\u000a\u000a"The Association does not recommend that people with or at risk for diabetes consume alcohol if they don't already, but if they do, moderate consumption is recognized as generally safe and potentially of some benefit," said Cefalu.\u000a\u000aDr. Len Horovitz, an internist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, found the report "unsurprising."\u000a\u000a"It's been kind of a dictum for quite a number of years that people who don't drink at all don't live as long as people who drink mildly or moderately," said Horovitz, who added that "the theory behind that was that mild drinking, at least, was good for lower blood pressure, dilated blood vessels," and both of these outcomes translate to better overall circulation.\u000a\u000a"We have to remember that diabetes is not just a problem with blood sugar, it is a problem of microvascular," said Horovitz. Microvascular, which relates to the smallest blood vessels, is positively impacted by alcohol.\u000a\u000aIn terms of research flaws, there's always the issue of honesty and truth when people self-report their habits, said Horovitz. The authors are also not clear about the "stream of input" -- how much body mass index and diet, for example, were taken into account.\u000a\u000a"And what about recreational substances?" Horovitz said. "Drinking, recreational drug use, recreational marijuana use, medicinal marijuana use, these are all things that need to be looked at a little more closely, especially as marijuana becomes something that's more and more legal and more and more medical in its uses."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIn the end, though, the study "generally supports the old notion, again sort of a dictum within medicine, that teetotalers don't live as long as people who do drink."\u000a\u000aIn the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 23.1 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes, though an additional 7.2 million people are suspected of having the disease. The total, then, is 30.3 million Americans or 9.4% of the population living with diabetes, with type 2 diabetes -- the type that can be prevented with a healthy lifestyle -- accounting for up to 95% of these cases.\u000a\u000aGlobally, diabetes among adults over 18 years old has risen from 4.7% or 108 million people in 1980 to 8.5% or 422 million people in 2014 , according to the World Health Organization. Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.\u000a\u000aSince alcohol is related to other diseases and conditions, "any recommendations about how to drink and how much to drink should not be inferred from this study," said Tolstrup. She added that the most important finding of her study is that when it comes to the risk of diabetes, drinking a little bit often -- instead of drinking a lot rarely -- is best.

Both acknowledged the changes and challenges they had undergone, with Arya offering a ray of hope by saying, "Our stories aren't over yet."\u000a\u000aThe same sense of melancholy hung over Arya's encounter with her brother, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright), whose transformation into a mystic seer has left him bearing scant resemblance to the boy who existed when the show began.\u000a\u000aRead More

"He wants to use his city as an example of embracing green technology ... and that's what other cities are doing around the world."\u000a\u000aMany major automakers are also shifting their focus away from traditional combustion engines.

aV(CNN) China is no stranger to contemporary architecture that boggles the mind or appears to side-step common sense, from an LED-lit horseshoe in Huzhou to a glowing teapot in Wuxi. But in 2016, China's State Council released guidelines forbidding the construction of "bizarre" and "odd-shaped" buildings lacking character or cultural heritage, shifting their focus to the "economic, green and beautiful."\u000a\u000aNewly unveiled plans for Liuzhou Forest City, designed by the Italian firm Stefano Boeri Architetti to be built in southern China, certainly seem to fit the bill. The 342-acre, self-contained neighborhood will comprise more than 70 buildings -- including homes, hospitals, hotels, schools and offices -- all of which will be covered with 40,000 trees and almost a million plants. Eventually, up to 30,000 people could call the Forest City home.\u000a\u000a"(This is) the first experiment of the urban environment that's really trying to find a balance with nature," firm principal Stefano Boeri said on the phone from Milan.\u000a\u000aThe plant life is expected to absorb almost 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide and 57 tons of pollutants per year, and produce 900 tons of oxygen a year, while also decreasing the air temperature and providing a new habitat for displaced wildlife. Solar panels on the roofs will collect renewable energy to power the buildings, while geothermal energy will power air-conditioning, adding to the project's green appeal.\u000a\u000aRead More

Cory Gardner\u000a\u000aSince coming to power in 2011, Kim Jong Un has significantly accelerated the regime's nuclear and ballistic missiles tests, and has also launched numerous cyberattacks against the United States and our allies. Last year alone, this regime conducted two nuclear tests and attempted some two dozen ballistic missile launches. It is clear that we are rapidly approaching a point of no return, when Pyongyang will have a capable and proven delivery system for a nuclear warhead to be able to reach and potentially cause great harm to the United States.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump must now make the tough decisions to ensure that his administration will use every tool at its disposal to peacefully denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.

aVA new Senate bill to repeal Obamacare would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 than under current law, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe Republicans' latest attempt to fulfill their years-long pledge would effectively repeal Obamacare in 2020, giving lawmakers until then to come up with a replacement plan.\u000a\u000aThe ramifications of not replacing the law immediately would be severe. Three-quarters of the nation would live in areas with no insurers participating in the individual market by 2026 -- leaving many without an option if they do not have employer-provided or government health insurance, such as Medicare or Medicaid.\u000a\u000aAlso, premiums would about double by 2026, compared to current law, the CBO found.\u000a\u000aIt's unlikely GOP lawmakers will approve this bill, though these frightening figures will make it even harder for them to proceed down this path. House Republican leaders cast aside an attempt to swiftly and simply repeal Obamacare earlier this year after encountering stiff opposition from fellow lawmakers and others, who said it was critical to come up with a replacement bill at the same time.\u000a\u000aThe idea unexpectedly resurfaced earlier this week after Republicans' effort to repeal and replace Obamacare ran aground in the Senate on Monday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would call a vote on a repeal bill modeled on 2015 legislation that was passed by both chambers before being vetoed by then-President Obama.\u000a\u000aThis bill, unveiled Wednesday afternoon, is meant to be a wake-up call for Republican senators, to serve as a reminder that most of them voted for it just two years ago. McConnell is essentially daring Republicans to reverse their vote and support the status quo they've been campaigning against for seven years.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump to GOP senators: 'Inaction is not an option'\u000a\u000aThe CBO score could also pressure Republicans to consider going back to the negotiating table to find a path forward on their more comprehensive health care bill, which would leave 22 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade. That is what President Trump asked them to do on Wednesday during their lunch at the White House, though earlier in the week he called for lawmakers to repeal the Obamacare now and replace it later.\u000a\u000aThe administration pushed back on the report.\u000a\u000a"We continue to believe that CBO's methodology is flawed, and this score fails to take into account the president's full plan, which includes a replacement for Obamacare and administrative actions to reduce costs and expand access to quality, affordable care," a White House official said.\u000a\u000aHere's what the new bill would do:\u000a\u000a-- Get rid of the individual and employer mandates, two of the least favorite provisions of the law, by reducing the penalty to $0. This provision would be retroactive to 2016.\u000a\u000a-- Effectively end Obamacare in 2020 by eliminating the federal subsidies that help people afford individual coverage.\u000a\u000a-- Eliminate Medicaid expansion starting in 2020.\u000a\u000a-- Repeal taxes on the wealthy, health insurers, medical device makers and others.\u000a\u000a-- Defund Planned Parenthood for one year.\u000a\u000a-- Increase funding for substance abuse and mental health needs by $1.5 billion over two years.\u000a\u000aEnacting the legislation would decrease deficits by $473 billion over the next decade, however this doesn't take into account the cost of a replacement plan.\u000a\u000aRelated: Will Obamacare really fail?\u000a\u000aIn some important ways, however, this bill repeals less of Obamacare than the legislation that passed the House and the version that was under consideration in the Senate until this week. It doesn't touch Obamacare's insurance provisions, including the immensely popular protections for those with pre-existing conditions. That will make it more likely to comply with Senate rules that will allow it to be passed with a simple majority.\u000a\u000aAlso, it would not curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program as the House and Senate health care bills would have.\u000a\u000aStill, repealing Obamacare without replacing it would throw the individual market into chaos, prompting insurers to start exiting swiftly. Lawmakers wouldn't have a lot of time to come up with a replacement, said Cynthia Cox, associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u000a\u000aInsurers are mid-negotiation for participating next year. Repeal without a replacement will destabilize the market in 2018. \u2014 Cynthia Cox (@cynthiaccox) July 19, 2017\u000a\u000aSome 17 million fewer people would be insured next year, leaving only an estimated 84% of Americans covered, compared to 90% under current law, the CBO found. Premiums would be roughly 25% higher mainly because many younger and healthier people would drop their coverage since they would no longer be penalized for being uninsured.\u000a\u000aBy 2026, a total of some 59 million people would lack coverage under this bill, compared to 28 million under current law, the agency estimated.\u000a\u000aCNN's Lauren Fox and Dan Merica contributed to this report.

aVKelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Like most parents, my weekends are consumed with getting my girls, ages 9 and 11, to and from various activities.\u000a\u000aThis weekend, we had two soccer games, one sleepover party, two play dates, religious school and an outing with my sister-in-law. We also would have had a baseball double header, but that was canceled due to the rain.\u000a\u000aIn between, there were definitely a few fights and complaints, homework assignments that needed to get done, a house to get ready for not one but two houseguests and, of course, meals to prepare and snacks to pack.\u000a\u000aIt's the same story every weekend and week. My mom jokes that she can't keep up with how crazy our lives are, but I know I'm not alone.\u000a\u000aAnd that is why a recent New York magazine story really resonated with me. Headlined "Just like Burnout at Work, It's Possible to Burn Out on Parenting," the story talked about a recent survey of more than 2,000 parents, conducted by researchers in Belgium. They found that just as people can burn out from their professional jobs, mothers and fathers can burn out, too.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, found that close to 13% of the parents surveyed, 12.9% of mothers and 11.6% of fathers, had what the researchers called "high burnout." That meant they felt exhausted, less productive and competent and emotionally withdrawn -- qualities that are similar to professional burnout -- at least once a week.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure I needed a study to tell me parental burnout is real, and neither did many of the parents I contacted via social media and email. What I wanted to find out from parents is why parents today may be experiencing burnout more than parents did in previous generations and what we can do about it.\u000a\u000aPressure to be a 'superhero in everything'\u000a\u000aLyss Stern is author of "Motherhood is a B#tch!"\u000a\u000aBy all accounts, Lyss Stern seems like the mother who has it all together. A mom of three, she built a thriving business called Divalysscious Moms, a networking and event company for New York City mothers, creating what she calls "fabuLyss" opportunities for mothers to connect and recharge.\u000a\u000aBut Stern was so busy taking care of her business; her three kids, who are now 3, 9 and 13; and her husband and dealing with the death of her father that she never took time for herself. About a year and a half ago, she said, she hit rock bottom and found herself crying on a rock during a retreat in Massachusetts.\u000a\u000a"I think I was just overwhelmed by everything," said Stern. "I think at that moment, it was like my 'aha' moment: 'Lyss, you need to get your life back on track. You need to start taking care of yourself.' "\u000a\u000aShe was burned out, she said, and experienced another "aha" moment when she returned home.\u000a\u000aThis parenting manual includes tips for moms to combat parental burnout.\u000a\u000a"I turned to my husband, I said, 'I need to make changes. I need to take baby steps, because I want to get healthy, healthy physically and healthy mentally, so I could be the best mom,' " said Stern, who wrote about her journey in the hopes of inspiring other burned out mothers in the just released book "Motherhood is a B#tch! 10 Steps to Regaining Your Sanity, Sexiness, and Inner Diva."\u000a\u000aHer mom (and my mom, too!) certainly wouldn't say they were burning out as parents when they raised us, said Stern. "Today, so many moms have these high-powered jobs, and they have the kids, and we want to be the best at our jobs, and you want to be the best with your kids, and then you want to sometimes take time for yourself, and you feel guilty, but you can't feel guilty. You're allowed to go to a movie with your husband. You're allowed to go to a movie with your friend without having a breakdown."\u000a\u000aThe "modern mindset" that you have to essentially be a "superhero in everything you do" is part of the problem, said Vanina Nikolova, a mom of two boys, ages 2½ and 6, in San Jose, California. Nikolova is the senior data analyst for Power to Fly, which connects women to remote opportunities in tech and prides itself on transforming how women are treated at work.\u000a\u000aShe said parenting burnout is so real that at times, she dreams someone would kidnap her for two weeks so she can finally get some rest from the kids, housework, co-sleeping with a toddler, food fights and everything else that comes along with raising two young boys.\u000a\u000a"You have to excel at work. You have to excel in your relationship. You have to excel in society. You have to be a great parent who feeds the kids with organic food, stimulates their brains while still in uterus, finds the right balance between protecting them and yet exposing them to the real world, shuttles them to sports, arts," and the list goes on and on, said Nikolova. "A supercomputer would go crazy. How about a simple human being!"\u000a\u000aParenting in social media age\u000a\u000aSocial media certainly hasn't helped, many parents said.\u000a\u000a"Gone are the days of backyard birthday parties with a homemade cake, a peanut hunt and a game of 'drop a clothes pin in the bottle,' " said Shelby Rideout, founder of Bright Signs Learning, a children's educational company that uses sign language to teach early reading concepts. "Thanks to Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram, parents now get to feel 'less than' for throwing that kind of party. These exaggerations on social media become a measuring stick in which to gauge your success or failure as a parent," said Rideout, a parent of four, ranging in age from 21 months to 6 years.\u000a\u000aParents exhaust themselves trying to keep up with the false standard of perfection they see around them, she said. "It doesn't seem to matter that these family portraits conjured up on social media do not offer a true depiction of what families are really going through. This is a perfect recipe for burnout."\u000a\u000aFor working parents, there is the pressure to excel in your career and master the work/life balance, while giving your children everything you never had to ensure that they turn into well-rounded, happy and successful adults, said writer Jennifer Bosse, a mom of two boys ages 4 and 6 in Fort Mill, South Carolina, who has contributed to the Huffington Post, Scary Mommy and Mamalode. For stay-at-home parents like herself, there are pressures too, she said.\u000a\u000a"There is the underlying need to feel valued and validated within society (a society which still places a higher value on what you provide to the job force)," she said. "Socializing with other adults can be difficult, the days long, the routine monotonous and the job, overall, relatively thankless."\u000a\u000aBosse, whose husband travels frequently for work, said she has definitely experienced burnout, and for her, the experience is one of a "complete shutdown."\u000a\u000a"I feel touched out, emotionally low and mentally blank. I am merely there," she said. What has helped her is finding outlets outside of home and openly communicating with her husband about her needs. "I was always afraid of saying I needed a break because I thought it would make me sound like a horrible mother, but as I progress in this journey, I realize that everyone needs time to realign."\u000a\u000aThe need for 'me' time\u000a\u000aFinding that "me" time is key, many parents said. Nikki Little, a mother of 4-year-old twin boys, said she and her husband agreed from day one that it is important that they both get time for themselves.\u000a\u000aThey recently trained for the same half-marathon and alternated their run days so one would run and the other would put the boys to bed. "My husband and I both want each other to feel like we can have our 'me' time without guilt -- which is why we encourage each other to take that time as needed, with the mutual agreement of not committing to so much that it takes significant time away from being together as a family," said Little, a social media director for a public relations firm.\u000a\u000aWhat pains her, she said, is when she hears from moms who say they truly do everything when it comes to parenting while their husbands enjoy plenty of "me" time.\u000a\u000a"That's not acceptable in my book. It is not a badge of honor to say you sacrifice everything for your family and put yourself last. Self-care and 'me' time are so, so important to avoid parental burnout," she said.\u000a\u000aJanis Brett Elspas had four children born in the same year, a singleton plus triplets, so she knows a thing or two about burnout. Up until the age of 3, her four kids were home with her all day. She remembers the relief she felt when her husband returned home from work and she could do basic things for herself that she was neglecting, like taking a shower, going to the dentist for an overdue appointment or even reading a book in a peaceful bedroom to get her energy back.\u000a\u000a"I just don't know how single parents raise their children without a second pair of hands to help. I'm convinced that there are few moms or dads out there who can deal with kids 24/7," said Elspas, founder of The Mommy Blog Expert.\u000a\u000aHer kids are now all grown and in college, but looking back, she thinks today's parents of young kids are even at higher risk for parental burnout than she was, in part because there are more single parents and households in which both parents need to work out of necessity. On top of that, there is the impact of technology.\u000a\u000a"Burnout is also fueled by the constant vigilance, the need to deal with the ever-increased speed of technology, the internet and all the dangers in the world we now have to protect our children against," she said.\u000a\u000aIs 'burnout' an excuse?\u000a\u000aMindee Hardin, a mom of six in Beaverton, Oregon, said that if parents are truly feeling "burnt out," they should examine why they are feeling that way and fix it as soon as possible. She worries that some parents may use it as an excuse to check out of engaging with their kids. She believes far too many parents are doing that already.\u000a\u000a"A large percentage of parents are already so selfish with the majority of their time being spent on many things besides investing in their kids, the last thing they need is one more excuse to disconnect the only hour a day they are engaging as it is," said Hardin, founder of Juice Box Consulting , where she helps moms make the best career choices for their family needs.\u000a\u000aShe says she overworked herself into a divorce and bankruptcy about seven years ago and has been trying not to make the same career, marriage and mothering mistakes in her second marriage. She wrote about her experience in her new book "Boogie Wiped: The Story of My Mom Life Crisis."\u000a\u000aShe believes the growing depression and suicide issues in tweens and teens is directly related to parents who "can't seem to enjoy their company long enough to have a meal with them once a day," she said. "Disconnected, overcommitted, exhausted parents + ignored, socially connected kids = a void so big in a child's heart it can't ever be filled," Hardin wrote in an email. "It's an epidemic in my opinion."\u000a\u000aLouise Sattler, a mom of two grown children, said the need to compete is driving some of the burnout parents feel today. "For some reason, we are not happy being 'just average,' " she said.\u000a\u000a"Moms in particular need to be 200% at everything. We need to give ourselves permission to be just 'average' at some parts of our lives and perhaps let other aspects go. That load of laundry can wait until tomorrow, as reading an extra bedtime story to your child is more important," said Sattler, co-founder of 411 Voices , a collective of professionals with social media experience.\u000a\u000aStern, the author of "Motherhood is a B#tch!" wholeheartedly agrees. "Everybody has to stop looking at everybody else and look to within," she said. "My kids this morning had Frosted Flakes for breakfast. They had sugary cereal. Now, the past two days, they had eggs, but today they didn't have eggs. ... Mothers, I'm sure, will come after me and say, 'Lyss Stern is a terrible mother, because she gave her kids Frosted Flakes for breakfast today,' but at the end of the day, it's OK."\u000a\u000aShe added, "We all need to let go of whatever that perfect image is in our heads and be content and happy with who we are and do the best job that we can do, because nobody knows what goes on behind anyone's closed doors at the end of the day."\u000a\u000aBurnout is certainly not just an issue for mothers. As the recent study revealed, almost the same number of fathers as mothers said they were experiencing high burnout.\u000a\u000aBuzz Bishop, a father of two, ages 7 and 9, jokes that he's just getting started with this thing called parenting. But he shares an interesting -- and hopefully helpful -- perspective about burnout.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Here's the thing about burnout: As soon as you're just about done, things change. An infant eventually learns to sleep through the night; a toddler will become toilet trained. When they walk, you don't have to pack a stroller when you go out. At meals, they eventually learn to feed themselves," said Bishop, a radio host in Calgary, Alberta, who writes about parenting at DadCAMP.\u000a\u000aIf you are feeling burned out as a parent, just hang in there, says Bishop. "The rules of the game will change soon enough, and you'll have an entirely different game to play, which may or may not be more fun. As my brother used to say, 'Whoever called them the terrible twos never had a 3-year-old.' "\u000a\u000aOr a tween or a teen, many parents might add.

aV(CNN) Maegan Sheiman and her husband, Josh, just wanted to have a baby. But it was never going to be that simple.\u000a\u000aThe quest to grow their family has been a roller coaster ride of exciting ups and terrifying downs. "Every good thing that happened, something bad would happen," she said.\u000a\u000aBut with an amazing amount of love and care, their hope has a reason to thrive.\u000a\u000aDefying the odds\u000a\u000aSheiman, 33, has two rare diseases: medullary sponge kidney disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The kidney disease causes her body to create and pass a multitude of kidney stones. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare genetic disease that affects connective tissue and blood vessels.\u000a\u000aNeither was confirmed until she encountered complications during her first pregnancy in 2005, during a previous marriage. She gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Isabella, in 2006, but had a hysterectomy that year.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans searched for an egg donor as well as a surrogate in 2015, two years after getting married. They found a donor with a strong resemblance and similar background. They were also excited to locate a surrogate, LaToya, in their hometown of Humble, Texas. LaToya had had a healthy child of her own and was eager to help other families bring children into the world.\u000a\u000a"I anticipated whoever would be carrying our baby would end up being part of our family forever," Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aMaegan Sheiman with LaToya and her daughter while LaToya was pregnant with Beckham.\u000a\u000aSheiman and LaToya bonded quickly and easily. LaToya agreed to change to an all-organic diet and was happy to have Sheiman accompany her to every appointment. They texted every day.\u000a\u000aSheiman's daughter, Isabella, was hoping for a baby brother. She received her wish when a faint line showed up on LaToya's pregnancy test and the Sheimans threw a gender reveal party at the end of 2015. The baby was due on May 5, Cinco de Mayo. They joked that he was destined to be a party baby.\u000a\u000aBut Sheiman knew that something was wrong when she received a scared phone call from LaToya late one night, not long after Josh's birthday in January 2016. LaToya was being rushed to the hospital with bleeding.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans rushed to the hospital. Only one person was allowed into the cramped room in the maternity ward, so Maegan went in. LaToya was screaming, in excruciating pain.\u000a\u000a"I knew something bad was happening," Sheiman recalled. "I didn't think that he would be born alive."\u000a\u000aDoctors told her the baby was coming, and there wouldn't even be time to give LaToya medication.\u000a\u000aForty-five minutes later, on January 19, Beckham came into the world at 24 weeks gestation, weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces. The nurses rushed him into an incubator and kept him warm to ensure that he would survive. Doctors still aren't sure what caused the early birth.\u000a\u000a"I got a glimpse of him and have never seen anything so small in my life," Sheiman said. "I did not know that a human could be that small and look like a human. He had a strong heartbeat, and he came out kicking like crazy. I'll never forget it. It was ironic, because his name is Beckham," like the soccer star.\u000a\u000aBaby Beckham in the neonatal intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aSheiman was told that Beckham would be rushed to Texas Children's Hospital, an hour away through rush-hour traffic in Houston. That's when she realized her husband had been in the waiting room the entire time, unaware of what was happening.\u000a\u000aWhen he saw Beckham, he asked in shock, "Is that the baby?"\u000a\u000aNew normal at the NICU\u000a\u000aDr. Mona Khan, a neonatologist at Texas Children's, greeted the stunned Sheimans when they arrived. Beckham had been placed in an incubator and was connected through tubes and IVs to numerous machines and devices.\u000a\u000aKhan could tell how nervous they were. Together, they pulled stools together around Beckham's incubator and talked about what to expect. Sheiman had plenty of questions.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans were told not to be too hopeful the first week, considered the "honeymoon phase" in which things can initially go well before going horribly wrong.\u000a\u000aA family advocacy group at the hospital gave Sheiman a notebook and told her to document everything. She wrote down every stat, every oxygen measurement, every discussion with every doctor and the trends tracking her son's improvements and declines. It helped her understand and feel in control of things.\u000a\u000aThe hospital staff impressed upon Sheiman how important her presence would be, not just to make critical decisions but to bond with a baby she couldn't even touch.\u000a\u000aA physical therapist holds Beckham in the NICU.\u000a\u000aShe was able to take time off from her consulting work as a project manager thanks to the generosity of her co-workers, who contributed their time off to carry her to August 1. This was vital for the family breadwinner.\u000a\u000a"We treat the family as part of the medical team," Khan said. "Every piece of information has to be discussed with them, and they have to feel that they are part of the decision-making process. We are all advocates for these babies, but they are their baby's strongest advocates."\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans moved into the Ronald McDonald House to be close to Beckham and see him every day for the first two months.\u000a\u000aBeckham was tiny, his head the size of a kiwi. An incubator monitored heat and humidity to keep his frail, bright pink, almost translucent skin from drying out. A bit of sticky fabric used with an instrument to detect oxygen ripped the skin off his foot.\u000a\u000aAnd then, a succession of issues arose: bowel perforation and surgery to repair it, a hernia, brain bleeds, heart defects and issues, a blood clot, a staph infection, pulmonary hypertension and even the threat of blindness. Those are just the big ones, Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aBeckham going into one of his many surgeries.\u000a\u000aKhan and the entire medical team became invested in taking care of Beckham. On nights when things looked bad, the attending physician would pull up a cot and sleep next to him. Even nurses who weren't assigned to him would ask Khan how he was doing each day.\u000a\u000a"You get really invested," Khan said. "This is your patient. You are taking care of them, and there is so much that is happening. Anytime there is a bad outcome, there is a slice of your soul that is taken away. With us, it's definitely emotional. Health care professionals, respiratory therapists, nurses, physical therapists -- everyone was very invested and involved. He has a special place in a lot of people's hearts."\u000a\u000aSheiman holds Beckham for the first time.\u000a\u000aIn addition to providing around-the-clock care, the doctors talked with Sheiman about "kangaroo care," in which mothers are encouraged to hold their babies with skin-to-skin contact.\u000a\u000aSheiman held Beckham for the first time two weeks after he was born. It took four people at the hospital, as well as her husband, to help tape all the boy's tubes and wires to her shoulder so she could hold him without doing any damage.\u000a\u000a"He was so small, I didn't feel like I was holding anything," Sheiman said. "But I was so excited to finally hold him and have that bonding time I had been craving."\u000a\u000aEvery time she held him through the kangaroo care method, his oxygen levels would improve. "If you had not been there every day, he would've ended up with a breathing tube surgically implanted in his neck," the doctors told her.\u000a\u000a"It gives such a good feeling to parents to be doing something to help their baby," Khan said. "What greater feeling is that?"\u000a\u000aA poem of gratitude\u000a\u000aMaegan, Josh, Isabella and Beckham Sheiman.\u000a\u000aIn April, Beckham finally got to meet his sister. Isabella was so happy she cried while smiling her biggest smile, Sheiman said. It laid the groundwork for a deep bond. If Beckham doesn't feel like smiling, he needs only to see his sister to start laughing again.\u000a\u000aLaToya recovered but faces long-term consequences. Any future children will be at risk of being born prematurely. The single mother putting herself through law school is an inspiring superhero, Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aAlthough LaToya felt guilty about what happened to Beckham, Sheiman insisted it wasn't her fault and urged her to come see Beckham. Now, they visit regularly.\u000a\u000aAfter 185 days in the NICU, Beckham went home for the first time in July. He's still on oxygen and can't be around other children because of the dangers of flu season, but the Sheimans are hopeful for the future.\u000a\u000aEven when he's having blood drawn every month or enduring painful procedures, he remains "the happiest baby," Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aBeckham celebrates his first birthday.\u000a\u000aIn January, Beckham turned 1 year old. All of his doctors and nurses were invited to his birthday party. Sheiman wanted to deliver a speech to thank everyone who cared for Beckham. It turned into a poem.\u000a\u000a"Everyone put their heart and soul into saving his life," Sheiman said. "They needed to know how much it meant to us. While we were there for 185 days, we won't forget it. They're practically raising our kids."\u000a\u000aShe shared the poem at the party but also created cards and had them sent to the hospital. The poem was also included in a hospital-wide newsletter two weeks ago.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"It was beautiful," Khan said. "Everybody was just really overwhelmed. It's a tear-jerker, full of emotions and very raw.\u000a\u000a"We love happy endings. We call them our graduates, these little babies that have been here for so long. We love seeing them. It makes us feel that we are doing something that makes it all worth it."\u000a\u000aBeckham still has quite a journey ahead of him, but the Sheimans remain hopeful.\u000a\u000a"He was not born normal, and I don't think he will be a normal kid," Sheiman said. "I want him to grow up to be happy and healthy, but however he turns out is however he turns out, and he will always be extra special, and he will have big things planned for his life."\u000a\u000aBeckham, then and now.\u000a\u000aThe full text of Sheiman's poem is below:\u000a\u000aI'm just a mother not big and not small\u000a\u000aAn ordinary mother and that is all\u000a\u000aI have a child my sweet baby boy\u000a\u000aWho has never been just an ordinary boy\u000a\u000aHe came to this world 1 pound and some ounces\u000a\u000aHis parents unsure if they could announce\u000a\u000aHis early arrival of 24 weeks\u000a\u000aAt 12 inches long we weren't ready to meet\u000a\u000aTo the NICU is where we were quickly sent\u000a\u000aOverwhelmed by this new place our time would be spent\u000a\u000aYou were covered in tubes and kept in a case\u000a\u000aOn meds and support, what on Earth was this place?\u000a\u000aNoisy and dark we were filled with fear\u000a\u000aAll the while we could not hold you near\u000a\u000aSo overcome by percentages and numbers\u000a\u000aTreatments and surgeries, survival rates stole our slumber\u000a\u000aThrough incubators, warmers, lights and lines\u000a\u000aOne day we were told you would run out of time\u000a\u000aWe cried so hard and couldn't stay strong\u000a\u000aSo you showed everyone that you could hold on\u000a\u000aWhen one thing was fixed another would break\u000a\u000aFrom your bowels to infection, lungs and your brain\u000a\u000aYour heart and your liver what more could go wrong\u000a\u000aYou never gave up you always stayed strong\u000a\u000aYou had countless transfusions, PICS and scans\u000a\u000aThe blood tests sometimes just got out of hand\u000a\u000aThe numbers we tracked and monitors watched\u000a\u000aWas all forgotten once in my arms you were caught\u000a\u000aBut there's more to this boy than his numbers and stats\u000a\u000aHis procedures and therapies, appointments and chats\u000a\u000aIt's not how he started that makes him so grand\u000a\u000aBut what he accomplished and who held his hand.\u000a\u000aIt's the doctors and nurses, therapists and techs\u000a\u000aWho have given their all to save our sweet Becks\u000a\u000aWho studied and fought, collaborated and led\u000a\u000aAnd stopped at nothing to get this boy fed\u000a\u000aIt's not just our preemie who suffered and fought\u000a\u000aBut also his team who we care for a lot\u000a\u000aIt's more than the meds and treatment plans given\u000a\u000aIt's the comfort and guidance the things that were hidden\u000a\u000aThe things that you know others won't see\u000a\u000aOnly the families you treat and have to let be\u000a\u000aWe come and we go and you send us away\u000a\u000aYou jokingly tell us to never come back your way\u000a\u000aBut we never forget the 185 days\u000a\u000aWhere we were all a family with this boy to raise\u000a\u000aTo help him to grow and fight and to live\u000a\u000aSo that he may go home and love we can give\u000a\u000aWe appreciate all you have sacrificed\u000a\u000aAnd a quick goodbye just doesn't suffice\u000a\u000aYou will always be family this we know\u000a\u000aAnd I hope you continue to watch Beckham grow\u000a\u000aIt is because of you that he is here\u000a\u000aIn our hearts, you, we hold so very dear\u000a\u000aWe love you so much and it was so hard to go\u000a\u000aYou have given our family this time to grow\u000a\u000aSure it's been hard he has the scars to prove it\u000a\u000aHis machines and that g tube how we want to remove it!\u000a\u000aHe loves to set his alarms off every night\u000a\u000aAnd yank on his tubes to give us a fright\u000a\u000aNow he is one he smiles and he laughs\u000a\u000aHe grabs and he cries and he bites his giraffe\u000a\u000aHe sits and he stands and even rolls over\u000a\u000aHe screams and he bangs until mommy comes over\u000a\u000aHe may still have quite a long way to go\u000a\u000aAnd the whole way we know we'll be kept on our toes\u000a\u000aHe will never be ordinary this we all know\u000a\u000aAnd before we all know it he'll be on the go\u000a\u000aI have no doubt he will continue to amaze\u000a\u000aWe will ooo we will ahhh at all of his ways\u000a\u000aAs he shows us what it truly means to overcome\u000a\u000aThis life he fought for he surely has won\u000a\u000aSo I say happy birthday to my un ordinary boy\u000a\u000aWho has given us worry overcome by joy\u000a\u000aWhat a miracle he is to be here in this world\u000a\u000aHe has made this "just mom" an un ordinary girl

He has won many awards and has produced several books, including "The Kingdom of Coral: Australia's Great Barrier Reef." He is a member of the Academy of Achievement, International Diving Hall of Fame, Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and a Rolex Ambassador. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Hold your pinky nail out in front of you. Now divide your nail into quarters. This is the size of one of the most remarkable animals in the world -- the coral polyp. The life of this tiny creature represents a biological process that helps produce geological fact in the form of coral reefs. These minute organisms are the building blocks of The Great Barrier Reef, which at 1,400 miles long is the largest living structure on Earth -- visible even from space.\u000a\u000aDavid Doubilet\u000a\u000aSome of my most memorable moments in the sea have occurred in this remarkable ocean ecosystem. One mid-October night in the Australian spring our team, led by Dr. Peter Harrison, sank beneath the surface off Heron Island into a dark world that that resembled a galaxy of stars created by many different species of reef-building corals that release their eggs and sperm into a warm sea with precision timing in a single night. These bundles of eggs and sperm combine to eventually produce coral larvae. The morning sea is coated with oily pink coral spawn, and a tangy coralline odor, unlike any other smell in the world, hangs in the humid air, evidence of millions of years of evolution and one of the most intricate mass spawning events in the world.\u000a\u000aToday, this living structure is facing an uncertain future in a warming sea.\u000a\u000aAcropora millepora release egg and sperm bundles that rise to the surface, creating a sea that resembles a starry night in the waters off Heron Island.\u000a\u000aSequential coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 have affected nearly 900 miles of the reef. Thermal stress causes the coral polyp to lose its symbiotic algae, which provides valuable nutrients and gives coral its color. If temperatures return to normal quickly, coral can recover with time. But these unprecedented back-to-back bleaching events give the already stressed coral little time to recover. The reef is literally in hot water, living under the Damoclean sword of ocean acidification and rising sea levels.\u000a\u000aThe Great Barrier Reef may be located in Queensland, Australia, but it really belongs to the world as the most well-known of all corals reefs on our planet. I am confident that even the most landlocked of Americans in the heartland know what it is and vaguely where it is.\u000a\u000aRead More

Krill is a licensed attorney, board certified alcohol and drug counselor, author and advocate. He is the director of the Legal Professionals Program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation.

My condolences and best wishes to the Ford family today". --Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, via Twitter.\u000a\u000aPatrick R. Krill\u000a\u000aAs is now customary with the passing of public figures, social media exploded with condolences for the family of the late Mayor Rob Ford on Tuesday, making it clear that a man once the subject of merciless ridicule was now being afforded a level of sympathy and kindness unfathomable just a few short years ago.\u000a\u000aAcross the Internet and media, punchlines have largely been replaced by dignified tributes, and crude caricatures by staid, objective reporting. Why? Because Rob Ford, alive as an alcoholic, was apparently less deserving of compassion and understanding than Rob Ford, now dead from cancer.\u000a\u000aTrue, the fond remembrances and generous consolations are heartening, refreshing expressions of decency towards a family in grieving, and yes, they should be acknowledged and welcomed as such. To be clear, however, they are also the indisputable byproduct of the type of image makeover nobody wants \u2014 a cancer diagnosis.\u000a\u000aFueling Ford's trajectory from viciously mocked to politely mourned, his cancer demonstrated how malleable our emotional responses are in light of our moralizations. Rob Ford was, after all, a man who suffered from two life-threatening diseases but garnered sympathy for only one. Perhaps that dichotomy is worth us, as a society, examining.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVEvery parent worries about online predators at some point. And while it's smart to be cautious, the facts show that it's actually fairly rare for kids to be contacted by adult strangers seeking sexual communication. Of course it's natural to be concerned when your kid goes into an unknown world. But instead of acting out of fear, arm yourself with the facts so that you can help your kids be smart, cautious, and savvy. If the concerns below ring true, use some of these strategies to be proactive in protecting your kids -- they'll make your kid safer and help you feel a lot better.\u000a\u000aThe concern: Every time I read the news, it feels like there's an article about some creep contacting a kid in a game.\u000a\u000aThe facts:\u000a\u000aThe strategy: More than inspiring fear in our kids, we want to arm them with information. So when you talk to your kid, tell them there's a chance someone could approach them online to get personal information, exchange pictures, and/or meet in person, and it might be someone who feels like an online friend. It's not the norm, and it's not a reason to be afraid all the time. It's simply a reason to be aware and know that if someone starts asking for personal information or talking about sexual stuff, it's time to get help from an adult.\u000a\u000aThe concern: I can't keep up with all of the media my kid is into, so I don't know what games and apps to keep my eye on.\u000a\u000aThe facts:\u000a\u000aAccording to the New England Journal of Public Policy, contact with online predators happens mostly in chat rooms, on social media, or in the chat feature of a multiplayer game (Roblox, Minecraft, Clash of Clans, World of Warcraft, and so on).\u000a\u000aMost games meant for kids -- like Roblox and Animal Jam -- have built-in features and settings that are designed to prevent inappropriate comments and chat. Though they're often imperfect, they do help.\u000a\u000aGames that aren't designed only for kids have fewer controls, settings, and safeguards.\u000a\u000aAny app or online space that allows contact with strangers without moderation or age verification can allow contact between kids and adult strangers.\u000a\u000aTeens sometimes visit adult sites, chat rooms, and dating apps out of curiosity about sex and romance.\u000a\u000aThe strategy: First, stay on top of what your kid is doing online by asking them which apps, games, and other tech they use. If they're on social media, friend or follow them. Set rules about First, stay on top of what your kid is doing online by asking them which apps, games, and other tech they use. If they're on social media, friend or follow them. Set rules about times and places for device use -- for example, banning phones and tablets from bedrooms. Find out how they chat -- is it through an app or through their phone's SMS texting? (If they're using an app, it won't be easy for you to see it, so ask to do occasional spot checks.) Make rules around who they can chat with -- for instance, only people they know in real life. If your kid's a gamer, use these questions to probe deeper: Do you like multiplayer games -- and why? Do you chat with others while you're gaming? What's been your experience so far? What would you do if someone you didn't know contacted you? Help them set privacy settings to limit the contacts in their games.\u000a\u000aThe concern: I don't even understand how this works -- does an adult pose as a kid, then ask to meet?\u000a\u000aThe facts:\u000a\u000aOnly 5 percent of online predators pretend they're kids. Most reveal that they're older -- which is especially appealing to 12-to-15-year-olds who are most often targeted.\u000a\u000aSome predators initiate sexual talk or request pictures immediately and back off if refused. They're in it for an immediate result.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, some predators engage in "bunny hunting," which is the process of picking a potential victim for "grooming": They'll look at social media posts and public chats to learn about the kid first.\u000a\u000aOnce they've selected someone, they may begin the grooming phase, which often involves friending the target's contacts, engaging in increasingly personal conversations to build trust, taking the conversation to other platforms (like instant messaging), requesting pictures, and finally requesting offline contact.\u000a\u000aSometimes if a kid shares one compromising picture, a predator will engage in "sextortion," which involves demanding more pictures or contact under threat of exposure or harm.\u000a\u000aThe strategy: We often tell kids not to talk to strangers or share personal information, but a kid's online relationships can feel just as real as their offline ones. So before they start chatting with anyone online, kids need to know some basic digital citizenship and online privacy information. For instance, kids should never share a phone number, address, or even last name with someone they've never met. Also, sharing sexy pictures or being overtly sexual online leaves an unwanted legacy, with or without creepy adults, so we need to teach kids about being mindful about their We often tell kids not to talk to strangers or share personal information, but a kid's online relationships can feel just as real as their offline ones.

Plus, having nude pictures of a minor -- even if you are a minor -- is against the law and teens can get into legal trouble as a result. Finally, it's important to teach kids that if someone is asking a kid for sexy pictures or chat, that person is not a friend, no matter how cool or understanding they seem.\u000a\u000aThe concern: How would I even know if this is happening to my kid if they don't come out and tell me?\u000a\u000aThe facts:\u000a\u000aPredators target kids who post revealing pictures, divulge past sexual abuse, and/or engage in sexual talk online.\u000a\u000aThere's some conflicting research about what ages are most at-risk, but 12 to 15 seems to be prime time, and girls are more frequent victims.\u000a\u000aTeen boys who are questioning their sexuality are the second-most targeted group because they often feel talking about it online is safer than sharing in real life.\u000a\u000aSometimes, teens egg each other on to pursue contact with strangers online, and it can feel like a game.\u000a\u000aTeens want to feel special, validated, attractive, and understood at a time when they're separating from their parents, so an older "friend" who's very interested in them can feel exciting and special.\u000a\u000aMost often, teens engage in relationships with predators willingly, though they often keep them secret.\u000a\u000aIf your kid withdraws and becomes secretive around a device (hiding the screen, clicking from a window suddenly), it could be an indicator.\u000a\u000aPhone calls and gifts from unknown people are possible signs.\u000a\u000aPorn on the device your kid uses might be a sign.\u000a\u000aThe strategy: The tricky part is that most tweens and teens withdraw and are sometimes secretive; it's part of their development.

Instead, gather evidence: Take screenshots, save communications, and so on. Talk with your kid about the details without making them feel like it's their fault or that they're in trouble. Then report it to the platform or service your kid is using, block the person, and find the reporting features on other apps and games your kid uses together. Finally, contact the police. Even though it may seem like a one-time thing, that it's over, or you don't want to make it a big deal, it's best to let the authorities know in case the person is a known offender and to prevent them from doing it to other kids.

Unrest continued to sweep through the country after a new legislative assembly was inaugurated following a controversial election on July 30. The new assembly has wide-ranging powers and is expected to rewrite the Venezuelan constitution at Maduro's behest. Opposition supporters, who see the vote as a power grab and an erosion of democracy, boycotted and staged demonstrations against the vote.

aVCNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR) is pleased to announce that CNN has become the first organization to be granted a Part 107 waiver by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fly small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) over people for closed-set motion picture and television filming. CNN previously received the first-ever waiver granted by the FAA to fly UAS over members of the public for media coverage, including newsgathering and reporting activities.\u000a\u000aCNN\u2019s successful waiver application builds on its longstanding commitment to moving UAS policies forward for news organizations. In 2015, CNN was selected by the FAA as one of the first three industry \u201cPathfinders\u201d to develop safe uses of UAS in newsgathering, particularly in urban populated areas. This approval builds on CNN's closed set filming authority previously granted under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012.\u000a\u000a"We are delighted the FAA has approved CNN's application for closed set filming authority under Part 107," said Greg Agvent, Senior Director of National Newsgathering Technology and CNN AIR. "We are grateful for the opportunity to work with the FAA to move UAS forward for newsgatherers and filmmakers, and for the commercial UAS industry at large."\u000a\u000aThe new waiver allows CNN AIR to operate a diverse range of UAS over uncovered people who are participating in filming operations. As part of the waiver approval process, CNN demonstrated to the FAA that its operations could be conducted safely.

aVMichael D'Antonio is the author of the new book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Given a straighforward opportunity to disavow the most dangerous brand of hatred in American history, the man who has declared, "I'm, like, a really smart person" couldn't do it.\u000a\u000a"I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists," said Donald Trump in a response to CNN's Jake Tapper. "So I don't know. I don't know -- did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists."\u000a\u000aThe statement was classic Trump: a chopped salad made out of words. But the two parts were clear. "I know nothing about David Duke," he said. "I know nothing about white supremacists." (Trump later tweeted a disavowal.)\u000a\u000aEvery literate American adult, and certainly anyone running for president, must know that Duke is the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and that white supremacists promote a violently racist ideology that plagues America.\u000a\u000aThe 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, including 21 kids in a daycare center, was associated with if not inspired by white supremacy.\u000a\u000aSince 9/11 white supremacists and other domestic terrorists have carried out more deadly attacks on American soil than Muslim extremists. It was a white supremacist who killed nine people at a Bible study at a Charleston, South Carolina, church last summer.\u000a\u000aConcern about racist support for Trump arose last week when David Duke said on Facebook that he liked Trump's stands on certain issues and the way the candidate exposed "lies" perpetrated by the press and believed he will ensure "that White-Americans are allowed to preserve and promote their heritage and interests just as all other groups are allowed to do."\u000a\u000aWhen first informed of Duke's support on Friday, Trump didn't have any trouble recognizing the name. "David Duke endorsed me?" he said. "OK, all right. I disavow, OK?" This makes sense, given the fact that Duke is notorious for hate-mongering and Trump named him years ago when he explained why he dropped out of the old Reform Party. Back then, and again on Friday, he knew who Duke was and seemed to recognize that he's political poison.\u000a\u000aTrump's tune changed 48 hours before polls would open for Super Tuesday primaries, many of them in Southern states. Suddenly he was unable to place Duke's name and he didn't know a thing about the movement that keeps white racist extremism alive in America.\u000a\u000aThis from a fellow who is famous for recalling every detail of every deal he ever made and who never forgets those who offend him. If Duke was so bad that his presence drove Trump out of the Reform Party, it's unlikely he's forgotten him.\u000a\u000aWhat's going on here? As someone who has spent many hours with Trump and devoted two years to piecing together the story of his life, I can tell you that Trump is not speaking out of ignorance. He is, as he says, "very smart," and he understands the effects of what he says. And he has been signaling where he stands when it comes to race for many years.\u000a\u000aBefore declaring for president, Trump spent much of the Obama presidency as the loudest voice of the "birthers" who repeatedly claimed that Barack Obama was born, not in Hawaii, as documents prove, but abroad. And therefore he was not a U.S. citizen, and not a legitimate president, in Trump's eyes.\u000a\u000aBirtherism was a barely disguised effort to paint the first black president as an un-American other and was energized by racial animus. Trump played the game long after others disavowed it and went further, suggesting the President might not be a Christian, as he says, but perhaps instead a Muslim.\u000a\u000aThe insinuation, like Trump's suggestion that the truth about Obama's college years was somehow clouded, was a divisive kind of gutter politics.\u000a\u000aAlways comfortable going further than others, Trump was the man who responded to the arrest of five minority youths in the 1989 assault of a jogger in New York's Central Park with newspaper ads that said, "Bring Back The Death Penalty, Bring Back the Police."\u000a\u000aWhen Trump and I discussed the five -- who were coerced into false confessions but eventually cleared of the crime -- he wasn't interested in discussing any part of it except for his belief that they were bad characters who deserved no consideration for the years they spent in prison.\u000a\u000aThe Trump record on race also includes the ridiculous assertion, made in a TV interview with Bryant Gumbel, that "A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market."\u000a\u000aTrump also appeared as a witness at a congressional hearing on Indian casinos -- they were his competitors -- and said, "Organized crime is rampant on Indian reservations." He then offered his belief that Native Americans at the hearing where he spoke "don't look like Indians to me, and they don't look like Indians to Indians."\u000a\u000aTrump's tendency to play with racial fire is a longstanding element of his style and personality. When he was a marginal political figure, no one dwelled much on this problem. But as he lurches toward the Republican nomination for president, it's important to understand that he always knows what he is saying and always acts with an intention in mind. He is, after all, a really smart person.

aV(CNN) Do you ache all over? Do you find yourself exhausted even after a full night's sleep? Does just the slightest touch on certain spots on your body make you want to scream in pain?\u000a\u000aYou could have fibromyalgia, a painful musculoskeletal disease characterized by widespread muscle pain, oversensitivity to common pain, extreme fatigue and sleep, mood and memory problems.\u000a\u000aWhat is fibromyalgia?\u000a\u000aFibromyalgia's name comes from "fibro" (the Latin term for fibrous tissue), "myo" (the Greek word for muscle) and "algia" (the Greek word for pain). According to the National Fibromyalgia Association , an estimated 3% to 6% of the world's population suffers from the condition: about 450 million people, including at least 10 million in the United States.\u000a\u000aAnd finally, red meat doesn't make the MIND diet menu either, but the diet does allow people to eat a serving once a week. A number of studies link red or processed meat consumption with chronic conditions and heart problems.\u000a\u000aSadly, fast food doesn't make the MIND diet either, and neither does fried food. Again the empty calories and fat are not worth breaking your healthy diet.\u000a\u000aSadly, fast food doesn't make the MIND diet either, and neither does fried food. Again the empty calories and fat are not worth breaking your healthy diet.\u000a\u000aCheese is also on the forbidden list. The MIND diet suggests keeping your cheese habit to once a week, if at all. Low fat cheese may be a better option if you can't break the habit, according to earlier studies\u000a\u000aThe butter-loving French culture won't like this news, but butter ison the MIND diet. You can have a tiny amount a day, but you may want to replace it with the healthier fat in olive oil.\u000a\u000aWhat doesn'tmake the MIND diet is dessert, at least of the pastry variety. Sweets are empty calories and while they make you happy for a moment, the fat and sugar is not good for your health. Avoid them if possible.\u000a\u000aWhen you cook your veggies or low fat poultry and fish, try olive oil. It should be your go-to oil. Earlier studies have shown people have improved cognitive function using it. Considered a healthy fat , it has antioxidants, and can also reduce the risk of heart disease and has been shown to prevent the spread of cancer cells, earlier studies show.\u000a\u000aA serving a day of other vegetables is also important. Vegetables provide nutrients your body needs, they are naturally low in fat and are a good source of fiber. Side benefit : the vitamin A in vegetables keeps your skin looking healthy and younger.\u000a\u000aBlueberries, strawberries and other berry family members make the MIND diet with a suggested two servings a week. A rich source of antioxidents and flavonoids, blueberries have been shown to improve memory, cognition and spatial memory, according to earlier studies.\u000a\u000aYou knew leafy greens were on the MIND menu. Try six servings a week. Greens are good for your vascular health, earlier studies show. They're also good for your digestion.\u000a\u000aEat three servings of beans a week. Beans are a good source of fiber which is important for digestion and also help you feel full, meaning you won't want to eat as much. A study in Japan found high soy bean consumption was associated with a lower incident of dementia and long life.\u000a\u000aSnacking is allowed on the MIND diet. It suggests eating nuts five times a week. Eating pistachios has been shown to lower blood pressure in some people . Peanuts are known to be a good source of resveratrol, a compound with antioxidants that help brain and heart health, earlier studies show.\u000a\u000aPoultry is on the MIND diet menu, two or more servings a week. Stick with baked, grilled or broiled, but skip the fried.\u000a\u000aPoultry is on the MIND diet menu, two or more servings a week. Stick with baked, grilled or broiled, but skip the fried.\u000a\u000aA glass of wine a day is allowed on the MIND diet. Wine is a good source of antioxidants, which is also good for your heart health. Resveratol in red wine may also help prevent damage to blood vessels.\u000a\u000aCarbs are allowed on this diet, particularly of the whole grain variety. You should have three servings a day. Earlier studies have shown a connection between high fiber consumption and living a long life\u000a\u000aThe MIND diet suggests eating at least one serving of fish a week. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet suggests eating more like 2-3 servings a week. Salmon, considered a "superfood," gives you a high dose of omega-3 fatty acids which studies show lower the risk of heart disease and fight inflammation. Earlier studies showed it also reduces anxiety.\u000a\u000aThe diet, driven by medical research, is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, both of which have been shown to have a positive impact on full body and brain health. The MIND diet may be a little bit simpler to follow than the other two as you have to eat less fruit and fish. In an observational study, people who stuck closest to eating the MIND diet saw a 53% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's , even people who ate the MIND diet most (instead of "all") of the time saw a 35% reduction in developing the disease. It's a result that is considered "significant."\u000a\u000aThe Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, known as the MIND diet, is a brain-friendly eating plan developed by researchers at Rush University in Chicago and Harvard's School of Public Health in Boston. Since most people experience some kind of memory loss as they age, even if they don't suffer from Alzheimer's, it's not a bad diet for anyone who hopes to live long into old age.\u000a\u000aThe Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, known as the MIND diet, is a brain-friendly eating plan developed by researchers at Rush University in Chicago and Harvard's School of Public Health in Boston.

One effort in particular, diet, is getting some renewed interest from scientists.\u000a\u000aFibromyalgia is considered a rheumatic disease like arthritis because it impairs joints and soft fibrous tissues like muscles, ligaments and tendons. But fibromyalgia is not a true form of arthritis, as it doesn't cause damage to those muscles and joints.\u000a\u000aInstead, the disease wreaks havoc with the body's pain centers, causing muscle stiffness and pain, intense fatigue, difficulty sleeping, migraines and terrible memory and concentration issues, often known as "fibro-fog."\u000a\u000aWhat's fibromyalgia feel like?\u000a\u000aThose who struggle with fibromyalgia say the muscle and tissue pain can include a deep, achy misery, an unbearable throbbing or stabbing, or an intense burning sensation. Often, the pain occurs in muscle nodules, or myofascial trigger points, causing restricted movement and full-body agony.\u000a\u000a"I used to say it was like a blowtorch," said Lynne Matallana, co-founder of the National Fibromyalgia Association. She began the advocacy group in 1997 after years of suffering from chronic pain.\u000a\u000a"The pain radiates out so much that your skin, your hair, your nails, everything hurts. Anything that touches you hurts you. You can't wear jewelry; you can't wear anything with a collar or rough texture. I used to put pillows at the bottom of my bed so the sheets wouldn't touch my legs."\u000a\u000aOverwhelming fatigue is another classic symptom. Between the pain and the exhaustion, says Matallana, she often felt despair.\u000a\u000a"You feel like you can't move, you can't think, and time seems to last forever and ever," she explained. "You lose sense of the fact that you could be better."\u000a\u000aFibromyalgia suffers often have sleep issues, such as restless leg syndrome, and struggle with frequent sleep disruptions. The National Sleep Foundation calls the connection a "double-edged sword: the pain makes sleep more difficult and sleep deprivation exacerbates pain."\u000a\u000aBecause both pain and exhaustion are invisible, it's often hard for anyone with fibromyalgia to convince family and friends of the extent of their misery. To make matters worse, it wasn't long ago that many doctors thought fibromyalgia was psychosomatic. Sad stories of going from doctor to doctor only to be told that the pain and fatigue are "all in your head" are common among patients; as are stories of losing marriages, relatives and friends who could not understand the debilitation that the disease can cause.\u000a\u000a"Doctors didn't accept it; patients didn't know what was wrong with them," Matallana said, describing what having fibromyalgia was like a decade or so ago. "Everyone felt so hopeless. I did a lot of suicide prevention counseling in the beginning of my work with the foundation.\u000a\u000a"I always believed that if you went to a health care provider, they would have an answer for you. I didn't realize there are things they just didn't understand," she added, explaining that many doctors wanted to help but didn't know how.\u000a\u000a"What I would often hear is, 'We don't believe it's being caused by anything other than stress or whatever. You need to change your lifestyle.' " It was like they were saying, "I don't know what to do to help you, so go do this, so I can take care of a patient I know how to help."\u000a\u000a"So I quit work, I stayed at home, I tried to exercise and reduce stress," Matallana said, "but we didn't know enough about how to put those actions into a workable plan that would slowly help me get better."\u000a\u000aWhat causes fibromyalgia?\u000a\u000aFibro can strike at any time. Symptoms often begin after a traumatic physical event, such as a car accident, surgery, even infection. Flu viruses, herpes simplex, the Epstein-Barr virus and hepatitis B and C may contribute to the onset of fibromyalgia.\u000a\u000aPsychological or emotional stress such as abuse, the loss of a parent or going to war can also trigger the disease. A recent study in Finland found that being exposed to family trauma such as alcohol and financial problems, chronic illness and depression or divorce while growing up was associated with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia later in life.\u000a\u000aThere's even a link between sleep disorders and fibromyalgia. A study in Norway found that women older than 45 with frequent sleep issues had five times the risk of developing fibromyalgia than sound sleepers.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Tips for better sleep Setting an alarm might be the only thing that helps you get up in the morning, but try setting one at night to remind you when it's time to go to bed.

Hide Caption 8 of 8\u000a\u000aThe National Institutes of Health says that between 80% and 90% of those diagnosed with the disease are women, but no one really understands why.\u000a\u000aOne theory is that lower levels of serotonin, a brain transmitter that helps regulate pain, may contribute to the development of fibromyalgia. Men make more serotonin than women, which some feel could explain the gender gap.\u000a\u000aAnother theory links female hormones and menopause to the disorder, but both of these are unproved.\u000a\u000aIf you have other arthritis-related conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or lupus, your risk of getting fibromyalgia is higher. There's also a familial connection, so if your mother has fibromyalgia, you're more likely to contract the disease.\u000a\u000aOther conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, painful bladder syndrome, anxiety, depression and temporomandibular joint disorder (or TMJ) often go hand in hand with fibromyalgia, as do several sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome and sleep apnea.\u000a\u000aToday, researchers believe that the bombardment of nerve pain that occurs in fibromyalgia may even alter the brain. Some feel that alteration could be related to abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain (like serotonin), or perhaps how blood flows through the brain. A study last year found that spinal fluid and plasma from people with fibromyalgia contained significantly higher levels of inflammatory chemicals, which could trigger swelling and pain.\u000a\u000aPain receptors in the body become hypersenstive with fibromyalgia\u000a\u000aScientists are also looking into the link between damaged peripheral nerves -- the small nerves of the body outside the brain and spinal cord -- and the chronic pain of fibromyalgia. One study found "withered or sparse nerve endings" in people with fibromyalgia, and two others found "small-fiber" nerve damage in those with the disease.\u000a\u000aRegardless of the cause, the result is that the central nervous system alters the way it processes pain messages throughout the body. Then, the theory goes, the pain receptors in the body develop a type of "pain memory," making them oversensitive and over-reactive to any degree of pain.\u000a\u000a"As time went on, I also described the pain as a sort of poison or acid going through my veins," Matallana said. "It is almost like you are slowly being drained of anything in you that would give you the strength to get better and help the pain go away."\u000a\u000aHow do I know if I have fibromyalgia?\u000a\u000aIt can take a long time to get a diagnosis for fibromyalgia. There is no test. You can't tell from an X-ray or blood test. Your doctor must consider the entire group of symptoms: pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, mood disturbances, tenderness, stiffness and functional impairment.\u000a\u000aBecause myriad other conditions share symptoms, doctors often need to rule out other diseases before a diagnosis of fibromyalgia can occur. You will probably be screened for neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease that leads to muscle weakness, as well as depression and anxiety.\u000a\u000aA blood test called FM/a can help distinguish fibromyalgia from other rheumatic diseases like Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A complete blood count will help rule out thyroid disorders, anemia and vitamin deficiencies that can cause fatigue and sleep problems.\u000a\u000aTender trigger points of fibromyalgia, no longer used for a definitative diagnosis.\u000a\u000aFor many years, fibromyalgia was diagnosed by pressing firmly on 18 typical trigger points or small patches of tightly contracted muscle tissue. If 11 or more of those trigger points were painful, the person had fibromyalgia.\u000a\u000aThat's no longer recommended. Tender spots come and go, and doctors were unsure of how hard to press. You may still experience a test like that, but since 2010, it's no longer the gold standard for diagnosis.\u000a\u000aThe American College of Rheumatology now says that a diagnosis of fibromyalgia will be given if pain has lasted more than three months, with no other underlying medical condition, and is widespread, which means it must occur on both sides of the body and above and below the waist.\u000a\u000aBecause of the many challenges in diagnosing fibromyalgia, finding a doctor with experience in separating it from other diseases is key. An experienced rheumatologist -- a doctor who specializes in musculoskeletal and autoimmune disorders -- will be the most successful at diagnosing fibromyalgia.\u000a\u000aHow is fibromyalgia treated?\u000a\u000aWidespread pain is often treated with over-the-counter pain relievers, but narcotics are not recommended, as they can increase pain over time.\u000a\u000aIn 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first drug for fibromyalgia. Pregabalin appears to work by calming overactive nerves. Unfortunately, it has two significant side effects, dizziness and sleepiness, that might dissipate over time.\u000a\u000aThe agency has since approved two more drugs: duloxetine is approved for anxiety, depression and neuropathic nerve pain; milnacipran is another antidepressant approved for fibromyalgia.\u000a\u000aWhile those drugs can help some with the disease, many find little relief from medication.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aPatients are encouraged to turn to physical and occupational therapy to improve muscle strength and flexibility. Stress can also be lowered via yoga, tai chi, meditation and counseling. Massage can be helpful, as it relaxes muscles, reduces stress and improves range of motion in muscles and joints.\u000a\u000aScience has joined in the search for alternative treatments: the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases has a number of studies underway into the roles of exercise, behavioral therapy and sleep interventions.\u000a\u000a"We now know that pain can be learned," Matallana said. "A lot of us with a genetic predisposition, we were trying to do it all, and we wore ourselves down. We didn't eat well, didn't exercise, didn't meditate and take time for ourselves. We overstressed the whole system.\u000a\u000a"Fibromyalgia is when you have pushed your system beyond the point it can function, and like a computer, sometimes you have to reboot."

Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey . The views expressed are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Conservatives busy defending the Trump administration's plans to reform the immigration system and delve into affirmative action policy need to understand something that simply won't change during the Trump era: Everything the administration proposes that even hints at race or ethnicity will receive heightened, and sometimes even unfair, scrutiny.\u000a\u000aThat's the price the GOP will pay for the foreseeable future because Republicans put a man in office who advocated for a " total and complete shutdown " of Muslim immigration, deemed a federal judge unqualified because of his ethnicity , and rose to national political prominence on the bigotry of birtherism. No matter the merits of the Raise Act or the intent of the Justice Department's foray into the affirmative action debate -- whether designed, as The New York Times initially reported , to potentially sue schools for supposed discrimination against white people, or according to DOJ, simply taking a look at a 2015 complaint brought by Asian-American groups who felt discriminated against -- the stench of Donald Trump's use of bigotry throughout the campaign and earlier will overwhelm everything else.\u000a\u000aThere are legitimate reasons to oppose the Raise Act. It purports to want to turn the immigration system into a merit-based one to increase the skill level of those we let in, but immigrants are already more skilled than native born Americans. And, as Sen. Lindsey Graham said , it is too focused on shoring up the tech economy, which could hurt other important segments of the market. Those criticisms, and others, would be worthy of debate, no matter who was in office. But because Donald Trump is President and one of his top advisers once bragged about providing an online platform for the so-called alt-right (read white supremacists and nationalists), it's hard to believe the administration's most recent rationale for the policy proposal.\u000a\u000aThe same goes for affirmative action. Maybe the DOJ really just wants to give a fair hearing to an issue raised by dozens of Asian-American groups. Are too many Asian-Americans being unfairly held out of top universities and colleges because of affirmative action? That's a debate worth having -- including whether prioritizing test scores above efforts to level the playing field for other marginalized groups makes sense -- which is why the Supreme Court weighed in on the subject a few years ago, essentially scaling back the policy and forcing colleges to better explain why it's still necessary in 21st century, browning America.\u000a\u000aA serious discussion about affirmative action would begin with the unfair advantage given to less-than-spectacular students who happen to come from rich families -- such as those with similar backgrounds to Jared Kushner and Donald Trump himself often get . But Trump doesn't do serious, and he has shown time and again he believes white grievance is potentially his ticket to a second term, or might help him make it to the end of his first one.\u000a\u000aIn the past, the civil rights division of the DOJ has pursued such things as police oversight, voting equality and LBGT rights. Under the Trump administration, its focus has been redirected away from these priorities. That's why it's hard to believe anything Trump officials say about policies concerning race. They don't seem credible because the man in the White House is not credible.\u000a\u000aThat man just days ago " jokingly " endorsed police brutality during an era in which white confidence in the police has steadily increased while blacks and Latinos have grown more concerned about police actions. That's why as upset as he is with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for refusing to protect him from an investigation into his campaign's ties to the Russian government, he will not fire him, because Sessions is busy implementing the policies that will likely hurt people of color the most -- policies endorsed by right-wing hard-liners -- including an increasingly cruel immigration stance.\u000a\u000aWhite grievance is Trump's fallback because he can no longer brag that he's a skilled dealmaker. The failed GOP attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act exposed Trump as the proverbial naked emperor, and more people are willing to publicly say he has no clothes. He promised the moon and the stars but didn't even seem to understand the difference between health and term life insurance. The much-hyped Carrier deal, in which Trump supposedly swooped into Indiana like Jesus returning on a cloud to save jobs, also exposed him as a reality TV fraud of a president, as many of those jobs are still being shipped overseas and workers there feel betrayed by his empty promises.\u000a\u000aIt's beyond unwise to take at face value statements coming from the White House on such sensitive topics, or just about anything. The number of lies and misleading comments from the administration -- from crowd size at the inauguration to questionable meetings with Russian officials -- is unprecedented.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aAnd on the issue of race itself, Trump dug himself such an enormous hole, he and his party may never recover. It's too bad, because we need more grownup conversations about race in a country that not too long from now will be majority-minority.

aVDavid A. Love writes for thegrio.com . He is a writer and commentator based in Philadelphia. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The recent shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk by police officer Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis is a reminder of the problem of police violence and lethal force in that city and around the nation. This case comes only a month after a former police officer in a nearby suburb, Jeronimo Yanez, was found not guilty in the July 2016 fatal shooting of Philando Castile.\u000a\u000aThis most recent case, however, does not adhere to the typical pattern, in which the victim is black and the offending police officer is not. Ruszczyk , who reportedly had called 911 to alert police to a sexual assault happening hear her home, was white, and Noor is black, the first Somali-American officer on the Minneapolis police force.\u000a\u000aAfter Ruszczyk came outside in her pajamas and walked into an alley, Noor shot her to death through the door of his police car. Mystifyingly, both officers' body cameras were turned off . Noor and fellow officer Matthew Harrity, who also responded to the scene, were placed on administrative leave. Harrity has talked to state investigators, who said he told them he was startled by a loud sound near his squad car before Noor (who has not spoken to investigators) fired.\u000a\u000aThis incident's deviation from a pattern we have come to expect does not make it any less tragic, senseless or shocking. But it provides an opportunity for the public to view police abuse in a different light and to bring more visibility to the issue.\u000a\u000aThe killing of Ruszczyk, an immigrant from Australia, bears noteworthy similarities to the death not only of Castile but also that of Sean Bell , who died in a hail of 50 NYPD bullets from uniformed and plainclothes officers just hours before his wedding. Ruszczyk was to be married next month.\u000a\u000aIn both the Castile and Bell cases, police faced criticism for being too quick to fire their weapons and kill innocent civilians. Castile did all of the right things after being stopped: He produced his license and registration, and informed the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it . Officer Yanez, who claimed he feared for his life and saw Castile reaching for the gun, was still acquitted of manslaughter and reached a $48,500 settlement that ended his career with the town of St. Anthony. The Castile family settled with the Minneapolis suburb for $3 million\u000a\u000aThe aftermath of the deaths of Castile and Bell represent common outcomes of police fatality incidents involving unarmed civilians. Police typically are not indicted and rarely are convicted, which often means the victims' families receive at most a lump sum settlement from the city rather than justice.\u000a\u000aSome observers, lacking in empathy, have blamed black victims for their own deaths by claiming they did not comply with police instructions, mouthed off at officers, or were thugs or gang members.\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of Ruszczyk's death, however, it is clear that America is not as accustomed to the killing of an innocent white woman by police, much less by a black officer. That the officers involved in the killing of Justine Ruszczyk have been named, and the state investigation announced, suggests that this case -- unlike so many other homicides over the years of black people involving police -- is being taken seriously.\u000a\u000aIn that regard, Ruszczyk's death may allow the crisis of police excessive force to become even more visible.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, many segments of society cannot (or refuse to) appreciate suffering until and unless it affects them or their own community. It is for this reason that black and brown people often believe their lives are not valued.\u000a\u000aWhen white lives are at stake, society takes notice. During the civil rights movement, for example, the murders of white civil rights workers such as Viola Liuzzo in Alabama and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner in Mississippi illuminated the problems of racist violence in the South in ways that felt new to many white people, even after African Americans had experienced a century of terrorism and lynching during Reconstruction and Jim Crow.\u000a\u000aMore recently, whites impacted by the opioid epidemic have been regarded as victims of a public health crisis who need treatment, and the crisis is a public health crisis, while blacks and Latinos caught up in the war on drugs in the 1980s and 1990s were treated as criminals and subjected to mass incarceration.\u000a\u000aIt's too soon to know whether Ruszczyk's death will bring the problem of police violence home to white Americans in ways that previous shootings haven't. But it is neither inconsistent nor insensitive to say that her death was cold-blooded, and many in the black community are not surprised by it. In a country that has failed to rein in law enforcement practices and the use of deadly force, this recent killing in Minneapolis carries with it an air of inevitability.\u000a\u000aThe black community, their allies, and advocates for police reform have sounded the alarm for years, often to be met with attacks and accusations of stoking racial divisions. But those attacks ignore the reality that while Black Lives Matter has brought attention to the killing of black people, and the violence and discrimination facing people of color in the justice system, leaders and members of the movement have also voiced support for Dylan Noble , 19, a white teen killed by Fresno police in June of last year.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aCitizens of color are the disproportionate victims of bad policing, but that does not mean they are the only ones. When police departments function well and work in concert with the community, and law enforcement is transparent and accountable to the public, society as a whole will benefit, regardless of race or ethnicity.\u000a\u000aJustine Ruszczyk should not have died. Perhaps if society had cared enough to repair a broken system that has claimed so many lives, such as Philando Castile's and Sean Bell's, she might still be alive today.

"Our model is based on data which already show the effect of existing emission mitigation policies. Achieving the goal of less than 1.5 C warming will require carbon intensity to decline much faster than in the recent past."\u000a\u000aThe second study analyzed past emissions of greenhouse gases and the burning of fossil fuels to show that even if humans suddenly stopped burning fossil fuels now, Earth will continue to heat up about two more degrees by 2100. It also concluded that if emissions continue for 15 more years, which is more likely than a sudden stop, Earth's global temperature could rise as much as 3 degrees.\u000a\u000a"Even if we would stop burning fossil fuels today, then the Earth would continue to warm slowly," said Thorsten Mauritsen, author of the second study. "It is this committed warming that we estimate."\u000a\u000aTaken together, the similar results present a grim reality.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The effects of climate change on the world Photos: The effects of climate change on the world Florida \u2013 A flooded street in Miami Beach in September 2015.

"We're a long ways down the path to disastrous global warming, and the policy response -- especially in the United States -- has been pathetically underwhelming." "These studies are part of the emerging scientific understanding that we're in even hotter water than we'd thought," said Bill McKibben , anenvironmentalist not affiliated with either study. "We're a long ways down the path to disastrous global warming, and the policy response -- especially in the United States -- has been pathetically underwhelming."\u000a\u000aBecause both studies were completed before the United States left the Paris Agreement under President Trump earlier this year, that has not been accounted for in either study.\u000a\u000a"Clearly the US leaving the Paris Agreement would make the 2 C or 1.5 C targets even harder to achieve than they currently are," said Raftery.\u000a\u000aWhy two degrees?\u000a\u000aThe 2 degree mark -- that's a rise of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit in global temperature -- was set by the 2016 Paris Agreement. It was first proposed as a threshold by Yale economist William Nordhaus in 1977. The climate has been warming since the burning of fossil fuels began in the late 1800s during the Industrial Revolution, researchers say.\u000a\u000aIf we surpass that mark, it has been estimated by scientists that life on our planet will change as we know it.

"In contrast, our results are statistically based and probabilistic, in that they aim to cover the range of likely outcomes."\u000a\u000aWhat Raftery and his colleagues discovered is that population is not a factor.\u000a\u000a"This is due to the fact that much of the expected future population growth will be in Africa, in countries whose carbon emissions are currently very low," Raftery said.\u000a\u000aThe study confirms conclusions of many other studies, said Bill Hare, director and senior scientists of nonprofit Climate Analytics. Hare was not affiliated with either study.\u000a\u000a"This interesting paper confirms the conclusion about where the world is headed unless there is a major increase in the ambition of climate and energy policies," Hare said.\u000a\u000aThe other finding of the study suggests that achieving a goal of less than 1.5 Celsius warming would require carbon intensity to decline faster than it has in the past. "The whole purpose of climate and energy policy is to accelerate decarbonisation and this will necessarily be faster than what we have seen globally," Hare said.\u000a\u000aMauritsen, author of the second study and climate researcher at Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, also shared thoughts on Raftery's findings.\u000a\u000a"It seems interesting in that it uses an economic statistical model that accounts for an increasing energy efficiency as societies develop," Mauritsen said. "It shows that the 1.5 to 2 degrees targets will not be met without additional mitigation, and suggests that a focus on energy efficiency is the best way forward."\u000a\u000aThe impact of our past\u000a\u000aBy combining observations of past global warming and how much heat and carbon is being captured and taken in by the ocean, Mauritsen and his co-author, Robert Pincus, found that even though CO2 has an incredibly long lifetime in the atmosphere, the ocean's absorption capacity may reduce estimates of global warming by 0.2 degrees Celsius.\u000a\u000aThey arrived at the "committed" warming of 1.3 Celsius by 2100, and the estimate including the ocean factor is 1.1 degrees Celsius. But that is still nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit: 1.8, to be precise.\u000a\u000a"What the study is not concerned with is how future emissions might develop," Mauritsen said. "This is a societal problem where we as physical scientists have fairly little to add. These future emissions will, however, add warming on top of the already committed warming and so our study can act as a baseline for estimating how far we are from reaching various temperature targets."\u000a\u000aHare also found this study to be consistent with previous papers on global temperatures on the rise.\u000a\u000a"It shows, in effect, that unless we start reducing emissions quickly -- soon there is a risk that we will overshoot temperature limits like 1.5 or 2 degrees C," Hare said. "It is just another confirmation of how dangerous the present situation is unless CO2 emissions, which have flatlined in the last few years, really start dropping.\u000a\u000a"This addresses a somewhat different question, namely how much warming should we expect if fossil fuel emissions were to suddenly cease," Raftery said. "In contrast, our study tries to assess how much warming we should expect given realistic future trajectories of emissions. Thus the other study provides a lower bound on expected emissions and warming, and this is indeed lower than the likely range we find, as we would expect."\u000a\u000aWhat can be done?\u000a\u000aResearchers know that if there is any hope of preventing the outcomes they include in their findings, changing public policy is key.\u000a\u000a"The next few years are going to be key in the fight against global warming," said Dargan Frierson, co-author of the first study. "Are we going to get to work installing clean energy, or stick to old polluting sources? If we don't act quickly, we better get to work preparing for many severe consequences of a much hotter world."\u000a\u000a"There are only two realistic paths toward avoiding long-run disaster: increased financial incentives to avoid greenhouse gas emissions and greatly increased funding for research that will lead to at least partial technological fixes," said Dick Startz, economist and co-author of the second study. "Neither is free. Both are better than the catastrophe at the end of the current path."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aSilver linings and hope are hard to find in climate change studies, but they also don't account for every factor.\u000a\u000a"The only bright point is that, as the study authors say, they haven't factored in the plummeting cost of solar power," McKibben said. "That's the one way out we still might take -- but only if our governments take full advantage of the breakthroughs our engineers have produced."

aV(CNN) A bomb rips through the Humvee in the road ahead, sending it flying into the air. The pop of gunfire is everywhere.\u000a\u000aThe man next to you -- your best pal in this godforsaken place -- suddenly slumps over. Screams and dense smoke fill the air.\u000a\u000aIt's the stuff nightmares are made of, and all too real most nights for many returning veterans.\u000a\u000a"Six to eight months after I got home, the nightmares really started to come in," said Army Reserve veteran Aaron. "Middle of the night, all of a sudden I'm back in Iraq, full battle mentality, running, chasing people down."\u000a\u000aAaron is one of many soldiers identified by their first names who shared their stories on video on Make the Connection , a US Department of Veterans Affairs website devoted to returning veterans.\u000a\u000a"I was having to sleep on the front porch, I couldn't even sleep in my wife's bed," added Mike, who served in Iraq for the Army Reserve and National Guard. "When I slept in her bed, I'd wake up every 30 minutes with nightmares that someone had come into the house and were harming my family, my kids."\u000a\u000a"Over half all veterans have nightmares," said psychologist David Cooper, who works with traumatized veterans at the Department of Defense National Center for Telehealth and Technology . "It's a common symptom that comes along with PTSD, or post-traumatic stress syndrome."\u000a\u000aBut it's not just veterans who struggle with nightmares. The American Sleep Association estimates between 80% and 90% of us have disturbing dreams at night.\u000a\u000aThe dark side of nightmares\u000a\u000aFor most of us, nightmares occur when we are stressed and worried, or when we've experienced an upsetting event. Nightmares tend to stay with us longer if they are fear-based, but studies show confusion, guilt, disgust and sadness are the most common triggers.\u000a\u000aIt's not just feelings. Late-night snacks, some medications, and even the withdrawal of medications or alcohol can trigger repugnant dreams.\u000a\u000aScience says these types of dreams may actually be good for our psyche. Instead of living with vague feelings of unease, the brain, usually during the REM stage of sleep, consolidates our bad feelings into a concrete memory that we can then process, file away, and forget.\u000a\u000aBut for the unlucky among us, nightmares can become chronic, and turn into a disorder that rips apart sleep and destroys productive lives.\u000a\u000a"I started having a lot of trouble sleeping, sleeping for two, three hours a week," said US Army veteran Bryan in a Make the Connection video. Bryan served several tours in Iraq. "I just couldn't sleep through the whole night."\u000a\u000a"They start avoiding sleep for fear of the nightmares," said neuropsychologist William Kerst. He worked with soldiers with PTSD and nightmares while in the Air Force and now counsels vets in his private practice in Alaska.\u000a\u000a"And chronic sleep deprivation is associated with lots of bad things," Kerst continued. "Obviously their attention, concentration and memory are going to suffer ... depression risk, it goes way up ... there's even lots of studies to show a really clear link between chronic sleep deprivation and suicidal thoughts."\u000a\u000aIt can happen to any of us\u000a\u000aYou don't have to be a veteran to have PTSD and the accompanying nightmares. Anyone who has suffered or witnessed major trauma, such as natural disasters, domestic violence, rape, terrorism, even a terrifying car accident, can develop ongoing, frightening memories of the event. The National Center for PTSD estimates 10 out of every 100 women and four of every 100 men will develop PTSD at some point in their lives, and as a result, may suffer nightmares.\u000a\u000aAnd here's the really nightmarish thing. Even if the PTSD is addressed and overcome, studies show the gut-wrenching dreams may not go away.\u000a\u000a"The tendency for these individuals to have trauma related nightmares and then sleep disruption and sleep disturbances continued well after successful PTSD treatment was complete," said Kerst.\u000a\u000aThe reason why may lie in how PTSD and nightmares are treated.\u000a\u000a"When I'm working with a patient with PTSD one of the things I want them to do is expose themselves to those traumatic feelings over and over again so that their body learns to calm down and not react as much," said Cooper. "But traumatic nightmares are not treated the same way as other PTSD symptoms. Instead we give something new for the brain to focus on which eventually reduces the overall frequency of the nightmares."\u000a\u000aThe approach is called Imagery rehearsal therapy or IRT. The goal of this type of therapy isn't to relieve or process the trauma in your nightmare. Instead you want to change it -- tweak it, really -- so the nightmare loses its power over your mind and your sleep.\u000a\u000a"Let's say I'm working with someone who has a nightmare about going on patrol in Afghanistan where their Humvee was blown up by an IED," said Cooper. "I may want to have them change that explosion to confetti, or a balloon popping."\u000a\u000a"Or instead of an IED on the road," Cooper continued, "maybe it's a grocery bag that the Humvee hits, something that is not going to elicit the same emotional response, but still remains true to a majority of the dream."\u000a\u000aDeveloped in the 1990s by Dr. Barry Krakow at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Imagery rehearsal therapy has shown some impressive results in studies. Besides limiting chronic nightmares and improving sleep quality in over 70% of the subjects, IRT has been shown to decrease PTSD severity , as well as reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\u000a\u000aOther research found the effects of IRT on nightmares can be long lasting , especially if the rewritten dream removes violent details\u000a\u000aHow IRT works\u000a\u000aImagery rehearsal therapy works by having the patient write down specifics about the nightmare, creating almost a movie-like script of the disturbing dream. Then, in conjunction with a therapist, the patient rewrites the nightmare to make it less disturbing. Then they are told to practice the re-scripted dream during the day.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that it doesn't take long for the positive benefits of IRT to take place, for both those with PTSD and more common nightmares.\u000a\u000a"It's usually only a couple of sessions, maybe four," said Cooper, "and we ask that folks rehearse the new dream one or two times throughout the day for 20, 30 minutes. That's really all the actual work that it takes."\u000a\u000aIn fact, one of the most time-consuming parts of the process, said Kerst, is the writing process. That's why he was excited to partner with Cooper and the National Center for Telehealth and Technology to develop an app called Dream Ez . While it can be used on its own, Kerst and Cooper say it will be most effective with an IRT-trained therapist.\u000a\u000a"You wake up, you grab your phone, you record your nightmare," said Kerst. "Then you rate how distressing or disturbing the nightmare was, and with the help of your therapist turn the dream away from the distressing turn of events."\u000a\u000aThe app allows users to audio record the re-scripting of the dream, and then encourages them to practice the reworked dream, while also providing some relaxation tools to foster better quality sleep.\u000a\u000aThe app is currently being evaluated by various sleep clinicians.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We know IRT works, so we're not studying that," explained Cooper. "But we want to know if making the process more user friendly will help people stick with it longer, so they get the full effect of something that we already know works."\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest pluses for IRT is the avoidance of prescription sleep aids, which often cause drowsiness, lethargy, and in some cases, are dangerously addictive. It's also helpful for veterans or others who refuse to be treated for PSTD or other disorders, perhaps because of stigma or personal pride.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people are willing to say I want to get rid of my nightmares and sleep better," Kerst explains. "So even when people don't want to talk about their trauma specifically, they're willing to say that and they begin to get the help they need."

aV(CNN) Two men have been charged in Australia in connection with an alleged plot to bring down a passenger plane, police said Thursday.\u000a\u000aAccording to a statement from Australian Federal Police (AFP), a 49-year-old man and a 32-year-old man each were charged with two counts of "acts done in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act."\u000a\u000aThe maximum penalty for each offense is life in prison.\u000a\u000aIt comes five days after four people -- including the two men -- were arrested by police over what Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull described as an "elaborate conspiracy." A 50-year-old man was released without charge on Tuesday. One man remains in custody.\u000a\u000aPolice search for evidence at a block of flats in the Sydney suburb of Lakemba on July 31.\u000a\u000aTurnbull said the plot involved bringing down a passenger plane. AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the plan had been to use an "improved device."\u000a\u000aNo further official details have been released.\u000a\u000aAustralian media has been full of speculation around the terror plot since the arrests were announced on Saturday. Local newspaper The Australian said the plan involved "an explosive device (creating) poisonous gas."\u000a\u000aThe AFP would not confirm or deny the report and Minister of Immigration Peter Dutton told media he didn't "want to go into the detail."\u000a\u000aMultiple raids following arrests\u000a\u000aMultiple raids have been carried out at multiple properties across Sydney by law enforcement authorities since Saturday, including the suburbs of Surry Hills, Lakemba, Wiley Park and Punchbowl.\u000a\u000aPolice tape up evidence outside a house in the inner Sydney suburb of Surry Hills on July 30.\u000a\u000aInvestigators were seen rifling through garbage and removing items from houses, dressed in full protective gear.\u000a\u000aEarlier Thursday, Turnbull said the threat to aviation in Australia had been "disrupted and contained" following the arrests and the level of security at airports was being lowered.\u000a\u000aStricter airport security measures had been put in place following the attack, with Australian airports warning of possible delays and longer check-in times.\u000a\u000aAt the same press conference, Turnbull said a "very substantial" amount of evidence had been uncovered and investigations were ongoing.\u000a\u000aThe two men facing charges will appears in a Sydney court on Friday morning.

aVJust before the Senate convenes at 11am ET today to work on a plan to avoid the fiscal cliff, Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) tells Starting Point that he believes that a bipartisan agreement on revenue has been reached, but it\u2019s now a question of whether the money will go to more spending or deficit reduction.\u000a\u000aSen. Isakson says, \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not sure we have the inside information, but I do believe the revenue issue is no longer a question. The question is making sure any new revenues go to debt spending reduction and deficit relief rather than new spending. It's deficits that got us into this problem. It's only reducing deficits that get us out of this problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen CNN\u2019s Ali Velshi asks him to clarify if a revenue deal has been accepted, Sen. Isakson responds, \u201cNo, that's not my best information, but it's my best belief that they've reached an agreement on revenues. What that level is, I don't know, but the question now is where those revenues go. If they go to new spending, we're going to have a problem making a deal because spending has been our problem. But if they go towards deficit reduction, which ultimately will be debt relief, that will be a good thing, and we probably will have a deal.\u201d\u000a\u000aStarting Point with Soledad O\u2019Brien airs weekday mornings from 7-9am ET on CNN.

aVRuth Ben-Ghiat is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion and a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who writes about authoritarianism and propaganda. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Just before Donald Trump took office, I argued that our new President would likely follow the "authoritarian playbook," an approach toward governance that privileges executive power and makes the leader's personal goals and needs the focus of his public office. Now, six months later, those predictions have come true.\u000a\u000aBelieve me, I wish I had been wrong. I warned that President Trump would escalate his attacks on the media, disregard political customs and democratic norms, and single out judges or other government employees who might challenge the legality or ethics of his actions. Two weeks later, Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates, and over the next months, United States Attorney Preet Bharara and FBI Director James Comey.\u000a\u000aSo what's next for Trump and his authoritarian playbook? What is he likely to do over the next six months of his presidency?\u000a\u000aThe most important item of the authoritarian's playbook is this: He is in office not to serve the nation but to protect his own position of power, often enriching himself along the way. As Prime Minister of Italy, the business and sports tycoon Silvio Berlusconi set the standard here. He transferred certain functions of his business to his children but never resolved most of his conflicts of interest. The constant legal and juridical fallout from this fazed neither him nor his supporters. Look for Trump to continue doing the same -- and with the same attitude.\u000a\u000aIt might be tempting to think Donald Trump won't even be in office by the end of 2017, given special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Such work is necessarily long and painstaking , though, and impervious to the momentum that builds on the topic from our 24/7 news cycle. In the wake of the Republicans' health care defeat, it might also seem that he has lost too much political capital to stay the course. In reality, he is on his way to accomplishing the most important things an authoritarian leader must do to survive over the long term. The strategies that he's already used effectively will also guide his next phase of rule.\u000a\u000aSo far, Donald Trump has cleared the way for conservative forces to implement their long-held dreams of combating big government and acting aggressively to bolster the declining influence of white majority culture in America. And he's created what Carl Bernstein called "a cold political and cultural civil war" by pursuing a media strategy that's benefited him but further polarized the country. Discrediting the mainstream media is the authoritarian's insurance policy: He cashes it in if allegations of corruption surface, or if events occur that merit a government crackdown.\u000a\u000aNow, President Trump will continue to cultivate ties with followers that are based primarily on loyalty to his person. He knows that what matters the most is not whether they believe him, but that they believe in him. He'll use rallies and tweets to keep up this direct connection, and continue to brand the mainstream media as "fake news" purveyors. It's already paid off handsomely: His support has held and much of his base is wedded to his version of reality (or has decided they don't care if he tells untruths).\u000a\u000aPresident Trump will also fulfill his end of the bargain with supporters who wish to stymie America's shift to a minority-majority country. Look for aggressive action on the kinds of voter suppression tactics that disadvantage people of color and for attempts to cast doubt on the veracity and validity of elections. The head of the Trump administration's Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, Kris Kobach, has already questioned whether Hillary Clinton really won the popular vote. And watch for Trump to become more public about his support for the cause of "re-moralizing" America on a white Christian basis.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, President Trump's adviser Stephen Bannon and his Republican allies will accelerate their campaigns against sectors of society that uphold the value of evidence and expertise, such as the media, the intelligence community, and the judiciary. The GOP's increasing negativity toward higher education , and NRA executive vice president and CEO Wayne LaPierre's inflammatory comment that academic, political, and media elites are "America's greatest domestic threats" also herald the ramping up of this strategy.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aFinally, look for Donald Trump to leverage the culture of threat he's created and profited from. The President's recent circulation of a meme showing him punching a CNN logo raises the belligerent tone, as do the NRA's recent videos , one of which asserts that "the clenched fist of truth" is the only means of saving the country from the left.

aV(CNN) The Rev. Noe Carias shuffles into the cramped room, his face immediately pleasant upon seeing strangers. He's well practiced in his pastoral craft of comforting parishioners.\u000a\u000aBut the pastor isn't in ministerial clothes. He sits down, wearing a blue prison uniform. Carias' name is printed on a plastic band attached to his left wrist. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer tells Carias he has 20 minutes before he needs to return to detention.\u000a\u000a"I think first my lord, Jesus Christ," says the pastor, "then my wife, my children, my church. I think God is going to make a miracle to release me, set me free from this place."\u000a\u000aCarias, 42, is being held at the Adelanto Detention Facility, in California's high desert, for crossing the border illegally in the 1990s.\u000a\u000aThe Guatemalan native had been trying to correct his immigration status since 2014, and ICE had granted him yearly stays. That ended this year at his most recent ICE check-in, when Carias was informed he would be arrested and deported.\u000a\u000a"I've never been arrested by police," he says. "I'm a minister. I have my American citizen wife, being married for 14 years. I have two kids. I support the economy of this country and I paying my taxes. I never commit crime in this country."\u000a\u000aCarias is one of the undocumented immigrants the administration of former President Barack Obama considered less of a priority, as ICE officers focused on deporting felons. Under President Donald Trump, the policy has shifted.\u000a\u000aICE guidelines now direct officers to "take enforcement action against all removable aliens." ICE has reported that in the first 100 days after President Trump signed executive orders on immigration enforcement, arrests of undocumented immigrants with no other criminal convictions were up more than 50% compared to last year.\u000a\u000aAside from Carias, other religious leaders who have been arrested on immigration violations include a Georgia deacon and his wife, a pastor in Northern Virginia and a minister in Oceanside, California.\u000a\u000aNoe and Vicky Carias and their two children.\u000a\u000a'I'm not a bad hombre'\u000a\u000a"We agree this government should remove the criminal, the bad people. The ones who come to this country to only do bad things," Carias says. "I'm not that kind of person. I'm not a bad hombre. If they remove me, that's a signal they want to remove every people (sic) who do good things, right things in the United States of America."\u000a\u000aAbout 100 miles away in Los Angeles, the pastor's wife, Vicky Carias, breaks down in front of their two children, age 5 and 6. It's something she's been trying to avoid since her husband was detained on July 24, because the children don't understand why their father was arrested. They know the Sunday service was filled with tearful prayers and that the parishioners, just like their mother, told them not to worry.\u000a\u000a"I just tell them, 'Daddy's going to be home soon. Be patient. We have to just pray. We have a powerful God.'" Vicky Carias pauses. She turns her words to her President:\u000a\u000a"This is hurting a whole family, my kids and myself. The church, the congregation, we're all hurting. We want to get things right. We've been trying to get it right. Please, have mercy on us."\u000a\u000aAccording to ICE, Carias is "a repeat immigration violator who has assumed multiple identities and nationalities over the years in order to evade federal immigration enforcement."\u000a\u000aCarias' attorney, Noemi Ramirez, says that explanation oversimplifies her client's history. Ramirez says Carias has never stolen an identity or used false documents in the United States, but did verbally tell immigration officials he was from Mexico instead of Guatemala, because he feared returning to his country and being killed.\u000a\u000aCarias says he was kidnapped by Guatemalan guerillas when he was 7 years old and held until he was 12, when he managed to escape. In the meantime, Carias' parents, believing their child was dead, fled to Mexico. Carias says he eventually tracked down his family in Tijuana but then continued north, making his way illegally into the United States, to work in the agricultural fields.\u000a\u000aHis first encounter with US immigration was when Carias was still underage. Two more deportation orders followed, the last in 1995. Carias slipped into the shadows to avoid being sent back across the border.\u000a\u000aHe built a life in the United States, and in his early 20s he found God's calling and turned to pastoral work. Carias met and married Vicky, then had two children. He established an Evangelical Assemblies of God church near downtown Los Angeles. The family recently bought a modest home there.\u000a\u000aNoe Carias prepares to face ICE officials on the day he was arrested.\u000a\u000aEvangelical ministers see a challenge\u000a\u000aTo evangelical ministers in California, Carias' case signals a challenge for their church, one the faith's leaders and white members are failing to act upon. White evangelicals make up President Trump's political base , with more than 80% voting for him in the election.\u000a\u000aBut the very people being arrested and deported, says the Rev. Juan Martinez with the Fuller Seminary, are evangelical.\u000a\u000a"The future of the church in the United States is brown," says Martinez. "The church in the United States will be browner than it is today. You're deporting a fellow believer of Jesus Christ. You're deporting a person from your own denomination. You're deporting someone who might be in your church."\u000a\u000aSeven evangelical ministers and one Presbyterian minister spoke with CNN, all urging white faith leaders to do more in the face of detentions and deportations of their Latino parishioners and pastors.\u000a\u000aThe Rev. Zach Hoover, a member of the religious grass-roots group PICO National Network, says as a white pastor, he sees what's happening to the Latino faithful as a moral turning point for all evangelicals.\u000a\u000a"I want to say to my fellow white evangelicals, how important is the 'white' part of that? What are we going to say to Latinos in the pews or the children of people who were deported, who end up staying here? What are we going to tell them we did at this moment? That we walked with their parents or that we had other things to do?"\u000a\u000aThe Rev. Ada Valiente with the First Baptist Church of Maywood, California, says evangelicals need to re-evaluate where church teachings collide with secular politics. "What are the real values we have?" she asks. "Is it just abortion? Anti-abortion? Yes, we are. But we're also pro-family. Family is important as a country. If we don't keep families together, what are we going to do as a church?"\u000a\u000aIn a statement to CNN, the National Association of Evangelicals urged compassion in the cases of their pastors and parishioners who have been arrested by ICE. The NAE, which represents more than 45,000 local churches and serves a constituency of millions, said, "Millions of immigrants are growing America's churches and these immigrants need pastors. Instead of routinely deporting good spiritual leaders, we need to provide pathways to legal status. Our laws are important and so is justice, compassion and common sense that goes with the enforcement of immigration laws."\u000a\u000aHoover, while crediting evangelical leadership for publicly supporting the pastors, is blunt in his assessment of the leadership of his church. "No, it's not enough. It's not enough until this stops, until we aren't sitting here talking about a pastor sitting however many miles it is from here in a terrible detention center. We need you right now. Today you have a choice, and we need you to choose to stand with us."\u000a\u000aAlexia Salvatierra, with grass-roots religious group Matthew 25, says the conversations are happening within evangelical churches, but real change remains slow. "We've been talking about mercy in the church. But we also need to talk about justice. The immigration system is unfair and inhumane."\u000a\u000aWhat's next for Carias?\u000a\u000aCarias' attorney has filed a motion to reopen his 1995 immigration case. As he awaits a move by the courts, the pastor says he's ministering fellow detainees at Adelanto Detention Center. Included in his prayers is one for Donald Trump.\u000a\u000a"I pray for the President. The Bible say, pray for our leaders," says Carias. "I also want to ask President Trump for compassion. I'm never going to lose my faith. I love my family. I love this country."

aV(CNN) Apple cider vinegar is one of the most popular natural health products around, with claims for everything from sanitizing toothbrushes to whittling waistlines.\u000a\u000aBut how much of its popularity is based on hype? Could you be wasting your time or -- even worse -- harming your health?\u000a\u000aHere are 10 of the top ways people are using apple cider vinegar and what the science says.\u000a\u000aDiabetes\u000a\u000aWhat's the most popular use for apple cider vinegar? If a simple internet search is any measure, it involves diabetes.\u000a\u000aDietitian Carol Johnston has been studying the effects of the main component of any vinegar, acetic acid, on diabetic blood glucose levels since 2004. She's conducted 10 small randomly controlled studies and published six papers on the subject.\u000a\u000aHer studies indicate vinegar can help lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes; in those who are prediabetic, also called insulin-resistant; and even in healthy control subjects. The improvement was slight for all but those at risk for diabetes, she says.\u000a\u000a"In pre-diabetics, it was too good to be true," says Johnston, who is also associate director of the Arizona State University's School of Nutrition and Health. "It fell a good bit and stayed that way. It may be this is the group that could benefit the most."\u000a\u000aBut this antiglycemic response can be induced by any sort of vinegar, she says: red and white wine vinegars, pomegranate vinegar or even white distilled vinegar. She suggests adding it to salads, as in the Mediterranean diet, or diluting it in water and drinking it before a meal.\u000a\u000a"Basically, what acetic acid is doing is blocking the absorption of starch," Johnston says. "If my study subjects eat a starch and add vinegar, glucose will go down. But if they drink sugar water and add vinegar, nothing happens. So if you're having bacon and eggs, don't bother. It only helps if you are consuming a starch."\u000a\u000aIf you choose to use apple cider vinegar, be sure to tell your doctor, says nutritionist Lisa Drayer.\u000a\u000a"If you're taking a diabetes drug, the vinegar could amplify the effects of your meds," she warns, "and your doctor might want to adjust your dosage."\u000a\u000aMost important, if you're expecting vinegar to significantly alter or prevent diabetes, science suggests you reconsider.\u000a\u000aJohnston notes that there is no evidence, in her studies or others, to establish that connection.\u000a\u000a"I simply determine if your glucose level goes up and down," she says. "If I was to show that vinegar slows progression to diabetes, then I would need hundreds of people and millions of dollars to do the studies, because diabetes has a lot of causes, including genetics."\u000a\u000aWeight loss\u000a\u000aWeight loss, or dieting, is another popular use for apple cider vinegar and there is some evidence that it can help.\u000a\u000aThe most cited study was done with 175 heavy but otherwise healthy Japanese subjects. The 12-week treatment produced lower body weight, body mass index, visceral fat, waist measurements and triglyceride levels. Sounds great, right?\u000a\u000a"People didn't really lose that much weight," Drayer says. "Only 2 to 4 pounds in three months over a placebo. That's only a third of a pound a week."\u000a\u000aJohnston agrees the study showed "a very, very modest weight loss.'\u000a\u000a"In fact, I would say most people who are on a diet for 12 weeks and only lose a couple of pounds aren't going to be very happy," she adds.\u000a\u000aIf you are using apple cider or other vinegars as one part of an overall plan, combining it with a healthy diet, portion control and exercise, it might help, Drayer says. She suggested using balsamic vinegar on salads, in a 4:1 ratio with oil, or adding it to sauces for poultry and fish.\u000a\u000aThe best way to consume apple cider vinegar is on your salad, experts say.\u000a\u000a"If you were doing all the other things to lose weight, it might give you a slight edge," Drayer says. "Also, if you're drinking it in water, that's good, as water makes you feel full."\u000a\u000a"Sometimes, people get really excited to try something new, and then their other behaviors change, too," she adds. "So if this helps people be more careful overall, that's a good thing."\u000a\u000aTeeth cleaning and whitening\u000a\u000a"Some people like to use it to remove stains and whiten their teeth," according to one of many online articles touting apple cider vinegar for this purpose: "To try this, rub a small amount of apple cider vinegar onto your teeth with a cotton swab."\u000a\u000a"I let out an audible gasp when I read about this!" says Chicago dentist and American Dental Association spokeswoman Alice Boghosian. "It made me cringe, to be honest with you. What are people doing?"\u000a\u000a"You're putting acid on your teeth," Boghosian continues, "the last thing you'd want to do to promote oral health. What would be a healthier option is to brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes, with a whitening toothpaste with the ADA seal. That shows it's been tested to do what it's supposed to do."\u000a\u000aOther articles promote rinsing your mouth with apple cider vinegar, soaking dentures with a diluted mixture or using it to clean a toothbrush.\u000a\u000a"You just have to rinse off your toothbrush, get all the toothpaste out, and let it air out. That's all you have to do," Boghosian says. "Cleaning dentures or rinsing with vinegar is not a good idea. It too could put your teeth at risk. And just think how it might affect the metal on partial dentures."\u000a\u000aA pH of 7 is neutral, explains Boghosian; anything less is acid. She said many of today's popular apple cider vinegars are in the 2 to 3 range -- about the same as stomach acid.\u000a\u000a"Anything acidic which contacts your teeth will wear out the enamel, the protective coating, and that will cause cavities," Boghosian adds. "So, this is totally, completely wrong, unless you want to be paying more visits to your dentist."\u000a\u000aSkin, hair and nails\u000a\u000aCommonly suggested uses for apple cider vinegar across the internet include it's use as a treatment for skin infections and acne, fighting lice and dandruff, as a natural wart remover and as an anti-aging treatment.\u000a\u000a"It will dry out a pimple, but it's not an anti-aging method," says dermatologist Dr. Marie Jhin, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Dermatology. "It might fade dark spots, or maybe you could use it as a skin toner, if you dilute it a great deal. But I wouldn't recommend it. We have much more effective and safe methods today than this."\u000a\u000aOne use she can agree with: "I do love it for bites, especially mosquito bites. It's a very underutilized home remedy. If you have a lot of bites, put two cups in a full tub of water and soak. It will help with itching," she says.\u000a\u000a"It can also help with sunburn, although there are so many other good remedies," Jhin adds. "We don't usually suggest that to patients."\u000a\u000aApple cider vinegar might help with dandruff, says Jihn, because the acidity could increase the sloughing of the skin on the scalp, and it does have some antifungal properties.\u000a\u000aBut don't turn to it to get rid of head lice. One study found the use of vinegar to be the least effective method among several natural solutions; only petroleum jelly killed adult louse, but it did next to nothing to fight the eggs.\u000a\u000a"I love vinegar for Another use Jhin recommends:"I love vinegar for paronychia , an infection under the cuticle that a lot of people get," Jhin says. She suggests mixing one-fourth cup of vinegar with three-fourths cup of water and soaking nails.\u000a\u000aBut what about warts and other home uses?\u000a\u000a"Warts are caused by a virus, so there's no cure," Jihn explains. "You can dab a diluted version of apple cider vinegar on a wart with a Q-tip, and it's going to help remove dead skin, which is what we do in the office by paring it down, cutting it out or burning it with liquid nitrogen. But it's not going to be as fast or effective as what we do in the office."\u000a\u000aAmerican Academy of Dermatology spokesman Dr. Michael Lin, director of the Advanced Dermatology and Skin Cancer Institute in Beverly Hills, has a more negative perspective on home use.\u000a\u000a"I've had quite a few patients harmed by apple cider vinegar," Lin explains. "One terrible example was a man trying to treat genital warts. When he came into the office, the entire area was raw, burned by the vinegar.\u000a\u000a"I don't know if he was using it full-strength, but whatever he was doing it was too strong," he continues. "He probably has permanent scarring from that natural home treatment."\u000a\u000aLin says he feels more comfortable recommending distilled white vinegar, as it is created to a standardized formulation of 5% acidity.\u000a\u000a"With apple cider vinegar, you don't know what strength you're getting," Lin says. "It's depends on the brand, and even among batches within a brand, you could get different concentrations of acidity."\u000a\u000a"If you do choose to use apple cider vinegar, try to buy a name brand that clearly labels the acidity level. And whatever you do, don't use it full-strength."\u000a\u000aHe suggests a 1:10 ratio.\u000a\u000aAll-purpose cleaner\u000a\u000aBecause of apple cider vinegar's antimicrobial properties, it is often suggested as a natural cleanser for the home.\u000a\u000aThe acid is effective against mold, but according to the Pesticide Research Institute , an environmental consulting firm, so are salt, lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide, tea tree oil and baking soda.\u000a\u000aMany of those also smell better.\u000a\u000aApple cider vinegar is biodegradable, and because of its low pH, it's great against alkaline grime such as hard water and mineral deposits, as well as soap scum.\u000a\u000aBut it won't cut grease. Why not? Just think of a simple oil and vinegar salad dressing. After mixing, the oil and vinegar quickly separate because oil is nonpolar, while vinegar and water are polar, meaning they are not attracted to each other.\u000a\u000aWill apple cider or other vinegars sanitize or disinfect your home? Probably not enough to make you feel germ-free.\u000a\u000a2000 study also showed vinegars to be quite effective against the waterborne bacteria That2000 study also showed vinegars to be quite effective against the waterborne bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa , mostly found in hospitals and untreated hot tubs. It was also effective against Salmonella choleraesuis, a rare pig-borne version of salmonella.\u000a\u000aIf you do choose to use a vinegar to clean your home, never mix it with bleach or ammonia, because it will create toxic chlorine or chloramine gases.\u000a\u000aFood preservatives\u000a\u000aUsed for centuries to preserve everything from pickles to pig's feet, vinegar is now becoming popular as a natural preservative in processed meat and poultry items as well.\u000a\u000aMost home pickling uses 5% distilled white vinegar because it doesn't affect the color of the vegetables or fruits, but apple cider vinegar is a popular choice due to its mellow, fruity flavor. Do know, however, that it will turn most fruits and veggies dark.\u000a\u000aAnother popular use for apple cider, and other vinegars, is as a food wash to reduce bacteria or viruses on the surface of fruits and vegetables. Studies have had varying results, often depending on the type of fruit or vegetable and the amount of time spent in the vinegar solution.\u000a\u000aApple cider and other vinegars is used by some as a food wash to reduce the number of bacteria or virus on fruits or vegetables.\u000a\u000aAfter listing a number of studies and results, the US Food and Drug Administration sums it up: "Vinegar and lemon juice have potential as inexpensive, simple household sanitizers; however, possible negative sensory effects [color, odor] when used on produce would be a disadvantage."\u000a\u000aCough and sore throat\u000a\u000aThe use of vinegar medicinally starts with the father of modern medicine, Hippocrates. He would mix it with honey and use it for chronic coughs and sore throats, and the suggestion continues today across the internet.\u000a\u000aMany parents might think this is a natural and safe option for their children. The American Academy of Pediatrics doesn't have an official stance on the use of apple cider or other vinegars as a health aid, but spokeswoman Dr. Jennifer Shu urges caution.\u000a\u000a"I would just think that the vinegar would irritate the throat even more," says Shu, an Atlanta pediatrician and author of "Food Fights". "But diluting it and mixing it with other ingredients such as salt or honey might decrease any pain that the vinegar might cause."\u000a\u000aThe University of Arizona's Johnston cautions against trying any vinegar straight, due to the risk of inhaling the liquid and damaging the lungs.\u000a\u000a"Vinegar has that strong smell and puckering taste, so if you take a breath, you could inhale it into your lungs as you swallow," she says. "It can burn the lungs a little, because it is an acid."\u000a\u000a"It can also burn your esophagus," says Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado. "And if you're predisposed to reflux, ulcers or stomach problems, it could certainly make those worse."\u000a\u000aHeart disease and cancer\u000a\u000aIf you're a rat worried about heart disease, put apple cider and other vinegars on your shopping list.\u000a\u000aStudies show the vinegar can reduce blood pressure triglycerides and total cholesterol in rodents fed a high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet. But similar studies have not been conducted in humans.\u000a\u000aFreeman, who serves on the American College of Cardiology's prevention board, says there could be some benefit due to its antioxidant properties, like other heart-healthy fruits and vegetables, such as broccoli and blueberries.\u000a\u000a"The data is not particularly strong or overwhelming, but vascular health may be enhanced," Freeman says. "What's best to avoid heart disease is to exercise and eat a low-fat, plant-based diet."\u000a\u000aFreeman further recommends using apple cider or other vinegars on salads, to maximize the benefits and reduce any reactions to the acidity.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aStudies in humans are nonexistent.\u000a\u000aSo, does apple cider vinegar measure up to its positive internet reputation? If you consider that almost any other vinegar will produce the same benefits, not so much.\u000a\u000aThere are also some serious downsides, if used full strength and inappropriately. As the experts suggest, make sure you check with your doctor before giving it a try.\u000a\u000a"When do you a search for apple cider vinegar you see so many claims, and people will try it, searching for that natural cure-all," says Drayer.\u000a\u000a"Whether any of those claims are based on science is another matter."

She is the love and relationship ambassador for AARP and writes the Naked Truth column for AARP.org. She is also a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit organization that gathers research on American families. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) -- Some revolutions happen in a single day; others over decades. The rise of the voluntarily single woman has been happening in Western societies slowly, over time, concomitant with well-paying jobs, legal protection from economic or physical abuse, reliable birth control and the possibility of fulfilling careers and adventures.\u000a\u000aWomen are marrying at a later age these days, cohabiting with their partners or going in and out of short-term relationships without ever walking down the aisle.\u000a\u000aCurrently, 53% of women over 18 are in the singles column. Put another way, women now have choices that allow them to customize the arc of their lives and some of them find that it is best for them to put marriage aside.\u000a\u000aIs this natural? Is this bad? Is this cause for alarm?\u000a\u000aWe have long counted on women's sacrifices and the compromises they've made to lift societies all over the world. We are worried that if women delay or forgo marriage, the all-important family unit will suffer.\u000a\u000aAs much as I admire happy couples and families, I think this may be one of the few times in history when so many women could choose from such a full range of life choices without penalty or stigma. Since few people "have it all," why not choose being single if that's the best option?\u000a\u000aWhat it comes down to is people get married when it's a good deal. The question is why isn't marriage a good deal anymore? Here are some considerations.\u000a\u000a1. A useless husband\u000a\u000aIf a woman is poor and only meets equally poor or poorer men, she's in a tough spot. It is no secret that many women do not choose to marry if the available partners will make their economic situation worse.\u000a\u000aIn some of these cases, even if a woman has a child, she may be better off with government help than a nonworking, noninvolved husband.\u000a\u000a2. Success changes everything\u000a\u000aWhen a woman is very privileged or highly successful, marriage could come very easily -- or not. Think of the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times. Or Oprah Winfrey, who for personal or professional reasons, is not married.\u000a\u000aMoreover, a woman doesn't need a husband who is a high-powered corporate attorney if she is a high-powered corporate attorney. Taking advantage of economic and professional opportunities could be undermined by committing to a partner with an equally ambitious, or different, life agenda. This kind of woman may wake up every day to new and exciting challenges and think, "best to wait."\u000a\u000a3. Unwilling to make traditional compromises\u000a\u000aA woman who doesn't want to settle for cooking and cleaning and being the primary parent that society prefers. She is not meeting guys who want the kind of woman she is.\u000a\u000a4. The marriage penalty tax\u000a\u000aSome women are in an income bracket where marriage inflicts economic costs. She would have to pay more taxes if she marries someone who earns approximately what she makes or more.\u000a\u000a5. Avoiding cheating men\u000a\u000aA few years ago when I was in China, I had a conversation with some very beautiful female Chinese TV personalities about their personal life. I asked them why they were single and if they wanted to get married.\u000a\u000aThe three women all said they didn't want to marry because "the men of our class will all expect to have mistresses, and it is better not to marry than have to put up with that." I have no idea if this was an exaggeration or not -- but they believed it.\u000a\u000a6. Waiting for the "one"\u000a\u000aThese women wait for the perfect guy, or the guy who they would fall in love with and love them back just as much. If that man doesn't come along, they prefer to go alone. As women get pickier, more factors enter into the marriage equation.\u000a\u000aThey may find someone who doesn't quite go the distance even after years of dating. They cohabit with someone and it doesn't work out. Singlehood, never intentional, becomes a fact. But they will not marry just to marry as their mothers or grandmothers might have.\u000a\u000aIn social psychology, there is a classic theory called "exchange theory." It is a bit cold-blooded, but it predicts that a person's actions will be based on trying to find a balance of give and get. Each person's resources -- of all kinds, including money, looks, background -- are traded back and forth for a "good deal." For example, a "good deal" scenario could be a woman who makes an excellent living pairing up with a man who is a writer and is willing to work at home and be the primary child care person.\u000a\u000aWhen women's life choices were highly constrained, they had little negotiating power. They had to marry or were seen as damaged. A few got away with being "free spirits" but usually they were exceptional in wealth or lineage -- and even so, it wasn't easy.\u000a\u000aIt's different now. While most women still want marriage, they don't want it at just any price. They don't want it if it scuttles their dreams. Marriage is not dead -- not by a long shot. It is still, to most of us, the house we wish to build for our love, our lover and our children.\u000a\u000aBut women want to craft a life instead of having it pressed upon them. And that means some of us will be single for a long time, and some of us will be single for life.\u000a\u000aRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine\u000a\u000aFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\u000a\u000aJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion

aVDr. Joseph P. Alukal is an associate professor (Urology, Ob/Gyn) at the NYU School of Medicine and director of Male Reproductive Health for NYU Langone Health. He also is a host of the "Men's Health Show" on SiriusXM's Doctor Radio . Follow him on Twitter @alukal . The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Research into reproductive biology is one of the most fascinating corners of medicine and science; my interest in this field was one of the driving forces behind my decision to go to medical school. Work in this field has resulted in life-changing treatments for infertile patients. More than one million babies have been born in the US to otherwise infertile couples, thanks to lab-assisted techniques like in-vitro fertilization (IVF).\u000a\u000aAt the same time; there remains a massive amount of research to do. Treatments for women whose number of eggs are prematurely low ( diminished ovarian reserve ), understanding of the causes and treatments of low or zero sperm counts ( azoospermia ) in male patients, non-surgical male contraception -- all of these topics are incompletely understood at present. As a result, infertile patients continue to suffer.\u000a\u000aThis new study raises obvious questions: why might this decrease be occurring? Is this trend indicative of other ongoing changes in men's health? Are there obvious causes of this trend and can they be acted upon? As a researcher in this field, I know the importance of answering that last question -- what might be the causes and what do we do about them -- and I know that there is already ongoing research on this front. But certainly more is needed.\u000a\u000aPossible explanations include lifestyle factors (increasing obesity, tobacco use and its lingering effects), aging demographics of people pursing family building, environmental exposures to substances including plastics, hormones, radiation and radio frequency networks, and biological changes -- the results of what we call epigenetic change -- from fertility or hormonal treatments. Several factors could potentially be at play at the same time.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, obtaining an answer to this conundrum is challenging at best. There are unique barriers to answering these questions through experiments (including the obvious fact that experiments to prove these theories cannot be performed in humans). Even if we had an answer as to a single culprit, the further question of "What can we do about it?" seems even more daunting.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I remind people whenever I can that no field of research is more important than understanding the biology of conception. Cancer research, cardiovascular health research -- these fields will enable us to live longer. But, of course, that ceases to be important if a hypothetical fertility crisis results in fewer or even no babies being born. Understanding human fertility is a vital part of understanding the cycle of human life and death.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, our fertility research is governed by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine , whose first national meeting was held almost 75 years ago. I often point out that the meeting topics on male fertility at that first meeting are still being discussed at our current meetings. The need for further research in our field was already urgent. Dr. Levine's study makes that need even more vital.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aI am asked repeatedly what I tell my patients about this study. I remind people that healthy behavior is the easiest intervention patients can opt into. Studies have found that smoking cessation sleep hygiene , and diet promote healthy sperm count. That being said, we will continue to test for potential causes of male fertility and we will act upon the causes that are correctable.\u000a\u000aI know that this recommendation constitutes basic common sense, and it is the advice that I would give to a friend or a family member. But in the back of my mind, every time I am saying this to someone, I am asking myself the question of how we can do more or be better. What further research study will help us to better understand both the worldwide trends in fertility and problems each of my individual patients face? Hopefully the conversation this study has started will enable that research to become a reality.

aVStory highlights Mark Bauerlein: NY Times reflexively mis-characterized Justice Dept.'s affirmative action initiative as discrimination against whites\u000a\u000aHe says liberals uncomfortable facing 'Asian factor' in college admissions and with Trump administration transgressing progressive sacred principle\u000a\u000aMark Bauerlein is a professor of English at Emory University, senior editor of the journal "First Things" and author of "The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future; Or, Don't Trust Anyone Under 30." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) If you doubt that affirmative action policies in college admissions need a bright dose of sunlight, just read the first sentence of The New York Times story that purported to reveal a new Justice Department initiative to examine those policies. The story, which the administration has disputed, asserts that the aim of the Trump administration is to investigate and sue schools over actions that "discriminate against white applicants."\u000a\u000aMark Bauerlein\u000a\u000aDo you see the problem? It's a common one in liberal defenses of affirmative action. We realize it in an admission a few sentences later in the story. The Justice Department document that The Times has obtained, you see, says nothing about white people. In fact, the document doesn't identify any specific victim of affirmative action, only the procedures of "intentional race-based discrimination."\u000a\u000aNow, most people assume, as the Times reporter does, that white applicants are the ones who suffer when schools lower the bar for minority students. When the Supreme Court decided against Abigail Fisher in her challenge to affirmative action policies at the University of Texas, the interim president of the University of Houston Downtown predicted that while "moral order has been restored in the universe, there will be more aggrieved whites." A journalist for The Root cast threats to affirmative action as the restoration of "white-collar white supremacy."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Late night airs white discrimination PSA spoof Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Late night airs white discrimination PSA spoof 01:21\u000a\u000aWhen we look at affirmative action policies at selective institutions, though, it isn't whites who will benefit the most if they are restricted. It is, potentially, Asians. In 2004, a Princeton University study of 124,000 applications to elite selective institutions, looked at SAT scores and found that "Asians experience the greatest disadvantage in admissions vis-à-vis other comparable racial/ethnic groups." The researchers claimed that being Asian is "comparable to a loss of 50 SAT points."\u000a\u000aThe big surprise in the study was that Asians had to score significantly higher than whites, as well as blacks and Hispanics. Despite having a higher average SAT score, Asians have lower odds of admission than do "comparable whites."\u000a\u000aRead More

aVWashington (CNN) Shortly before Sen. John McCain entered the Senate chamber in the wee hours of Friday morning, reporters wanted to know how he'd vote.\u000a\u000aHe instructed them to "watch the show."\u000a\u000aMcCain killed his party's narrowly-crafted Obamacare repeal bill Friday not because he was opposed to dismantling the Affordable Care Act, but because he fundamentally believed the process -- the lack of hearings, the one-party, closed-door negotiations, the fact that in the end all that Republican senators could agree upon was a shell of the plan they'd promised -- was flawed.\u000a\u000aIt was a result that may have been hinted at earlier in the week.\u000a\u000aLess than two weeks after surgery to remove a blood clot revealed McCain had brain cancer, the Arizona Republican -- still with a visible scar above his eye -- traveled 2,000 miles from Phoenix and returned to a hero's welcome Tuesday in the Senate, where he delivered an epic 15-minute speech that rattled the conscience of the body.\u000a\u000a"We're getting nothing done, my friends," McCain told his colleagues. "We're getting nothing done."\u000a\u000aIt was a fiery and intense lecture on the shortcomings of bypassing "regular order" and turning your back on compromise. But moments earlier, McCain had delivered a decisive vote to advance a health care bill that was still an uncertain product at that point, a kind of blessing for the type of secretive negotiations he'd just decried.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The life and career of Sen.

Instead, McCain took a vote that very well may re-chart the course of Trump's own legislative agenda.\u000a\u000aTrump, of course, had insulted McCain back in 2015.

aV(CNN) There was a time when Barcelona fans did not expect success. To wallow in pessimism was the accepted norm. Trophies? Titles? They were for others, usually the reserve of the grandiose club of the capital, Real Madrid.\u000a\u000aThe European Cup was as elusive as the unicorn: talked about, looked at with wonder, pictured with others but never seen in this Catalonian city by the Mediterranean sea.\u000a\u000aA club like Barcelona, the nihilistic fans would say, would never reach the zenith of European club football. There was no bombast, no peacocking, just fatalism.\u000a\u000aThe ironhanded years of General Francisco Franco, whose dictatorial regime had crushed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy, had ruined the spirit.\u000a\u000aTrue, Barcelona had been able to sign football greats such as Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona, but two European Cup finals -- in 1961 and 1986 -- had ended in defeat and between 1961 and 1990, the club won just two league titles in Spain's top flight, finishing runners up 13 times.\u000a\u000aBut all changed on May 20, 1992.\u000a\u000aThat was the day Barcelona won its first European Cup. That was the day the club, its city, and football was transformed.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Xavi hails Barca's 1992 Dream Team Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Xavi hails Barca's 1992 Dream Team 01:54\u000a\u000aBarcelona's 'Holy Grail'\u000a\u000aSpringtime in London. Cruyff, the football revolutionary, now Barcelona's visionary coach, and his assembled team of artists, known as the "Dream Team," are at Wembley for the first European Cup final of the Dutchman's managerial reign.\u000a\u000aOpponents Sampdoria have poachers supreme in Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Mancini, but Barcelona can offset the Italians with Michael Laudrup, Pep Guardiola, Hirsto Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman.\u000a\u000aBarcelona Team Group. (Back Row L-R) Andoni Zubizarreta, Nando, Julio Salinas, Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov, Eusebio Sacristan, (Front Row L-R) Jose Mari Bakero, Albert Ferrer, Josep Guardiola, Juan Carlos\u000a\u000aIf it's a title-winning team of regal talent, Barcelona's fans, however, are preparing for the worst.\u000a\u000aMemories of the club's European Cup final defeat on penalties to Steaua Bucharest in 1986 are still fresh so supporters ask Cruyff to record a few soothing words for the return journey to Spain, a precaution should the worst happen.\u000a\u000aBut Cruyff, in his fourth year as Barca manager, wants his players to forget about the club's past. His battle cry as he sends his men out onto the Wembley turf? "Go out there and enjoy it."\u000a\u000a"It was more than a thorn in their side. It was something that was almost mythical, to get to that final and win it."\u000a\u000aFull-time turns into extra-time and the score remains goalless. Knees are knocking, in the stands and in the dugout. Penalties are looming. Fear.\u000a\u000aBut with less than 10 minutes remaining Barcelona is awarded a free-kick. Koeman, the sweeper with a sniper's eye for long-range goals, steps forward.\u000a\u000aWatching on television in Barcelona is a teenaged Xavi, an academy player who would go on to become one of the club's greats.\u000a\u000a"It was truly an extraordinary experience," the former Spain and Barcelona midfielder tells CNN as he remembers the match unfolding.\u000a\u000aTwenty-five yards from goal, Koeman shoots. He aims low towards the bottom corner. Defenders rush forwards, breaking from the defensive wall. The goalkeeper stretches and dives to his right. But they're all too late. They are beaten.\u000a\u000aKoeman scored 102 goals in 354 games during his career\u000a\u000aThe goalscorer sprints towards the sidelines and his teammates follow, swallowing him up in a jubilant wave of orange shirts when he is caught.\u000a\u000aWhen the blond Dutchman emerges from the celebratory mass, he is hiding his face in his hands, using his fingertips to hold back tears.\u000a\u000aHis is the winning goal, a strike which unshackles his club from the heavy weight of history. "It was the beginning of big changes," Koeman, who pulled on Barca's blue and garnet shirt over his orange top before lifting the European Cup, would later say.\u000a\u000aCruyff's Dream Team won four successive league titles between 1990 and 1994\u000a\u000aThe genius from Amsterdam\u000a\u000aCruyff had made an impact at the Camp Nou as a player, winning the title in his first season following a world-record move in 1973, but it was the Dutchman's appointment as coach in 1988 that changed the club's DNA.\u000a\u000aOn May 4, when Cruyff is announced as Barcelona's coach, the team is experiencing its worst season since 1941-42. The club is in debt and in crisis. They go on to finish sixth in the league, two points off 10th place, while Real Madrid celebrate a fifth straight La Liga title. Ignominy.\u000a\u000aHe had, Cruyff said, inherited players who "wanted to have fights about the past."\u000a\u000aCruyff died, aged 68, in 2016\u000a\u000aIn planning for the future a manic period of departures and arrivals follows -- 15 players are sold and 12 are bought. Cruyff, one of the greatest players of all time, took risks but rewards followed.\u000a\u000aAmong the newcomers are the young and eager Txiki Begiristain, Jose Mari Bakero, Julio Salinas and Eusebio Sacristan, a quartet which would become crucial cogs in the manager's Dream Team.\u000a\u000a"They were conditioned to coming second," says Hunter of the Barcelona squad Cruyff inherited.\u000a\u000a"He felt there was a losing mentality around Catalonia itself and that this was a product of years of oppression under the Franco dictatorship. Commenting on another tragic day had become a habit."\u000a\u000aTo accompany the change of personnel, came a shift in style. Naturally, Cruyff -- a three-time European Cup winner with Ajax -- wanted to win, but there was a way of winning. A philosophy, an identity.\u000a\u000aIn the era of 4-4-2, the young manager introduced the 3-4-3 formation -- an adaptation of the 4-3-3 system Cruyff had played under the coaching pioneer Rinus Michels for the Netherlands and Ajax in the 1970s.\u000a\u000aCruyff reached the 1974 World Cup final with the Netherlands, who were lauded for their 'Total Football' style, but were beaten 2-1 by West Germany\u000a\u000a"We couldn't believe how many attackers were in the team," Eusebio, who made more than 250 appearances under Cruyff, said of the day the boss first drew three defenders, four midfielders, two out-and-out wingers and a center-forward on the blackboard.\u000a\u000aThis radical change would require players to be comfortable interchanging positions. They would have to press, they would have to pass swiftly. Possession would reign supreme, which was not an easy task in a club where defenders were usually jeered for passing the ball back to the goalkeeper.\u000a\u000aFor Cruyff to implement this cerebral approach, he needed a production line to supply him with possession-hungry players. Cue the overhauling of La Masia, the club's academy. Barcelona would never be the same again.\u000a\u000aDifferentiating Barcelona from the rest\u000a\u000aEvery team, from the under-eights to Barcelona's B team, were ordered to play the revolutionary 3-4-3, with an emphasis on technique rather than physique, another volte-face for a club which, as recently as 1986, selected young players based on whether they would be taller than 1.80m.\u000a\u000aFirst off the conveyor belt were Albert Ferrer, Guillermo Amor and Guardiola, the 1992 history-makers.\u000a\u000aFor Carlos Hugo Garcia Bayon, a former assistant coach at Barcelona B, winning the European Cup with academy graduates in the side was confirmation that Cruyff's methods worked.\u000a\u000aBayon tells CNN: "It was that victory which changed the culture and mentality of the club. They won the European Cup, but won it playing a specific style and with a lot of players from La Masia.\u000a\u000a"It was something unique, something that differentiated us from others.\u000a\u000a"Without a doubt, if you have a methodology and that methodology doesn't win, you are going to lose confidence to play players from the academy."\u000a\u000aCesc Fabregas, one of La Masia's graduates, holds aloft the World Cup trophy after Spain won the 2010 final\u000a\u000aFrom that famous Wembley win, other world class seedlings blossomed at the La Masia hothouse: Xavi, Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas, to name but a few.\u000a\u000aAll of them, bar Messi, integral to not only Barcelona's success but that of the Spain team which won the World Cup in 2010 and two consecutive European Championships in 2008 and 2012.\u000a\u000a"They were the generation who paved the way for us," says Xavi of the European Cup-winning Dream Team. "They gave Barcelona a winning mentality. It was an example for all of us."\u000a\u000aHunter says academy players grew up "thinking anything was possible" after seeing the likes of Guardiola succeed on the biggest stage of all.\u000a\u000a"The brand of football we saw from 2003-12, the unbroken stretch of success, those types of players, the promotion from the youth system, the attitude, the winning mentality, all of these have geneses in the Wembley victory over Sampdoria," he says.\u000a\u000a'Now you have it here'\u000a\u000aFrom Wembley to Barcelona and a dizzying week of celebrations for the club's European pioneers.\u000a\u000aOn the balcony of Placa de Sant Jaume, stood Cruyff's men, soaking up the adulation of their fans, holding aloft the European Cup. Fantasy had become reality.\u000a\u000aA 21-year-old Guardiola, the Catalan symbol, shouted: "Citizens of Catalonia -- now you have it here."\u000a\u000aThe midfielder, says Hunter, had prepared in advance, modifying a phrase used by Josep Tarradellas, named "President in absentia" by his people in 1954 during the Franco dictatorship, when on the same balcony in the city's gothic quarter 15 years earlier.\u000a\u000aThe Dream Team's European success, combined with the Olympic Games which was held in the city later that summer, transformed Barcelona and its people.\u000a\u000aHunter describes the summer of 92 as the "one of the most important summers in the history of Barcelona and Catalonia."\u000a\u000aThe football club, whose slogan is 'more than a club' for its defense of the Catalan culture and language, became Catalonia's most important institution. The radical shift was not solely on the pitch.\u000a\u000aSpreading the Cruyff gospel\u000a\u000aNovember 25, 2012, the day the teachings of Cruyff, his vision for a team full of La Masia pass masters becomes reality.\u000a\u000aBarcelona is playing Levante in a league game. In the 14th minute Martin Montoya replaces Brazilian full-back Dani Alves. It is the first time in Barcelona's history that the entire first team comprises of players who graduated through the club's now famed academy. It is the legacy of Cruyff and the 1992 European Cup win.\u000a\u000a"La Masia is a football school but also a school of values, a school of life," explains Xavi.\u000a\u000a"It is something to feel proud about. We now have 20 to 25 years of harvesting titles for Barcelona and playing an attractive style of football for the fans."\u000a\u000aGuardiola won 14 trophies from a possible 19 in his four years as Barcelona coach\u000a\u000aGuardiola, the great player who became the club's most successful coach, has often said that he and other Barcelona managers have simply been restoring, or improving, the chapel that Cruyff painted.\u000a\u000aThe Catalan himself created a football masterpiece, winning 14 trophies in four golden seasons between 2008 and 2012 with one of the greatest teams in history, the heart of which were other wordly academy talents.\u000a\u000aFor Bayon, currently academy director at Celta Vigo, the transformation of the Dream Team from playing greats to high-class managers is another lasting legacy of that 1992 win, with Cruyff's former players spreading his gospel in various leagues around the world.\u000a\u000aIn England there is Guardiola at Manchester City and Koeman at Everton, while Eusebio is in La Liga. The latter two are being linked with succeeding Luis Enrique as Barca boss when he leaves at the end of this season.\u000a\u000aThere are others too: Michael Laudrup managing in Qatar, Txiki Begiristain, an unused substitute at Wembley, as sporting director at Manchester City and Andoni Zubizarreta in Marseille as the French club's sporting director.\u000a\u000a"They have become great managers, that's one of the most important thing from that victory. It generated a culture of coaching. It is not only to generate great players, but great coaches," says Bayon.\u000a\u000aAn identity changed\u000a\u000aAnd so, to the future. What about the Barcelona of today?\u000a\u000aUnder Enrique, who will depart at the end of the season having won the Champions League and two Spanish titles, does the legacy of Wembley 1992 still run through the side like letters in a stick of rock?\u000a\u000aOf the title-chasing Barcelona team which started in the 4-1 victory over Las Palmas on May 14, only four players -- Sergio Busquets, Messi, Iniesta and Jordi Alba -- had played for the academy. Alba, released by the club in 2005, was repatriated seven years later at a cost of 14 million euros ($15.49m) from Valencia.\u000a\u000aPossession has not always been king for Enrique's Barcelona, although there have been significant departures during the Spaniard's reign.\u000a\u000aAged 35, Xavi left in 2015 to play in Qatar, following another academy great, Carles Puyol, who retired in 2014, out of the Camp Nou.\u000a\u000aSuarez, Messi and Neymar have been lethal goalscorers for Luis Garcia's Barcelona\u000a\u000a"No youth system will be able to produce that generation repeatedly on demand," says Hunter. "It's just not feasible, but the tail-off has been pretty dramatic and has inevitably changed the football Barcelona play.\u000a\u000a"When you sign from outside they don't have the same aptitude, they don't speak the same football language.\u000a\u000a"There are fewer youth products available to Enrique than there were to (Frank) Riijkard and Guardiola and it's also been a strategic idea that the front three -- Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez -- need to be given the ball more quickly and with less elaboration because they're different strikers to any in the club's history.\u000a\u000a"They need less work, they're able to score on their own so the midfield is sometimes bypassed.\u000a\u000a"The identity of the first-team football in the last two-and-a-half years has significantly changed, but the actual existence of the youth system in unchallenged, it's part of their identity."\u000a\u000aIfs, buts, maybes\u000a\u000aGuardiola has already said he would vote for Pique should his former run for president at Barcelona.\u000a\u000aIs this the closing chapter of a glorious Cruyff-inspired quarter of a century of success? Not quite.\u000a\u000aIn Xavi, Pique, Busquets and Puyol, Barcelona could have former pupils as zealous off the pitch for their brilliance on it.\u000a\u000aXavi has already said he dreams of one day managing his former club and has divulged a plan which would have the club run exclusively by former La Masia graduates, with Pique as president, Puyol as sporting director and Busquets as his assistant.\u000a\u000a"If we talk in 10 years' time, I imagine some president will have attempted, and succeed, in appointing Xavi as first-team coach, with Busquets as his assistant," says Hunter.\u000a\u000a"It's Pique's declared intent to run for presidency at one stage of his life. That would be the most dramatic induction of Cruyff and Guardiola values into the club."\u000a\u000aAcademy graduate Messi is Barcelona's all-time leading goalscorer, netting over 500 times for the club\u000a\u000aHow different would Barcelona's history be had they not won in 1992?\u000a\u000aThe trophy cabinet tells a story: Three league titles in the 25 years leading up to the Dream Team's European Cup success, 13 thereafter and four nights of Champions League glory -- a total of 44 trophies in 25 years and their status as one of the sport's dominant forces fixed.\u000a\u000aPessimism replaced with confidence, fatalism defeated, and the club's global status only reinforced by the style -- dubbed tiki-taka -- that accompanied that success.\u000a\u000aHad Barcelona not won in 1992, they may have had greater motivation, Hunter argues, in the 1994 Champions League final against AC Milan, which they lost 4-0.\u000a\u000a"They were complacent, they believed they would win for sure," he says.\u000a\u000aBut without European success under Cruyff there is less glue to hold his system in place.\u000a\u000a"You can't say whether they would have won other Champions Leagues because each of the Champions Leagues subsequently won after 1992 have direct lineage to Cruyff and his beliefs," says Hunter.\u000a\u000a"With no trophy under Cruyff then Barcelona's history is subsequently going to be much poorer and the trophy cabinet is going to be more barren.\u000a\u000a"No European Cup win under Cruyff and the subsequent history, which we've become so used to -- the signing of Messi, the recruitment of Iniesta -- probably wouldn't have happened."

aVLaurie Garrett is a Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Thirty-five years ago, alert physicians in the United States spotted a new disease, caused by a virus that had been in circulation, unnoticed, for decades in people, and millennia in monkeys.\u000a\u000aThe virus had hit pay dirt, racing through the gay sexual revolution where one man might have sex with 30 other men a year, giving the virus exponential rates of infection\u000a\u000aOver time, the virus' transmission shifted, especially in Africa, from rare cases of monkey-to-human transmission to general heterosexual spread, with women today five times more likely to be newly infected compared to men, thanks to sexual cultures that favor male promiscuity.\u000a\u000aThat was HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which currently infects more than 37 million people living all over the world.\u000a\u000aA key lesson of AIDS is that a virus\u2014in HIV's case, infecting African monkeys\u2014might pass rarely, but repeatedly, to human beings for decades before arriving in a context of epidemic potential.\u000a\u000aAdapting to new modes of transmission and targeting novel species, the microbe can exist for thousands of years before beginning to achieve previously unimaginable feats, with devastating impact.\u000a\u000aNow the world is facing a virus that seems poised to make a similar leap: the Zika virus.\u000a\u000aLike HIV, Zika originated in central Africa, very rarely infecting human beings, and circulating among rainforest primates. Unlike HIV, Zika had the ability to fly, carried by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from one monkey or human, to another.\u000a\u000aSince reaching Brazil in 2013, where it has spread explosively over the last 12 months, Zika has demonstrated capabilities not seen, or extremely rarely noted, with any other insect-carried microbes.\u000a\u000aMost worrying, Zika has shed its mosquito transport dependency, becoming an efficient resident of human semen , and spread from male-to-female (and male-to-male) via sexual intercourse.\u000a\u000aThis week researchers reported finding Zika in a woman's vagina, noting that, "the very presence in the female genital tract [implies] that sexual transmission from women to men could occur." And barely had the ink dried on that report when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced today that a woman who traveled in a Zika-hit country, who got infected through a mosquito bite, has passed the virus onto her male sexual partner in New York City, marking the first documented case of female to male sexual transmission in the U.S. (and the 14th documented sexual transmission in the U.S. overall).\u000a\u000aIf Zika finds its way into an especially sexually active community, it could well become a threat not only in America's southern, mosquito-infested states, but anywhere in the world.\u000a\u000aLike HIV, the Zika virus would likely find its way into populations that feel discriminated against by the general population, and take its toll disproportionately among teenage girls and young women.\u000a\u000aAnd while politicians play partisan games with funding on Capitol Hill, government and philanthropic donors ignore the World Health Organization's pleas for a measly $122 million to fight it, and state health agencies scramble to find anti-mosquito resources, the virus is spreading in new ways , causing an ever-widening range of dangerous birth defects and human illnesses.\u000a\u000a"I am concerned that the goose is cooked. This funding is done. It's not coming to us," Dr. Umair Shah, a public health official in Harris Country, Texas told NBC News . "We cannot spray our way out of this situation," Shah added, saying pesticides won't be enough to stop Zika at this late date in the American South.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What twins can tell us about Zika Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What twins can tell us about Zika 03:14\u000a\u000aThe lingering Ebola epidemic in West Africa offers lessons on the difficulty of stopping a virus that takes on sexual transmission and can abide in semen for weeks after a man has recovered from the disease. Several times in 2015 and 2016, Ebola seemed to have been eradicated from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia, only to reemerge via sexual transmission\u000a\u000aThe statistics on Zika as a sexually transmitted disease are sobering. According to the World Health Organization , the Zika virus has emerged in 48 countries since Brazil sounded the alarm in October 2015.\u000a\u000aFour of those countries have active mosquito-borne spread of the virus underway now, and eleven of them\u2014including the United States\u2014have documented sexual transmission of the virus. Two Americans have died of Zika , one in Puerto Rico and the other in Utah. They were among the 1,132 travel-related Zika cases documented in the United States. Among the 50 states, Florida has been hardest hit to date, with 263 confirmed cases, 43 of them pregnant women, followed by Texas.\u000a\u000aPolitics should not trump biology\u000a\u000a"No pregnant women should have to worry that her baby will develop brain damage because she was bitten once by a mosquito," a petition to Congress from the March of Dimes states. "It's an outrage that Congress has failed to give states and localities the resources they need to protect pregnant women and babies from Zika virus."\u000a\u000aThe Zika funding stalemate on Capitol Hill might well result in an increase in the numbers of abortions in the United States this year\u2014an ironic and tragic outcome of a political squabble that features, among other disputes, Democrats' objection to House Republicans' inclusion of anti-Planned Parenthood language in the GOP's Zika bill\u000a\u000aIn Latin American countries hard hit by the virus, abortion rates have soared this year by as much as 108%, which research suggests is due largely to women who feared carrying a "Zika baby" but had no access to tests that could confirm the healthy viability of their fetus. Such tests don't exist: American women have no special advantage in the Zika fight, despite the greater wealth of the United States.\u000a\u000aIn a few days, the Republican Party will gather for its national convention in Cleveland, Ohio\u2014a metropolis that last year ranked in the top twenty most mosquito-infested cities in the United States. At the end of this week, Congress will shut down for the summer, and the politicians will not return to hammer out new agreements until September 6.\u000a\u000aBarring a remarkable compromise, the politicians will exit Washington on Friday, leaving funding for Zika prevention and research in the lurch , with the White House, Senate, and House each offering radically different funding proposals, none of which will materialize as money for research.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in all tiers of public health across America, scientists and officials are scrambling to rob other budgets in order to finance research and mosquito control measures. At local levels, this ironically means things like sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) programs are losing money, so that counties can hire mosquito abatement experts.\u000a\u000aAt the federal level, the remaining Ebola programs are seeing their budgets pilfered to provide temporary Zika funds, and a range of basic science research initiatives at the National Institutes of Health are on hold , their funds diverted to efforts to understand, diagnose, treat and vaccinate against Zika.\u000a\u000aVital questions about Zika, especially as a sexually transmitted disease linked to birth defects, are going unanswered, thanks to the research funding gap.\u000a\u000aCan the world's blood supply be cleansed of Zika risk with transfusion?\u000a\u000aHow likely is it that sexual transmission could dominate spread of Zika in the United States?\u000a\u000aHow long can Zika survive in semen and cause infections?\u000a\u000aHow does the virus get through the placenta to infect the developing fetus?\u000a\u000aIs it possible to create a 100% reliable fetal test for Zika infection and brain damage that can be used to guide decisions regarding pregnancy termination?\u000a\u000aAre the risks greater in a particular stage of pregnancy?\u000a\u000aWhy aren't sonograms reliably identifying microcephaly babies in utero?\u000a\u000aCan a mother give birth to Zika-damaged babies if she never had symptoms of the disease?\u000a\u000aAre there ways that women can protect themselves and carry babies to term, short of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to delay pregnancies altogether?\u000a\u000aHow can a potential Zika vaccine be safely tested on pregnant women and their babies\u000a\u000aIn the absence of answers to these and other Zika questions, women are compelled to make dire decisions, including opting for abortions\u000a\u000aIs Zika becoming a sexually transmitted disease?\u000a\u000aWhile HIV and Ebola offer potential roadmaps for how this might happen, it's still an open question. Researchers in Brazil took a deep dive into the country's data for dengue, a virus spread by the same Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as carry Zika, analyzing of the disease's diagnoses in 2013, 2015, and early 2016.\u000a\u000aThey paid special attention to the distribution of dengue by age and gender. And they did the same for Zika cases in the country over 2015 and 2016. If all Zika cases were due to mosquito bites, the demographic distribution of dengue and Zika should match. But that's not what they found\u000a\u000aInstead, 90% more Zika cases were registered among women, compared to the female rates for dengue.\u000a\u000aNeighboring Colombia has also seen far more Zika in females, with young women accounting for two-thirds of the 65,726 cases diagnosed by mid-April 2016.\u000a\u000aResearchers note that though the infection rate was similar in very young children of both genders, "the incidence was significantly higher among female patients than among male patients in all other age groups."\u000a\u000aCritics charge that both the Brazilian and Colombian studies may simply reflect the greater fear women have about exposure to Zika during pregnancy, prompting more of them to seek medical care. The researchers disagree, insisting that the higher rates of diagnosed Zika are seen in young women, whether or not they are pregnant or are trying to conceive.\u000a\u000aOne reason young women may be at higher risk is that they are having more sex with male partners whose semen may remain Zika-contaminated and infectious for months\u000a\u000aSuch a pronounced gender difference wasn't seen in the Zika outbreaks in Pacific Island nations between 1990 and 2013, but there have been subtle genetic changes in the virus since its arrival in the Americas. Are these mutations relevant to sexual transmission? That is another research question scientists would like to answer, if Congress ever provides funding.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Mothers of Zika babies shunned by society Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mothers of Zika babies shunned by society 02:13\u000a\u000aAt the end of June, frustrated scientists at the NIH decided to charge ahead with pregnancy and sexual research, despite congressional gridlock, by putting numerous other disease studies on temporary hold.\u000a\u000aA large study, tracking women over time in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, has begun enrolling volunteers. "We are going out on a limb, but we have to," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters . "We can't say we're going to wait until we get all the money."\u000a\u000aWhen microbes gain capacity to be sexually transmitted, they rarely disappear from the human population group in which they emerged.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, for instance, physicians in San Francisco noticed that drug-resistant Staphylococcus, MRSA, was far more prevalent among gay men compared to any other demographic group; the bacterial disease had become a STD , soon surfacing among gay men in Boston and New York.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, European researchers discovered that a virulent form of the bacterium that causes meningitis was spreading sexually among gay men. By 2015, gay men were dying from the new STD, and this year, public health officials all over the United States are begging gay men to get vaccinated as meningitis outbreaks surface nationwide.\u000a\u000aHow to prevent a sexually transmitted Zika catastrophe?\u000a\u000aSo what can we do to stave off a similarly catastrophic turn of events with the Zika virus? According to the CDC , 287 pregnant women living in the United States were diagnosed as Zika-infected by June 23, and another 250 in U.S. territories. There is no reliable test that can tell these 537 women whether or not the virus has passed to their fetus, gnawing away at their tiny, developing brains. In the United States and beyond, women especially are in desperate need of such a test.\u000a\u000aA recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans have heard of Zika, which means an alarming third of the population knows nothing about the disease, and is unlikely to take precautions against infection.\u000a\u000aFewer still\u2014less than half\u2014were aware that Zika could be passed sexually. In the absence of such knowledge, sexually active Americans are unlikely to use condoms.\u000a\u000aAround the world, intriguing puzzles abound. Jacqueline Silva de Oliveira lives in Santos, Brazil, where she contracted Zika during her pregnancy\u2014either via a mosquito or sexually, it is not known\u2014and gave birth to twins in February.\u000a\u000aToday, Lucas is a healthy, happy infant, but his twin sister, Laura, suffers in agonizing pain thanks to Zika microcephaly -- which slaughters brain cells and results in complete remodeling of the brain in development.\u000a\u000aThe Brazilian government is monitoring six such sets of twins , discordant for Zika microcephaly, in hopes of learning how the virus infects (or doesn't infect) fetuses.\u000a\u000aIn France , a healthy couple trying to have children sought in vitro fertilization. The clinic assisting them tested their blood and his semen for various infections, including Zika: they were fine.\u000a\u000aThe couple took a holiday in the Caribbean nation of Martinique, returned to France, and underwent more tests. The man's blood was free of Zika, but about a month after they were back in France, the woman became infected. Examination of her partner's semen revealed Zika. Neither of them ever had symptoms of illness, nor felt any reason to avoid sex or use condoms, as they were a married couple trying to have a baby.\u000a\u000aHere at home, time is running out. Researchers desperately need funding to provide the tools required to forestall a sexually transmitted Zika epidemic in the United States.\u000a\u000aIn the absence of those tools, women will make difficult choices, deferring pregnancies for months, perhaps years, and seeking abortions.\u000a\u000aThe stalemate on Capitol Hill may actually increase the likelihood that more American babies will be born with terrible malformations and neurological deficits. And, equally horribly, that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of couples will seek abortions based on suspicion of Zika infection, possibly terminating some healthy pregnancies.

aVStory highlights A judge recently ruled in favor of Maine truckers because of a missing Oxford comma\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter: Oxford commas ward off ambiguity, but need not be used all the time\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "Words on the Move." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) A recent court case seems like a victory for fans of the grand old Oxford comma. To many, it feels natural to write "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cleveland." But just as one may feel lazy saying "My brother and me went home" rather than "My brother and I," there is a sense that it is more proper to write "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland," inserting a comma after the item before the last one.\u000a\u000aAnd people advocating for the Oxford comma have a point now and then. If you were a trucker reading that union rules deny you overtime pay for "the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of agricultural produce," would you consider yourself due overtime payment nevertheless for distribution? That is, as opposed to packing things for shipping and distribution?\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter\u000a\u000aTruckers for Oakhurst Dairy in Maine have been granted back overtime pay for having distributed product as opposed to packing it, because though the writers of the contract meant that overtime would not be granted for distribution either, this is not clear when there is no comma after shipment. The drivers' lawyer has successfully argued that the contract appears to stipulate that overtime won't be granted for, only, the packing of things for future shipping and distribution.\u000a\u000aBut it's premature to read this as demonstrating that everybody should always use the Oxford comma. What happened here shows, just as defensibly, that the Oxford comma should be used in cases of potential ambiguity. The people who wrote the union contract made a mistake, but not in way that means all of us should feel bad about writing "hamburgers, hot dogs and French fries."\u000a\u000aWe might feel slovenly, however, for writing "I had toast, bacon and eggs and coffee" where one could argue that it's unclear whether the bacon and eggs went together or eggs and coffee did, or "My parents, Mother Teresa and the Pope," which implies a rather stunning parental history in casting those two people as your parents, as opposed to persons in sequence with your parents.\u000a\u000aRead More

If they're doing that, that's a total violation of the pledge, yes.\u000a\u000aTrump on his tax returns: "Well, number one, I fully disclosed my financials. And I put them in actually right on time. And nobody else did, by the way, but I put them in on time. And it's almost 100 pages of financials. And it shows over $10 billion. If you figure it out, it's over $10 billion in net worth. And it's an amazing company with great cash flow, very little debt, all of that. You can't tell anything from tax returns, because you take deductions, massive deductions and lots of other things. And you can't tell very much from a tax return. You really can't tell anything as to that. As far as gifts, I give a lot of money. I could probably release a lot of the gifts that I have given over the years. And I probably will do that some time next week. We will just make a listing of the various monies that I have paid for two charities. And I think that's a good idea, actually. But I can't release tax returns when there's an audit. Now, it's very unfair. I have been treated very unfairly by the IRS, because I have been audited almost every year for 10 or 12 years. And I have friends that are very rich people. They never get audited. And so I think I have been really singled out. I don't know why I'm singled out, maybe because I'm a - very conservative, maybe because I'm Tea Party. I feel Tea Party. I have always been sort of that feeling of Tea Party. I have always had great Tea Party support. I don't know what it is, but I have been singled out."\u000a\u000aTrump on the Anti-Defamation League's call to condemn David Duke: "\u000a\u000a[TRUMP] "Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. " [TAPPER] "But I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is, even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing you. Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support? " [TRUMP] "Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I would have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong. " [TAPPER] "The Ku Klux Klan? " [TRUMP] "But you may groups in there that are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So, give me a list of the groups, and I will let you know." [TAPPER] "OK. I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but..."[TRUMP] I" don't know any - honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him."\u000a\u000aTrump on who he would choose as his Vice President: "Well, I have a great business ability. I have always had a great business ability. And I built a great company. And I don't need that, really, I don't believe, for what I'm doing. I would want somebody that can - you know, that does have a little bit of an insider track, so we can get things through Congress. He can work - he or she can work with me on getting, you know, papers filed, papers approved, so we don't have to use executive orders, like President Obama is always using his executive orders because he can't get - he just can't get anything approved. He can't get anything through. So, I would like the idea - I mean, just conceptually - it doesn't mean I'm going to do that, but, conceptually, I like the idea of a political person to go along with my abilities. Now, I'm a very political person also, which people are just about starting to find out. But I would rather have, I think, somebody that's political that can help. But the most important position - now, look, for vice president, you have got to pick somebody who's going to be a great president, because, if something should happen - hopefully not - but if something should happen, the single most important quality would be a person that can be a great president."\u000a\u000aFULL POST

aVPresident Trump says the media is ignoring the U.N.'s sanctions against North Korea. He's wrong.\u000a\u000aIn a tweet sent out at 4:15 PM EST on Monday, the president wrote that "The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N.

Portions of the interview were re-played several times.\u000a\u000aRelated: New North Korea sanctions are unlikely to make Kim blink\u000a\u000aTranscript searches show that the sanctions news was also a frequent topic of discussion on Sunday newscasts.\u000a\u000aMany analysts and commentators, even those who frequently deride Trump, credited his administration with the victory at the U.N.\u000a\u000aThe coverage continued at the start of a new workweek.\u000a\u000aRelated: North Korea vows to 'make the U.S. pay dearly' as sanctions tighten\u000a\u000aOn CNN's "New Day" morning show, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, talked to CNN's Brianna Keilar about the sanctions. That appearance apparently prompted a series of tweets sent by the president attacking Blumenthal.\u000a\u000aAt the moment that Trump tweeted his criticism of the "Fake News Media," CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" was covering the impact of the sanctions.\u000a\u000aCNN's "The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer," discussed the sanctions on Monday, as well.\u000a\u000aThe Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N.

aVNew CNN Special Report Premieres Monday, August 7 at 9:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S. and CNN International\u000a\u000aDonald Trump\u2019s victory on Nov. 8, 2016, shocked the American political establishment. WHY TRUMP WON, tells the story of the signals many missed, but were there all along. Fareed Zakaria points to himself \u2013 \u201cI got it wrong,\u201d he says \u2013 as he explores the cultural forces that propelled Trump towards his historic presidential win in a new CNN Special Report, WHY TRUMP WON, that will premiere Monday, Aug. 7 at 9:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S. and CNN International.\u000a\u000aWHY TRUMP WON shows how Trump has worked towards closing the ultimate deal \u2013 winning the White House \u2013 for decades. Trump attended his first Republican National convention in 1988 and competed for the Reform Party nomination in 1999. And, through print ads, television interviews, and social media, Trump has carefully tailored his political messages over the years and ultimately persuaded millions to join his powerful political army.\u000a\u000aIn WHY TRUMP WON, Zakaria reports on families falling apart: depression, drugs, desperation, and finally resentment taking root in some American communities, supplanting what had been flourishing middle class optimism. Under a veneer of rosy 2016 stock market and jobs statistics, was a decades-long crumbling of middle class culture and a long-simmering loss of faith in institutions.\u000a\u000aDavid Betras, chairman of Ohio\u2019s Mahoning County Democratic Party, is frustrated that \u201ca man who [uses] gold-plated toilets\u201d became the political bannerman for middle America, but Betras feels Hillary Clinton and the Democrats lost as definitively as Donald Trump won in 2016. Betras says working class people in Mahoning felt Democrats, the \u201cparty of the people,\u201d had left them. And, they channeled their frustrations into electoral victories last year for Donald Trump that were decisive in what some described as an earthquake of an election.\u000a\u000aOthers with insights into Trump's historic vanquishing include conservative culture columnist and author, David Brooks ( The Road to Character , 2016); political historian and author, Thomas Frank ( Listen, Liberal: Or, What Every Happened to the Party of the People? , 2017); journalist and author George Packer ( The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America , 2014); Trump ghost writer Tony Schwartz ( Trump: The Art of the Deal , 1989), and statistician and author Nate Silver ( The Signal and the Noise , 2012)\u000a\u000aWHY TRUMP WON will encore Friday, Aug. 11 at 10:00pm Eastern on CNN/U.S.. In addition to the telecasts, WHY TRUMP WON will also stream live for subscribers via CNNgo (at www.CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV, and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android. Beginning Tuesday, Aug. 8, this Fareed Zakaria CNN Special Report will also be available on demand via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms, and CNN mobile apps.\u000a\u000a*****\u000a\u000aAbout CNN\u000a\u000aCNN Worldwide is the most honored brand in cable news, reaching more individuals on television, the web and mobile devices than any other cable news organization in the United States.

aVOver the intervening 20 years, he's set records on the course and off it with his prodigious talent and immense marketability.\u000a\u000aHe might not have played competitively since August 2015 after undergoing multiple back surgeries , but the former world No.1 -- now ranked 898th -- is finally set to return this week at the Hero World Challenge, a $3.5 million invitational event hosted by his own foundation.\u000a\u000aWoods had previously planned to return to action at the October 13-16 Safeway Open, but withdrew from the PGA Tour season-opener after deciding he was "not yet ready to play."\u000a\u000aAnd, while the 14-time major winner hasn't been out of the game entirely, taking on the role of US vice-captain at Hazeltine for September's victorious Ryder Cup campaign , 17 months of injury turmoil will finally come to an end when he tees off in the Bahamas this Thursday.\u000a\u000aWoods may never reach his previous heights again; aged 40, he's cast doubt on his lifelong quest to break Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major titles.\u000a\u000aBut, given the Golden Bear won his 16th, 17th and 18th majors after his 40th birthday, a revitalized Tiger certainly has plenty to play for.\u000a\u000aAs he prepares to put troubled times behind him, CNN reporters recall the times they met one of history's most fascinating sportsmen.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1997, Atlantic City - Gary Tuchman\u000a\u000aWoods' first major triumph came at Augusta in 1997 when he became the youngest Masters champion in history and its first non-white winner.

When CNN asked me if I would like to meet Tiger and interview him, I jumped at the opportunity. I believed he would likely become the best golfer to ever play the game.\u000a\u000a"People were very excited to meet him. There was a buzz on the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey where this all took place. People knew he was a young man who was likely to make history.\u000a\u000a"Woods was polite, thoughtful, and considerate. I remember thinking to myself that I hoped he would always stay that way because I was so certain he would be immensely successful and so many people who become rich and famous don't keep the values they had when it all began.\u000a\u000a"Tiger clearly knew what he was capable of at a young age. And I also had little doubt about his capabilities. It is amazing now to look back and know that what he, I, and so many others thought would happen did indeed happen.\u000a\u000aGary Tuchman joined CNN back in 1990.\u000a\u000a"The difference of course is that he was relatively innocent and naive back then. Now, he has the physical and emotional scars that one often gets as the years go by.\u000a\u000a"With the benefit of hindsight, I would ask him if he was concerned about the pressures of being on the PGA Tour and his personal life off the tour. I would ask him if he felt he had the support to deal with all of that.\u000a\u000a"And then I wish I said to him that I hope he has a happy and healthy career. I try to be polite when I interview people and I don't think I got the chance to say that to him as he began his path to fame and fortune."\u000a\u000a2008, Dubai - Don Riddell\u000a\u000aFast forward 11 years and Woods was living up to the hype. Aged 32, he was ranked as the world's No. 1 golfer having won a further 12 majors -- including four in a row between June 2000 and April 2001. But away from the course, it had been a turbulent couple of years. His father Earl passed away in 2006, the sadness of which was somewhat offset by the birth of Woods' first daughter Sam in June 2007. Both events were discussed when Woods sat down with CNN World Sport's Don Riddell in 2008 ...\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Tiger Woods opens up on becoming a father in 2008 Replay More Videos ...

I think he was genuinely excited to be a Dad and absolutely devastated when his father passed away.\u000a\u000a"I'll always remember his reaction when I told him I had twin boys in 2006 'Twins?,' he exclaimed, 'Holy s**t!'\u000a\u000a"I guess my reaction was similar when he hit the fire hydrant in 2009 and everything fell apart; turns out I'd been getting an overly varnished account of his marital bliss.\u000a\u000a"He once told me that he didn't want to be remembered for his achievements as a golfer, more for his 'actions as a human being.'\u000a\u000a"Hopefully I'll get to see him again one day. If so, I'd ask what has been the single biggest regret of his life. Whether it's personal or professional, I think that would be very revealing."\u000a\u000a2012, China - Shane O'Donoghue\u000a\u000aBy 2012, Woods' life had unraveled in spectacular fashion. A minor car crash in November 2009 began a chain of events which led to the revealing of multiple infidelities and, ultimately, the break-up of Woods' marriage to Elin Nordegren. His golf game had suffered too. He won the U.S. Open in 2008 but a severe loss of form and fitness meant he'd failed to win a major in over three years by the time he sat down with CNN Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue in November 2012. And he wasn't alone. A new generation of golfers, who'd grown up idolizing Woods, were now overtaking their hero at the top of the game.

A long way to go, but it was an opportunity to host the first ever sit-down interview with Tiger and Rory McIlroy. Rory had yet to be announced as a Nike player, but the rumors had begun of a multimillion dollar deal. I remember noting that he wore Nike trainers to the interview.\u000a\u000a"That was revealing, but we couldn't really speak about it, as he was still under contract to his other clothing sponsors. Rory and Tiger had both decided not to compete in the WGC event later that week in Shanghai, which caused a bit of a fuss.\u000a\u000a"They were here in Zhengzhou for a big money match and we were the only television interview that they were doing, so it was a real exclusive.

We were off to a good start and then Rory turned up, also in good form. The two had a very natural friendship and it certainly wasn't forced. They were laughing and joking.

However, it was very noticeable how Tiger changed the minute the red light went on and we began recording the interview. It wasn't bad or anything, just a very noticeable change in his demeanor as soon as we started. He doesn't really like interviews.\u000a\u000a"He was lighthearted again once we finished and wished me a safe trip home. I hope to interview Tiger many more times in the future!\u000a\u000a"I expect him to return to top class golf, and to win again. We have seen the best of him, but there are still a few more chapters left in his extraordinary story, so I hope to be in a position to bring those stories to the CNN audience."

aVJohn Mathews is Professor of Strategic Management, Macquarie Graduate School of Management in Sydney, Australia.The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation .\u000a\u000a(CNN) The aviation industry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2011, aviation contributed around 3% of Australia's emissions. Despite improvements in efficiency, global aviation emissions are expected to grow 70% by 2020 from 2005 . While the industry is seeking new renewable fuel sources, growing biofuels takes up valuable land and water that could be otherwise used to grow food.\u000a\u000aBut what if you could grow biofuels on land nobody wants, using just seawater and sunlight, and produce food at the same time?\u000a\u000aThat's just what a new project in Abu Dhabi is seeking to do. The Integrated Seawater Energy and Agriculture System , or ISEAS, will grow sustainable food and aviation fuel in the desert, using seawater and sunshine, in a way that is eminently transferable to similar arid regions around the world.\u000a\u000aThe project was announced in January 2015 and is now under construction.\u000a\u000aSo, how does the project solve the biggest environmental problems?\u000a\u000aA triple dilemma\u000a\u000aEnergy, water and food problems frequently compound each other, each making the others more difficult to resolve.\u000a\u000aExamples abound. Think of wasteful irrigation coming up against water limits and threatening reductions in food production. But there are some projects that turn the issue around and bring water, energy and food issues into positive relations, each strengthening the others.\u000a\u000aThe Integrated Seawater Energy and Agriculture System in Abu Dhabi, the UAE.\u000a\u000aOne example of this is the Sundrop Farms project in South Australia, on which I previously wrote on The Conversation , where abundant sunshine and seawater are used to produce electric power and fresh water to cultivate greenhouse crops like tomatoes.\u000a\u000aThe Sundrop Farms project is moving ahead, and has won substantial financial support from the global venture capital firm KKR in addition to its earlier support from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, as well as a contract to supply fresh produce to supermarket chain Coles over the next ten years.\u000a\u000aThe Abu Dhabi project is even more ambitious and is called "seawater farming". It involves the use of salt-tolerant plants like mangroves and the oil-rich Salicornia as well as aquaculture of seafood such as shrimps and fish.\u000a\u000aSea tolerant plants like mangroves will feature in the Abu Dhabi project.\u000a\u000aThe project was developed through the Sustainable Bioenergy Research Consortium in Abu Dhabi. It involves as partners the airline Etihad Airways, the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology (from the UAE), as well as corporate giants Boeing, General Electric and UOP Honeywell. These corporations provide the funding and a potentially (vast) market.\u000a\u000aThe idea is to rapidly scale up various options for securing the biomass and complementing it with associated activities to generate a closed loop operation.\u000a\u000aHow does it work?\u000a\u000aThe Integrated Seawater Energy and Agriculture System in Abu Dhabi, the UAE.\u000a\u000aFirst, seawater is used in aquaculture ponds, where (2) fish and/or shrimp varieties can be grown (= food). Then (3) the waste water from the aquaculture, which is rich in organic nutrients, is used to irrigate a salt-tolerant crop of Salicornia.\u000a\u000aThis crop is harvested (4) and the oil extracted from the seeds (= aviation biofuel). Water is then drained from the salt-tolerant crops (5) and fed into a mangrove wetland, where it is naturally purified and carbon can be sequestered (6).\u000a\u000aOutside this sequence there is solar energy input to drive the crop production and energy production needed for pumping.\u000a\u000aSolving complex problems\u000a\u000aThe project solves the problem of waste disposal with fish farming (aquaculture) by channeling the organic wastes as irrigation to act as fertilizer for the cultivation of the Salicornia plants. The Salicornia plants themselves (known as halophytes, or salt-resistant species) need only the seawater and grow on arid land.\u000a\u000aThe project eliminates the problem with most biofuels: that they are perceived as taking away water and arable land that could be used for food production. Instead, the Abu Dhabi project produces fuel and food and recycles everything.\u000a\u000aThe Integrated Seawater Energy and Agriculture System in Abu Dhabi, the UAE.\u000a\u000aThe current pilot farm is entirely closed-loop, with the seawater drawn originally from the ocean passing through the various stages and finally fed to mangrove plantations.\u000a\u000aThe water is filtered through the mangroves, extracting the final nutrients, and the water can either be fed back to the ocean or recycled to the fish farms. All energy used (such as for pumping the water) is generated with a solar array -- so there is no fossil fuel input at all.\u000a\u000aThe project is achieving remarkable success because it is backed financially by large players -- Etihad itself as the principal airline, the Masdar Institute of S&T, and corporate giants like Boeing.\u000a\u000aThe project will scale up quickly. The pilot project is a plant covering 2 hectares, but in three years it is expected to grow to a 200 ha demonstration scale involving around 140 ha for the Salicornia cultivation, 30 ha for the aquaculture and 20 ha or more for the mangrove plantation.\u000a\u000aCould Australia do the same?\u000a\u000aAustralia is a country with vast arid areas, copious quantities of seawater and sunshine -- all the ingredients needed for a similar solar biofuel and food project.\u000a\u000aIt has a national air carrier in Qantas that has already experimented with various kinds of aviation biofuels . It has a national R&D organization in CSIRO that could organize such a project.\u000a\u000aThe Integrated Seawater Energy and Agriculture System project in Abu Dhabi, the UAE.\u000a\u000aAustralia has long experience in development of agricultural models that can cope with high salinity levels.

aVRepublicans are trying to diminish the Congressional Budget Office's importance even before it issues its review of their Obamacare repeal bill.\u000a\u000aLawmakers are calling out that the agency repeatedly overestimated how many people would gain coverage on the Obamacare exchanges. Republicans want to downplay the score of their bill, which is expected to show that millions could wind up uninsured.\u000a\u000aThe CBO's report is expected Monday.\u000a\u000aRelated: GOP tries to discredit agency reviewing its health care bill\u000a\u000aIt's true that CBO thought more people would flock to the Obamacare exchanges.\u000a\u000aWhen the law originally passed in 2010, it estimated 21 million would gain coverage through them in 2016. Three years later, just before the exchanges opened, the agency upped the figure to 22 million.\u000a\u000aThat didn't happen. About 10.4 million were actually enrolled last year, according to the Department of Health & Human Services data.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, the exchanges did not turn out to be as vibrant as expected. But their enrollment was also dampened because fewer employers stopped offering coverage than the CBO originally thought, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. This would have sent more people looking for policies on the exchanges.\u000a\u000aAnd, more Americans turned out to be eligible for Medicaid, further reducing the number of folks buying policies on the exchanges.\u000a\u000aHowever, the agency was much closer to the mark on Obamacare's overall impact on coverage. In its original 2010 estimate, CBO thought the insured rate for non-elderly adults would rise to 92% in 2016. It tempered that view somewhat in 2013, after the Supreme Court ruled that expanding Medicaid was optional for states. The revised forecast was that 89% would have coverage in 2016.\u000a\u000aIt turns out that 89.7% of Americans under age 65 had insurance last year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. That's up from 83.4% in 2013, before the exchanges opened and Medicaid expansion officially began. (A few states launched the program earlier.)\u000a\u000aRelated: Millions could lose insurance under GOP Obamacare repeal bill, S&P reports\u000a\u000a"Where people get coverage matters, but what's most important is that they are covered at all," said Matt Fiedler, a Brookings Institution fellow who served as chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration.\u000a\u000aBecause there are fewer people on the exchanges, CBO overestimated how much the law's coverage provisions would cost overall. Originally, it expected the net cost would be $132 billion in 2016. However, it lowered that estimate to $110 billion in the estimate it released last year.\u000a\u000aThe agency's review of the Republican bill's impact on coverage is expected to be ugly. But it's impossible to expect the CBO to hit the number exactly, Goldwein said. Its projection is in the center of a range of potential outcomes.\u000a\u000aMostly importantly, the agency has a long history of credibility and neutrality, he said.\u000a\u000a"It's not novel to beat up on the refs," Goldwein said. "We can feel confident that whatever they put forward will represent their best, unbiased estimate."

aV(CNN) The Democratic Party has reacted to its series of recent election losses by once again concluding that it needs a better economic message. As Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Sunday, "Democrats need a strong, bold, sharp-edged and common-sense economic agenda." The only disagreement within the party is about how sharp-edged and left-wing that agenda should be. But it is increasingly clear that the problem for Democrats has little to do with economics and much more to do with a cluster of issues they would rather not revisit \u2014 about culture, social mores and national identity.

aVElaine Yu, CNN \u2022 Updated 16th September 2016\u000a\u000aNanjing, China (CNN) \u2014 More than 150 years after rebels destroyed it, Nanjing's famed "Porcelain Tower" -- one of the Seven Medieval Wonders of the World -- has been brought back to life.\u000a\u000aSort of.\u000a\u000aA modern, steel reconstruction of the pagoda now sits by the Yangtze River in the same area as the original, which was built in the early 15th century.\u000a\u000aThe new tower, reportedly funded by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, is surrounded by a futuristic, Buddhist-themed museum that opened late last year.\u000a\u000aThe sites are collectively known as the Porcelain Tower Heritage Park.\u000a\u000aDuring a recent visit to the museum we found relics from the sixth century and earth-colored ruins standing next to modern palatial designs -- including a giant floating 3-D Buddha head made of tiny dots of light.\u000a\u000aThese visual effects are amplified by background music fit for a "Lord of the Rings" soundtrack.\u000a\u000aThe reconstructed pagoda stands near the City Wall's Gate of China.\u000a\u000aWhat led to the reconstruction?\u000a\u000aDespite a centuries-spanning history, the Porcelain Tower's ruins weren't open to excavation until 2007.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, archeologists unearthed a number of holy and treasured relics, including a reliquary in which the remains of the Buddha (Shakyamuni) are believed to be enshrined.\u000a\u000aThey were discovered in an area now called the "millennium-old underground palace," which the rebuilt tower serves to protect.\u000a\u000aA couple of years later the cash started rolling in.\u000a\u000aWang Jianlin -- who made his fortune as chairman of China's largest property developer Dalian Wanda Group -- decided to fund the Porcelain Tower Heritage Park project, according to a report in the official People's Daily.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, he reportedly donated 1 billion yuan (about US$150 million) to the municipal government in his name to fund the reconstruction.\u000a\u000aThat gives the Porcelain Tower another landmark claim: The single largest personal donation in Chinese history.\u000a\u000aNew addition to the historic quarter\u000a\u000aIn 1412, during the Ming Dynasty, the Yongle Emperor ordered the tower's construction in the ancient capital of Nanjing. It took 17 years to complete.\u000a\u000aPart of the larger Bao'en temple complex, which means "Temple of Gratitude" in Chinese -- the tower was built with glazed, white porcelain bricks and rose 78 meters from an octagonal foundation.\u000a\u000aIt's said that rebels destroyed the tower during the Taiping Rebellion in the 19th century as they took over the city.\u000a\u000aA model of the Bao'en Temple complex during the 15th century Ming dynasty.\u000a\u000aThe new tower was built with steel beams and offers great views of the city.\u000a\u000aLike the original, the pagoda has nine stories, each of which serve as viewing platforms accessible by an inner staircase or an elevator.\u000a\u000aFrom these vantage points, the city's many layers of history are visible.\u000a\u000aThe City Wall , a circular fortification and defensive complex built in the Ming dynasty, can be seen snaking through the city alongside neighborhoods with Republican-era housing and modern skyscrapers.\u000a\u000aThe Qinhuai and Yangtze Rivers, which have long nurtured Nanjing's trade and culture, can also be viewed.\u000a\u000aThe temple area is located near the Gate of China, which served as the former capital's southern gate and grand entrance of the City Wall.\u000a\u000aThe exhibition deploys highly visual renderings of Buddhist themes.\u000a\u000aModern technology used to rebuild medieval wonder\u000a\u000aThe Porcelain Tower Heritage Park might be steeped in history but the visitor experience is anything but dated.\u000a\u000aVisitors can use their smartphones to scan the QR codes scattered throughout the park for more information (in Chinese).\u000a\u000aA room encased in mirrored walls and thousands of light bulbs with ever-changing colors is supposed to represent the Buddhist concept of light and "sarira" (shelizi in Chinese) -- referring to the bodily relics of Buddhist spiritual masters.\u000a\u000aIf it weren't for the decorative Buddha statues, visitors might think they've walked onto an empty, 90s-inspired dance floor.\u000a\u000aThese highly visual renderings of the site's sacred elements can be found throughout the museum.\u000a\u000aWhile ruins have been carefully preserved in their original locations, they're often layered with grand interior designs and enhancements like animated illustrations projected onto wall art.

aVThe torture survivors suing the Syrian regime\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, Germany\u2019s federal prosecutor heard witness testimony in a landmark case filed by the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), which accuses six high-ranking Syrian officials close to President Bashar al-Assad of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u000a\u000aThe complaint was submitted by several Syrian ex-detainees, including two Syrian lawyers, who say they were victims of torture in the regime\u2019s cells. While similar legal action has been taken elsewhere in Europe, this case is unique in that it was launched under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows prosecutors and courts to pursue international crimes even in the absence of links to Germany.\u000a\u000aIn February, Assad denied claims of torture in Syrian prisons, saying in an interview that the allegations had \u201cnot a shred of evidence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe accounts detail brutal beatings, sexual violence and systematic torture in three Damascus prisons -- branches 215, 227 and 235 -- between October 2011 and July 2015.

aVTokyo, Japan (CNN) There's something distinctly punk about Katsuya Kamo's aesthetic. His otherworldly headpieces, designed for some of the world's most revered fashion houses, seem to disregard the limits of millinery, often combine hair with unusual materials.\u000a\u000a"Feathers, paper, butterflies, animals, everything," the Japanese hairstylist and makeup artist said in his Tokyo studio, gesturing to the examples surrounding him, including outtakes from his latest collection for designer Jun Takahashi's Undercover label.\u000a\u000aOn the runway, the butterfly-inspired Undercover designs -- each of which took a day to produce -- fluttered about the models' heads, making them appear half human, half insect.\u000a\u000aBut Kamo isn't just looking to shock; his is a quest to create pure beauty.\u000a\u000a"If it's not that, then the end form cannot be complete."\u000a\u000aA Katsuya Kamo headpiece for designer Junya Watanabe.\u000a\u000aThree decades of innovation\u000a\u000aSince 1996, Kamo has collaborated with Japanese designers Takahashi and Junya Watanabe on hair and makeup for their collections. His international breakthrough came in 2007, with his attention-grabbing looks for Watanabe's Autumn-Winter 2008 show. Wrapping models' heads entirely in cloth, Kamo transformed them into bulbous sculptures.\u000a\u000aThe show caught the attention of Stephen Gan, creative director of Harper's Bazaar's, who hired Kamo to style hair for a shoot with Karl Lagerfeld. Soon after, Lagerfeld booked Kamo for Chanel's pre-fall 2009 collection "Paris-Moscou," for which he crafted 50 braided hair crowns interwoven with pearls and metal accoutrements.\u000a\u000aMore collaborations with Chanel followed, including a series of flower headpieces crafted from paper for the brand's Spring-Summer 2009 couture show.\u000a\u000aA model wearing Katsuya Kamo's headpiece for Chanel during a Spring-Summer 2009 Haute Couture collection.\u000a\u000aSince then, Kamo's reputation has blossomed. Designers and stylists, from Haider Ackerman to Carine Roitfeld, have commissioned him for works.\u000a\u000aFinding inspiration in the mundane\u000a\u000aA Katsuya Kamo headpiece for 7000 magazine.\u000a\u000aLike a mad scientist, 51-year-old Kamo spends nearly every day experimenting, toiling away in his lab with materials ranging from familiar (safety pins) to the decadent (stuffed birds and exotic silks).\u000a\u000aThree decades' worth of work has been meticulously recorded in notebooks brimming with Polaroids, material scraps and sketches, but Kamo's biggest inspirations are found in the present, not the past.\u000a\u000a"I'm always picking up something from the street," he explained. "Not books, not movies. Just from the street."\u000a\u000aHow remarkable the world must look through Kamo's eyes.

Investors from Hong Kong -- and beyond -- rushed across the border to build factories and other businesses.\u000a\u000aPhotos: These spiraling skyscrapers are some of the world's most eye-catching buildings Twisting tall towers of the globe \u2013 The Council of Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has released a comprehensive list of the world's twisting tall buildings that are either completed or under construction.

At 556 meters (1,824 feet) tall, the building was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates Hide Caption 31 of 31\u000a\u000aFrom the beginning, urban planners decided that it would be a city of skyscrapers. Shenzhen's growing skyline is simply part of its DNA, according to University of Hong Kong architecture professor Juan Du, whose book, "The Making of Shenzhen: A Thousand Years in China's Instant City," will be published next year.\u000a\u000a"In Shenzhen, (skyscrapers are) really linked to the image of the city," she said over the phone. "Between the early 1980s and the early 90s, it had more tall buildings than any Chinese city.\u000a\u000a"The term 'Shenzhen speed' was coined from the (time of) the construction of the city's earliest skyscrapers. When Deng Xiaoping made his first visit to Shenzhen, he was really excited by the speed at which tall buildings were being built."\u000a\u000aToday, Shenzhen has evolved beyond its manufacturing roots to become a hub for service industries -- especially technology and design. Often described as "China's Silicon Valley," the city is home to huge companies like Tencent (which itself built two skyscrapers) and a network of thousands of smaller firms.\u000a\u000aBut Shenzhen's geography plays a part, too: the city center is located in a narrow strip between mountains and the Hong Kong border. A growing network of subway lines and a new high-speed rail connection to Hong Kong have made this strip even more desirable, pushing development up rather than out.\u000a\u000aCities in slowdown\u000a\u000aShenzhen appears to be showing no signs of slowing. In addition to a current crop of 49 buildings taller than 200 meters, a further 48 skyscrapers are under construction, according to CTBUH data.\u000a\u000aBut as Shenzhen grows skywards, empty office space in other big cities has led market analysts to speculate that China is caught in a spiral of overbuilding. The office vacancy rate in Beijing, which stood at 8% at the end of 2016, is forecast to rise to 13% by the end of 2019, according to a report by property firm Colliers International. The report noted that "the growing office supply will still outstrip the growth in demand."\u000a\u000aIn Shanghai, the country's tallest building, the 632-meter Shanghai Tower, has sat largely empty since opening in 2015, with one of the project's lead developers, Gu Jianping, admitting at an awards ceremony last year that "the biggest challenge facing China is how to build fewer skyscrapers."\u000a\u000aAcross China, the race upwards has produced outsized landmarks (like Nanjing's Zifeng Tower which is nearly twice the height of the city's next-tallest building) in areas where there was not enough demand to justify construction. Entire new cities were built in places like Ordos, a dusty outpost in the Gobi Desert, which then sat empty for years. Tianjin built no fewer than three central business districts filled with skyscrapers -- including one unashamedly modeled on Manhattan.\u000a\u000aSome media reports have pointed to the so-called "Skyscraper Index," an idea first proposed by economist Andrew Lawrence in 1999, which suggests that a surge of investment in skyscrapers is a harbinger of recession.\u000a\u000aBucking the trend\u000a\u000aBut rather than signaling a downturn, Shenzhen's spate of new skyscrapers may simply reflect its booming economy. With the highest per capita GDP of any major city in China, Shenzhen is also experiencing soaring land prices.\u000a\u000aLast year, the city's property market was named the mainland's most expensive, with homes selling for an average of $6,500 per square meter, according to SouFun , which tracks house prices in 100 Chinese cities. There has been a similar trend in the office market, according to David Ji, the head of research for Greater China at property consultancy Knight Frank.\u000a\u000a"Shenzhen has a lot of demand for Grade A office space, unlike some other mainland cities that just go for height to compete with each other," he said over the phone.\u000a\u000aAnd aside from the 600-meter Ping An Financial Centre, which became the world's fourth tallest building when it opened last year, Ji said that "buildings built in Shenzhen tend not to be that tall relative to Shanghai or other cities."\u000a\u000aIn other words, Shenzhen may be building plenty of skyscrapers, but most of them aren't showstoppers.\u000a\u000aRather than tolerating vanity projects, urban planners encourage projects that fit in with the surrounding city, according to Hong Kong-based architect Stefan Krummeck. His firm, TFP Farrells, designed KK100, a 442-meter tower that is currently the second tallest in Shenzhen. Rather than an isolated landmark, the skyscraper is part of a former village that was redeveloped in conjunction with KK100.\u000a\u000a"There's always a bit of an ego trip involved in super high-rises, but in Shenzhen it's more sustainable -- the towers are reasonably modest," he said over the phone. "There are only a few super-high-rise towers and they're pretty well integrated into the urban fabric.\u000a\u000a"To the best of my knowledge, the towers are full and the streets are lively. It works quite well."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) What the American public craves is authenticity: a sense that the men and women we elect are, like us, flesh-and-blood creatures who celebrate and grieve, who dance and despair. But it's rare to see politician reveal his or her vulnerability before a mass television audience.\u000a\u000aAnd that is why Vice President Joe Biden's appearance on "The Late Show" with Stephen Colbert on Thursday night was so uncommonly moving. In the face of Biden's offhand honesty, passion and wrenching humanity as he discussed his beloved son Beau's death from brain cancer earlier this summer, it is almost embarrassing to acknowledge that it made for "good television."\u000a\u000aIt was life happening before our eyes, the kind of life we find in our own living rooms and kitchens.\u000a\u000aReal conversation about the human experience is something we don't expect on late night -- from arch hosts, and particularly from politicians, who often seem like pieces of Styrofoam.\u000a\u000aThe Biden appearance slapped the nation awake, reminding us that we've become almost numb as we listen to the excuses, the prevarications, the bragging, the naked vanity that seems to dominate both major parties in this election season.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Funnyman Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert talks with George Clooney during the premiere episode of "The Late Show," which he took over on Tuesday, September 8.

His face was extremely mobile, with a range of emotion flickering as he dipped his eyes to the floor and seemed to wince. A vast audience saw the obvious truth: Here is father grieving for beloved son, Beau, who died of brain cancer only a few months ago. The rawness of his feelings were vividly on display.\u000a\u000aBiden was frank, saying: "I don't think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, number two, they can look at folks out there and say, 'I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this." One could hear a pin drop in the audience, which held its breath.

And it's clear that even Joe doesn't think he can manage it in the wake of his son's death.\u000a\u000aIt's easy to say why so many like Joe Biden a great deal. I'm among them. He's a compassionate human being, and he's real.\u000a\u000aBorn in 1942, he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- the lunch-pail capital of the western world, in my view. I grew up only a mile or so from Biden, whose father scraped to find work during some hard economic times in this era, when anthracite mining had died out and left many in northeastern Pennsylvania without other options for making a living. My mother, who died at 97 only last year, was a friend of Biden's aunt and mother, and she recalled that they moved to Delaware in search of better work.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Biden unsure if he's 'there' for a run Replay More Videos ...

aV(CNN) The first time Shaesta Waiz remembers seeing a plane, she was a child watching the news about an aircraft accident.\u000a\u000a"I said to my mom, 'I hope I never ever have to fly in an airplane,'" she said. "I was so scared and terrified."\u000a\u000aNow Waiz is a certified pilot in the middle of a solo flight around the world. By the time the 30-year-old completes her journey in September in Daytona Beach, Florida, she plans to have made more than two dozen stops in some 18 countries.\u000a\u000aShe also hopes her trip will "inspire girls and young women worldwide to dream big and achieve more," especially in the fields of science, math, engineering and aviation.\u000a\u000aHer flight, in a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza A36, will take Waiz more than 25,000 miles. But it pales compared to her personal journey, which began three decades ago in a refugee camp in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aStruggling with dreams\u000a\u000aSoon after Waiz was born in the refugee camp, her family came to the United States in 1987 to escape the Afghan-Soviet War.\u000a\u000aOne of six girls, she grew up in Richmond, California. As a child, becoming a pilot was not anything she thought about.\u000a\u000a"I struggled (as a girl) with dreams, and I thought ... a woman like me, the best thing to do is have kids ... so they might do something grand," Waiz said via Skype from a stop in Sri Lanka.\u000a\u000aWaiz in her plane at Cairo International Airport on July 2.\u000a\u000aHer only female role models were the women in her extended family. "They were all housewives, and that's all I aspired to be."\u000a\u000aAs a child she didn't live near an airport, and nobody in her family flew.\u000a\u000a"We weren't wealthy enough to fly in an airplane," she said. "It was something out of reach, something very scary."\u000a\u000aThe first time Waiz remembers being on a plane, she was a teenager going from California to Florida. She remembers buckling her seat belt and praying.\u000a\u000a"I thought this airplane was going to launch into the sky like a rocket ... like a roller-coaster," she said. But when the plane took off, "it was so romantic."\u000a\u000a'What Afghan man would want to marry a woman who flies?'\u000a\u000aIn the years that followed, Waiz started plotting her dreams. She went from a community college to an aeronautical university.\u000a\u000aShe also began to navigate cultural resistance from members of her family.\u000a\u000aHer uncle told her women did not belong in the cockpit. Her grandmother asked her, "what Afghan man would want to marry a woman who flies?"\u000a\u000aGrowing up, Waiz always straddled two cultures. She attended American schools, but spoke Farsi and Pashto at home. She was training to become a pilot, but her family still enforced a curfew.\u000a\u000a"Growing up in the United States, I never felt like I was American ... my parents reminded me that I was Afghan, I was not American," she said. "But sometimes, when I would speak to my cousins in Afghanistan, they thought I was American. There was confusion of where I belonged."\u000a\u000aFlying changed that.\u000a\u000a"When I was in an airplane, all of that (confusion) disappeared," said Waiz, who now lives in Daytona Beach. "The plane does not care. The plane responds based on the skill of the pilot. In the air, I can be whoever I am."\u000a\u000aReturn to Afghanistan\u000a\u000aWaiz's route so far has taken her to Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\u000a\u000aShe also made a three-day stopover in Kabul last month. It was the first time she'd returned to Afghanistan since she left as a baby.\u000a\u000aWhile there Waiz met with the president and the prime minister of the country, connected with her extended family and began to dream up what she wants to do next.\u000a\u000a"I had the chance to meet a lot of my cousins, a lot of young girls," she said. "What I noticed is that these girls are so ambitious, and they're so hungry to do something."\u000a\u000aWaiz met with students during her stopover in Kabul on July 12.\u000a\u000aShe also noticed that the ambition of these young Afghan women came with limitations: They had to be accompanied by their fathers to be able to move around the city.\u000a\u000aWaiz is funding her trip though sponsors and a nonprofit, Dreams Soar , that she founded to inspire future generations of female pilots and women in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math). As she notes on her website, only a small percentage of the world's pilots are women.\u000a\u000aHer family is now supportive of her passion. And after her trip to Kabul, she's dreaming of starting a STEM school for girls in Afghanistan "so that young girls can go somewhere and use their talents."\u000a\u000aFor Waiz, the world has opened up since she was a scared teenager buckling up for her first flight.\u000a\u000a"I used to read in geography books about countries like Sri Lanka and India and Greece and Italy. To me they were just names in a book," she said. "And when I sat in that plane and that plane took off, (I thought) maybe one day those names could be memories."

aVA company associated with President Trump is seeking new trademarks for the casino industry in Asia's biggest gambling hub.\u000a\u000aA firm called DTTM Operations LLC has applied for four new trademarks under the Trump brand in Macau, according to documents published by the government of the Chinese territory last week.\u000a\u000aThe company, which lists the Trump Tower at 725 Fifth Avenue in New York City as its address, submitted the applications two months ago, the documents revealed.\u000a\u000aThe applications were first reported by the South China Morning Post.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump's newest Chinese trademarks: Religious clothing, advertising\u000a\u000aThe trademarks are for a wide range of Trump-branded services. One application lists hotels, restaurants, bars and conference facilities, while two others list "real estate services" and "real estate development and construction."\u000a\u000aA fourth application requests a Trump trademark for "gambling and casino services and providing casino facilities."\u000a\u000aThe Macau government lists 22 other trademarks registered by DTTM Operations for various brands dating back to 2006, including Trump Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower and the Donald J. Trump brand.\u000a\u000aRelated: Macau billionaire found guilty of bribing UN officials\u000a\u000aTrump relinquished control of his businesses soon after he became president but hasn't sold his stake, instead transferring it to a trust run by his two sons -- a decision that has been criticized by ethics experts as inadequate in addressing perceived conflicts of interest.\u000a\u000aTrump's company, the Trump Organization, said in a statement to CNNMoney that it "has been zealously enforcing and protecting its intellectual property rights around the world for more than 20 years, particularly in jurisdictions where trademark infringement is rampant."\u000a\u000aThe trademark applications in Macau "simply represent a continuation of those efforts," it said.\u000a\u000aThe company hasn't announced any plans to do business in Macau, and Trump said before he took office that his firm wouldn't do any "new deals" while he's in office.\u000a\u000aThe Macau government didn't respond to a request for comment Monday.\u000a\u000aThe semi-autonomous Chinese territory has become one of the world's top gambling destinations. Prominent U.S. casino magnates like Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson already own several casinos there.\u000a\u000aRelated: China jails top casino exec over gambling crimes\u000a\u000aTrump is a former gambling tycoon himself, having built three casinos in New Jersey's Atlantic City in the 80s and 90s. Two of them -- Trump Plaza and Trump Taj Mahal -- have now been shut down, while the erstwhile Trump Marina Hotel Casino was sold in 2011 and rebranded as the Golden Nugget.\u000a\u000aBut none of the casinos contributing to Macau's multi-billion dollar gambling industry, which accounts for more than half of the territory's economy, currently bear the Trump name.\u000a\u000a-- Jill Disis, Vasco Cotovio and Serenitie Wang contributed to this report

aVAlbert Stumm, CNN \u2022 Published 26th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Uniform rows of identical white headstones fill the green space in the small yards of mosques and churches throughout Sarajevo, each one bearing a date that seems too recent for a European war.\u000a\u000aOnly a few blocks outside the city center, some buildings are still pockmarked with bullet holes.\u000a\u000aReminders of the war that dissolved Yugoslavia are everywhere, but the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina is due for a fresh look as signs of a vibrant future begin to outshine those of the nearly four-year siege that devastated Sarajevo during the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aNew hotels add a measure of comfort to what has mostly been a backpacker destination, and five airlines announced new services to the city in the last year, including Qatar Airways and the budget carrier Wizz Air.\u000a\u000aNow the enigmatic city exudes a modern cool in numerous ways, such as a sculpture garden skate park in the restored Austro-Hungarian quarter and margaritas served in the preserved Ottoman bazaar within earshot of the Muslim call to prayer.\u000a\u000aTimothy Clancy, an American who came to Bosnia as a volunteer in 1992 and never left, said he's spent most of his adult life shining a positive light on a place that most travelers think of as a war-torn wasteland.\u000a\u000a"One advantage is, people have low or no expectations," he says. "And Sarajevo drastically exceeds them every time."\u000a\u000aHere are 11 things to do there:\u000a\u000a1. See the Ottoman bazaar\u000a\u000aThe Ottoman bazaar boasts the majority of the historical sights in town, such as the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque.\u000a\u000aThe heart of Sarajevo, which was founded by the Ottomans in the 15th century, still lies in the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija, a tight quarter of one-story market stalls that date to the city's earliest years.\u000a\u000aThe market runs through a few car-free streets along the Miljacka River, leading up the wooden Sebilj fountain in a square teeming with pigeons.\u000a\u000aThroughout the bazaar, exotic aromas of spice markets float among those of sizzling meats, sometimes a whole lamb spit-roasted in full view of passersby. Grizzled men in other stalls use metal tongs to pull searing copper from a fire and then hammer it into intricately designed plates, trays and goblets.\u000a\u000aSome vendors veer closer to kitsch, selling cheap souvenirs and pens made from the shell casings of high-caliber rifles. Others stick with classics such as gooey Turkish delights, their gelatinous cubes redolent of fruit flavors and dusted in flour or coconut.\u000a\u000aThe area also has the majority of the historical sights in town, such as the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and its lunar clock tower. The Hotel President, which opened in 2015 at the edge of the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija, makes a good home base within sniffing distance of the action.\u000a\u000aHotel President , +387 33 575-000, Bazard\u017eani 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a2. Savor a cultural pick-me-up\u000a\u000aYounger Sarajevans enjoy meeting at hookah bars.\u000a\u000aThere are dozens of places for an espresso or cappuccino in the old town, but it's worth searching out Bosnian coffee.\u000a\u000aThick, rich and strong as jet fuel, the local version is such a part of the culture that it's the drink of choice for everyone from courting couples to businessmen closing a deal. Visitors to a Bosnian's house will have coffee served whether they like or not.\u000a\u000aThe coffee grounds are boiled with water in a long-handled copper pot on top of the stove, which most people associate with Turkish coffee. But the beans are generally roasted in Bosnia for a brew that's even more potent.\u000a\u000a"It's 10 times better," Clancy says. "Turks are great at tea but not so much at coffee."\u000a\u000aIn the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija, the Male Daire hookah bar, which is another activity enjoyed by younger Sarajevans, is a laid-back place to perk up and meet some friends. Or for a great people-watching corner, there's the sidewalk cafe outside Kaffa.\u000a\u000aMale Daire , +387 62 434 384, Luled\u017eina 6, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000aKaffa , +387 33 538-633, Sara\u010di 70, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a3. Take in a view from above\u000a\u000aWork began in 1729 on five fortifications built onto the old city wall, but the \u017duta Tabija, or the Yellow Fortress, is basically all that's left. It looms above the city from Jekovac Cliff on the eastern end of the old town, offering a fantastic view and a spectacular place to see the sunset.\u000a\u000aThe red roofs and minarets of the old town give way to the neoclassical heft of an Austo-Hungarian expansion during the late 1800s, and eventually to the skyscrapers of the modern city in the distance. All of it is set against a backdrop of thick forested hills that surround Sarajevo.\u000a\u000aA basic cafe opened in the fortress last year, with picnic tables that make the operation resemble a beer garden. Except no alcohol is served, and in the middle of the tables, a red velvet rope circles a cannon that's fired at sunset during the holy month of Ramadan.\u000a\u000aDespite a few dry locations, the predominately Muslim city prides itself on its secular attitude, and you're much less likely to see a woman covering her hair than one click-clacking down the cobblestones in high heels.\u000a\u000a4. Go on one of the world's best hikes\u000a\u000aVia Dinarica is a mega-network of paths that runs through the Western Balkans from Albania to Slovenia.\u000a\u000aAll those hills surrounding Sarajevo lead to the mountains of the Dinaric Alps, which gave the city reason to host the Winter Olympics in 1984. Well-marked hiking trails wind through the woods on all sides of the city, meaning a hiker could walk out its eastern edge, head north and west along a ridge, and end up back on the other side of town that afternoon.\u000a\u000aThose trails also lead to the Via Dinarica, a mega-network of paths inspired by the Appalachian Trail that runs through the Western Balkans from Albania to Slovenia. Along the way are traditional mountain villages and opportunities for rafting, hiking and climbing.\u000a\u000aThe network was named the best new trail of 2014 by Outside magazine and was on National Geographic Traveler's list of places to go in 2017. ViaDinarica.com is a comprehensive resource.\u000a\u000a"You can print a miniguide for each section of the trail," says Clancy, who helped stitch the trial network together as an ecotourism consultant for the United Nations. "It'll show you where you the water holes are, can give you turn-by-turn directions. It's pretty sophisticated."\u000a\u000a5. See where World War I began\u000a\u000aThe Latin Bridge, which crosses the shallow Miljacka River to connect the old town with the Skenderija neighborhood, is the city's oldest. But as 16th-century bridges go, the structure itself isn't what stands out.\u000a\u000aOn one end of this bridge in 1914, the heir to Hapsburg throne was assassinated by an 18-year-old Serbian, sparking World War I and leading to the extinction of two great empires, the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman.\u000a\u000aA modest museum at the northern end of the bridge tells the story how Gavrip Princip happened to see Archduke Franz Ferdinand's motorcade after other would-be assassins failed to kill him.\u000a\u000aThe museum has changed with the evolving perception of Princip, who over the years has been seen as both a nationalist wing nut and a socialist hero. Now the museum focuses on the 40 years Sarajevo was ruled by Austria-Hungary, with particular attention for the end.\u000a\u000aMuseum of Sarajevo 1878-1918 , +387 33 533 288, Zelenih beretki 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a6. Dive into the steampunk and skater scene\u000a\u000aToward the west end of town, skateboarders shoot around the ramps at Hastahana Park while families linger on the grassy areas. When the sun starts going down on nice days, it can be a cool scene of young and old mingling together, some hanging out drinking beers while others watch the world go by.\u000a\u000aA gigantic sculpture by German artist Helmut Lutz, which was installed in 2005 next to one of the ramps, dominates the park. It's a steampunk mix of steel horns, fabric bellows and fanciful busts that looks like a yacht-sized musical instrument from Dr. Seuss' Whoville.\u000a\u000aThe sculpture was funded by residents of one of Sarajevo's sister cities, the German town of Freiderichschafen. Each winter, the park also hosts a holiday market.\u000a\u000aThe neighborhood around the park exhibits the building boom during a massive expansion of the city during Austrian rule. Another Austrian contribution: the street car, which arrived in Sarajevo in 1885 as a test run for Vienna's public transit.\u000a\u000aHastahana Park , Mar\u0161ala Tita 12, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a7. Hike up to the abandoned Olympic bobsled track\u000a\u000aThe Olympic ruin is now a daredevils' playground.\u000a\u000aWhen the Olympics came to Sarajevo, the games were hailed as a Cold War success in semi-neutral territory (Yugoslavia was communist but not aligned with the Soviet Union).\u000a\u000aThe war in the 1990s damaged many of the sporting venues, including the bobsled and luge track on Trebevi\u0107 Mountain south of town. Despite some recent efforts to restore the track for training, it's basically abandoned and covered in graffiti.\u000a\u000aVideos abound on YouTube of people riding bikes or rollerblades down the track, but it also attracts non-daredevils who hike through thick pine forest on well-marked trails and climb onto the track at various spots along the way. The trailhead is a cheap, 10-minute taxi ride outside the city for a rare opportunity to see a bizarre Olympic ruin.\u000a\u000aThe Pino Nature Hotel, which opened near the top last year with a mid-century-meets-Aspen ski lodge feel, has a spa and a terrace with spectacular views of the mountain. It too, however, is a dry venue, but the restaurant is worth a visit for its hearty, updated Bosnian fare.\u000a\u000aPino Nature Hotel , Trebevi\u0107 - Ravne 1, 71000 Sarajevo, BiH +387 33 257 800\u000a\u000a8. Drink rakija on a night out\u000a\u000aThroughout the Balkans, rakija is a staple served at parties and weddings, with dinner at home, and at most bars as a boost of liquid courage. A clear brandy similar to grappa, it's distilled from various fruits, often plum, pear or apple but also from more exotic ingredients such as quince or walnuts. Just don't be fooled by the fruit flavors. This is potent stuff.\u000a\u000aBarhana in the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija serves many varieties as well as mezze, or small snacks, and tablets of cured meat and cheese similar to what you'd find at Spanish tapas bars. All that toasting and tasting leads to some late nights -- some bars in Sarajevo don't close until 6 a.m. -- and lots of new friends.\u000a\u000a"Sarajevo is the kind of place where you leave your place with five marks in your pocket, and somehow you come home at 6 a.m. with 10 marks and a full pack of cigarettes," says Cat Norman, who opened the Doctor's House Hostel about three years ago. "You'll see their generosity knows no limits."\u000a\u000aAnother popular place is Hacienda. What it lacks in Mexican authenticity it makes up for with a lively crowd and surprising margaritas.\u000a\u000aBarhana , +387 33 447-727 \u0110ulagina \u010dikma 8, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000aHacienda , +387 33 441-918, Bazard\u017eani 3, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000aThe Doctor's House Hostel , +387 61 222 914, Pehlivanu\u0161a 67, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a9. Get your kicks at an old porn theater\u000a\u000aA night at Kino Bosna is a singular experience, Norman says. Before the war, it was a movie theater showing Hollywood movies and eventually porn films, but the owner fled and never came back.\u000a\u000aOne of the employees decided to open it as a bar, bringing in wooden chairs and red-checkered tablecloths and leaving up the old film posters.\u000a\u000aThe owner has since become a Sarajevo legend. Because she's essentially squatting in her old boss' business, she can't register to pay taxes. "The bar will get closed down for a week here and there, but she always finds a way to reopen it," Norman says. "It's what the party people want when you come to the Balkans."\u000a\u000aMonday night is the best of the week, she says. That's when they have a lively band playing traditional sevdah music for tips.\u000a\u000aKino Bosna , +387 61 866 946, Alipa\u0161ina 19, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia-Herzegovina\u000a\u000a10. Glimpse at horrors or war from siege to Srebrenica\u000a\u000aThe tunnel that was a link to the outside world when the city was cut off by Serbian troops.\u000a\u000aAlthough there's much more to Sarajevo than war, the city has embraced its tortured past. Serbian troops cut the city off from the outside world, and rooftop snipers fired at anyone walking on the streets.\u000a\u000aThe only lifeline for supplies was an 800-meter tunnel that connected the people with smugglers from outside the city. The War Tunnel Museum has preserved a section of it and tells the tale of the family that risked their lives by allowing the entrance to pop up in their cellar.\u000a\u000aAnother exhibition, the Srebrenica-Galerija 11/07/95, focuses on the worst genocide in Europe since the Holocaust. In one month near the end of the war, Serbian troops slaughtered more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in one town, mostly men but also women and children, and buried the bodies in mass graves.\u000a\u000aA photographer chronicled the lives of the survivors, who more than 20 years later still don't have all the answers about what happened to their family members. The black and white photos show the exhumation of graves, some of which had been moved several times to evade human rights inspectors.

aV(CNN) The World Interior of the Year shortlist has been announced, bringing together 2017's best designed hotels, restaurants, offices and retail spaces.\u000a\u000aBut while the nominees hail from around the globe, there is one clear winner: China.\u000a\u000aMore than a third of the 78 finalists are based in Greater China, including 19 from the mainland, five from Hong Kong and four from Taiwan.\u000a\u000aAmong the nominees are a co-working space in Shanghai, a minimalist Beijing comic store and a sleek Japanese restaurant in the southern city of Shenzhen. At least one Chinese interior was shortlisted in each of the award program's nine categories, which encompass residential, commercial and public spaces.\u000a\u000aChanging attitudes toward design\u000a\u000aAt the time of the inaugural World Interior of the Year awards in 2011, fewer than 10 percent of the finalists came from China. And all of those projects were based in Shanghai.\u000a\u000aFast-forward six years, and cities less familiar to the international design circuit -- like Hefei and Baoding -- now appear on the shortlist.\u000a\u000aCHA Chinese Restaurant at Wanda Vista Hefei by Wanda Hotel Design Institute (Hefei)\u000a\u000aHalf of the nominated projects in this year's Bars and Restaurants category can be found in Greater China. Among them is Big Small, a 366-square-foot coffee shop and guesthouse designed by the Beijing-based firm Office AIO\u000a\u000aAccording to the company's co-founder, Tim Kwan, the shortlist reflects changing attitudes toward design in China.\u000a\u000a"We noticed the drastic changes happening in the architectural and design landscape around the time of the 2008 Beijing Olympics," said Kwan, who co-founded Office AIO in 2012. "And we wanted to get ourselves involved in these opportunities.\u000a\u000a"The market is becoming more sensitive to the idea and values of 'design' -- both the clients and the public are now seeking innovation and uniqueness."\u000a\u000aChina's growing prominence at the awards is partly the result of organizers' efforts to reach more corners of the world.\u000a\u000aBut it also reflects the changing interiors market, according to Paul Finch, program director at Inside World Festival of Interiors.\u000a\u000a"The Chinese architectural community is on a bit of a roll at the moment," he said over the phone. "When we started, entries from China were more likely to come from international practices that happened to have been commissioned to do buildings in Shanghai, Beijing or Shenzhen.\u000a\u000aPhotos: World Building of the Year 2017 shortlist Culture: Completed Buildings -- Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology, Lisbon, Portugal by AL_A \u2013 This building by Amanda Levete and Associates is located on the Tagus River, and is a multi-purpose facility designed in such a way that visitors can walk over, under and within the building itself.

For some, frequent snacking may replace a typical meal or two.\u000a\u000aRegardless of your health goals, what you choose to snack on matters, especially if you snack often. A healthy nutrient-rich snack can fill in nutritional gaps and boost energy.

aV(CNN) As he sits aboard superyacht Amore Mio in glamorous Monaco, Tripp Hock's mind wanders back to the moment his life flashed before him.\u000a\u000aIn 1992, then only a teenager, Hock was taking part in the annual "Running of the Bulls" festival in Pamplona, Spain.\u000a\u000aBacked into a corner on one of the course's notoriously dangerous turns, Hock frantically tried to escape as a 600-kilogram beast hurtled towards him down the narrow street.\u000a\u000aWith both horns -- each a foot long and sharp enough to sink several inches deep into human flesh -- pointed in his direction, the college student and Wall Street intern closed his eyes and feared the worst.\u000a\u000a"As the bull hits me, it sees the wall coming and slips. The thing that saved my life was the wall behind me," Hock tells CNN of his first -- and only -- attempt of running at the festival.\u000a\u000a"The bull's snout hits the wall and he can't get the horn all the way into me, but then he stands up and the horn pinches my sweatshirt. He picks me up and drags me -- I literally go down the street riding his horn."\u000a\u000aThe dust had barely settled on the tiled street when Hock finally unhooked his university sweatshirt from the bull's horn, the tip of which was now decorated with his blood.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The 'Running of the Bulls' in 1954 Bulls enter a bullring in Pamplona, Spain, during the San Fermin festival in 1954.

He attributes almost all of his accomplishments to that hot summer day in northeastern Spain.\u000a\u000a"I had kind of this awakening, my life was nearly gone so what am I doing commuting, getting on the 5 a.m. train and sitting with a bunch of gray suits," Hock says, recalling his daily commute to the now defunct Lehman Brothers\u000a\u000a"So I quit and bought a one-way ticket to the Caribbean.

We've seen him on CNN. What happened?'

aVSingapore (CNN) A graphic novel about the history of Singapore stirred controversy before its publication, with a senior official in the city-state once warning that it could "potentially undermine the authority of legitimacy of the government and its public institutions."\u000a\u000aBut the Singaporean artist behind the book, Sonny Liew, continues to receive international praise.\u000a\u000aLast Friday, Liew and his graphic novel "The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye" bagged three Eisner awards -- Best Writer/Artist, Best Publication Design and Best US Edition of International Material in Asia. The Eisner Awards are often regarded as the Oscars of the comic world. The work was also named Best International Comic at Denmark's Pingprisen Awards in June.\u000a\u000aTelling a more inclusive story\u000a\u000aLiew's graphic novel has raised eyebrows in Singapore for featuring the country's first Prime Minister, the late Lee Kuan Yew, and a former opposition leader, Lim Chin Siong, as its main characters.\u000a\u000aThe story also retraces important -- and controversial -- historical events that helped shape the tightly controlled city-state, including the violent strikes and riots of 1955, the detention of left-wing politicians and trade unionists and the alleged Marxist conspiracy of 1987.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, the National Art Council of Singapore (NAC) withdrew a previously approved 8,000 Singaporean dollar ($5,870) publishing grant for the novel, citing concerns over "sensitive content." But in an official statement released on Monday, the agency congratulated Liew "on being the first Singaporean to bag three Eisner awards."\u000a\u000aThe NAC also stated that although it had withdrawn the novel's grant because its content "breached" its funding guidelines, Liew had continued to be supported in various other ways. "For example, he enjoys subsidized arts housing in the much sought-after Goodman Arts Centre," the statement said.\u000a\u000aMoving past controversy\u000a\u000a"The book is essentially a history of Singapore told through the lens of a comic book artist called Charlie Chan," Liew explained over the phone from San Diego. "And while at first it appears to be an 'art of' book with archival images of (Chan's) work along with interviews and essays in comic form, the readers will discover it's not quite what it seems."\u000a\u000aBeyond the political history, the novel is also a celebration of "comics as a medium," full of witty allusions to famous works such as Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy, Walt Kelly's Pogo and Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns."\u000a\u000aRather than trying to replace the "official" narrative of Singapore's history, Liew said he wanted to tell a story that was "more inclusive and complex."\u000a\u000a"I think this (is what) potentially upset (the authorities), though they didn't specify exactly what they were not happy with," he said. "So all we can do is speculate about their reasons."\u000a\u000aLiew's wins at the prestigious Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, have helped return the focus to the quality of his work. In its congratulatory statement, the NAC praised the "high artistic merit" of Liew's novel.\u000a\u000aExcerpt from "The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye" by Sonny Liew.\u000a\u000aBut the 42-year-old artist and author expressed concern that the attention attracted by the controversy is a double-edged sword.\u000a\u000a"Without the (grant) withdrawal, the book wouldn't have received the social media attention it got, and we wouldn't have sold out the initial print run in a week," the artist admitted. "But I wonder about the impact the controversy will have over the longer term, for example whether schools might be wary of recommending the book to students, or that people will assume the book is anti-government without having read it."\u000a\u000aDebate over funding\u000a\u000aLiew is not the only Singaporean writer to have faced funding disputes with the NAC. The agency, according to the Straits Times , withheld part of a SG $12,000 ($8,800) grant to author Jeremy Tiang after he submitted a first draft of a novel about the leftist movement's place in Singapore's history.\u000a\u000aIn that same article, NAC had responded, acknowledging Tiang as "one of Singapore's promising young fiction writers," who had been supported by the NAC on various projects.\u000a\u000aAlthough Singapore's art community has enjoyed strong financial support from the government , some have argued that state funding has also be used as an instrument for censorship.\u000a\u000aIn a parliamentary exchange last year, lawmaker Baey Yam Keng acknowledged that "as part of the funding principles of the NAC, there is a requirement and understanding with the arts groups and the applicants that they should not put any public institutions in a bad light or put them in a derogatory position."\u000a\u000aBut critics, like the director of Singapore International Festival of Arts, Keng Sen Ong, argue that state funding should not be withheld from dissenting voices.\u000a\u000a"Arts funding should not be about supporting propaganda mouthpieces for the government but about supporting high-quality art, nurturing creative expressions to become deeply insightful, and inspiring new artists to produce the best art possible," he said in an email.\u000a\u000a"Anything that rocks the boat is already weeded out. I personally view art funding as becoming increasingly suspicious -- we are told more and more that we should not bite the hand that feeds us. So perhaps we are being guided slowly towards become an echo chamber for the government."\u000a\u000a"The old philosophy was to promote art, while today there seems to be a shift to the 'national' project. The colossal tragedy is that in this seeming lack of transparency, the only strategy left is to self-censor for many artists."\u000a\u000aFor Liew, the "wall of silence" from authorities has prevented open dialogue about Singapore's history. He said that in the last two years, he has never been offered "a clear account from the government about what they think about the book, whether from the NAC or any other members of the ruling party."\u000a\u000a"I'd hoped the book would open things up, but I think it's actually closed them a little bit."\u000a\u000aCNN has reached out to NAC for comment on claims about censorship and ties to art funding.

aVKarla Cripps, CNN \u2022 Updated 27th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 When a luxury resort developer wants to create a truly spectacular property that'll be talked about for years to come, there are only a handful of designers in Asia up to the task.\u000a\u000aBangkok -based Bill Bensley is among the top on that list.\u000a\u000aAfter nearly four decades in the business with a portfolio of more than 200 luxury hospitality properties in nearly 40 countries he's in a position to be choosy about the projects he'll take on. And there's one overlying philosophy that guides his decisions.\u000a\u000a"If it's no fun, don't do it," Bensley tells CNN, his eyes lighting up with enthusiasm. "If you're not having fun, then you're not going to do a good job. Everybody in our studio here -- 100 people -- we're all about having fun."\u000a\u000aIt'd be hard not to have fun while working at the BENSLEY design studio, a large complex with an art deco feel that once housed Bangkok's Iraq Embassy.\u000a\u000aIt's more like a giant artistic playground than an office. Practically every room, from the fine arts studio to the architecture department, is a colorful buzz of creativity. (See the video at the top of this story for a peek inside.)\u000a\u000a'There are no boundaries'\u000a\u000a"There are no rules to what we do in this studio. There are no boundaries. Anyone can pick up anything."\u000a\u000aIt's fitting, given most of projects with Bensley's involvement are often quite whimsical, places where you'll spend days marveling at the attention to detail.\u000a\u000aThe Harvard-educated American has designed a huge chunk of Asia's most incredible hotels and resorts. These include Oberoi Vilas projects in India , Four Seasons' award-winning resorts in Thailand , St. Regis in Bali and two of Vietnam 's most talked about projects to date, JW Marriott Phu Quoc and the InterContinental Danang.\u000a\u000aHe's been invited to New York to be inducted into the Hospitality Designs Hall of Fame in November.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 15 Bensley says his favorite project to date is the Four Seasons Golden Triangle Tented Camp in Chiang Rai, which he designed over 10 years ago. He recently returned to design a new two-bedroom pool villa for the project.\u000a\u000aWhile Bensley's whimsical stamp is increasingly being seen on projects around the world, a global outlook hasn't weakened his focus.\u000a\u000a"What makes a project magical is the ability to finish down to the smallest detail," he says.\u000a\u000aThis isn't hyperbole.\u000a\u000aBENSLEY studios is known to handle everything from uniform design, menu design, signage and graphics to even the music that people hear as they're wandering around a resort. It's fitting, given Bensley prefers to think of his work in terms of a storyline. And he doesn't focus on the trendiness of materials.\u000a\u000a"Not a whole lot of people think like that so a lot of the hotels being built now are strictly utilitarian and don't have much soul," he says. "Even if it's as simple as the story that we created 25 years ago with Four Seasons Chiang Mai -- living on a farm. It's surrounded by a rice field. It was a such a simple story but it will never go out of style."\u000a\u000aOperating in all design facets -- landscaping, interiors and architecture -- wasn't part of the original plan for Bensley.\u000a\u000a"I started out just doing landscapes and I just got so tired of doing nice gardens for bad buildings," he says. "What I'm trying to do that's a little bit new is to create this mesh between all of these different traditionally separate design companies, where graphic designers, landscape designers and interior designers can all come together in this place where they can work together and create a new product."\u000a\u000aRaiding the cabinet of curiosities\u000a\u000aMuch of the art that Bensley includes in his hospitality projects was created in his studio or handpicked during his travels.\u000a\u000aIn his warehouse, or the "cabinet of curiosities" as he calls it, you'll find everything from animal antlers to a spiral staircase he found in a house in Myanmar.\u000a\u000a"Buy first, think later," he says, reasoning that if he comes across a unique piece he knows he'll use it somewhere eventually. "I select, design and make things for the rooms that are very happy. That are joyful. That are representative of that place."\u000a\u000aBensley says he often chooses projects based, not just on fun, but on whether he's been to a location or not. Hence the reason his portfolio includes projects in nearly 40 countries. Still on his design wish list: Japan and Morocco.\u000a\u000a"What I like the most about [my job] is working in a new place," he says.\u000a\u000a"Someplace where I can learn a new architectural language, can be challenged to try to see something through somebody else's eyes. Inspiration comes from everywhere. But mostly it comes from traveling to new places for me."\u000a\u000aEscapism\u000a\u000aSet inside the InterContinental Danang, this pre-function foyer leads the all black ballroom.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Bensley released the first of a series of books that showcases 26 projects in 12 countries over the last two decades.\u000a\u000aAppropriately called " Escapism, " the 500-page volume features beautiful, large photographs and detailed explanations of the inspirations and design processes behind each project.\u000a\u000aSo where does Bensley go to escape? Definitely not a beach resort.\u000a\u000a"It's funny. I've designed 200 resorts -- a lot of them are on beaches -- but you know what, the last place in the world that I want to go is go and sit on the beach. I would find that really boring."\u000a\u000aHis vacation of choice: fly fishing in Mongolia, where he's been going to unplug for the last four years. Last year, he took 12 of his Thai staff with him.\u000a\u000a"We're up there on the border and we don't see anybody for two, three weeks," he says. "That's one thing I do every year. There's no telephone, there's no computer there. It's completely unplugged and when I come back from there I feel like I can jump over a house."\u000a\u000aComing soon: A Cambodian luxury tented camp\u000a\u000aComing in 2018: Shinta Mani Wild, a tented camp in the wilds of Cambodia.\u000a\u000aOne of Bensley's current projects marries his philanthropy work with his passion for design. Called Shinta Mani Wild, it's part of Bensley's own Shinta Mani hotel brand.\u000a\u000aThe associated Shinta Mani Foundation , which promotes responsible tourism in Cambodia , will be spearheading the conservation and community outreach programs for the camp and provide long-term employment opportunities to those in region.\u000a\u000aBensley says it's his most ambitious luxury camp project to date.\u000a\u000aSet along 1.5 kilometers of river and waterfalls, there are 16 large luxury tents perched over swift waters and waterfalls between southern Cambodia's Bokor and Cardamom national parks. It's due to open in mid-2018.\u000a\u000a"I think this is gonna really change what a camp looks like for the whole world," he says. "It's so luxurious and beautiful."\u000a\u000aBear in mind this is the same man who over a decade ago kick-started the luxury camp phenomena with the Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle in Chiang Rai , which he admits is one of his favorite projects of all time. He was recently invited back to design a new two-bedroom pool villa.\u000a\u000aSo what advice would Bensley offer any budding luxury resort designers?\u000a\u000a"I would urge anyone that's coming into hospitality for the first time to do something weird," he says. "Do something different. Do something that's going to surprise people. Don't do the norm."

aVPhotos: Iconic British design From stunning skyscrapers to flamboyant fashion, perfectly formed household products to streamlined sports cars, British designers have built a reputation for innovation, imagination and style. We take a look at the British designs that have become icons in their own right. Hide Caption 1 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Rolls Royce \u2013 Engineer Henry Royce and car dealer Charles Rolls were the joint force behind the celebrated Rolls-Royce brand at the turn of the 20th century. The 1907 Silver Ghost, pictured, was among the most glamorous models produced by a name that became synonymous with luxury and quality. Hide Caption 2 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Jaguar E-Type \u2013 Aerodynamicist Malcolm Sayer was one of the first to apply the principles of aerodynamics to motor car design, used in Jaguar's elegant 1961 E-Type. Hide Caption 3 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Mini \u2013 Less glamorous than the E-type, but no less important, the Mini was born in 1959, when engineer and designer Sir Alec Issigonis designed a small, accessible car by pushing the wheels out to the corners and placing the engine sideways to make more space for passengers. Hide Caption 4 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Royal Enfield \u2013 Beloved of bikers the world over, the first Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle hit the road in the UK in the 1930s, with the tagline "Made like a gun, goes like a bullet." Made by one of the oldest motorcycle companies in the world, the Bullet has even been used by the Indian armed forces.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 5 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Spitfire \u2013 First used by the Royal Air Force in 1938, the Spitfire, a World War II fighter plane, was used in the Battle of Britain in 1940. More than 20,000 Spitfires were built in 22 different variants, with British aeronautical engineer Reginald Mitchell leading the team behind the first design. Hide Caption 6 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Concorde \u2013 The supersonic passenger jet Concorde was operated by British Airways and manufactured as a collaboration between British Aerospace and French firm Aérospatiale. Despite short flight times -- it could fly from New York to London in just under three hours -- it was not commercially viable, and the fleet of seven aircraft was retired in 2003 after some 50,000 flights since the 1973 maiden journey. But its long, drooping nose and slender wings its appearance as remarkable as its velocity. Hide Caption 7 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Gherkin \u2013 Nestled between more recent additions to the London skyline is Norman Foster's 30 St Mary Axe. Completed in 2003, it's popularly called the Gherkin (a British term for a pickled cucumber), due to its unconventional shape, designed to reduce wind deflection.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 8 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The original Wembley Stadium, with its distinctive Twin Towers, hosted the London 1948 Olympics and England's only football World Cup win, in 1966.

Hide Caption 9 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Penny Black \u2013 Based on Royal Mint engraver William Wyon's portrait of Queen Victoria on the so-called City Medal, the Royal Mail's 1840 Penny Black was the world's first adhesive postage stamp. A small stamp with pitch-black ink etchings, its radical design became the model for making stamps around the world. Hide Caption 10 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Sex Pistols poster \u2013 This provocative image was originally featured on promotional posters for the British punk rock band Sex Pistols' "God Save the Queen" single, released to coincide with the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977. Like the song's lyrics, the poster, design by British artist and anarchist Jamie Reid, was controversial at the time, but has since been reproduced on everything from mugs to jackets and shirts.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 11 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design McQueen's Union Jack frock \u2013 Designed for David Bowie for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, the now iconic "Union Jack" frock with its frilly black-lace cuffs is one of Alexander McQueen's earliest designs. The theme was revisited in his later creations, including scarves and clutch bags carrying the distinct red, white and blue colors of the Union flag.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 12 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Penguin book covers \u2013 Penguin's classic covers originate from the publishing house's first book, "Ariel," by André Maurois, published in 1935. It was designed by Penguin's first production manager, Edward Young. This was also the birth of the distinctive Penguin logo, which Young sketched using the penguins at London Zoo as models.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 13 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design London tube maps \u2013 In 1933 electrical draughtsman Harry Beck straightened out the sprawling squiggly lines of the London tube map, producing a map that was clear, concise and almost beautiful in its sense of order. A radical drawing at the time, the style is still used to help people navigate urban underground networks around the world.

Hide Caption 17 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Burberry trench coat \u2013 The early trench coat, patented as the Tielocken by Thomas Burberry in 1912, was designed for soldiers and made from a sturdy khaki-colored material called gabardine, which Burberry himself invented. British troops wore the coat in the World War I trenches, where the weather-proof material kept off the rain and mud. The name trench coat has followed the garment since, but its wartime use has been swapped for fashion shows, with Humphrey Bogart and Kate Moss among the famous modelers of the coat, now found in a range of styles and colors.

aV(CNN) Cindy Martinez joined the Marines when she was 17 years old.\u000a\u000a"When you go through Marine Corps boot camp or any type of training in the military, you're trained to be prepared for something big," she said.\u000a\u000aWhat Martinez didn't realize was how much she would need to rely on her mental toughness, not on the battlefield but in civilian life.\u000a\u000aMartinez served four years and met her husband, David, while on active duty. In May 2015, she was working full-time and raising two small children when her strength was put to the test.\u000a\u000aCindy Martinez with her husband, David, and two kids, David and Bianca, before she got sick.\u000a\u000a"One day, I woke up, and it just felt like a little ache on my left side, in my back shoulderblade area," she said.\u000a\u000aMartinez thought she must have slept on it awkwardly. But by the weekend, she was in intense pain.\u000a\u000a"David took me to the emergency room, and from there, I don't remember much," she said.\u000a\u000aFight of her life\u000a\u000aMartinez was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, a type of flesh-eating bacteria. She doesn't know how she contracted, it because she didn't have any visible cuts or wounds.\u000a\u000aDoctors removed the bacteria from her back, but her body was in septic shock.\u000a\u000a"Her life was now in danger," said her husband, David Martinez. "I tried to be as strong as possible for her and for the kids."\u000a\u000aThe medications that saved her life also ravaged her arms and legs.\u000a\u000a"My vessels were constricted, which didn't allow blood flow to my extremities because the doctors wanted all the blood to go to my heart," she said. "They told my husband, it was life over limb."\u000a\u000aMartinez fought for her life after being diagnosed with flesh-eating bacteria.\u000a\u000aMartinez underwent multiple amputations: both legs below the knee, her right arm above the elbow and portions of all the fingers on her left hand.\u000a\u000a"When I woke up and the amputations were done, it's a hard thing," she said. "They're gone, and they're not coming back."\u000a\u000aMartinez spent almost three months in the hospital and seven weeks in rehab. She learned to walk again with prosthetics.\u000a\u000aBut coming home wasn't easy.\u000a\u000a"It's almost like you're a different person," she said. "When your husband is at work, your kids are at school and you're home by yourself, that can take a toll on you."\u000a\u000aFinding new strength\u000a\u000aMartinez found support in an unlikely place. She reached out to CrossFit GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) gym in Dacula, Georgia, to see about becoming a member.\u000a\u000a"I still needed to work on myself and build my endurance to walk on my prosthetics," she said. "So I thought, 'Let me see if CrossFit could be something I could do.' "\u000a\u000aAmanda Greaver, founder of the gym, had never coached someone with multiple amputations. But she was up for the challenge. "It was a lot of trial and error, but Cindy has such a positive spirit," she said. "She's always up for anything I throw at her."\u000a\u000aWhen Martinez arrived at the gym, she could barely lift 5 pounds. But with modifications and adaptive devices, she can now squat 72 pounds and dead-lift up to 95 pounds.\u000a\u000a"Working out has really changed my outlook on life. It's my form of therapy," she said. "Now I can pick up my daughter, and I can pick up my son if I want to and hug them. ... I just can't put it into words."\u000a\u000aAfter regaining her strength, Martinez sought out a new challenge. She signed up for the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington in October.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I did the first 25 miles on my (modified) bike, and then I changed into my running prosthetics for the last 1.2 miles. My husband was there to finish it off with me," she said.\u000a\u000a"I was extremely proud," her husband said. "I could just see that determination on her face. ... No matter how tired she was, she just couldn't stop."\u000a\u000aMartinez completed the Marine Corps Marathon in October.\u000a\u000aMartinez was overcome with emotion when she crossed the finish line.\u000a\u000a"Just a year prior, I was in a hospital bed," she said. "Whatever challenge (you face), there is a positive in everything. ... You just have to be willing to try something new and put yourself out there."

aVJohn D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000aAtlanta (CNN) Before I launch into the argument for making all restrooms in the United States gender neutral -- that is, removing "men's" and "women's" labels -- I want to show you a photo.\u000a\u000aThis is James Parker Sheffield.\u000a\u000aNow a truly ridiculous question: Which restroom do you think he should use?\u000a\u000aMen's or women's?\u000a\u000aIn the United States at the moment, the legal answer depends on location. If Sheffield is in North Carolina, it's illegal for him to use a public men's restroom. Since he's a transgender man -- his birth certificate has an "F" on it -- he has to use the women's.\u000a\u000aIf he's at home in Atlanta, he can use the men's.\u000a\u000a"It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife," Sheffield wrote on Twitter along with his selfie. He posted that message in March, only hours after North Carolina passed a law making it illegal for transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond with their true gender identities.\u000a\u000aAs it's written, Sheffield would have to use the lady's room or break the law.\u000a\u000aThat's absurd, as the selfie and tweet make clear. Sheffield is a 36-year-old man who lives in Decatur, Georgia. He has a scruffy beard and a receding hairline, which he jokingly calls a "reverse fade." If he walked into a lady's restroom he'd likely be met with stares or screams or worse.\u000a\u000aBut you know what else is absurd? The idea that Sheffield -- or anyone else -- should have to choose a male or female restroom at all. And, beyond that, that any of us would feel entitled to decide someone else's gender for them -- and, consequently, where they can and can't pee.\u000a\u000aThis isn't a binary gender world. People don't fit neatly into the "M" and "F" boxes. It's time our public restrooms reflected that. The fairest way to do so is to desegregate restrooms by sex, and that means eliminating the men's and women's rooms in favor of "all gender" restrooms.\u000a\u000aThink that's an overreaction? Take a quick look at the history of bathroom politics in the United States. We've tried time and again to control who we sit and stand next to at the toilet.\u000a\u000aIn the 1960s, black civil rights activists were killed for trying to use "whites only" bathrooms. In the 1980s, gay men were harassed because the public wrongly assumed they could catch HIV-AIDS from a toilet. (AIDS was viewed then as a gay man's disease). Restrooms weren't required to be accessible to people with wheelchairs until the Americans with Disabilities act of 1990. And now, some cities and states are trying to keep transgender people out.\u000a\u000aThe only justification is bigotry and ignorance.\u000a\u000aYou might think that allowing a transgender person to use the restroom of their choice is a workable solution. It's a first step. But Sheffield and others who don't conform to gender norms face discrimination even when they're legally allowed to choose which restroom to use.\u000a\u000aSeventy percent of transgender people surveyed in Washington, for example, a city with progressive laws allowing people to use either restroom, reported "verbal harassment, assault and being denied access to public restrooms" because of their identities, according to a report from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles . Further, 54% reported medical problems "like dehydration, urinary tract infections, kidney infections and other kidney problems" because they avoided using restrooms entirely.\u000a\u000a@PatMcCroryNC It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife. #HB2 #trans #NorthCarolina #shameonNC pic.twitter.com/4b4OdmfmeN \u2014 James P Sheffield (@JayShef) March 24, 2016\u000a\u000aSheffield told me he plans his days around where he can and can't pee.\u000a\u000a"I almost never go to the restroom in a place I haven't been at least once before," he told me. He cuts appointments short and avoids going out simply to avoid peeing in public. Sometimes he'll find the one stall in a men's room is occupied, or out of order. Other times he sits on the toilet for longer than necessary because he worries it's suspicious a man would sit down to urinate.\u000a\u000a"It's not a good feeling to be a grown-up and wondering, 'Am I going to make it to a restroom on time -- and how do you explain it if you don't,'" he said.\u000a\u000aSuch fears apply not only to transgender people but also those who don't meet our rigid gender norms. In 2013, I met a female middle school student in Mississippi , for example, who told me her teachers wouldn't let her use the girl's restroom because she had short hair and wore hoodies. She looked too boyish.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Young and out in Mississippi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Young and out in Mississippi 03:15\u000a\u000aGendered restrooms support these biases.\u000a\u000a"We need a restroom revolution in this country," said Kathryn Anthony, an architecture professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\u000a\u000aI agree. And there are simple places to start. Restaurants and small businesses with two single-unit restrooms simply can paint over the "M" and "W" on their doors and -- ba-da-bing! -- they're gender inclusive. No one's harmed as long as we men stop peeing on the toilet seat.\u000a\u000aPhiladelphia recently made that concept law for single-stall bathrooms. Other governments and businesses should follow. (And if you're a business that is considering this sort of move, please send me a tweet ).\u000a\u000aThen, bigger leaps: The International Building Code should suggest all-gender restrooms become the norm, or at least be included, in larger businesses and public establishments. (That idea comes from Terry Kogan, a law professor at the University of Utah.)\u000a\u000aCity, state and federal governments also could legislate these restrooms into existence, too.\u000a\u000aIt won't happen immediately, but new construction and renovations could be subject to our updated understanding of which types of bathrooms are safest for everyone. That's the precedent set by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Kogan said.\u000a\u000aHarvey Molotch, a professor of sociology at New York University and co-editor of the book "Toilet: public restrooms and the politics of sharing," outlined for me what he considers to be the Holy Grail of restrooms. Walk in and you'd see a long line of private toilet stalls, with floor-to-ceiling doors. On the other side would be a row of communal sinks. Anyone is free to use any stall -- and there might be a row of urinals tucked away somewhere to the side.\u000a\u000aThe urinals could be left out of some restrooms, but they should be kept when possible, Molotch said, because they're much more water-efficient than sit-down toilets.\u000a\u000aAll this sounds wildly inoffensive to me.\u000a\u000aAnd it's already happening.\u000a\u000aThe Cooper Union, a college in New York, announced on March 18 that it is removing gender identification from restrooms on campus and opening single-occupancy toilets up for anyone's use. "We have always been ahead of our time and we must continue being leaders on issues of social justice," Bill Mea, acting president, wrote in an email to the campus\u000a\u000aThe Urban Justice Center, also in New York, made a similar move a decade ago.\u000a\u000a"I'm delighted to be able to share that our experiences have been wholly positive," the center's executive director, Doug Lasdon, and a development associate, Hugh Ryan, wrote in a recent op-ed in the Washington Post . "To this day, we have not received a single complaint. Not one in a decade. Nor have any incidents of violence or harassment been reported."\u000a\u000aThere's little counterargument other that bias and squeamishness.\u000a\u000aSheffield, the transgender man in Georgia, doesn't expect the all-gender restroom revolution to occur anytime soon. "If we could go to sleep tonight and wake up and all the bathrooms were gender neutral -- great! But it's not practical," he said. "It's not going to happen that way."\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, he said, a little courteousness would help.\u000a\u000a"We can't hold it," he said. "Trans people have to pee multiple times a day, just like everyone else."\u000a\u000aCurrently, there are only two places Sheffield feels comfortable peeing.\u000a\u000aOne's at home.\u000a\u000aThe other's at work.\u000a\u000aAnd that's because it's labeled "all gender restroom."

aVStory highlights The Syrian people need help with food, shelter and medical aid\u000a\u000aThousands of people have died\u000a\u000a(CNN) In 2011, more than 3 million people lived in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Then the bombs came.\u000a\u000aChildren could no longer go to school. Their parents could not get to work. Over time, the explosions increased. Residents feared for their lives. Gunfire and blasts echoed through neighborhoods. Food became scarce, and families went hungry. International outcry had little effect on Aleppo's civilians.\u000a\u000aNow, their world in ruins, thousands of parents, children and elderly dead, Aleppo's innocent can no longer live if they stay in the city. But they might not survive their journey out.\u000a\u000aUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Aleppo "a synonym for hell." He said the carnage there is a "gaping hole in the global conscience."\u000a\u000aBut no matter where you live, there are ways you can help -- with food, shelter, medical aid and other basic needs -- by supporting these organizations:

aVEditor's Note: On April 23, Jacob Zurl completed his Cuba challenge, cycling 1450km in 58 hours and 48 minutes -- nearly two hours slower than his initial estimated time. The article below was first published on April 18, the day before the Austrian began cycling across the Caribbean island.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Sleep deprived, the mind begins to play tricks. Exhausted, the body begs for no more. But Jacob Zurl carries on. He must. Records can only be broken when the spirit refuses to bow.\u000a\u000aEnduring when the majority would quit is this Austrian's specialty.\u000a\u000aThe extreme cyclist lives to achieve the unthinkable: cycling across the Himalayas in a record 39 hours, setting world firsts in high altitude.\u000a\u000aThis month he is to cycle non-stop the length of Cuba, from east to west, on gravel and dirt tracks, in extreme heat, perhaps tropical rain. It will be humid. It could be 1450 kilometers (900 miles) of hell.\u000a\u000aNo one has attempted this round-the-clock feat. The 28-year-old hopes to complete his mission -- the equivalent of cycling from New York to St Louis in the Midwest -- in 57 hours. Experienced cyclists would normally take two weeks.\u000a\u000aHe will, he says, nap for a few minutes, weather permitting, and when nature calls he will hop off his bike. But essential functions will be brief. Time moves forward without rest and so must he.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Extreme Cuba: 1450km, 57 hours, 1 song Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Extreme Cuba: 1450km, 57 hours, 1 song 01:34\u000a\u000aFor a little over two days, Zurl will mainly be pedaling, relentlessly so, fighting the aches in the body, the manipulative voices in his mind and whatever the elements throw at him.\u000a\u000aIt is his inquisitiveness, as well as a love for adrenaline, which drives him.\u000a\u000a"When I look at the world map, for me, as an ultra cyclist, I see so many interesting projects," he tells CNN Sport.\u000a\u000a"Why hasn't someone done this challenge before? Cuba is such an interesting country.\u000a\u000a"I want to get in contact with the people, to know the country. I have endurance in cycling and the Cuban people have endurance in life."\u000a\u000aYoung men wait by the side of the road for the remains of former Cuban President Fidel Castro to pass by on their four-day journey across the country.\u000a\u000aThe Caribbean's largest island is experiencing an uncertain era following the death of Fidel Castro in November 2016.\u000a\u000aCastro, regarded as a revolutionary hero to his supporters and a ruthless autocrat to his enemies, was the man who created a communist state in America's backyard.\u000a\u000aBut earlier last year, Barack Obama became the first US President to visit the country in 88 years as relations between the Cold War-era adversaries thawed. It is yet unclear what policy US President Donald Trump will pursue, but it is possible he will harden America's stance towards the island.\u000a\u000aCuba, a country 90 miles off the Florida coast, is renowned for its color and spirit, but its vivacity will not shield Zurl from the agony he will undoubtedly experience as he forces his body to cover a daunting distance at rapid pace.\u000a\u000aRiding along, and up and down, rickety roads, his body will rattle as if riding on a pneumatic drill. Crouched for hours, his back will eventually feel as tight as old rubber and his muscles will be as hard as week-old bread.\u000a\u000aWhile the lights on his bike will guide him through dark nights, it is music -- and an iron will -- that will drive this son of a bank manager on when he is sucked into a black hole of physical suffering.\u000a\u000aCuriously, he will only listen to one song, a familiar beat, lyrics he can easily repeat. Sometimes, he may even sing along. Quietly, of course, for it is long-distance cycling, not singing, which is his forte.\u000a\u000a"I haven't decided what song it will be yet in Cuba," he laughs, revealing that his tune of choice during a recent training stint in Spain was Mumford and Sons' "Believe" before adding that he rode up the Himalayas listening to "Free" by Natalia Kills.\u000a\u000a"For the long distance projects, the music makes it easier," he says. "Once my support car drove over one of my MP3 players. That was s***."\u000a\u000aZurl is the sort of man who would feel lost riding without music.\u000a\u000aHe will take three portable music players to Cuba, a precaution against a repeat of the previous disaster.\u000a\u000aFor many, listening to the same song for hours, for days, seemingly forever on loop, would be as torturous as pedaling from one end of a country to another at 25 kph.\u000a\u000aBut when life on the saddle feels effortless, Zurl's mind drifts. He will contemplate about his yesterdays and make plans for his tomorrows. "I'm thinking about everything," he admits.\u000a\u000aHe hears the music, but doesn't listen. The music, he says, goes "under my mind."\u000a\u000aIt is when the adventure becomes a chore that Zurl refocuses on the beat of his favorite tune which will push him to achieve a feat no man or woman has done before.\u000a\u000a"It's always just one song. It's kind of spiritual. When it's getting hard and I want to listen to music and there is no music, it's a problem for me," says Zurl, who has been cycling an average of 20 hours a week in preparation for this ride, focusing on speed rather than endurance.\u000a\u000a"The worst thing to happen in this race would be if I lost my MP3 players."\u000a\u000aBut Zurl has experienced deeper misery than the crushing of his portable music player.\u000a\u000aIt was while in Cuba, before his first attempt to cycle across the island in 2015, that Zurl contracted dengue fever.\u000a\u000a"I felt suddenly not good," is his understated description of the day he was hastily taken to hospital, his temperature rising to 40 degrees.\u000a\u000aZurl says he fears catching dengue fever again during his ride along the country.\u000a\u000aIn nine days, he lost seven kilos. He says he caught the tropical disease, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, when cycling in heavy rain during a training session on the island.\u000a\u000aHe is better prepared for this his second attempt, though that does not mean he has forgotten easily about the fright of two years ago.\u000a\u000aAsked what he feared the most about the journey ahead, he gravely replies: "Catching dengue again."\u000a\u000a"There was a heavy shower and I didn't have the (mosquito) spray and, I think, that was the problem," says Zurl, regret still in his voice.\u000a\u000a"I did not think it was going to be so dangerous.\u000a\u000a"I took the plane back to Austria and for the next two months sport was forbidden and, after that, I started to cycling again, but in 2016 I fell ill so many times."\u000a\u000aIt is Zurl's experience with dengue which partly explains why his family will be close behind in a support car this time around.\u000a\u000aHis parents, Paul and Brigitte, a medical physicist, and girlfriend, Nina Almer, are the ones who will drive behind with food supplies, isotonic drinks, spare wheels and, of course, his MP3 players.\u000a\u000aThe mum who once told her then-18-year-old son he was "completely stupid" for spending a vast sum on shoes for his new two-wheeled hobby is now fully supportive of his long-distance expeditions.\u000a\u000a"First my parents were skeptical," admits Zurl, once a promising sailor of international class before cycling took hold.\u000a\u000a"It needed a lot of energy for me to convince them, but in the last two years or so it's easier and they know, for me, it's important.\u000a\u000a"If it's not too dangerous they will let me do it. In the past it was difficult because my father loved to sail and I'd sail in regattas.\u000a\u000a"That's all changed. Not only do my parents now cycle, but my uncle and aunt do too. Sometimes we cycle together and we have our own jersey. I made it for them with the family name on it."\u000a\u000aIt is perhaps fitting that Zurl's mum will be on hand to make sure her son eats properly, though he does not need his mother to remind him of the dangers of not consuming the right calories at the right time. Every engine needs fuel.\u000a\u000aEating for endurance, says Zurl, is a skill. "I really have to eat a lot," he says, sighing.\u000a\u000aExperience has taught him he will have to eat or drink 500 calories an hour to compensate for the minerals he will lose through sweating.\u000a\u000aEven food lovers would balk at the thought of consuming 30,000 calories in two-and-a-half days -- especially when presented with a diet of rice and potatoes, essential for this race against the clock.\u000a\u000aWill Zurl find fresh vegetables along Cuba's dirt tracks?\u000a\u000aHe says he would love to, but is unsure what will be available en route. Protein bars and drinks, he says, will suffice if fresh food cannot be found.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Ultra cyclist to cross Cuba in 57 hours Austrian ultra cyclist Jacob Zurl is planning to see Cuba like no person has ever seen before ...

aVOn tonight\u2019s AC360°, Anderson spoke with Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY, following Friday\u2019s vote to keep interest rates on government-backed student loans from doubling. Most Democrats, including Maloney, opposed the move, blasting Republicans for raiding a preventative care fund in President Obama\u2019s health care law, in order to pay for their bill, accusing those across the aisle of going after women, yet again.\u000a\u000aBut when Anderson pointed out Democrats, including Maloney, dipped into that very same fund to pay for an extension of the payroll tax cut earlier this year, things got a little heated. Additionally, the prevention fund does not appear to specifically target women\u2019s health, rather, it paints in much broader brushstrokes. As Maloney points out, the preventative measures funded in the health care bill do benefit women and their families.\u000a\u000aBut if Democrats have raided this fund before, and if the fund does not specifically target women\u2019s health programs, can you really call what Republicans did Friday a \u201cwar on women\u201d?

aV(CNN) Three weeks ago, a group of children with disabilities and their parents chartered a bus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and headed to Washington to protest proposed cuts in Medicaid, the government health insurance they all rely on.\u000a\u000aThere was one problem.

When they felt that lawmakers hadn't heard their voices, Lorio's husband, Neal, suggested traveling to Washington.\u000a\u000a"I was like 'ha, ha, ha,' " she said.\u000a\u000aThe next day, Lorio and Michot attended the funeral of a 2-year-old girl, the daughter of one of the Trach Mommas.\u000a\u000aThe day after that, while in church, Lorio heard "that little voice of God" telling her to organize the trip.\u000a\u000a"I was like -- seriously? God, if you want this to happen, you're going to have to do this for us," she said.\u000a\u000aShe never dreamed that Rod Stewart, whose music she'd listened to since she was a little girl, would be the one to step in.\u000a\u000a"It was beyond our wildest dreams -- not just anybody paid for it, but Rod Stewart!" she said.

aVJeffrey Sachs is a university professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) For those with a college degree or above, life is good. Jobs are plentiful, incomes are rising, inflation is low, health is broadly improving, and the impacts of the new information technologies -- from smartphones to e-commerce to ubiquitous information -- are generally beneficent.\u000a\u000aFor those without a college degree, the situation is starkly different. Earnings are low and often lagging behind inflation. Health conditions of less-educated whites have been deteriorating, with rising mortality from suicides, opioid addiction, and other kinds of substance abuse. It may not even pay to work, if the meager take-home pay reduces access to public benefits.\u000a\u000aAt first glance, America's job market is strong. The unemployment rate for July fell to 4.3% The unemployment rate in June was just 4.4%, and non-farm payroll employment rose by 222,000. Yet while the American economy is creating jobs, it is not creating enough good jobs. Solutions will have to go far beyond raising the minimum wage.\u000a\u000aWe can get a sense of the problem by looking not at the unemployment rate but at total employment relative to the total adult population. That ratio in June stood at 60.1%, meaning close to three of every five adults is working, still down sharply from the peak rate of 64.6% in early 2000. Millions of individuals without jobs are not looking for work, and are therefore not counted as unemployed.\u000a\u000aWe can get a sense of who those individuals are by looking at educational attainment. Among individuals whose highest educational attainment is a high school diploma, the employment ratio is only 54.9%. For those with a bachelor's degree or higher, the employment ratio is 72.1%. America's jobs crisis hits lower-skilled workers, essentially those with less than a bachelor's degree.\u000a\u000aWe have become, in effect, two societies, largely divided by educational attainment.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What is the 'real' unemployment rate? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the 'real' unemployment rate? 03:09\u000a\u000aAs has been discussed widely in recent political debates, the loss of employment and relative earnings for less-educated workers results from two related forces: automation and globalization. Machines have increasingly replaced less-skilled jobs in agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, while the remaining labor-intensive operations (such as the cutting and stitching of garments) moved overseas. The trend is, if anything, accelerating: McDonald's has recently announced, for example, a further move to self-serve kiosks\u000a\u000aDonald Trump won the vote of working-class voters in part by promising to bring overseas jobs back to the US, especially manufacturing jobs. This is doomed to fail.\u000a\u000aMost job losses have been due to automation, not outsourcing. Most offshored jobs are not returning. And when production does return, it will be capital intensive, meaning that hundreds of millions of dollars of new factory investments will produce hundreds of jobs , not thousands, in a US workforce of more than 150 million workers.\u000a\u000aThe job growth will continue to be in services, as it has been for a generation, with good jobs going to those with good skills, and low-paying and insecure jobs going to those without them. And with stunning advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics, the prospects for further job losses to the robots will multiply.\u000a\u000aWhat can be done\u000a\u000aOne popular response is to boost the minimum wage. Yet this is a policy tool to be used with caution. Simply declaring a job to be worth $15 an hour doesn't make it so. A recent careful statistical analysis of Seattle's new minimum wage law (rising in two steps to $11 and then $13 an hour) is sobering.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Here's why we get overtime pay Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Here's why we get overtime pay 03:04\u000a\u000aThe study suggests that Seattle suffered a significant loss of jobs at the bottom end of the wage distribution as a result of the boost in minimum wage. This job-loss effect had been rejected in earlier studies of minimum wages, but the Seattle study makes a convincing case that earlier studies that claimed little or no job loss were probably marred by poor data.\u000a\u000aMost Republicans assume that faster economic growth would be enough to boost earnings and employment among low-wage workers. This is naïve. Economic growth boosts the incomes of highly educated workers, not of the majority of young people who do not complete a bachelor's degree. Economic growth is not enough. We need to do three things better.\u000a\u000aFirst, we need to ensure that every child reaches his or her potential in quality education and job skills. Poor children fall behind early, and usually permanently, in America's highly unequal society. The problem is not teachers' unions (the favorite scapegoat of the rich and powerful).\u000a\u000aThe problem is poverty: growing up in households with very few books, often poorly educated and under-employed parents, neighborhood crime and poverty, and often highly unstable family arrangements. Public schools become the recipients of these social catastrophes, not the creators.\u000a\u000aSecond, we need to boost the incomes even of lower-skilled and less-educated workers. This is not so hard to do. The earned-income tax credit -- the federal tax credit for low- and moderate-income people -- should be expanded. Remember, the American economy is richer than ever, though more of the income is concentrated at the top.\u000a\u000aBy taxing those recent gains, and sharing them with lower-skilled workers, all parts of American society can taste the fruits of technological progress. While boosting the minimum wage will reduce work, boosting the EITC will increase it, partly by bringing less-educated people back into the labor market and enabling them to earn a decent wage.\u000a\u000aThird, and more generally, we should distinguish between low market earnings and a decent overall living standard. In northern Europe, governments provide child care, pre-K, public schools, college tuition, and free health care for all, financed out of general tax revenues. In that way, less-skilled workers with lower take-home pay can still have a good living standard.\u000a\u000aIt's similarly time for America, richer than ever in our history, to ensure decent living standards for all Americans, including those with less education, lower skills, and lower earnings.\u000a\u000aThis commentary was updated from an earlier version to include the July employment figures.

It will also house 300 seafront apartments.\u000a\u000aThe second, private island is set to host 14- luxury villas and marina for residents, along with a boutique hotel.\u000a\u000aMarsa Al Arab will add 2,400 hotel rooms to the Jumeirah Group's portfolio. The group is part of Dubai Holding, which is majority-owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai.\u000a\u000aJumeriah Group have experience when it comes to man-made islands. They manage the Burj Al Arab, located 280 meters off Jumeirah Beach on artificial land first constructed in 1994.\u000a\u000aOther artificial islands of grander scale and logistical complexity have followed the Burj, with varying levels of success.\u000a\u000aSea dredgers are used to create Dubai's artificial islands.\u000a\u000aPalm Jumeirah, 9.6-square miles and constructed between 2001 and 2006, is now home to hundreds of family residences and at least two dozen hotels.\u000a\u000aPalm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira are both set to eclipse the Jumeirah, but have suffered setbacks stemming from the global financial crisis of 2008.

Usain Bolt, an eight-time Olympic champion, the fastest man in history, will retire after the IAAF World Championships in London, which run from August 4- 13.\u000a\u000aHe is a sprinter who has broken records and left a legacy.

Known in his early years as a prodigiously talented 200m runner, he burst onto the 100m scene by breaking the world record in New York (9.72) in 2008. Eleven weeks later, in Beijing, he improved on his time, clocking 9.69 as he claimed his first Olympic title.\u000a\u000aHe has dipped under 10 seconds in the sport's blue riband event 50 times -- putting him fourth on the sub-10 seconds all-time list.

aVAlice Stewart is a CNN Political Commentator and former Communications Director for Ted Cruz for President. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.\u000a\u000aNew proposed legislation has shifted the heated immigration debate from discussion of a southern border wall that Mexico was never going to pay for to the Statue of Liberty, and more fundamentally to what our nation stands for. President Donald Trump, along with Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, and David Perdue, R-Georgia, announced details this week of the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act, a plan to slash legal immigration into the United States. Critics argue this flies in the face of Lady Liberty, which serves as a beacon of hope to immigrants arriving from abroad.\u000a\u000aThe RAISE Act aims to reduce the number of low-skilled immigrants who are allotted green cards by 50% and would replace the current employment-based system with a merit-based system grading possible immigrants according to specifics such as education, English-language ability, high-paying job offers, and age.\u000a\u000aDemocrats in Congress dismissed the policy as shameful, disgusting and emblematic of naked intolerance in the White House.\u000a\u000aCNN's Jim Acosta questioned White House Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller about the policy, invoking "The New Colossus," the poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty. Written in 1883, it reads in part , "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free."\u000a\u000aYes, America has an honorable tradition of taking in persecuted people from across the world -- that's what the poem on the Statue of Liberty is all about. We still take in the persecuted under the Refugee Act of 1980, though the RAISE Act would limit the numbers of those admitted. The broader point is this: the RAISE act is not about refugees; it's about immigrants seeking green cards.\u000a\u000aBut our policymakers cannot ignore the reality: legal immigration numbers have shot past historical levels. Liberal elites argue that we should continue to take in the world's poor like we always have; anything less is discriminatory. The problem is that everyone wants to come to the United States. When we have too many people coming into this country who fit the low-skill profile, that hurts low-income, blue-collar people who already live here.\u000a\u000aOur immigration system should attract young and highly skilled people, those who can integrate into American society most effectively, and focus on uniting immediate families, as opposed to extended family members.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aI was born and raised in Sen. Perdue's state of Georgia and lived the last 17 years in Sen. Cotton's state of Arkansas. I have seen what they see: everyday Americans who want to work hard, build wealth, and achieve the American dream. The RAISE Act helps make that possible.\u000a\u000aImmigration is not an entitlement; it's based on hard-fought, well-debated policy. It's time we decide what's best for America today, not what a poem from the late 19th century tells us.

aVYou're going to read this, and you're going to say, how is this about tech? I'm gonna head you off at that pass: This is a message from Internet, the generation that became the voice that set the tone for everything you love about the Net. And it's pissed. -Editor\u000a\u000aEarlier generations have weathered recessions, of course; this stall we're in has the look of something nastier. Social Security and Medicare are going to be diminished, at best. Hours worked are up even as hiring staggers along: Blood from a stone looks to be the normal order of things "going forward," to borrow the business-speak. Economists are warning that even when the economy recuperates, full employment will be lower and growth will be slower-a sad little rhyme that adds up to something decidedly ­unpoetic. A majority of Americans say, for the first time ever, that this generation will not be better off than its parents. \u2014New York Magazine\u000a\u000aGeneration X is sick of your bullshit.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000aThe first generation to do worse than its parents? Please. Been there. Generation X was told that so many times that it can't even read those words without hearing Winona Ryder's voice in its heads. Or maybe it's Ethan Hawke's. Possibly Bridget Fonda's. Generation X is getting older, and can't remember those movies so well anymore. In retrospect, maybe they weren't very good to begin with.\u000a\u000aBut Generation X is tired of your sense of entitlement. Generation X also graduated during a recession. It had even shittier jobs, and actually had to pay for its own music. (At least, when music mattered most to it.) Generation X is used to being fucked over. It lost its meager savings in the dot-com bust. Then came George Bush, and 9/11, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Generation X bore the brunt of all that. And then came the housing crisis.\u000a\u000aGeneration X wasn't surprised. Generation X kind of expected it.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000aGeneration X is a journeyman. It didn't invent hip hop, or punk rock, or even electronica (it's pretty sure those dudes in Kraftwerk are boomers) but it perfected all of them, and made them its own. It didn't invent the Web, but it largely built the damn thing. Generation X gave you Google and Twitter and blogging; Run DMC and Radiohead and Nirvana and Notorious B.I.G. Not that it gets any credit.\u000a\u000aBut that's okay. Generation X is used to being ignored, stuffed between two much larger, much more vocal, demographics. But whatever! Generation X is self-sufficient. It was a latchkey child. Its parents were too busy fulfilling their own personal ambitions to notice any of its trophies-which were admittedly few and far between because they were only awarded for victories, not participation.\u000a\u000aIn fairness, Generation X could use a better spokesperson. Barack Obama is just a little too senior to count among its own, and it has debts older than Mark Zuckerberg. Generation X hasn't had a real voice since Kurt Cobain blew his brains out, Tupac was murdered, Jeff Mangum went crazy, David Foster Wallace hung himself, Jeff Buckley drowned, River Phoenix overdosed, Elliott Smith stabbed himself (twice) in the heart, Axl got fat.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is beyond all that bullshit now. It quit smoking and doing coke a long time ago. It has blood pressure issues and is heavier than it would like to be. It might still take some ecstasy, if it knew where to get some. But probably not. Generation X has to be up really early tomorrow morning.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is tired.\u000a\u000aIt's a parent now, and there's always so damn much to do. Generation X wishes it had better health insurance and a deeper savings account. It wonders where its 30s went. It wonders if it still has time to catch up.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000aRight now, Generation X just wants a beer and to be left alone. It just wants to sit here quietly and think for a minute. Can you just do that, okay? It knows that you are so very special and so very numerous, but can you just leave it alone? Just for a little bit? Just long enough to sneak one last fucking cigarette? No?\u000a\u000aWhatever. It's cool.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is used to disappointments. Generation X knows you didn't even read the whole thing.

aV(CNN) This time last year, CNN Opinion asked a group of commentators from around the world for their take on the US presidential election. One year later, Donald Trump is preparing to be sworn in as President of the United States. So, what is the world expecting -- and hoping for -- from a Trump presidency? Guest commentators from around the world weigh in. The views expressed are their own.\u000a\u000aRussia: A domestic win for Putin\u000a\u000aWhen Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, he received a round of applause in the Russian parliament. It was a pure, almost childish expression of joy.\u000a\u000aSince then, the "Russian factor" has loomed ominously over Trump's impending presidency. The Russian term " kompromat " -- compromising material -- is entering the English language, much like "sputnik" did more than 50 years ago. The American press debates -- in total seriousness -- whether the Kremlin is literally keeping the President of the most powerful country on Earth on its leash and shaping his policies. More importantly, the notorious hacking story is far from over. For many in Washington, Vladimir Putin has become the main trickster of the election.\u000a\u000aHowever, Russian officialdom was hardly expecting a Trump victory. Viewing the American election as a zero-sum game with the West, Putin planned for a likely defeat. Before Election Day, Russia's propaganda machine was warming up to announce that a flawed American political system would never let the anti-establishment candidate win. That was supposed to be Russia's consolation prize.\u000a\u000aThen, defeat suddenly turned into victory. Russia is beyond satisfied with this serendipitous turn of events. A happy and astounded Kremlin will now try to get the most from Trump -- from easing sanctions to making a deal on Syria and settling the Ukraine issue.\u000a\u000aIt is difficult, of course, to predict how Trump's administration will address these issues and what the result will be. But this uncertainty hardly undermines the feeling that Russian officialdom has been experiencing: a sense they have achieved a moral victory over the West and its values.\u000a\u000aSince the annexation of Crimea, the West has labeled Putin a pariah and a global threat. Yet now, Trump's win has made something clear: It is not Putin who is a weak outlier before the world's liberal order. Rather, it is the West that is divided and full of resentment. An outcast yesterday, Putin may now see himself as a major power broker in the emerging global Trumpworld.\u000a\u000aThe least that the Kremlin will now expect from the White House is a display of respect and equality. After what has been presented by Russian propaganda as years of unprecedented humiliation and offense from the West, Putin will easily sell his country's newfound parity with the United States to the Russian public for his own personal gain.\u000a\u000aTransforming Putin's moral triumph into a dramatic expansion of Russian influence on the global stage will be trickier. But from the Kremlin's point of view, it is probably doable.\u000a\u000aMikhail Fishman is editor-in-chief of The Moscow Times.\u000a\u000aMexico: Will Trump really pursue his 'Mexican agenda'?\u000a\u000aAna Maria Salazar\u000a\u000aThroughout his campaign, we all hoped he would tone down such rhetoric so as not to alienate the Hispanic vote (too much, at least). However, his rhetoric simply became more vitriolic -- and more threatening.\u000a\u000aSo President Enrique Peña Nieto invited him to Mexico , perhaps in hopes that the hospitality and reality of bilateral relations would change Donald Trump´s opinion about the southern border (and awkward facts such as there being potentially millions of jobs at stake -- on both sides of the border -- if he decided to scrap NAFTA).\u000a\u000aBut mere hours after returning from Mexico, not only did Trump NOT change his mind, but he engaged ( in Arizona of all places ) in some of his most anti-immigration rhetoric yet. Meanwhile, in Mexico there was a backlash against Peña Nieto's decision to invite Trump, forcing Finance Minister Luis Videgaray -- seen as instrumental in arranging the visit -- out of the Cabinet.\u000a\u000aAs the votes were tallied on election night, there was hope that Trump's rhetoric was campaign garbage and not genuine policy. But in the two months since the election, Trump has reiterated his calls for a wall, insisted that Mexico will reimburse the US for the cost and called for the renegotiation of NAFTA and a border tax for companies that invest in Mexico and wish to send their products to the United States.\u000a\u000aOn the back of all this, the Mexican peso has plunged, and there is concern that on January 20, the least popular person in decades to be sworn in as US President will deliver a speech that could be catastrophic for the Mexican economy.\u000a\u000aSince losing his role at the finance ministry, Luis Videgaray has been appointed foreign minister, and will head negotiations with the United States. Perhaps the President is hoping that Trump will now play and negotiate in an appropriate way. He likely is wrong.\u000a\u000aThrough his threats, tweets, and speeches, Trump may have left the President and his negotiators with no political wiggle room to sign any kind of agreement that requires ratification by the Mexican Senate. And the chances for a candidate from Peña Nieto's party will likely be scuppered in the 2018 presidential elections unless the President can convince Trump not to initiate massive deportations and to stop insisting on building the wall.\u000a\u000aBut if Trump believes his "Mexican agenda" helped get him elected, it is hard to imagine he will do anything but continue to insist on his beautiful wall, deportations and a new and "improved" NAFTA agreement.\u000a\u000aAna Maria Salazar worked at the White House as policy adviser for President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the Americas and was deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug enforcement. She writes, teaches and has anchored radio and TV news programs in Mexico since 2001.\u000a\u000aIsrael: Netanyahu breathes a sigh of relief\u000a\u000aYaakov Katz\u000a\u000aAfter eight years of hostility and tension with President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will let out a huge sigh of relief Friday when Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.\u000a\u000aFor Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition government, Trump's presidency is viewed as a new beginning when it comes to Israeli-US relations. One government minister went so far as to say that Trump's victory in November signals that "the days of the Messiah" have come.\u000a\u000aThat might be a stretch, but for Israel, Trump seems like the antithesis of the outgoing president.\u000a\u000aWhile Obama regularly pressured Israel to stop construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Trump's advisers have said they will not. While Obama refused to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, Trump has said that he will . And while Obama championed the Iran deal that Israel aggressively tried to prevent, Trump has raised the possibility that he will scrap it.\u000a\u000aWhile this all bodes well for the current government in Jerusalem, it remains to be seen what Trump will do when it comes to Israel's ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. Will he follow the longstanding US policy of pushing for a two-state solution or will he offer new options for a resolution?\u000a\u000aWill he stand strong against settlement expansion or will he allow Israeli annexation of settlements as some government ministers are advocating?\u000a\u000aSo far, Trump hasn't said much, although the announcement that his son-in-law Jared Kushner will serve as the president's Middle East envoy seems to indicate that he plans to take on the thorny issue.\u000a\u000aLike other countries in the Middle East, Israel is hoping to see a more engaged America playing an active role in the region. The presence of Russian military forces in Syria, for example, is believed to be directly linked to Obama's decision not to enforce his "red line" on the use of chemical weapons in that ongoing civil war and humanitarian disaster. Leaving a vacuum allowed Russia to enter the country.\u000a\u000aWill Trump re-engage the Middle East or will he prefer to remain on the sidelines and stay away from a region that has for decades frustrated consecutive American presidents?\u000a\u000aStarting on January 20, the world will begin to get some answers.\u000a\u000aYaakov Katz is the editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post and co-author of " Weapon Wizards: How Israel Became a High-Tech Military Superpower ."\u000a\u000aIndia: Did America get its Modi?\u000a\u000aSanjay Kumar\u000a\u000aOn the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, India is experiencing some of the same kind of anxiety it felt when Narendra Modi was about to become the country's prime minister, back in May 2014\u000a\u000aA right-wing Hindu leader with a controversial political past who cultivated an image as an outsider, Modi's rise to power disturbed the existing political equilibrium in the country, and his election brought with it a heightened sense of unpredictability and uncertainty among not just Indians, but overseas as well. Indeed, for many -- particularly the country's liberals -- it took quite some time for the reality of a Modi premiership to sink in.\u000a\u000aA sense of disbelief and uncertainty has gripped many people here again.\u000a\u000aWill the improvement in India-US relations continue with a Trump administration? How will Indians settled and working in the United States be treated? Will the protectionist measures that Trump is talking about impact Indians living abroad? Will such policies affect the outsourcing that keeps so many Indians in India working?\u000a\u000aThese are just some of the questions Indians have. But the questions also extend to international affairs -- how is India going to adjust if Washington decides to revise Obama's policy towards the Middle East and western Asia? Policymakers in New Delhi are already worried, for example, that reimposing sanctions on Iran would impact India's crude oil supply and delay the completion of Chabahar port that will create a new trade route for Afghanistan and drastically alter the trade dynamics in South Asia.\u000a\u000aIn addition, New Delhi is also keenly waiting to see how Trump goes about dealing with Pakistan. Will he continue the old policy of transactional engagement with the Muslim state or take a firm line over its support for terror groups?\u000a\u000aBut there is a more philosophical concern among liberals in India: The potential impact of a close political entente between Modi and Trump. The fear is that the political proximity between the two leaders, who have strong anti-Muslim, anti-minority images, will unleash and strengthen forces inimical to liberal and secular values. Such sentiment is already simmering in India since Modi assumed office in 2014 -- and his presence has contributed to keeping the Indo-Pakistan relationship on tenterhooks.\u000a\u000aMany on the Indian subcontinent see Trump as Modi's alter ego. Closer ties between them might prove to be a double-edged sword for our country.\u000a\u000aSanjay Kumar is a New Delhi-based journalist who writes on national and international issues with particular emphasis on South Asia.\u000a\u000aBritain: Trump creates a stir\u000a\u000aOn Monday, the British people learned that Donald Trump's late mother was an admirer of the British monarchy. "She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, 'cause nobody does that like the English," he told an interviewer\u000a\u000aA family weakness for the British nostalgia industry is unlikely to have much impact on his approval rating among a population deeply concerned about the President-elect's ethics, prejudices and mental stability.\u000a\u000aWhat did get the UK talking was the identity of the interviewer. Michael Gove, who recently left the British Cabinet after losing a leadership election, has returned to his role as a columnist for The Times of London. He remains a prominent figure in Westminster politics and has retained his seat in the House of Commons.\u000a\u000aMeeting with Trump in his capacity as a journalist, Gove is only the latest right-wing figure to irk the British government by flaunting a relationship with the President-elect outside official channels. Prime Minister Theresa May, who clashed frequently with Gove when they were Cabinet colleagues under David Cameron, has made clear that such freelance diplomacy will not hasten his political rehabilitation.\u000a\u000aEven Gove, however, failed to match the stir created when the President-elect was pictured with Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, before he had met representatives of the governing Conservative Party.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump then suggested on Twitter that Farage should be appointed ambassador to Washington, May was furious. In Britain, where ambassadorships are traditionally held by long-serving career diplomats, this was seen as unprecedented interference in the affairs of Her Majesty's Government. The Queen nominally appoints each ambassador and takes a close interest due to her contacts with other heads of state. If Trump shares his mother's fondness for the Queen's ceremonial role in British life, he would be well advised to respect her protocol.\u000a\u000aAs well as securing a scoop for The Times, Gove's main aim in meeting the President-elect will likely have been to impress on him the existence of prominent Brexiteers other than Nigel Farage. Farage has enjoyed high visibility on British TV, his divisive rhetoric delivering strong ratings. Unlike Trump, he has not succeeded in translating that into electoral success, having failed at seven attempts to win a seat in Parliament . He was excluded by the official "Vote Leave" campaign in the UK referendum, run by more mainstream members of the Conservative Party, and campaigned instead with a smaller, unregistered "Leave EU" team dominated by UKIP. The anti-European movement in Britain is riddled with personal divisions; Gove, who played a major role in "Vote Leave", will have bridled at Farage taking credit for the referendum.\u000a\u000aNone of these subtleties are likely to deter the British government from maintaining a formal alliance with the United States as long as it remains a world power. But the President-elect would be wise to avoid playing favorites with squabbling British politicians. Serious concerns remain about the future of the relationship with Britain; elements in the security services are concerned about the legal implications for the " Five-Eyes " intelligence sharing system should Trump authorize the use of torture by their American partners. In Scotland, he has long been an unpopular landlord, indulging in an ongoing feud with the ruling Scottish National Party over environmental and planning issues.\u000a\u000aDiplomacy by Twitter is not the British way. The Queen would not approve.\u000a\u000aKate Maltby is a theater critic for The Times of London and regular broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics. Her website is www.katemaltby.com\u000a\u000aGermany: Will Merkel confront Trump?\u000a\u000aAlmut Möller\u000a\u000aFrom a Berlin perspective, there is a particular irony in the inauguration of Donald Trump as the next US president. Today's Germany in many ways is a product of the post-World War II era in Europe on which the United States has spent so much time and resources over the past decades.\u000a\u000aLocking Germany into a collective European order has been key to pacifying the European continent, and has served Germany particularly well. Indeed, the principles that are so strongly rooted in this country are largely tied to the pacifist attitudes of the German public and a preference for an economic rather than a security role in foreign affairs. There is also a strong reflexive support among Germans for multilateral approaches aimed at building global institutions and international law, as well as for the need for Germany to have a predictable foreign policy.\u000a\u000aBut what Berlin has understood from the President-elect so far is that Donald Trump is not really very interested in any of these principles. Instead, his rhetoric runs counter to some of the most formative instincts of the political elite in Germany -- and of the public at large. The question Germans have now is how Berlin will react once President Trump actually starts to shape politics rather than talking about it?\u000a\u000aAnd there has been plenty in the talk so far to cause concern. For example, just last weekend, Trump gave a major interview with widely read German newspaper BILD Zeitung in which he called into question the role of NATO and the future cohesion of the European Union. Both institutions are fundamental pillars of German foreign policy.\u000a\u000aAngela Merkel gave a first glimpse of her mindset in a news conference with the prime minister of New Zealand in Berlin that same day. "I think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands," she said when asked about Trump's comments. By her usually cautious standards this was another remarkable statement following her initial reaction to Trump's election back in November.\u000a\u000aWhen President Barack Obama gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in the summer of 2013 , he called for an end to German complacency in international affairs. Developments in and around Europe over recent years have already seen a much more active Germany on the European and international stage. Berlin has understood that some of its vital interests -- both in economic and security terms -- have come to be challenged.\u000a\u000aTrump is going to ensure Germany accelerates along this path, a reality that will have major implications for Germany and Europe. Berlin has a realistic understanding of its power, and where the German government has the resources to punch its weight it will attempt to do so.\u000a\u000aBut how willing will Germany be to confront President Trump on fundamental questions over the future of the European and global order? Germany currently holds the G20 presidency. That might give us a sign about how much Merkel is willing to say.\u000a\u000aAlmut Möller is a senior policy fellow and director of the European Council on Foreign Relations' Berlin office.\u000a\u000aChina: Trump should avoid the Taiwan card\u000a\u000aShen Dingli\u000a\u000aWhile the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's incoming administration doesn't bode well for anyone, the instability ahead could begin to recede if the new executive branch is willing to learn and acts sensibly.\u000a\u000aFor instance, Trump has repeatedly demanded "fair trade". No one rejects the idea of fair trade, but if the focus is on "fair" rather than "unfair" trade, then the key issue is who decides what type of trade is fair or otherwise.\u000a\u000aAs long as the United States does not exit the World Trade Organization, America, like any other member of the WTO, is subject to the body's arbitration mechanism to settle trade disputes.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration may renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement or quit the Trans Pacific Partnership, but if it does, it will still be opting for negotiation and bilateral trade agreements with Asia-Pacific nations and other trade partners. In other words, Trump may not be a fan of globalism, but he still subscribes to bilateralism and even internationalism.\u000a\u000aChina, for its part, could well live with a China-US bilateral trade and investment framework, along with a WTO cap. The ongoing negotiation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty is an example. Trump wants "smart" negotiation, to which China has no objection. But if Trump refuses to settle disputes through negotiation, then China won't be happy.\u000a\u000aStill, China is wary of the possibility that the Trump team might try to play the Taiwan card as part of any bargaining. This would be unacceptable -- China may be willing to negotiate or renegotiate over trade, investment and currency levels, but it will in no way be willing to renegotiate the "One China" principle . This is one thing that China will never put up for sale.\u000a\u000aIf the Trump administration can understand this key point quickly, and if it acts in a diplomatic way, then Trump does indeed have a chance to make America truly great again.\u000a\u000aShen Dingli is professor and associate dean at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa: Trump brings a new style\u000a\u000aTinashe Chuchu\u000a\u000aSouth Africans in general were more inclined to support Hillary Clinton for president, but that did not happen. Why the support for Clinton? Because South Africans valued the longstanding relationship that their nation had developed with the Clintons, especially during the Mandela years.\u000a\u000aNow that the election is over and Donald Trump has won, South Africa -- like many other nations -- hopes that it will be able to secure favorable trade relations with the Trump administration. Of course, the signs from the Trump camp suggest that the incoming administration will take a tough stance on trade. And though Trump did not single out South Africa specifically for criticism, he did warn more broadly that deals would need to be rethought because the United States is always losing out on trade agreements.\u000a\u000aAnother issue that might be of interest to South Africans is US immigration policy toward South Africa. Again, Trump warned over the threat posed by certain kinds of immigration, which became a feature of his campaign. If he cracks down it could make it tougher for South Africans wishing to secure a US visa.\u000a\u000aBut it's not all trepidation. Some South Africans admire Trump's apparent success with his own businesses. They hope that he will enjoy similar success running the United States. Indeed, if Trump is successful and the US economy performs well under his presidency, countries like South Africa will likely benefit, too.\u000a\u000aAs John Stremlau, former vice president of the Carter Center, told Africa's News24 , it is still unclear what shape the Trump administration's foreign policy will take. However, as a businessman, it seems that Trump is determined to try his hand at making deals. It will be interesting to see what this new style means for business with Africa.\u000a\u000aTinashe Chuchu is a lecturer in the School of Economic and Business Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.\u000a\u000aEgypt: A lesson for Americans\u000a\u000aAdel Abdel Ghafar\u000a\u000aThe election of Donald Trump was welcome news in Cairo. The US President-elect and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met each other on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting last September. After that meeting, both expressed a mutual admiration for one another. Sisi remarked that Trump would make a strong leader, which Trump reciprocated by praising Sisi as a "fantastic guy." Sisi was reportedly the first Arab leader to congratulate Trump, and recently reportedly stated to the Egyptian press that he knew Trump would win as "his honesty touched the hearts of the American people."\u000a\u000aIt's not hard to imagine why these two men would get along. Both are not particularly fond of protecting human rights, and have demonstrated a deep disdain for the press. They abhor Islamists of all shapes and forms. Neither man handles criticism well, as demonstrated by their emotional outbursts. Both admire Vladimir Putin, who has spent time cultivating them both.\u000a\u000aOverall, they share an identical black and white world view, reminiscent of George W. Bush's "you are either with us or against us." There is no middle way in Trump and Sisi's world; only enemies to be annihilated or friends based on mutual interests.\u000a\u000aWith regards to Egypt and the Middle East, discourse on human rights and democratization will become background noise, as the Trump administration's foreign policy will likely focus on advancing US economic and security interests. Trump and Sisi began collaborating even before the President-elect assumed office: Trump reportedly called on Sisi to withdraw the U.N. resolution against Israeli settlements , which ultimately passed.\u000a\u000aConveniently, the Egyptian media has dropped the commentary from Trump about Muslim bans and registries from its coverage, while equating the President-elect with Sisi; a strongman who will bring stability in an age of turbulence. However, almost three years since Sisi's election, many segments of the Egyptian population feel disappointed in his leadership, as he has failed to bring stability or usher in the era of economic prosperity that he promised.\u000a\u000aGiven time, the American people, like their Egyptian counterparts, are also likely to find themselves profoundly unhappy with their new president.\u000a\u000aAdel Abdel Ghafar is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and the author of " Egyptians in Revolt: The Political Economy of Labor and Student Mobilizations 1919 -2011 ."\u000a\u000aPhilippines: Will Trump challenge Duterte?\u000a\u000aMong Palatino\u000a\u000aConsidering that there are, by some estimates , around 300,000 Filipinos living as undocumented migrants in the United States, the question for many here is whether President Donald Trump will be true to his campaign promise of being tough on illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aAs for the about 3.5 million Filipinos living in the United States , they join other Americans in hoping that the Trump presidency will deliver stable jobs, better health care, and safer communities.\u000a\u000aLike other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines wants to know whether Trump will continue to endorse the rebalancing of American forces toward the Asia-Pacific region. More specifically, Filipinos have two other questions on defense: What will Trump's policy be regarding the maritime dispute in the South China Sea involving China and its smaller neighbors? Will he uphold the mutual defense pact between the Philippines and the United States?\u000a\u000aIt is not only on defense that a Trump presidency raises questions for Filipinos. In terms of his economic program, for example, many wonder whether his vow to protect American businesses will mean less investment in the Philippines and the rest of Asia? They also wonder whether his call for the return of manufacturing and outsourced jobs to the United States will disrupt Asian economies.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, Trump is often compared to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Both are non-traditional politicians who achieved surprising electoral victories despite their controversial, divisive -- sometimes politically incorrect -- views.\u000a\u000aDuterte has frequently criticized the United States for its colonial crimes and political meddling, even making an unprecedented declaration of a "separation" of the Philippines and the United States. President Obama chose to ignore Duterte's rants. Will Trump do the same thing? Will he comment on the alleged American plot to destabilize Duterte's government\u000a\u000aBoth are interesting questions. But perhaps the biggest question mark is over whether Donald Trump will raise the issue of human rights with Duterte, whose war on drugs has, by many accounts, left thousands of civilians dead.\u000a\u000aFilipinos are extremely curious to find out what happens next.\u000a\u000aMong Palatino is a Filipino activist, blogger, and former legislator.

aV(CNN) At 91, Queen Elizabeth II of England is the longest-serving monarch in British history, having celebrated 65 years on the throne this year. A glance at her calendar is like entering a Jane Austen novel -- with a multitasking heroine. Her list of duties includes attending banquets and jubilees, appointing officials to obscure high offices, and receiving and entertaining visitors including assorted ambassadors, archbishops, ministers, generals, chiefs of state and various excellencies.\u000a\u000aThe Queen's hectic schedule demands equal amounts of polite conversation and extravagant dining. So how does she stay healthy and fit?\u000a\u000a"The queen's not really bothered about food. All she cares about are horses and dogs," said her former chef Darren McGrady, who worked for Elizabeth and her family from 1982 through 1993.\u000a\u000aIn fact, he says he is often asked why the Queen doesn't "get big from eating all that opulent food": five-course banquets of dishes with heavy sauces and elaborate mousses, followed by the inevitable glace ice cream.\u000a\u000aThe nights when she's on her own, she'll stick to grilled or poached fish with some vegetables and salad, but no potatoes or starch.\u000a\u000a"That's it. That's all she has," he said. "She's very disciplined like that. She could have anything she wanted, but it is that discipline that keeps her so well and so healthy."\u000a\u000aThe Queen's simply the kind of person who eats to live rather than living to eat, adds McGrady, and proof can be found in the kitchen itself.\u000a\u000a"The chefs and food and kitchens come last. They're still using pots and pans from the 1800s, with the Queen Victoria stamp on them, at Buckingam Palace," he said. While working at the palace, he would ask the Royals, "Don't you want some new pots and pans?"\u000a\u000a"No, no, no, we need the money to buy horses and saddles," he'd be told.\u000a\u000aNot your average chocoholic\u000a\u000a"The queen loves to eat food from the estate," said McGrady, who worked at the five-star Savoy Hotel in London before getting his gig at Buckingham Palace. Home-grown vegetables, fish, pheasant, anything off the various estates -- Balmoral, Buckingham and Windsor Palaces -- is what the Queen enjoys most.\u000a\u000a"She's also a chocoholic," he confided. "It has to be the dark chocolate, the darker the better. She wasn't keen on milk chocolate or white chocolate."\u000a\u000aDoes she exercise? McGrady laughs at the question.\u000a\u000a"I don't think she has a weight room at Buckingham Palace, but she loves horse-riding and walking the dogs," he said. "She's 91 years young, and she still goes horse riding. She'll walk for miles with the dogs or just around the gardens at Buckingham Palace."\u000a\u000aAs for her drinking, McGrady mentions all the "silly little pieces in the papers" in which he's quoted as saying she has four drinks a day.\u000a\u000a"She'd be pickled if she drank that much," he said. "All I said was she likes a gin and Dubonnet. That's her favorite drink."\u000a\u000aIt's obvious how this mistaken impression came about, he said: his accent, his swift way of speaking and an imperfect phone connection. The Queen doesn't have "gin in the morning," as some reported, but "gin and Dubonnet" (a spiced aperitif, pronounced doo-BON-ay).\u000a\u000a"She doesn't wake up in the morning and have a large gin and tonic," McGrady said, adding that when she does splurge on a glass of wine with dinner -- and this is not a nightly event, he emphasizes -- it will usually be a favorite German sweet wine. "Just in the evening," he added. "She certainly doesn't drink four glasses a day."\u000a\u000aThough each has different tastes, the Royals are generally a healthy bunch. "The thing with Prince Philip is, he's sort of into healthy eating, too," McGrady said, describing the Queen's husband as "very military."\u000a\u000aMcGrady remembers Philip coming into the kitchen one day and asking about dinner. When McGrady opened the fridge, he saw the lamb chops prepared for the staff.\u000a\u000a"'Can't we have those?' " Philip asked. "He wanted the staff food for dinner. He was more a Navy man."\u000a\u000aElizabeth and Philip's eldest son, Prince Charles, "was organic before organic was even invented," McGrady said. Each Christmas, the royal kitchen would get a gift from the luxury department store Harrods, a hamper of food filled with treats. One year, Prince Philip came into the kitchen and saw two hampers. He eagerly opened one, asking whether it was the Harrods' hamper.\u000a\u000a"Actually, no, Your Highness, this is a hamper from the Prince of Wales," responded McGrady. Seeing plums and vegetables and mushrooms, Prince Philip "slammed the lid down -- 'It's bloody organic' -- and he walked off," said McGrady.\u000a\u000aWorking for the princess\u000a\u000aAfter Charles separated from Princess Diana, McGrady went to work for the princess, who had struggled with bulimia.\u000a\u000aMcGrady was still cooking "crazy" opulent meals when he joined her household in 1993. "She said, 'Darren, I'm eating healthy' -- and she was patron of 119 charities at the time -- 'you take care of all of the fats in the kitchen, and I'll take care of the carbs at the gym.'\u000a\u000a"All my recipes changed when I moved to Princess Diana," he said. He learned to cut back on calories and fat; her preferences included stuffed vegetables. "She'd never eat red meat; she'd only eat chicken or fish," McGrady said.\u000a\u000aHe speaks of Diana with nostalgia and sadness. They met during the 11 "incredible years" he worked for the Queen, and then he worked for the princess until her death in 1997.\u000a\u000aThe night of the deadly car accident, "I went to bed, and I had the food for dinner the next day for her return," he said. "It was awful, awful, that next week.\u000a\u000a"It was all surreal: going into the garden and seeing the flowers getting higher and higher and all the people and being at the funeral. The whole week was just a daze."\u000a\u000aPrincess Diana inspired McGrady to leave England and come to America, where he continues to work as a chef and caterer in Dallas.\u000a\u000aShe is also why he donated the advances and royalties from his first cookbook, " Eating Royally: Recipes and Remembrances from a Palace Kitchen ," to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\u000a\u000a"Princess Diana inspired millions of people around the world, and she really did me, and in the years I worked for her, I saw the difference she made in people's lives," McGrady said.\u000a\u000aOne special memory: the day after the 1997 Christie's auction of Princess Diana's clothing in New York.\u000a\u000a"The princess came into the kitchen; she was just wearing a white towel and robe. She'd just come out of the shower. Her hair was ruffled, and she just looked stunningly beautiful naturally," McGrady said. Pointing to a piece of paper, she said, "Darren, look at how much money I made for charity just by selling a few of my old dresses." She'd raised about $2 million to fight AIDS and breast cancer, McGrady said.\u000a\u000aSo when he wrote "Eating Royally," he imagined meeting the princess again and saying, "Your Royal Highness, look at how much money I made for charity just by selling a few of my old recipes."\u000a\u000a"My second book, I have to confess -- that one I am donating to my children's college fund," McGrady said. "The Royal Chef at Home," featuring his own versions of American classics, will be published in September.\u000a\u000aEven after 20 years of assimilating to distinctly American tastes, his memories of the Queen remain fond.\u000a\u000a"It always made me laugh that, you know, one day, the Queen would be at an estate banquet, and she'd be eating off Meissen china from the late 1800s, beautiful hand-painted Meissen china, with gold and silver gilt knives and forks," McGrady said. Another day, she would eat from "a fruit dish -- it was a marble bowl with three horses in gold raised up, holding it, and they're encrusted in diamonds, rubies, sapphires." The gift from the Emir of Bahrain was valued at 50,000 pounds at the time, he said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"The next day, she'd be at Balmoral, and she'd be on the estate out in the hills, and she'd be eating lunch out of a Tupperware container," McGrady said. "One day they're normal; one day they're royal."

aVJohn B. King Jr . is a former secretary of education for the Obama administration and president and CEO at The Education Trust. Jidenna is a recording artist and producer. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\u000a\u000a(CNN) All too often, "A dream deferred is a dream denied." Langston Hughes challenged us with this reality through his poem , "Harlem," more than 60 years ago. Poets can speak truth in a time of struggle. Poets also can be prophets in verse.\u000a\u000aToday, the American dream remains out of reach for far too many people -- and far too often, it is people of color who still have to fight the hardest to achieve it because of systemic biases, structural obstacles and inequalities in opportunity.\u000a\u000aThe promise of America is that through hard work, perseverance and a good education everyone can get ahead, land a good job, provide for their families and lead successful lives. Our nation's history is the story of that promise being made more real -- in painful fits and starts -- for an ever-widening circle of Americans.\u000a\u000aFrom the Civil War to the civil rights movement, from the women's suffrage movement to the continuing fight for equal pay for equal work, progress has been far too slow, but it has been real.\u000a\u000aToday, the American dream needs people to stand up in its defense, especially because of what feels like a daily assault.\u000a\u000aWe need action.\u000a\u000aWe need action in matters of life and death, including the senseless killings of Tamir Rice and Philando Castile. And we need action in matters that affect millions of lives, including the reckless rollbacks on civil rights and harmful cuts to vital programs by the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump proposes eliminating after-school program Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump proposes eliminating after-school program 02:41\u000a\u000aWe need action when the 45th President proposes to reduce federal funding for education by more than 13% (about $10 billion). We need action when the administration attempts to raid nearly $4 billion in reserves from Pell Grants (federal financial aid for low-income students to attend college). And we need action when the safety net for low-income families across the nation could be slashed through proposals that would cut support for housing, public transportation and health care.\u000a\u000aWe are speaking out now because it is beyond time that we stand up against this senseless assault on the American dream, especially for young people of color.\u000a\u000aSadly, we know that the Trump administration's proposals will exacerbate inequities that already exist.\u000a\u000aAfrican-Americans and Latinos are significantly overrepresented among the poor in our country. Black and Hispanic families have less than one-tenth of the household wealth of white families in America . And the Urban Institute notes that young men and boys of color are twice as likely to grow up in poverty as their white counterparts.\u000a\u000aOver the last few decades, many states have increased their investments in locking people up faster than in lifting them up through education. In fact, some states have increased spending on jails at five times the rate of increase in spending on public schools, contributing to a school-to-prison pipeline that disproportionately funnels youth of color into our criminal justice system.\u000a\u000aAnd while 63% of white students who begin college complete college within six years , just over half of Latino students and only 40% of black students do. These gaps in college completion affect job prospects. The unemployment rate for African-Americans is nearly double the rate for whites, and a persistent gap remains between whites and Latinos.\u000a\u000aAll of these numbers add up to lost potential. And they represent troubling inequities in our systems and society that are drawn along lines of race and class.\u000a\u000aRecently, people across the country have been voicing their concerns on these issues and more by marching in the streets. But protest by itself -- while critically important -- isn't a guarantee of progress. We also need solutions.\u000a\u000aThe real resistance is in the daily fight for equity and opportunity for all, in building a movement to put kids and communities first, and in pulling the disenfranchised up, rather than pushing them down and to the margins.\u000a\u000aWe write this piece to call for action on behalf of our children, so they can build a better future for themselves and future generations. It is simply not enough to shout about the problem.\u000a\u000aTo be true advocates, yes, we have to show up on the streets of Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, New York or Washington, D.C. We also have to sit down at community meetings in rural New Mexico or Alabama. We have to run for that open school board seat in our town. And we have to realize how important it is to vote -- not just every four years in a presidential election, but in contests that decide who represents us in city hall, the state house, and Congress.\u000a\u000aOne way to make change, especially for our youth, is to get involved in schools. Consider becoming a teacher --especially for people of color, who represent just 18% of the teaching force when the majority of students in our nation's public schools are students of color.\u000a\u000aAs exciting as it is to aspire to be the next hip-hop king or basketball MVP, we need more educators of color. A recent study by Johns Hopkins University finds that having a black teacher for just one year is associated with a nearly 30% reduction in the risk of a black student dropping out.\u000a\u000aTeachers can make all the difference in a kid's life. Our lives are proof.\u000a\u000aWe both experienced challenges when we were young. One of us is an immigrant from Nigeria who encountered racism on his first day of school in the United States, but who was supported by educators and ultimately became a teacher himself, while working to pursue a music career. And one of us is an African-American and Latino from Brooklyn, who lost both of his parents to illness by the time he was 12 years old and was kicked out of high school -- but his teachers stepped in to save his life.\u000a\u000aBecause of our own experiences as educators, we understand that when kids are kicked out of school, they can be made to feel like they are less than their classmates or that their lives don't matter.\u000a\u000aThis is an experience that our young people of color face much more often than their peers. In fact, Black babies as young as 4 years old make up just 18% of the preschoolers in our country, but 48% of preschool children suspended more than once. And 1.6 million students -- predominately those in low-income areas -- attend school where there is a sworn law enforcement officer, but no school counselor.\u000a\u000aDespite this, we are hopeful.\u000a\u000aThat immigrant kid who struggled? He went on to become a successful musical artist and activist. And that kid who lost his parents and was kicked out of high school? He became a teacher, too, served as President Obama's secretary of education, and now is an advocate fighting every day for equal rights for all kids.\u000a\u000aStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media.

We must show young people that they matter, that we believe in them and their potential.\u000a\u000aIt's time to defend the American dream and not defer it for any of our children.

aV(CNN) In New Delhi, the heat is oppressive, with burning pyres of rubbish assaulting your nose. In São Paulo and Beijing, thick smog shrouds the city and stings your eyes. In London, the diesel engines of black cabs have become the ambient background noise of the capital. Yet on the quiet shores of Norway's Tautra island, the air is clean and delicately perfumed with pine.\u000a\u000aThese locales are central to British artist Michael Pinsky's new work. For "Pollution Pods," Pinsky has painstakingly recreated the air quality, smell and temperature of each one in a series of connected domes, now on display in the Norwegian city of Trondheim. Until July 7, visitors to Pinsky's highly sensory installation will go on a virtual trip around the world -- so long as they sign the health disclaimer beforehand.\u000a\u000aThe shape of Pinsky's pollution pods is an ode to Buckminster Fuller, the celebrated architect who pioneered the geodesic dome and wrote extensively about climate change. It is also a nod to the efforts of the Italian architect Paolo Soleri, who attempted to create an eco-utopian city in the Arizona desert in the 1970s.\u000a\u000aThe installation is the apex of Climart , a four-year scientific project that aims to uncover whether visual art can change people's perceptions around climate change. Conducted by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the venture needed an artwork to rigorously study, and chose Pinsky's proposal out of 120 global submissions.\u000a\u000aThe constructed "Pollution Pods" in Trondheim, Norway\u000a\u000aVisitors to Pinsky's installation will complete extensive surveys, the results of which will be analyzed and contributed to a paper that will be published this December to conclude the research.\u000a\u000a"My job is to do an artwork in the way I always do and not to alter it because of the study, otherwise it makes the study unsound," said Pinsky, who was privy to more two years' worth of Climart's research.\u000a\u000aThe artist as agitator\u000a\u000aPhotos: Beautiful creations made of unexpected materials Ink made from soot \u2013 India-based Graviky Labs uses polluted air to create paint and ink.

Hide Caption 13 of 13\u000a\u000aBy posing challenging and often controversial questions through their work, artists have often been the left-field propagators of wider social and political change. Pinsky himself identifies as one such figure.\u000a\u000a"My work has always been quite political," he said. "My primary objective is about pushing the boundaries of what art can do and how it functions on a political, intellectual and aesthetic level."\u000a\u000aThe Climart team came to him with data they'd collected from studying audience responses to more than 37 environmentally conscious artworks during the 2015 ArtCOP festival in Paris. The team went so far as to measure the electrical brain activity of a select handful of participants.\u000a\u000aOver the course of his work, Christian A. Klöckner, the environmental psychologist heading Climart, has discovered that Pinsky is part of a wider global movement.\u000a\u000a"So far in our studies, we have found that artists are increasingly responding to the threat of climate change within their work. What we expect to see in this project is that art, which is less dogmatic than scientific texts or political discussion, speaks to people on a more emotional level," he said.\u000a\u000aWhether art can actively elicit change remains to be seen. But with the continued threat of climate change, and the US expected to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, Klöckner and Pinsky's project will at the very least, spark crucial debate. For Klöckner, it's a humble start for a much bigger mission.\u000a\u000a"The most important thing in this project is to understand whether art can change the behavior of people and perhaps, from our studies, artists will take up our ideas and use them in the creation of new art pieces," he said.

aVOn the eve of that historic landmark, India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru gave a speech for the ages. India had redeemed its "tryst with destiny," he declared, "to awake to life and freedom."\u000a\u000aNehru's mood that day was triumphant. "The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity," he said.\u000a\u000aYet he was also mindful of the challenges ahead. "Freedom and power bring responsibility ... the future is not one of ease or resting, but of incessant striving."\u000a\u000aHistorians debate and judge India's past. I think it's more fruitful to look to the future. As the writer R. K. Narayan said, "India just goes on." But where to? What will the country look like in the next 70 years?\u000a\u000aIndia in 2087 will not only be the world's biggest democracy, it will also overtake China to be the world's most populous country. The United Nations projects that India will have between 1.5 to 1.6 billion people seven decades from now, adding 300 million inhabitants to its 2017 population. Incredibly, those numbers will represent a decline: India would have peaked with a population of 1.65 billion in the 2050s before tapering off.\u000a\u000aBy comparison China will only have 1.1 billion people in the 2080s, having peaked at 1.45 billion in 2030. The country most likely to rival India in terms of population will be Nigeria, which is projected to swell dramatically from its current strength of 186 million to a billion inhabitants.\u000a\u000aThe world in seventy years will look more Indian and more African.\u000a\u000aIndia will also look richer. According to 'The World in 2050,' a report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, India's gross domestic product in purchasing parity terms is expected to overtake the United States by 2040. (China is already #1). India will emerge as one of the world's greatest consumers.\u000a\u000aStrides will be made on several crucial indicators. Take illiteracy, for example. The country's 2011 census recorded 273 million citizens who were unable to read and write , representing 26% of the population. This may sound abysmal -- and it is -- but it represents a great improvement. 35% of Indians were illiterate in 2001, and 48% fell into that category in 1991.\u000a\u000aThe improvements on literacy look set to continue. Between 2003 and 2013, for example, the percentage of schools with toilets grew from 40% to 84%, while the institutions with electricity jumped from 20% to 45%. School enrollment reached 96.7%, suggesting that within a couple generations, illiteracy could finally be a thing of the past.\u000a\u000aOr consider poverty. For all the doom and gloom that seems to envelop the world in 2017, World Bank figures show 250,000 people are lifted from extreme poverty every single day. A significant portion of this number comes from India. According to the World Bank, again, 46% of Indians were making less than $1.90 a day in 1993 . The ratio fell to 38% in 2004, and 21% by 2011. These trends are almost certain to continue.\u000a\u000aLook at disease and healthcare. In 1960, the average life expectancy in India was just 41 years. Back then, the average American could expect to live past 67. Today, Indians can expect to live to 69, and Americans to 79. Thanks to massive improvements in hygiene, medicine, and health care, Indians are now living nearly as long as people in the West. The next 70 years will see a continuation of this trend, as access to drugs and technology continue to be globalized.\u000a\u000aToday, only a third of Indians use the internet, compared to 90% of Americans. This too will change. Thanks to a boom in cheap smartphones and mobile data, more than a billion Indians are projected to be online by 2025, representing about 75% of the country's population. Over time, this will have transformational impacts for Indians on a range of issues from education to efficiency, commerce to communication.\u000a\u000aBut it's not all good news. While Indians in 70 years will undoubtedly be more literate, richer, healthier, and have more access to global technologies, India will also inherit some of the West's biggest headaches.\u000a\u000aIndian policymakers have long gotten used to a 'demographic dividend' of young people. But what happens when the 600 million Indians currently under the age of 28 reach retirement age? Who will support them? This is all the more worrying given India's inability to create enough jobs.\u000a\u000aWill the traditional Indian model of older people living with their sons and daughters continue, or will India need to build homes for the elderly? Who pays for these homes, and the attendant costs in health care and pensions? What happens to India's growth rate with fewer working age men and women, and a higher proportion of people to support?\u000a\u000aAlso on demographics, will India be able to reverse its skewed sex ratio? The early evidence suggests things will actually get worse. India currently has 943 women for every 1000 men \u2014a product of decades of sex selection and abortions, as families vastly preferred baby boys over girls. An even more troubling statistic is that India has a child sex ratio of 919, which means only 919 baby girls for every 1000 baby boys. A skewed gender ratio is baked into India's future. It's a man-made disaster -- literally and figuratively -- that could bring anything from social breakdown to anarchy.\u000a\u000aWhat about climate change? Undoubtedly, one of the dominant themes of the latter 21st century will be how a warming planet wreaks havoc on human civilization. How will India cope? What measures will New Delhi manage to put in place? India has belatedly emerged as a champion of promoting solar energy and is on track to meet its 2030 Paris Agreement commitments. Yet even those measures may not be enough. A new study in the magazine Science Advances predicts that a cocktail of heat and humidity will cause deadly heat waves in South Asia before the end of this century, potentially impacting millions.\u000a\u000aWhat about communal harmony? The Pew Research Forum estimates that by 2050 India will have the largest Muslim population in the world, surpassing even Indonesia. And yet, as I write this column, India has been witnessing a clear, creeping trend of polarization between Hindus and Muslims, with scarcely believable cases of lynchings and mob violence . How will India come to terms with the reality that it is set to be the biggest home of Islam?\u000a\u000aThen there is foreign policy. Nehru famously set a tone for India in the 1950s and 60s of being "non-aligned" with the great powers. As India has gotten more powerful, this ideology has been abandoned. In 2016, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn't even bother to maintain the pretence of attending the Non-Aligned summit. Instead, India has gotten closer to the United States and Japan, and seems to be tussling with its bigger neighbor China. Will this be the new Great Game of the 21st century? If current trends continue, India in 70 years will be at its most globally influential point since the Middle Ages. What will that mean for global culture, for the struggle for resources and power?\u000a\u000aAnd what of human rights? Will India keep on being a home to the Dalai Lama and Tibetan refugees? Will India speak up on regional atrocities? Indeed, will India speak up on the atrocities within in its own borders, from the skirmishes and internet shutdowns in Kashmir to the mutinous parts of its restive northeast?\u000a\u000aMore questions than answers, of course. But these are all important questions for a still-young democracy to ponder as it embarks on another seven-decade period of growth. Nehru's words remain just as valuable: "freedom and power bring responsibility."\u000a\u000aIf the first 70 years of India's freedom were about survival, the next 70 should be about putting its strengths to good use for the world at large. That would be India's real tryst with destiny.

aV(CNN) In the summer of 1987, I was a teenage golfer in love with the sport. I had no desire to be a great golfer, but I was besotted with the whole sport; the players, the history, the records and the magic.\u000a\u000aThe players themselves were a particular fascination, and the great writing that shone a light on how these amazing men and women dared to dream big, and win on the biggest stages.\u000a\u000aThat summer stood out, with the incredible achievements of two English golfers; Laura Davies' win in the US Women's Open and then the colossal achievement of Nick Faldo, in reeling off 18 consecutive pars, in the mists of Scotland's Muirfield, to win the biggest title of all: the Open Championship.\u000a\u000aIt was comic book stuff. I'd attended my first Irish Open a few weeks prior, and was transfixed by the golf of Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam and Faldo. These guys were giants. Faldo's story, however, held a particular allure.\u000a\u000aHe had come back into the limelight that year with a victory in the Spanish Open. All the talk was about how he had completely re-modeled his swing, taking almost two years to perfect a movement that could withstand intense sporting pressure.\u000a\u000aFaldo had been mocked for his efforts. Fellow pros and various commentators thought it ludicrous that he could give up what was considered a beautiful swing.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Golf's past & present: Fitzpatrick, Jutanugarn Replay More Videos ...

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge impact on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000aHumans never have lived on a planet that's 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels, in the late 1800s, and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2-degree mark.\u000a\u000a"This is gambling with the planet," said Gernot Wagner , the lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of the book "Climate Shock."\u000a\u000aThink super droughts, rising seas and mass extinctions.\u000a\u000aYet for all of its importance, I don't think the 2-degree threshold is as famous as it should be. I've heard it referred to as the "north star" for climate negotiations. Meaning: This one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world's attention.\u000a\u000aIt's so significant that it's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year. I'm calling that effort "2 degrees," and I need your help to make it work.\u000a\u000aUntil 5 p.m. ET Monday, you can vote on the first story I'll report for the series.\u000a\u000aTell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees Posted by CNN on Tuesday, April 21, 2015\u000a\u000aAll of those story ideas came from you, by the way.\u000a\u000aThey focus on what a 2-degree world might look like.\u000a\u000aCNN kicked off this effort with a Facebook chat last week. We asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2-degree threshold, specifically.\u000a\u000aI don't have all the answers right now. We'll continue to explore the importance of this number together. But below you'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number. Many of them come straight from you, the readers. And I tossed in a couple of my own.\u000a\u000aIf you'd like to follow this project as it evolves, I'd encourage you to sign up for the "2 degrees" newsletter . And feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below. They'll shape the way I spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number.\u000a\u000a1. Where did the idea for 2 degrees come from?\u000a\u000aOne guy, it turns out. William Nordhaus , an economist at Yale.\u000a\u000aNordhaus, 73, proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 (1977!) paper titled " Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem ."\u000a\u000aThe estimate was "crude, but it was a reasonable first start," he told me.\u000a\u000a"If there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years," he wrote in "The Climate Casino."\u000a\u000aA growing body of research now supports the idea.\u000a\u000a2. How did 2 degrees become the international standard?\u000a\u000aScience has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming. And that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want.\u000a\u000a"You need a judgment call for these things," said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, who has written on the history of 2 degrees Celsius. "And this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy."\u000a\u000aGermany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal, Jaeger told me. That happened in the 1990s. Later came the European Commission , the G8 , the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most significantly, the Copenhagen Accord , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much.\u000a\u000aThe United States was among the signatories\u000a\u000a3. What would the world look like at 2 degrees?\u000a\u000aI'm going to spend the month of May exploring this question, so look for more on this. But here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like. These are pulled from reports by the National Research Council , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Bank\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.\u000a\u000a\u2022 A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates\u000a\u000a\u2022 The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.\u000a\u000a\u2022 The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%. \u2022 Wildfires in the United States are expected to increase 400% to 800% in size.\u2022 Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.\u2022 A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates 20% to 30% of animals and plants species will be at "increasingly high risk of extinction" at or near the 2-degree mark.\u2022 The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.\u2022 Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.\u2022 The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%.\u000a\u000aSo ... not good.\u000a\u000aAnd numbers don't convey the emotional toll.\u000a\u000a"I'm from New Mexico," said Nordhaus, the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold. "I love it there, and I know it's going to be a completely different climate. The trout fishing probably won't be as good. The hiking won't be as good. These forests may look completely different, or burn down. I love to ski. It's one of my things I love most. And that's obviously affected by warming. I love the ocean, and the New England coastline, and it's in peril. That's just for starters."\u000a\u000a4. What happens at 2.1 degrees?\u000a\u000aNo one knows, exactly. Think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking. How many cigarettes give you cancer? No one knows, exactly. But the more you smoke, the more you up your risk. And 2 degrees, policy experts agree, is certainly risky territory.\u000a\u000aPlus, everyone hates a fraction.\u000a\u000aTargeting 1 degree of warming is "ridiculous because you can't do it," said Nordhaus, the economist. "Three sounds too high. And you can't have a fraction because it's too complicated.\u000a\u000a"So two is kind of an obvious number."\u000a\u000a5. How much has the climate warmed already?\u000a\u000aThe climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the Industrial Revolution . And we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we're already putting into the atmosphere, even with "very ambitious mitigation action" to reduce carbon emissions, according to a 2014 report from the World Bank. Some of that warming is "locked-in to the Earth's atmospheric system," that organization says. The impacts of climate change already are being felt.\u000a\u000a6. Is it possible to stay below 2 degrees?\u000a\u000aYes, but it won't be easy.\u000a\u000a"If you want to stay below 2 degrees, you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree," said Jaeger from the Global Climate Forum.\u000a\u000aHere's the best guess for what that "amazing speed" might need to look like: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80% to 90% by 2050, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. "It depends on how much risk you want to accept," she said. Some activists, including those from 350.org and Avaaz, which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in New York , want to accept less risk than that.\u000a\u000a"Our position is 100% clean energy," said David Sievers, a senior campaigner for Avaaz.\u000a\u000a7. What happens if we don't take action?\u000a\u000aSome writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target, saying it's too ambitious, or even naive. But we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that "north star" to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem.\u000a\u000aIf you think 2 degrees sounds bad, 5 degrees is far, far worse.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by "major extinctions around the globe" and a "reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide." Just beyond that, at 6 degrees, we're looking a "catastro-f***" that would be almost "infinitely costly," said Wagner, the Environmental Defense Fund economist. "It's akin to killing the planet, basically. Or society on the planet."\u000a\u000aThis much should be clear: Something has to change.\u000a\u000aIf we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3, that's still better (or less awful) than 5 or 6. What's important is that we maintain a sense of urgency, and keep sight of the goal.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Melting polar ice caps \u2013 The consequences of climate change go far beyond warming temperatures, which scientists say are melting the polar ice caps and raising sea levels.

aVMark Preston is CNN's executive director of political programming and senior political analyst. He hosts "Full Stop with Mark Preston" on SiriusXM POTUS 124. The full interview can be heard on Saturday at 12 p.m. ET, Sunday at 1 a.m. ET, and Sunday at 5 p.m. ET. Follow him at @prestonCNN .\u000a\u000a(CNN) Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed several elected Republicans publicly rebuke President Donald Trump or outright oppose him on matters ranging from Russia and health care to chaos in the West Wing.\u000a\u000aWhile there was scattered GOP criticism of Trump in the first six months of his presidency, more and more Republicans appear to be reaching a breaking point with the head of their party -- aggravated over the lack of leadership coming from the White House and weary about having to answer day in and day out for the President's questionable actions and comments.\u000a\u000a"We saw in the most substantive way the rebuke of the President with the Russian sanctions vote, which was unanimous in the Republican Party," said Tim Miller, a Republican operative and Trump critic, to me in an interview. "I wish there was even greater vocal opposition, but I am encouraged by the recent changing of the tides and believe that unless there is a drastic change in behavior out of the White House you will see more and more Republican elected officials speak out against the President."\u000a\u000aBut distancing yourself from the President, let alone openly criticizing him, is a tricky thing to do for a congressional Republican, particularly when Trump maintains a 76% approval rating among self-identified GOP voters. And the President has made clear he is willing to support primary challengers to Republican incumbents who don't support his agenda.\u000a\u000aThe severity of criticism directed at Trump has ranged from full-throated condemnation by Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, to a seemingly frustrated Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, who told CNN he wants Trump "to be successful because I believe in his policies he ran on and won on. But it is hard when there is so much chaos and confusion."\u000a\u000aStill, it is not just the West Wing drama that has caused Republicans to split with the President; there are also sharp disagreements on some of his signature policy promises.\u000a\u000aFor Rep. Will Hurd, it was Trump's vow to build a wall along the US-Mexico border that prompted the Texas Republican to reiterate his opposition to the proposal just days into the Trump presidency. And, in May, Hurd was one of 20 Republicans to vote against the House GOP leadership's health care bill.\u000a\u000aOpposing the President and your party leadership is a lonely place to be, but Hurd, a former spy, shrugged it off in a recent interview on SiriusXM's "Full Stop with Mark Preston."\u000a\u000a"I follow very simple principles," Hurd said. "I agree when I agree ... and I disagree when I disagree. You know, I did that in the last administration and I am going to continue to do that here. Be honest, tell people what you're doing, and why you're doing it and people appreciate that."\u000a\u000aHurd is not your stereotypical congressman. He is not a lawyer, a former state senator or a business tycoon. The Texas Republican cut his teeth on the streets of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan as a CIA operative. Hurd was a "spy master": Essentially he "ran spies" in each of these countries, but is careful not to discuss too much about his previous employment.\u000a\u000a"I was the guy that was collecting intelligence from individuals that were helping the United States with our threats overseas," he said.\u000a\u000aEngaging in legislative battles on Capitol Hill or fighting for his political life every two years seems trite given what Hurd saw during his time in the CIA and growing up in South Texas, the son of a black father and white mother in the late 1970s/1980s.\u000a\u000aThe latter, Hurd said, helped him develop an understanding, a compassion for other people that has proven valuable in his professional life.\u000a\u000a"For me growing up ... I was the only person that looked like me," Hurd said. "And it made us a very close-knit family. It also taught me empathy. Also ... I had a big head as a kid. I had a speech impediment. I had messed up teeth. My last name rhymes with funny things, and it was something that I got picked on a lot and ... it made me realize 'Hey, the only thing that matters is what the people that you love think about you.' "\u000a\u000aHurd, many Republicans say, is positioned to be an influential voice in the Republican Party, as he checks several key boxes: He is one of only three black Republicans serving in Congress; he's a national security expert; he won twice in a congressional district that arguably should be a Democratic seat given its largely Hispanic demographic; and he possess a political touch that is welcoming, not off-putting.\u000a\u000aPolitico wrote a story earlier this year titled "Will Hurd Is the Future of the GOP. *If he can hold onto the toughest seat in Texas." Last year, The Daily Dot described Hurd as "the most interesting man in Congress."\u000a\u000aHeading into 2018, Hurd, again, is being targeted by Democrats who see his seat as a very viable pickup opportunity. Nathan Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan Inside Elections newsletter, rates the Hurd race as a tossup.\u000a\u000aIf Hurd is to be the "Future of the GOP" he will need to win a third time in a congressional district and a state that is trending Democratic.\u000a\u000aBelow are some of the highlights of my interview with Rep. Hurd. (This Q&A has been edited for brevity, clarity and flow).\u000a\u000aFrom spy ...\u000a\u000aMark Preston: Let's talk about how you got into the CIA.\u000a\u000aRep. Will Hurd: When I graduated [Texas A&M University] at 22, I went into the National Clandestine Service of the CIA and I did two years here in Washington, D.C. ... And then my first overseas assignment was India. My job for my 9½ years in the agency was to collect intelligence on threats to the homeland. I did a lot of counterterrorism stuff when I was still in Washington when 9/11 happened ... and I was one of the first employees in the counterterrorism center of special operations division, which is the unit that prosecuted the war in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aPreston: Tell us a little about what it was like for you over in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u000a\u000aHurd: Well, it was great work. It was the most important national security issues of the day and you're dealing with men and women ... real patriots that you're standing shoulder-to-shoulder with that are high speed, low drag. The answer is yes to whatever the question is. If you know ... there's going to be an attack being planned, you don't have the luxury of saying 'oh we don't have money' or 'we don't have enough people' or 'we don't have enough time.' So the answer is, 'sort it out' and that's an ethos that you don't see in many places.\u000a\u000a... to Congress\u000a\u000aPreston: You decided to run for Congress, and someone told me it was because you were frustrated that members of Congress didn't quite understand what was going on globally [regarding] the threats to America.\u000a\u000aHurd: True story. For me, in addition to collecting intelligence, I had to brief members of Congress. One time in Kabul, Afghanistan a bomb goes off in front of the embassy, kills some local guards, takes out a section of the wall and my unit was responsible to figure out what happened. ... We had to brief some of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence [members] and one of the members had been on the committee for five years, and the question was, 'Why was Iran not supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan the way Iran was supporting other groups in Iraq?' And I started explaining the Sunni, Shia divide and this member of Congress says, 'Hurd, what's the difference between a Sunni and a Shia?' And I'm thinking, he's getting ready to make a really inappropriate joke and who am I to deny him this opportunity. My response was 'I don't know congressman, what's the difference?' His face goes bright red and he didn't know that difference. ... For an individual who's making decisions about sending our boys and girls to places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, that's unacceptable. For someone making decisions on how billions of hard-earned taxpayer dollars is being spent, completely unacceptable.\u000a\u000aBorder wall\u000a\u000aPreston: You are on the other side of the issue when it comes to the wall. President Trump has made a big deal about it. He says that Mexico is going to pay for it. You represent the border, [and] you say that it's not feasible.\u000a\u000aHurd: So, border security is important, but building a concrete structure from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security. It is 2017, we have sensor technology that can determine the difference between a bunny rabbit and a person. We can deploy a drone to determine what the threat is and confirm there's a threat. Then track the threat until you can deploy your most important resource: your human capital, the men and women in Border Patrol, to deal with that threat. And all of that can be done, 75% of that process I just described can be done with computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence and for a fraction of the cost of building a 30-foot high wall.\u000a\u000aGreatest threats facing US ...\u000a\u000aPreston: I think you have a unique perspective when it comes to the biggest threats right now that you think are facing the nation.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u000a\u000aHurd: You have to start with North Korea, because North Korea has the ability to inflict the most damage in the quickest way possible. Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator, is going to stop at nothing to have the capability to launch a nuclear tipped intercontinental ballistic missile into the continental United States. He believes that when he has that power and it is well known, he is going to be able to have a stronger negotiating position.\u000a\u000aIslamic extremism\u000a\u000aHurd: Then you go back to Islamic extremism. ... One of the questions that I always ask folks that are involved in fighting terrorism ... "What day are we going to celebrate when it comes to the global war on terrorism?" And one of my former colleagues in the CIA and the private sector, Ambassador Hank Crumpton, said "We're not going to celebrate a day because terrorism is like influenza. It is something that you can deal with in communities, you can inoculate communities from it, but it's always going to be around."\u000a\u000aRussia\u000a\u000aHurd: And then the other entity I would say is Russia. Russia is our adversary. They are not our ally. The Russians, Vladimir Putin is very clear, he has one goal and that's to re-establish the territorial integrity of the USSR. And he can't do it militarily, he can't do it economically, he has to use asymmetrical warfare and that means eroding the trust in democratic institutions. That's the US That's the EU. That's NATO. And one of the issues, one of the ways that they do this is with disinformation or ... covert influence operations. Which means we, the United States, have to have a counter-covert influence strategy, which we don't have.\u000a\u000aRussia investigation\u000a\u000aPreston: So you brought up Russia ... I trust, as you have said, in these folks in the intelligence community [who say Russia tried to interfere in the US elections]. Is it frustrating when you don't hear the White House really give a full-throated response behind that?\u000a\u000aHurd: I stand behind the intelligence community assessment of this as well. The Russians were trying to manipulate our elections. Now, did they impact the vote tallying machines? No. So, President Trump won the election fair and square, but that doesn't change the fact that there was attempts of manipulation. The Russians have been doing this for decades in Europe, they're doing it now and they are going to continue to do that. ... I think it is frustrating when we allow the Russians to continue to win, and what do I mean by that? The Russians' goal in their activity was to sow, was to drive a wedge, whether real or perceived, between the President, the intelligence community, and the American people. And by the discord that continues, that allows those goals to continue to be achieved.\u000a\u000aPreston: I do agree with you entirely on that, the lack of ability for everyone to get on the same page here in the US government is only helping Russia\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aHurd: And look, I sit on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and we are doing our review. We are going to be methodical, we are going to be bipartisan, and we're going to be thorough, because that's what the American people deserve. I think folks want to see something sooner rather than later, but to do this right we have to pursue any lead that is out there to ensure we get to the truth and that is what we are going to do.

aVKelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When Avital Norman Nathman's son was about 3, she says, he freaked out after he walked in on her changing a sanitary pad. So she decided to have an age-appropriate conversation about menstruation with him right then and there.\u000a\u000aShe has taken an open approach ever since with her son, now 10, when it comes to talking about sex.\u000a\u000a"It's not just one conversation," said Norman Nathman , of Northhampton, Massachusetts, a blogger and editor of an anthology on motherhood titled "The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality." "We have this idea in our heads that there is 'the talk,' but it shouldn't be just one conversation. It should be multiple conversations, and starting from a pretty young age."\u000a\u000aNorman Nathman's approach is influenced by what she observed when she taught high school for about four years, beginning in 2002. With sex ed as part of the curriculum, she often led discussion groups based on what the students heard from experts on sex education.\u000a\u000aAnd she was surprised by "the amount of people that would come in from the overall talk with, 'Oh, my gosh. I didn't realize these things.' "\u000a\u000aFor instance, a lot of them thought they could get pregnant simply by being in a hot tub, she said.\u000a\u000a"Talk to your kids," she said when I asked her advice for other parents. "Be there to answer questions, because as uncomfortable as it may be for you, it might be more uncomfortable when your kid comes to you with (a sexually transmitted infection) or with an unplanned pregnancy."\u000a\u000aParents might dread talking to their kids about sex, but here's something really important for every parent to realize: They have tremendous power. Consistently, in surveys conducted by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, teens have said parents have the most influence over their decisions about sex.\u000a\u000aThe power of parents\u000a\u000aIn the most recent survey, released in October, 52% of children ages 12 to 15 said their parents have the most influence when it comes to sex, with friends far behind at 17%. For the 16 to 19 age group, 32% of teens say their parents carry the most weight, with 28% saying their friends have the most influence.\u000a\u000aHowever, when parents are asked who they think most influences their teens' decisions about sex, friends come out far on top. Nearly 60% of more than 2,000 adults over 18 surveyed nationally said friends carry the most weight, in findings released exclusively to CNN, while just 11% said that parents were the biggest influencers.\u000a\u000a"It's a natural rite of passage for teens to act like adults don't matter. It's just part of the developmental process in many, many cases, so I think it's fair for adults to believe what their teens are telling them, and the reality is that teens are clearly saying, especially younger teens and even 16- to 19-year-olds, their parents absolutely matter," said Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\u000a\u000aEven though Janeane Davis, a suburban Philadelphia mom of four, has been talking to her kids about sex since they were young, she still finds it surprising that teens say their parents have the most power when it comes to their decisions about sex.\u000a\u000a"I expected that in my house, but I didn't expect that to be true across the country, and so that's kind of encouraging to know that as parents, we can still influence our children," said Davis, whose kids are 9, 14 and 21 and who blogs at Janeane's World\u000a\u000aWe need to talk to our children, she said, and give them our opinions, "because they're going to listen to what we say, even if they don't do what we want. At least they're listening."\u000a\u000aBut parents seem skeptical about their own abilities to be a trusted source for their children or other young people when it comes to topics such as sex, birth control and relationships, according to the survey.\u000a\u000aWhile 68% said they consider themselves someone whom a younger person could approach to discuss these sensitive issues, 32% said they either couldn't be that person or didn't know whether they could play that role, according to the findings to be released this week.\u000a\u000a"We know that parents are key influencers ... and parents might not believe that, but what they should remember is that this is part of a process and that what parents instill in young people ... might not take hold and catch hold at the moment, but they're preparing their young people, their kids, for the future," Ehrlich said.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that young people who believe there is an adult they can talk with and trust are less likely to have a teen pregnancy, she said.\u000a\u000aSo how can parents start and have these important conversations with their kids? First, they should realize that the conversation is as hard for the teen as it is for the adult, Ehrlich said. "So many sitcoms have really covered that. As soon as the adult brings it up, the teen goes, 'Oh, no!' and vice versa: As soon as the teen brings it up, the adult is like, 'Oh, no!' "\u000a\u000aThe key is for both teen and parent to realize that it's uncomfortable and that's it's OK to feel uncomfortable, she added.\u000a\u000aHere are some tips to start the conversation and keep it going.\u000a\u000a1. Talking about sex in the digital age\u000a\u000aDiana Graber, who teaches "Cyber Civics" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California, remembers the first time she talked to her older daughter about sex. It was probably pre-middle school when she learned from another parent that she had had "the talk" with her son. Graber, a mom of two, then felt like she needed to have a conversation with her daughter because she didn't want her to be left behind.\u000a\u000a"And so I did, and she was looking at me: 'Why are you telling me this? I don't want to know any of this,' " recounted Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital media literacy platform for tweens and teens, teachers and parents. "For years after, even now today, she is 21 years old, she said, 'You told me that stuff way too young.' But as a parent, you just don't know. You don't want to be the one that their kid finds out from their friends because you were too lame to have that conversation."\u000a\u000aHer daughter grew up before kids had cellphones in their hands, she said. "I feel like it's so different for parents today because they don't have that opportunity to break the news to them."\u000a\u000aGraber says her sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders are often seeing a lot of sexual imagery that's sometimes confusing to them. A widely touted statistic is that 70% of children between 7 and 18 have stumbled upon pornography accidentally.\u000a\u000aShe advises parents who give young kids devices to make sure parental controls are in place to keep them from seeing inappropriate content and to spend time on the social media networks their kids are on.\u000a\u000aShe says social media can actually open a door to have discussions about sex that parents wouldn't know how to bring up before.\u000a\u000a"If something inappropriate happens and you know about it, well, that's a great door opener to talk about it and to be that wisdom and kind of guide them through what they're seeing," Graber said. "That's the thing about technology and social media. It does give you a window into your child's world that we never had before. When I was having conversations at the corner with friends, my parents weren't listening."\u000a\u000aEhrlich, of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, said parents should keep in mind how more and more conversations about sex are happening via text. Talking about sex with our kids through texts might be uncomfortable for those of us who didn't grow up in the digital age and prefer face-to-face chats, but texting might help break the ice and then make the face-to-face conversation easier, she said.\u000a\u000a"I think there may be something ... in being askable and making sure the door is open for conversation," Ehrlich said. "I think that for some young people, probably, the knowledge that the door is open is more important than the conversation itself."\u000a\u000a2. How pop culture can get the conversation going\u000a\u000aMore than half of young people ages 12 to 24 have had a helpful conversation with their parents about sex because of something they saw in popular media, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\u000a\u000a"I think watching things in media ... can be a great conversation starter," Ehrlich said. Parents can then use those moments as opportunities to talk about what happened, ask their child what they thought and talk about how it's similar or different to what they believe and do as a family.\u000a\u000aDavis, the mom of four, uses this approach quite a bit with her children. "If we see something on a television show, we'll do something along the lines of, 'Why is she making out with him? She just said she doesn't like him.' "\u000a\u000aHaving regular conversations and making them part of their everyday lives is a much better approach, she believes, than having one big talk.\u000a\u000a"We try to look for ways to make it part of life, because if it's part of life, they're more likely to listen when we talk than if it's 'Oh, my God, we got to have that conversation again,' " she said. "If we keep it along those lines, we think or we're hoping that we'll have better results than if it's just this major once a year conversation."\u000a\u000a3. Practice, practice, practice\u000a\u000aThe old adage "practice makes perfect" applies to talking about sex with your kids, Ehrlich said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Sex talk with mom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sex talk with mom 02:11\u000a\u000a"How do we practice for these conversations, knowing that developmentally, they're probably going to come, so how do we think about how we're going to prepare ourselves as adults not to react in a way that isn't going to keep the door open?" she asked.\u000a\u000aThat means thinking about what you might say and what resources you might want to offer to your child, because adults don't need to be experts in everything, she added. We have plenty of resources on the Internet, so that takes some of the pressure off. We just need to think beforehand about which trusted resources would be good for our kids to utilize on their own time.\u000a\u000a4. 'Stay early and stay late'\u000a\u000aEhrlich says "stay early and stay late" is an expression one of her colleagues likes to use. What it means is, there is no such thing as "the talk" -- but rather many talks that parents should be having with their children as they grow.\u000a\u000aAlso, the conversation doesn't need to be about technicalities and specifics, she said. It's more about making sure your children know that they have the power to decide when and if to have sex and what you as parents feel about that as a family.\u000a\u000a"Here's kind of what our teachings tell us about it. Here's what we want to think about," she said, sharing examples of what parents might say. "These are all kinds of guidance conversations that really parlay into the future and what (could happen) in the future."\u000a\u000a5. Be open\u000a\u000aDavis says her and her husband's philosophy has always been that kids are going to do what they want to do, and so they've been open with their children about sex and birth control.\u000a\u000a"They're not necessarily going to listen to us and just wait until you're married," Davis said. "And if they're not going to do that, we want them to be protected."\u000a\u000aHer husband has made the point with their 14-year-old son that just like a cellphone has a case, he needs to "keep it covered" if he's going to have sex.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We figure, if we talk to them and we're open and honest, then they're more likely to do the right thing and not be afraid to tell us what they've done and what they plan to do."\u000a\u000aNorman Nathman, the mom of one and editor of "The Good Mother Myth," says people might think that if you talk to kids about sex and teach them about it, they're more likely to have sex.\u000a\u000a"But they are going to have sex regardless. Why don't we give them the tools to do it safely for themselves and their partners?"

aVParis (CNN) Fear and concern are consuming the minds of many experts in the field of HIV control and it's not just because of the 1.8 million people that became newly infected with the virus, nor the 1 million who died of AIDS, in 2016.\u000a\u000aIn fact, experts this week were heralding their progress against HIV during the ninth International AIDS Conference on HIV Science in Paris, with UNAIDS reporting last week that more than half of people living with HIV globally are now accessing treatment. Deaths have halved since 2005.\u000a\u000aStill, experts worry this may be about to change. Or worse, go backward.\u000a\u000aThe largest supporter in the global fight against HIV and AIDS may be about to make drastic cuts to its level of support. That funder: the United States.\u000a\u000a"Things come out of the White House and cause a lot of anxiety and stress," said Dr. Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International AIDS Society. "Without resources, we will not be able to do what needs to be done," she told CNN.\u000a\u000aBekker is referring to the Trump administration's proposed budgets for 2017 and 2018 -- the "skinny" and "fat" budget -- in which funding for global aid, grant programs, and science institutions, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, is set to be cut.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, the White House proposed a $242 million cut in funding for the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, in the 2017 budget, equaling a 6% reduction, said Dr. Greg Millet, vice president and director of public policy at amfAR, a US non-profit that supports AIDS research."This would have devastating effects downstream, including 253,000 adults and 50,00 experiencing (HIV) treatment interruption, and as many as 40,000 deaths," he said.\u000a\u000aUS Global AIDS Coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, at this week's AIDS conference.\u000a\u000aGreater cuts proposed for 2018 would cause even more of a decline, Millet highlighted, adding that the progress currently being celebrated is largely due to the work of PEPFAR and the international financing organization the Global Fund, to which the US is the largest single contributor.\u000a\u000a"The US really stands out in this way," said Dr. Deborah Birx, ambassador-at-large, US global AIDS coordinator and the head of PEPFAR. Birx highlighted that as well as money, the US also provides human capacity in the countries it supports within embassies and field programs to "translate dollars into effective programs."\u000a\u000aStaying hopeful and proving your worth\u000a\u000aWhen asked about the proposed cuts to her organizations budget, Birx didn't show fear. "I believe this administration are committed to changing the course of this pandemic," she said.\u000a\u000aBirx, and others in the field believe they have shown what they're capable of when it comes to controlling HIV and that the results should hopefully speak for themselves to ensure continued support.\u000a\u000a"Traditionally you don't believe you control a pandemic unless you have a vaccine or a cure," she said, of which HIV had -- and continues to have -- neither. Yet this week, her organization announced that in four of the countries they work in -- Swaziland, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe -- the epidemic is becoming under control.\u000a\u000a"These are countries that had overwhelming pandemics, where a third of their population was dying," said Birx. It "went from a humanitarian crisis to us changing course of pandemic."\u000a\u000aOthers are looking to lawmakers to keep the budget stable, not the administration.\u000a\u000a"We know that (budget) is not the final say. There are processes," Bekker told CNN, optimistically. These processes mean approval by the US Congress which, so far, has not passed budgets that include these cuts.\u000a\u000aFormer IAS president Dr. Chris Beyrer and UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé are both equally positive that bipartisan support for HIV control in Congress will ensure cuts are not as drastic as the Trump administration would like.\u000a\u000a"Right now, Congress has not been willing to go along with these very drastic cuts ... (and) it is Congress that hold the power of the purse," said Beyrer. But he believes pressure is going to continue from the administration, making it "incumbent on everyone working in this space to keep Congress understanding how effective this has all been."\u000a\u000a"I met most of the senators from the Republican and Democrats and (with) Congress ... I am confident that it is so bipartisan and the American citizens are very supportive of PEPFAR programs," Sidibé told CNN, adding "we will have to wait and see what happens."\u000a\u000aThere is, however, universal agreement that there will be some form of cuts, if not as drastic as was first proposed. If this does happen, other nations, in both the West and among middle-income countries, will need to up their game, experts believe.\u000a\u000aThe next question then, is who it could be.\u000a\u000a"The unsettled nature of governments in so many parts of the world today make us anxious," said Bekker.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the West\u000a\u000aThroughout the week's conference, researchers, policymakers and clinicians alike have made constant reference to HIV budget cuts, not just by the US, but the general decline in funding from multiple governments in recent years.\u000a\u000aA recent Kaiser Family Foundation report found that overall donor funding for HIV fell by $500 million in the last year alone, bringing totals down to the lowest they've been since 2010.\u000a\u000a"We're concerned about France," said Beyrer. "The hope was that France would at least meet it's commitment and do flat funding, as they are the third largest donor to the Global Fund."\u000a\u000aFrench President Emmanuel Macron was due to open the conference on Sunday, but he didn't attend.\u000a\u000aAs Agnès Buzyn, French minister of solidarity and health, took to the stage instead, she was greeted by activists shouting, "Shame on Macron."\u000a\u000aMacron not appearing does not mean he will not honor funding commitments, Beyrer stresses, "but the minister of health had nothing to announce," he said.\u000a\u000aPolitical activists question French President Emmanuel Macron's failure to open this week's AIDS conference in Paris.\u000a\u000a"We're very reliant that France does what it needs to do and the UK," added Bekker.\u000a\u000aThe UK is the second-largest contributor in the fight against AIDS and Beyrer is also concerned that after Brexit, their voice in support of HIV within the European Union will not be replaced. To date, no country or institution has matched the financial support of the US.\u000a\u000a"If the US were to implement cuts on the level that the President has proposed, it's hard to imagine any of these donors being able to step up at that level," said Beyrer.\u000a\u000aIf the potential loss is not made up by the rest of the West, Sidibé believes it could be low and middle-income countries that step forward.\u000a\u000aRise in support from poorer countries\u000a\u000aIn 2015, the global HIV response saw a change in dominance as the scales tipped and low- and middle-income countries combined to provide more funding to control the infection than donors from the West. That year, 57% of the response budget came from domestic funding by the countries themselves, according to UNAIDS\u000a\u000a"We went to the African union and were able to share with heads of state the potential dependency crisis," said Sidibé. "Kenya, Ivory coast, are all increasing their domestic budget to deal with this epidemic."\u000a\u000aSouth Africa are already spending $2 billion of their own budget on HIV programs, covering most of it, and Botswana pays 80% of its own response, while China and Brazil are also paying for their own control efforts, said Sidibé.\u000a\u000aStable patients diagnosed with the HIV virus meet at a clinic in Cape Town, South Africa.\u000a\u000a"South Africa has taken the epidemic response into its own hands," said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and formerly founding executive director of UNAIDS. "The country now hosts the largest treatment program in the world financed for the most part from domestic resources."\u000a\u000aPiot further highlighted that Brazil was a leading light in the 1990s thanks to its comprehensive and proactive response, becoming the first middle-income country to provide free antiretroviral treatment in 1996. But today, new infections are rising in Brazil, he said, meaning the fight is far from over.\u000a\u000aNow, Sidibé would like the countries comfortably supporting the control of HIV in their own countries to go to the next level -- and become donors. "It's important to see how they can become progressively contributing to other parts of the world. Not just paying for their own," said Sidibé. "Countries who are able already to demonstrate they have fiscal space."\u000a\u000aBeyrer has experienced, however, that countries often struggle to think more broadly when tackling the HIV epidemic on their own soil. During his time as IAS president, he explained, he spent time working with the governments of Brazil, Russia, India and China, emphasizing the impact of becoming donors, but with little progress. "They continue to make contributions to their own programs, but really did not step up as donors," he said.\u000a\u000aMore expense to come\u000a\u000aBeyrer further worries that if funds are reliant on domestic governments fully paying for their own HIV control efforts, crucial elements of HIV control will be forgotten, or at least not prioritized. At particular risk are those targeting more marginalized groups, such as teenage girls, sex workers and drug users.\u000a\u000a"Governments are willing to spend money on mother-to-child transmission, keeping blood supplies safe, doing education campaigns in schools," said Beyrer. "What they're not willing to fund is needle and syringe exchange ... or programs for sex workers." As a result these programs are currently funded predominantly by external donors.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aMany experts further believe that the gradual increase in governments of high-rate HIV countries financially tackling their own epidemics, could be jeopardized if they feel like larger countries, such as the US, are bowing out.\u000a\u000a"It's not the right time to send the message to them that donors are reducing their funds and disengaging themselves," said Sidibé . "It will have a major impact on security (and) sustainability."\u000a\u000aFurthermore, economists and epidemiologists highlight that the next stage of HIV control is going to be the most expensive -- such as enticing young people, sex workers and migrants to get tested, getting men who prioritize working to come into clinics, and helping drug users to realize they are at risk and need to stay protected. "More resources might be required," said Beyrer.\u000a\u000aWhatever happens, Birx is ready to make the most of what she is given.\u000a\u000a"My job is to take the resources that we have and make sure they have the biggest impact that they can possibly have," she said.\u000a\u000aShe exemplified this by revealing that over the last three years, PEPFAR have almost doubled the number of people on treatment and more than doubled the number of people accessing voluntary male circumcision, which can protect men from HIV by up to 60%, all on a flat budget. "We say this is what's needed and figure out how to make it happen," she said.

aVStory highlights Leslie Lenkowsky: Often the wealthy focus too much on donations to fix a complicated issue\u000a\u000aBezos' approach -- to help "in the here and now" -- could lead to lasting changes, he says\u000a\u000aLeslie Lenkowsky is an expert on philanthropy and public affairs at Indiana University, where he is senior counselor to the dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. He was CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service under the Bush administration from 2001-2003. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) "Philanthropy," Oscar Wilde once wrote, "seems to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow-creatures." With a growing number of billionaires and other wealthy people pledging to give away large chunks of their fortunes to rid the world of diseases, illiteracy, poverty, global warming and much else, the rest of us are apt to be in for a good deal more bother in the future. However well-intentioned, their efforts usually require the objects of their concerns to change behavior in ways that often wind up doing little to solve the vast problems they are trying to address.\u000a\u000aLeslie Lenkowsky\u000a\u000aThat is why a June Twitter post by Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, owner of The Washington Post, and -- for a few hours this week -- the world's wealthiest person , has created a stir in the philanthropic world.\u000a\u000aDespite his vast wealth, Bezos is not known for his generosity, as many of his tech-industry peers are. According to The New York Times, he is the only one of the five wealthiest Americans not to have signed the "Giving Pledge," the plan developed by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to get commitments from billionaires to give at least half their money away. But in his Tweet , Bezos said he was planning on becoming more philanthropic and asked his more than 300,000 followers to send him ideas.\u000a\u000aHowever, Bezos was not looking for big challenges to tackle with his wealth. Instead, he wrote, "I'm thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now -- short term -- at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact." He offered a center for homeless families in Seattle as an example.\u000a\u000aThis approach sets Bezos apart from many champions of philanthropy, from John D. Rockefeller to today's billionaires, who have seen their role as using their vast wealth to address the underlying causes of the world's problems. Priscilla Chan recently declared, for example, that the programs she and her husband, Mark Zuckerberg, are creating aim to " take luck out of the equation " for children.\u000a\u000aRead More

Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000a(CNN) "Climate change is the canvas on which the history of the 21st century will be painted."\u000a\u000aThat's Mark Lynas, writing in "Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet."\u000a\u000aIt's a true if disturbing prediction.\u000a\u000aBy some accounts, we've already entered the Anthropocene , an epoch defined by human degradation of the natural world. We're causing extinctions, changing the climate. Mother Nature is still powerful, sure. But, as Lynas explains, we humans are so fundamental a force that we are changing the way she works.\u000a\u000aI recently asked readers of my "2 degrees" newsletter ( sign up here ) to suggest "must-read" books on climate change -- and Lynas' important work of nonfiction was among your top recommendations. I've been reading it, and I recently interviewed the author. The book takes a degree-by-degree look at the future of our planet as it continues to warm. Two degrees of warming, which the international community is trying to avoid, and which is the focus of my climate change initiative at CNN, sounds bad. But, as Lynas told me, a world that's 6 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution, which is possible if we keep burning alarming amounts of fossil fuels and chopping down forests, sounds downright hellish.\u000a\u000aYou'll find Lynas' "Six Degrees" on a list of 12 climate change must-reads below. It includes a Pulitzer Prize winner, Elizabeth Kolbert's "The Sixth Extinction," as well as an illustrated account of an artist's dive into climate science, titled "Climate Changed."\u000a\u000aYou readers suggested all these, and I've included some of your comments about them.\u000a\u000aWe'll tackle "Six Degrees" first, since it's a great primer. I'll post an interview with Lynas on Thursday, and then we'll read his book together over the course of the month.\u000a\u000aHe's graciously agreed to take your questions in a few weeks.\u000a\u000aThink we missed something? Feel free to leave suggestions in the comments section below.\u000a\u000a1. "Six Degrees," by Mark Lynas\u000a\u000aChapter by chapter, Lynas explores what the world would look like if it warms 1 degree, 2 degrees, 3, degrees Celsius, etc. He's great at distilling the science and maintaining a sense of optimism amid some very gloomy predictions about the future. Suggested by Lance Olsen.\u000a\u000a2. "This Changes Everything," by Naomi Klein\u000a\u000a"Well researched, compelling arguments, hits home for multiple audiences, and is a realistic call to action." -- Laura S. Lynes, from Canmore, Alberta\u000a\u000a3. "The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight," by Thom Hartmann\u000a\u000a"It's all-encompassing -- it delves into the various feedback systems in a climate change context, and also the underlying cultural philosophy or stories we tell ourselves that continue to create the situation we're in. Fascinating stuff!" -- Trevor, from Los Angeles\u000a\u000a4. "The Age of Sustainable Development," by Jeffrey D. Sachs\u000a\u000a"Comprehensive and positive summary of the steps required for sustainable development with good overviews of the problems causing climate change." -- Dan Fowler, from Austin, Texas\u000a\u000a5.

This book explains how animal agriculture is the single biggest cause of global warming." -- Wendy Horowitz, from New Haven, Connecticut\u000a\u000a6. "The Sixth Extinction," by Elizabeth Kolbert\u000a\u000a"An amazingly well written narrative on the effect our species has had on the planet. As our population continues to grow and our demand on our very limited resources escalates, the negative impact we have had and continue to have is well explained." -- Sharon Lynch, from Benicia, California\u000a\u000a7. "The End of the Long Summer," by Dianne Dumanoski\u000a\u000a"A really thoughtful, wise and balanced appraisal of fact that, going on past changes to the climate, we are likely to reach a sudden tipping point and experience huge climate changes over just a few years, BUT that humans are incredibly resilient and adaptable and rather than go extinct, will likely rise to the challenge.\u000a\u000a"This book gave me hope while presenting the facts." -- Persephone Maywald, from Australia\u000a\u000a8. "Climate Wars," by Gwynne Dyer\u000a\u000a"Waves of climate refugees. Dozens of failed states. All-out war. From one of the world's great geopolitical analysts comes a terrifying glimpse of the strategic realities of the near future, when climate change drives the world's powers towards the cut-throat politics of survival," the publisher's description says.\u000a\u000a9. "Merchants of Doubt," by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway\u000a\u000aHere's an endorsement from John Horgan, of Scientific American : "The book, which packages rigorous research in fiery rhetoric, inspired a documentary, 'Merchants of Doubt' ... I highly recommend the book and documentary, which reveal how disturbingly easy it can be for unscrupulous spin-meisters to dupe journalists and the public." The book was suggested by Aaron Thierry, a reader from Edinburgh, Scotland\u000a\u000a10. "Don't Even Think About It," by George Marshall\u000a\u000aA Twitter user -- @timreckmeyer -- suggested this one as part of a discussion on whether we at CNN should be leading climate change stories with images of sad polar bears on ice sheets. (He thinks we shouldn't. You can see from the gallery below that we still are, from time to time.) George Marshall, the book's author, explores how our brains shape (and warp) perceptions about climate change. I'm hoping this book will help me understand how to better explain this subject -- and will settle the polar bear debate.\u000a\u000a11. "Climate Changed," by Philippe Squarzoni\u000a\u000a"It's an amazing book. It's an illustrated nonfiction book (graphic novel format) that is built on Squarzoni's interviews with IPCC scientists. The science is well explained, but the power comes from watching Squarzoni absorb the information and struggle to fit it into his life, just like a reader, over the six years it took him to put the book together. So the intangible social aspect of climate, which is probably more important to solutions than climate science itself, is explored with candor." -- Richard Reiss, from New York\u000a\u000a12. "The Great Transition," by Lester Brown\u000a\u000a"Right away, book club or no, this book must be read: 'The Great Transition,' by Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute," a reader, Elizabeth McCommon, wrote in an e-mail.

aVMichael Zeldin, a CNN legal analyst, has served as a federal prosecutor in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice and was a special counsel to then-Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) We are a long way from having a complete understanding of the facts in the Russia investigation. We also do not know what possible crimes, if any, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may uncover. But, as in baseball, where a scorecard is needed to keep track of the game, having an understanding of the crimes that might be in play as the evidence unfolds should help in navigating the issues that may lie ahead.\u000a\u000a"Collusion" is the word used by the media to describe the allegations that underpin the investigation by Mueller into any potential efforts by the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and any possible involvement by the Trump presidential campaign. Collusion, however, is a crime known principally in the context of antitrust law. Typical antitrust collusion prosecutions involve price fixing, bid rigging, or market division/allocation schemes.\u000a\u000aOutside the antitrust area, a criminally actionable collusive agreement is described as a conspiracy. Indeed, the mandate given to Mueller by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein does not include the word collusion. Instead, the mandate authorizes an investigation into any "links and/or coordination" between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump presidential campaign and to "matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation."\u000a\u000aThe general federal conspiracy statute, Section 371 of Title 18 of the US Code, criminalizes two types of conduct. The statute makes it an offense "[i]f two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose."\u000a\u000aThe first clause, referred to as the Offense Clause, prohibits anyone from conspiring to commit any federal offense (i.e., one defined elsewhere in the Criminal Code). The second clause, referred to as the Defraud Clause, prohibits a conspiracy to "defraud the United States." Unlike the Offense Clause, the Defraud Clause does not require proof of any other criminal offense. It is, in and of itself, a crime.\u000a\u000aThe courts have interpreted the conspiracy law to require an agreement and at least one step in furtherance of the agreement (referred to as an overt act). For example, two or more people can agree to rob a bank, but if they do not take any steps to put the plan into action (e.g., get a gun or buy a getaway car), they have not committed a crime.\u000a\u000aIn the context of the Trump-Russia investigation, the key questions are whether any conduct by the Russian government and/or individuals associated with the Trump campaign potentially could constitute a crime, and if so, whether there was a conspiracy to violate the law.\u000a\u000aPut simply, and for the sake of discussion only, if members of the Trump campaign were found to have reached an agreement with representatives of the Russian government to try to affect the outcome of the election in Trump's favor and to have taken steps in furtherance of the agreement, could this conduct potentially constitute a violation of the conspiracy laws?\u000a\u000aIt is important to note that no evidence of any such agreement has been disclosed publicly, and those associated with the Trump campaign have publicly denied the allegations. Indeed, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has said , "I did not collude with Russia," and he has advised that he does not know of anyone in the campaign who did. In an off-the-record talk with interns , Kushner apparently remarked that the campaign was too disorganized to collude: "We couldn't even collude with our local offices."\u000a\u000aTo violate the Offense Clause of the conspiracy statute, there must be an agreement to violate another criminal law. If there were a conspiracy, what laws might have been violated?\u000a\u000aElection laws\u000a\u000aUnder Section 30121 of Title 52 of the US Code, it is a crime for a foreign national, directly or indirectly, to make a contribution or donation of money or "other thing of value" in connection with a federal election. It also is illegal for a person to solicit, accept, or receive such a contribution or donation.\u000a\u000aKey to determining if a violation of the election laws potentially may have occurred is whether providing negative information to discredit an opposition candidate in connection with a political campaign (opposition research) could constitute a "thing of value" under the election laws.\u000a\u000aTwo Federal Election Commission advisory opinions would appear to support the view that opposition research is a thing of value. In Opinion 2007-22 , the FEC advised that the proposed donation of certain printed materials, used in previous Canadian campaigns, without charge to a US congressional campaign would constitute a contribution and, as such, would be prohibited, particularly in light of the broad scope of the prohibition on contributions from foreign nationals. In Opinion 1990-12 , the FEC advised that the proposed donation of poll data or analysis to a candidate, which was commissioned by another candidate, would constitute an in-kind contribution.\u000a\u000aWhile there are a number of allegations that members of the Trump campaign may have colluded (or conspired) with the Russians, as of yet, they have not been proven. A particular focus, however, has been on the June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower, which Donald Trump Jr., apparently organized after he was advised that a group of Russians (or persons acting on their behalf) wished to provide to the Trump campaign opposition research on Hilary Clinton.\u000a\u000aIf it were determined that Donald Trump Jr., in fact, solicited a thing of value (the opposition research), his conduct potentially could provide the basis for a substantive federal election law violation. This is so because the act of soliciting a thing of value (or assisting in such a solicitation) can be, in and of itself, a criminal violation. The law does not require the solicitation must be accepted, that anything must be received, or that the recipient determined that the thing solicited was worthwhile.\u000a\u000aFurther, if other evidence were produced that indicated that the two sides had entered into an agreement to use the opposition research to interfere in the presidential election (either before or after the June 9, 2016, meeting), and additional steps were taken, a case alleging a conspiracy to violate the federal election laws also potentially could be initiated. (Donald Trump Jr., has denied wrongdoing. He acknowledged that he met with the Russian lawyer who promised information that could be helpful to his father's presidential campaign but once the meeting began he determined the lawyer had no "meaningful information" on then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The meeting, he said, ended within 20-30 minutes with no followup action taken.)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHacking/cybercrimes\u000a\u000aSection 1030 of Title 18 of the US Code makes it a crime, among other things, to access knowingly a protected computer (one used in interstate commerce) without authorization and, thereby, to obtain protected information. It also makes it a crime to conspire to commit or attempt to commit an offense under the statute.\u000a\u000aOther statutes, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. 2701) (ECPA) and the federal wiretap law (18 U.S.C. 2511), criminalize both the intentional and unauthorized acquisition of the contents of messages ( like emails ) and the disclosure/distribution or receipt of communications that have been acquired unlawfully by a third party. Thus, if anyone connected to the Trump campaign were to have asked the Russians to procure the data stolen from the Democratic National Committee or if a person somehow participated illegally in the acquisition of the data, a violation of the wiretap and/or hacking laws potentially could be established.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, were evidence produced that Russians (whether participants in the June 9, 2016, meeting or over the course of the campaign) illegally obtained information from a protected computer (for example, the computers at the DNC or John Podesta's personal computer), a substantive violation of Section 1030 potentially could be prosecuted.\u000a\u000aAnd, if evidence were available establishing that members of the Trump campaign conspired in the unlawful access of computers or that they agreed with others that such hacking should occur, they potentially could be prosecuted for conspiracy or for facilitation of these crimes.\u000a\u000aFinally, to the extent that any information taken from the DNC was provided directly to representatives of the Trump campaign, or that the Trump campaign participated in or requested that the information be released through WikiLeaks or otherwise, that conduct could give rise to a potential prosecution for conspiracy, aiding and abetting or facilitating an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property in violation of Section 2314 of Title 18 of the US Code.\u000a\u000aSection 2314 makes it a crime to "transmit, or transfer in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud." To bring an action under the statute, however, the prosecution would have to establish that the information (e.g., the information stolen from the DNC's servers) constituted "goods, wares, or merchandise."\u000a\u000aDefraud Clause\u000a\u000aThe historic use of the Defraud Clause finds its origins in the 1924 Supreme Court case of Hammerschmidt v. United States, when Chief Justice William Howard Taft wrote that to conspire to defraud the United States means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.\u000a\u000aIn that opinion, Taft explained that it is not necessary for the government to be subjected to a property or pecuniary loss by the fraud, but "only that its legitimate official action and purpose shall be defeated by misrepresentation, chicane or the overreaching of those charged with carrying out the governmental intention."\u000a\u000aModern-day legal actions brought under the Defraud Clause often involve a conspiracy to impede the functions of the Internal Revenue Service to collect taxes, otherwise known as tax evasion. For example, in United States v. Klein, the defendants were convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the government by engaging in certain acts, including altering and falsifying books and records, making false statements in tax returns, and making other misstatements to the IRS.\u000a\u000aThe rationale of the Hammerschmidt decision has survived more recent challenges. For example, United States v. Rodman involved impeding the lawful government functions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives by submitting fraudulent forms, and United States v. Ballistrea involved a conspiracy to interfere with or obstruct the FDA's lawful function of regulating the interstate distribution of medical devices).\u000a\u000aTheoretically, if an agreement had been reached at the June 9, 2016, meeting (or at another time) to obtain and use opposition research from a Russian national to influence the presidential election, it is possible that the government could construe the agreement as an effort to defraud the government by impeding the lawful functions of the Federal Elections Commission.\u000a\u000aIf there were evidence that there was a further agreement to use any information provided (for example, data stolen from the DNC) to impact voter opinion in the months leading up to the election, a broader case potentially could be made involving more individuals.\u000a\u000aFalse statements and obstruction of justice\u000a\u000aMany investigations do not result in a finding of a substantive criminal offense. Nevertheless, an individual sometimes can put himself or herself in legal jeopardy if, during the course of an investigation, that person were to lie under oath, otherwise make a false statement to the government, or obstruct an ongoing investigation.\u000a\u000aFor example, in United States v. Libby , Scooter Libby, a former assistant to President George W. Bush and to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted for making false statements to federal investigators, for perjury for lying to a federal grand jury, and for obstruction of justice for impeding a federal grand jury investigation concerned with the leaking of classified information in connection with the disclosure of the identity of a covert CIA agent, Valerie Plame Wilson. (President Bush commuted his sentence; Libby was not accused of disclosing Plame Wilson's name himself.)\u000a\u000aSection 1001 of Title 18 of the US Code makes it a crime to knowingly and intentionally: Falsify, conceal, or cover up by trick, scheme, or device a material fact to the US executive, legislative or judicial branch of government (federal government); or make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation to the federal government; or make or use any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry to the federal government.\u000a\u000aThe acts can be oral or written, and they can be acts of commission (giving a false answer to a question asked) or acts of omission (concealment). If this were to occur, the person making the false statement could be charged with a violation of Section 1001 or with aiding and abetting a violation of the statute.\u000a\u000aAny knowing and intentional false statement, whether in writing (e.g. on a government form), in the context of providing congressional testimony, in testimony before the grand jury, or in interviews with FBI agents, could be a Section 1001 violation. And, any agreement to coordinate the making of any false statements could violate the conspiracy laws.\u000a\u000aEven if it were the case that no agreement was reached on June 9, 2016, and therefore, there was no violation of the conspiracy laws, if a person were to make a knowing and intentional false statement about any material aspect of the meeting to federal investigators, that conduct could constitute a violation of Section 1001.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, were any witness testifying under oath to lie willfully as to a material matter either before Congress or in the grand jury, perjury charges could be brought under Sections 1621 or 1623 of Title 18 of the US Code. The obstruction of justice laws make it a crime for anyone to corruptly influence/interfere with a congressional or grand jury investigation or other agency proceedings.\u000a\u000aFor this reason, if anyone associated with the Trump campaign or otherwise connected to the Trump administration were to attempt, directly or indirectly, to obstruct Mueller's investigation or any congressional investigations, that person potentially could be charged with obstruction of justice. If there was an agreement between two or more persons to obstruct justice, conspiracy charges also could be brought.\u000a\u000aConclusion\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aSpecial counsel Mueller was appointed on May 17, 2017. It has been just over two months since he began his investigation. Sorting out all the legal issues included in his mandate is complicated and will likely be nuanced. Only time will tell whether a criminal conspiracy existed between any Russians and any members of the Trump campaign and, if so, who the participants were and what role they played.\u000a\u000aAt this point, we are only in the top of the second inning.

aV(CNN) While President Donald Trump insisted Congress repeal Obamacare within his first 100 days , the legislation was rushed, according to his Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price, and that's why the Republicans failed.\u000a\u000aBut the recent setback will not deter the Trump administration, he said during an interview at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday with CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\u000a\u000aPrice runs a department with a budget of more than $1 trillion dollars and more than 80,000 employees who do work that he said touches on "the lives of every single American." The orthopedic surgeon -- the third doctor to hold the secretary position -- said he was visiting Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday to meet leaders at the CDC. He also gave a speech Wednesday about the country's growing opioid epidemic at the National RX Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit.\u000a\u000a"Recovery is possible for every single individual," Price said in addressing the summit attendees. "America is not giving up on this fight. Surrender simply is not an option. The stakes are too high and the value of every life is too precious."\u000a\u000aPrice is part of the executive opioid commission announced by President Trump last month. When asked about what was at the root of the crisis, Price pointed to a sense of despair in individuals and lack of connection to community. "It's a struggle now that is being met with these powerful, powerful agents that are destroying lives, destroying communities, all over, all across the land," Price told Gupta in a follow up interview Wednesday.\u000a\u000aBefore becoming secretary, Price represented Georgia's 6th district in Congress and he happened to be visiting on the day his seat was up for grabs in what was seen as a litmus test on the Trump presidency. Tuesday's unexpectedly close election unfolded in a district that has elected a Republican since 1979, including Newt Gingrich.\u000a\u000aThis week, it gave the most votes to a Democrat, newcomer John Ossoff, whose lawn signs urge people to "Vote your Ossoff." He'll be in a runoff in June against Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, who got the second highest number of votes.\u000a\u000aAsked about the election, Price declined to weigh in saying that he was "told by the legal beagles at the Department of Health and Human Services" that he has to "take that political hat off and put it in the corner" so that's what he says he's done.\u000a\u000aWhomever gets elected to Price's old seat will be one of the many leaders Price will have to court if he is going to successfully transform the American health care system he has spent a political career railing against, one he has characterized as "failing."\u000a\u000aFrom doctor to politician\u000a\u000aPrice's first public complaints in the 1990s came long before he was elected. He served on the Georgia State Medical Association, a group that advocates for medical professionals. Representing the association, he visited Rotary clubs and church groups all around Georgia talking about how the Bill Clinton administration had "started down a path that I felt, along with many others, was not the right path to head."\u000a\u000aPrice turned that message into a political career. He served four terms in the Georgia state Senate. There, he became the first Republican Majority Leader in the state's history, bringing what his hometown paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , called a "Newt Gingrich-style sense of Republican partisanship" to the state House.\u000a\u000aHe brought in tort reform that placed new limits on medical malpractice complaints, voted consistently against access to abortion, and repeatedly demonstrated his conservative values beyond medicine. He voted for a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage in 2006 and sponsored a bill to create a Confederate history month that didn't mention slavery. He voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Georgia flag, then voted against eliminating the remaining Confederate symbol from the flag, which Democrats questioned him about in his contentious confirmation hearing in January. (At the hearing, Price said the move "addressed all the concerns of the state and was adopted and supported by the state.")\u000a\u000aWhen Rep. Johnny Isakson decided to run for the Senate, vacating his 6th district seat, Price took his conservative politics and passion for reforming health care to the national stage, getting elected in 2005. In Congress, he continued to get a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee and a 0% rating from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, voting against federal coverage for abortion and against expanding research on embryonic stem cell lines.\u000a\u000aHe also introduced a comprehensive health care bill of his own, the Empowering Patients First Act of 2015, that expanded health savings accounts. It gave states grants to create pools of high-risk patients, rather than have expensive patients deemed "high risk" by insurance companies in the general insurance population. The legislation never made it into law. Price said this week he still likes the idea of high-risk pools\u000a\u000aResearch shows, though, they are limited in their ability to help give "insurance for everybody," as Trump said he wanted to do. A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found prior to Obamacare, the states with high-risk pools offered coverage that was expensive, and only a small fraction of the people who needed the coverage actually got it.\u000a\u000aPrice told Gupta that while they did not work "terribly well" in the past, it's because they weren't funded to the "degree they should be" and the pools weren't big enough to be cost effective. Going forward, the administration's plan would need to address this issue, he said.\u000a\u000aA third-generation doctor, Price said he will work to transform the health care system to make it more "patient centered." The 62-year-old said he knows this kind of care is possible, since he witnessed those relationships first hand when he was a little boy, making housecalls with his grandfather.\u000a\u000a"The door flung open and they said, 'Dr. Price.' and gave him a big hug," Price remembered "And to me that's what the doctor-patient relationship was all about."\u000a\u000aIn contrast, at Resurgens Orthopaedics, which Price helped build into a nationwide practice, he said the system prevented those kinds of relationships.\u000a\u000a"I remember, almost to the day, the moment in my medical practice when I was back in my office working on some paperwork and I went out to see a patient, and I crossed, I went through that door, you know the door between the clinical side where you see patients and the back-office area, and it hit me that there were more people behind that door working on all the clerical stuff. Working, fighting with insurance companies, fighting with the government, fighting with this supplier, that supplier, to get the services and the apparatus needed to care for those people," Price said.\u000a\u000a"I said to myself then, at that very moment, 'There's something wrong with this picture.' When we have more people in the system who aren't providing clinical care, who aren't hands-on taking care of patients or having a responsibility to care for patients, then that's a system that again, may be working for other folks, but it's not working for the patients."\u000a\u000aMoving on after failure\u000a\u000aThe most recent Republican attempt to fix the healthcare system failed, Price said, because of the "compressed timeline for the sale of the bill." While his boss said, "nobody knew health care could be so complicated," Price seems to have understood and told Gupta that "the different systems that we have, don't make a whole lot of sense."\u000a\u000aHe vowed the administration will "keep our eye on the ball and make certain that we move in the direction of a system that is much more responsive to patients, again, those end users, the people and the patients across this land who need to be paid attention to," Price said.\u000a\u000aPrice suggested one way to fix the system will be to make sure the right resources go to the right initiatives.\u000a\u000aHe wants to cut redundancy and waste. And while he runs the federal agency that operates 11 divisions including the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, he thinks the states, rather than the federal government should get more power over your healthcare.\u000a\u000a"States are much more flexible, much more nimble to be able to create and modify a system that would work best for their constituents," he said.\u000a\u000aStates may have to pick up the slack since Trump's initial budget plan slashes billions from Price's departments, which have already seen shrinking budgets for years. For instance, a report from Trust for America's Health found that the CDC's core budget has decreased by more than $580 million since 2010. Still as the CDC budget fell, state public health spending remained relatively flat.\u000a\u000aMoney, though, is not the answer, Price repeatedly told Gupta. "For us to say,'OK, let's just throw more money at that system. Let's see if more money helps that out' is the wrong way," Price said.\u000a\u000aWhen pressed to give an example of a state that has improved healthcare with less money, Price did not give a direct answer.\u000a\u000aInstead he pointed to Indiana as a state that reformed its health care system under the guidance of the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services director Seema Verma.\u000a\u000aThe Healthy Indiana Plan did not do more with less; instead, it used the money it was given for Medicaid to create benefit packages for low-income adults that were modeled after high-deductible health plans. This created health savings accounts for the poor that required most to contribute some money toward their own health care, even if it was only a few dollars.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aPrice will continue to push for reform and is confident the Trump administration will leave Americans with a better health care system.\u000a\u000a"When we look back on this," Price said, "I believe, in 10 or 20 years, I think that we will say that we moved in the direction of a much more responsive, much more higher quality healthcare system for the American people, and I still believe that's what will occur."

aVAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of "The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President." Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him @aarondmiller2 . Richard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . From 2005-2015, he served as a member of the Secretary of State's Office of Policy Planning. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Our greatest presidents were by and large men who kept their private thoughts and feelings to themselves and didn't share them with many others, even while they projected larger than life public personas on the national stage. Donald Trump, on the other hand, and not to put too fine a point on it, seems to say what's on his mind in public; he's unscripted and unplugged and far too often does not fully appreciate the consequences his words carry.\u000a\u000aStill, even by Trumpian standards, the leaked transcripts of his two conversations with Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull are quite revealing in both style and substance. Indeed, in addition to raising the obvious question of why there seem to be so many leaks in this White House, the conversations reflect Trump's thinking on how his world relates to the foreign leaders with whom he's dealing.\u000a\u000aThese calls were made within the first month of his presidency, and he has likely learned a lot since then. But the initial read reveals a man so focused on his own needs and requirements that he can't seem to make much room for anyone else's.\u000a\u000aWhy the leaks?\u000a\u000aIn our nearly six decades of working at the State Department, it's our assessment that leaks generally fall into five categories: personal, political, bureaucratic, policy, and authorized. We don't know who is responsible for what appears to be mainly unauthorized leaking. Among the possibilities, it could be individuals from other agencies who resent the President's trash talking and budget cutting that threaten their mission, leadership and credibility. It could be individuals within the White House who are out to discredit or diminish their rivals or to advance their own personal agendas amid the cacophony of voices surrounding the President.\u000a\u000aWhat has been remarkable about the Trump White House is that, with a few exceptions, all of the leaks have been in the first three categories; they involved neither unauthorized disclosure of sensitive national security information nor the airing out of disagreements over foreign policy.\u000a\u000aBut take away the dysfunction -- the self-inflicted wounds over "Russiagate," the un-presidential behavior, the gross incompetence in managing policy and the White House's legislative agenda, and a totally disorganized White House operation -- and it's a good bet that most of the leaks would have never occurred.\u000a\u000aMaster negotiator?\u000a\u000aDuring the campaign, Trump prided himself on cutting the best deals for America and driving a stake through the heart of every agreement or major legislative achievement negotiated by his predecessor, such as the Paris Climate Accord and perhaps soon the Iran nuclear deal.\u000a\u000aAnd yet despite his bluster in both conversations on the building of the border wall that Mexico is going to pay for and the agreement to take a limited number of refugees from Australia, it's stunning how quickly the master of the "Art of the Deal" backs off his opening positions and implicitly concedes that they were just ploys.\u000a\u000aAfter the Mexican President adamantly but courteously opines that "Mexico cannot pay for that wall," Trump responds "but you cannot say that to the press," all but admitting that he knows Mexico won't pay for the wall. He is far more concerned -- even obsessed -- that the Mexican President not undermine his political position at home.\u000a\u000aAnd by the end of his very tough talk with Turnbull, who keeps pressing Trump on Obama's commitment to take the 1,250 refugees who had tried to enter Australia by boat, Trump succumbs, arguing to save face that it's a "disgusting deal" but he'd honor "my predecessor's deal."\u000a\u000aThese calls demonstrate in stunning fashion that, however unpleasant the conversations, both Pena Nieto and Turnbull got what they wanted and, in the process, the best of Trump.\u000a\u000aIt's all and always about Me\u000a\u000aTalk about a political tin ear. The President of the United States asks the President of Mexico to lie in public just to protect Trump with his base. The "ask" reflects a remarkable degree of both naiveté and cynicism. For a President who seems obsessed with playing to his base, it never seemed to occur to him that Pena Nieto has to protect not only his own base, but also his credibility and standing among all Mexicans.\u000a\u000aTrump is focused on his own image and needs, incapable of understanding or empathizing with Pena Nieto's political needs. And because Trump has only a casual relationship with the truth and thinks nothing of misleading the American public, he naturally assumed that his Mexican counterpart would be equally unburdened by the same norms.\u000a\u000aWhy the contention?\u000a\u000aIt's striking how quickly the tone of the conversation with both leaders escalated, largely because of Trump's aggressiveness, impatience and inability to have his own way. The President seems to have little sense that building relationships requires time and the capacity to listen with a measure of empathy, even though he may not agree.\u000a\u000aIn a first conversation as President (as opposed to conversations during a campaign as a candidate), he needed to be ready to accept the dictum that you rarely get a second chance to make a first impression. Trump seems oblivious to this rather elemental law of human interaction as evidenced by his outbursts with Turnbull -- a close American ally with whom he has little reason to argue, let alone offend.\u000a\u000a"I have had it," Trump exploded after an exchange on refugees. "I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day." And then in another gratuitous remark he goes on to refer to Putin as a "pleasant call," as if the Russian leader represented some paragon of virtue and courteousness in comparison with a longstanding US ally.\u000a\u000aIt's not surprising but still utterly incomprehensible why Trump accords this protected political space to a US adversary and explodes in friendly first contact with a close American neighbor and ally. One can only imagine how Trump would perform in a true crisis situation negotiating with a recalcitrant ally or a tough-minded adversary if he cannot handle pro-forma introductory calls with friendly partners.\u000a\u000aKnowing what you don't know\u000a\u000aFormer Secretary of State James Baker had an alliterative expression that he learned from his grandfather about success in life and politics. "Prior preparation prevents poor performance." And having worked for Baker, we know he lived it. The notion that you have to know what you don't know and be in a hurry to find out is one of the key attributes of a successful presidency, too.\u000a\u000aThese transcripts don't reveal highly classified information or state secrets. What they do reflect is a president who was not prepared for these conversations, was unfamiliar with the issues and focused on politics rather than policy, and was bereft of any sense of the leaders with whom he was dealing.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aMaybe Gen. John Kelly, his new chief of staff, will be able to stop the leaks and manage to bring the White House staff into line. Perhaps he can help ensure that Trump is as well-briefed as he can be for his encounter with foreign leaders.\u000a\u000aWhat Kelly cannot easily do is alter Trump's temperament and instill the judgment, wisdom and emotional intelligence required for real leadership. Today America faces trying times at home and abroad.

aVFARMINGTON, Wis. (WLUK) -- The Waupaca County Sheriff's Office says a 15-year-old boy died after being accidentally shot by a 17-year-old friend.\u000a\u000aIt happened before 1 p.m. Wednesday on Rieben Road in the Town of Farmington.\u000a\u000aThe boy, Jacob Peglow of Waupaca, was shot in the shoulder and chest area with a .22 caliber firearm, Sheriff Brad Hardel said. People at the scene helped the teen until paramedics arrived, but he didn't survive.\u000a\u000aInvestigators say the teens were playing with the gun, which they did not think was loaded.\u000a\u000aSheriff's officials don't anticipate any charges being filed, calling it a "tragic accident."\u000a\u000aCounseling services are being offered to the families and responding officers. Counseling services are also being sought for friends of the victim at his school.\u000a\u000a"Kids being kids," Waupaca County Sheriff Brad Hardel said.\u000a\u000aBut that led to one teenage boy accidentally shooting and killing another teenage boy, according to Hardel.\u000a\u000a"Just an unfortunate accident," he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVThe former president on climate change, curiosity, and what it means to be a leader\u000a\u000aThe office where I met Clinton high in the UN headquarters building belongs to another era. It is an institution built for a world of the past -- one based on Cold War rivalries and the last century's balance of power. It was Clinton's first day in the cramped space, and his entourage of bodyguards and assistants were stumbling over one another in the confines. The Secret Service men dispatched a young press aide to inquire why so many UN staffers were loitering near the elevators, though it was clear that they were simply trying to catch a glimpse of the ex-president.\u000a\u000a"Is this the office?" an exhausted Clinton asked after shaking my hand. I nodded, as did most of the swarm that followed him. The entire place felt as if it hadn't been touched since the early fifties when the building was raised, a lone skyscraper above an otherwise flat block on the East Side of Manhattan. I heard him chuckle to a staffer as he stepped inside, "You know what," -- 'wahut,' the final word came out -- "It kinda reminds me of Mad Men. Have you seen that show yet?"\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliam Jefferson Blythe III never met his father, a traveling salesman who died in a car accident three months before Bill was born. He took the name Clinton from his hard-drinking and abusive stepfather, Roger, who Bill, at fourteen, demanded never hit his mother again. He hid the abuse from most people in his life. As a junior at Georgetown University, though, he shuttled back and forth to Durham, North Carolina on weekends to make peace with his dying stepfather as he underwent cancer treatments. Clinton almost never drinks; he sleeps little and speaks without reprieve. On the day that we met, the topics of his endless seminar ranged from the evolution of the light bulb to early twentieth-century American film to the beauty of Columbia's Aburrá Valley and Medellín.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most interesting dimension of his character is the pace with which he lives. "He had said to everybody over and over and over again," Chelsea Clinton has said, "that none of the men in his family live past sixty, or much past." As a result, he has always moved at a rather reckless pace, trying to accomplish as much as possible before a short clock -- either real, imagined, or prophetically self-fulfilling -- ticks to a stop.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs members of my generation look around the world today, we see climate change on the rise and nothing in the way of a successor for the Kyoto Protocol, the proliferation of nuclear weapons still un abated, Millennium Development Goals we're still well short of, a hugely imbalanced global economy that will continue to undermine itself, and I wonder if you worry that you and this post-Cold War generation of leaders will be judged harshly by history?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNo. I think that's a cheap trick. I mean, all of this "the greatest generation is World War II?" -- it just happens that they're the most horrible parents in human history, right?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf all of us baby boomers were so bad, then our parents were terrible; they failed. And if we were so bad, how come our kids are so great? We were hellaciously good parents.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI think it's phony as a $3 bill. I think they had a chance to win World War II and it was clear. These are much more complex things [now]. We have no idea if the World War II generation would have made the decisions they should make on climate change if they thought doing so would bring an end to their economic prosperity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe real problem in climate change is that we're paying for our past success. The established order has too many self-protecting economic entities, and not enough people who yet understand what it takes to change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe World War II generation was thrown into a war by a madman, Hitler, and an expansionist empire in Japan, and we did what we had to do. Look, I admire the World War II generation; I'm just trying to make a point here. I don't think there are defective generations. There are times and struggles and they present different challenges.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI believe the United States will pass reasonably good climate change legislation, I believe we will get a successor that will be better than Kyoto, and I think that we're in a race against time and circumstance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis will be calamitous if we don't do something about it, and the population of the earth will drop hugely over the next 1,000 years, maybe over the next 200 years, if we don't do something about it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe're really in a race against time. I think history is a relay race and you just got to keep handing off and making things happen. I'm basically pretty optimistic.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhere the intersection of science and politics is on climate change, I'd leave to others. We might lose. Our minds may not be able to expand enough collectively to avert the worst.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI think most people are more literal and they learn things in a serial fashion. Most people have all they can do to keep body and soul together -- even before this economic collapse -- raise their kids, pay their taxes, worry about how to pay for college, deal with their mother's health, and everything.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt just takes time to change the mindset, but we're a much more communitarian country and a much more communitarian world than we were 20 years ago. I basically think you've got to get people's attitudes right, and then they have to have a general analysis that's right, and you have to organize for action. And you just have to stumble in the right direction. I'm pretty upbeat about it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen you're my age, I hope you're dealing with a different set of problems. There'll always be problems, but that's what I hope will happen\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Leopolus, a childhood friend of yours, used to joke with friends that if they were bored, they could always go and watch you read.

The Democratic presidential primary of 2008 muddled the esteem that had ballooned during eight years of gaffes and incompetence by his successor in the Oval Office. During that span, Clinton largely redefined the post- presidential years; he circled the globe as a nimble, intrepid freelancer, leveraging charisma and a seemingly limitless Rolodex for both the broader good and personal gain."Clinton is a nonprofit conglomerate," says one former advisor and long-time friend. It's not an in- accurate characterization. His work fittingly mirrors the rise of social networking and the Internet, a two-point-zero version of previous post-presidential benevolence.Among his most important accomplishments is his success drastically reducing the cost of life-saving anti-retro viral treatment for AIDS victims around the world. The latest round of deals with pharmaceutical companies -- on the heels of others that have helped two million people access treatment -- drops the cost of second-line regiments, for those whose illnesses have overcome first line drugs, by 60 percent. Commitments to charitable work made each year by individuals and corporations attending the Clinton Global Initiative conference reach into the billions of dollars. He launched a ten-year $100 million campaign against extreme poverty in Rwanda and Malawi and, in 2005, raised over a $120 million following Hurricane Katrina with George H. W. Bush.As president, his achievements were matched by equally notable shortfalls. He presided over a massive expansion of economic growth, generating surpluses of $122 billion and $230 billion during his last two years in office; he waged a successful campaign to stem genocide in Kosovo, and greatly expanded free trade and global commerce. But his failure to intervene in Rwanda, where some 800,000 were massacred, or to move effectively to stop genocide in Bosnia, or to advance middle east peace, marked high-profile failures. Domestically, he was unable to pass comprehensive health care reform and ambitious campaign finance reforms. He signed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, which had raised a wall between the speculative trading and underwriting of investment banks and the more traditional lending of commercial, depository banks. The law had been in place since the 1930s. Its elimination helped inflate the massive bubble that burst in the 2007 financial collapse, and meant commercial institutions, like Bank of America and Citibank, were allowed to assume massive risk in the form of housing market credit derivatives. They, of course, had to be bailed out to protect the broader economy. "I think they were wrong," he told ABC in April 2010, referring to his economics advisors, "and I think I was wrong to take [their advice]." The Monica Lewinsky scandal and a myriad of other sex-related allegations forever scarred his legacy and remains the first thought for many when his name is invoked.But for most of those who've had the chance to interact with Clinton, his warmth and intelligence overpower the more lurid details that special prosecutor Ken Starr seared into the American conscience. Clinton is surprisingly tender in person, a gentle handshake matches the soft white hair and the unmistakable bulb nose.He has been called the Michael Jordan of politics, an apt comparison in terms of both talent and intensity. Stan Greenberg, who worked as a consultant for both of Clinton's bids for the White House, recalled Clinton's rage at a Ross Perot attack in the closing days of the 1992 campaign: "They are attacking my character and we must attack Perot's character." He went on, speaking over the phone with aides after a long day of campaigning, "We need to take a meat axe to his brain, cut his head open." He demanded a response that was "red meat and passion, no more pussy ads."

aV(CNN) Last year, Kraig Moss sold the equipment for his construction business in upstate New York and stopped making mortgage payments so he could follow Donald Trump on the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aThe amateur country crooner sang pro-Trump ditties while strumming a guitar emblazoned with Trump campaign stickers, earning him the moniker "Trump Troubadour."\u000a\u000aBut now, Moss refuses to play the guitar with the Trump decorations. He's soured on the President because of the newly proposed Republican health care bill.\u000a\u000aThat legislation, which the president supports, could result in dramatic cuts in addiction treatment services.\u000a\u000aThree years ago, Moss found his son, Rob, dead in his bed from a heroin overdose. He was 24.\u000a\u000a"The bill is an absolute betrayal of what Trump represented on the campaign trail," he said. "I feel betrayed."\u000a\u000aMoss feels it personally.\u000a\u000aLast year, at a campaign rally in Iowa, Trump reached out and spoke directly to Moss about Rob's death.\u000a\u000a"In all fairness to your son, it's a tough thing. Some very, very strong people have not been able to get off (heroin)," Trump called out to Moss in the crowd. "The biggest thing we can do in honor of your son ... we have to be able to stop it."\u000a\u000aWhen Moss became emotional, Trump comforted him.\u000a\u000a"I know what you went through. And he's a great father. I can see it. And your son is proud of you. Your son is proud of you," Trump said. "I'll bet he was a great boy."\u000a\u000aKraig Moss, a supporter of Donald Trump during the campaign, sings a song outside a truck with a Trump painting last year in Iowa. Now, he regrets doing so.\u000a\u000aSeveral times on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to increase services for people facing addiction.\u000a\u000a"We will help all of those people so seriously addicted. We'll get them assistance," he told the crowd at a campaign event in New Hampshire in October.\u000a\u000aMoss trusted Trump.\u000a\u000a"I truly believe from the heart that (Trump) is going to do everything he can. He's going to create treatment centers for the kids," he said last year.\u000a\u000aBut last week, Moss read about the proposed American Health Care Act. The Republican bill would end the Obamacare requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program -- which include Moss' home state of New York.\u000a\u000a"This bill would devastate efforts to address the opioid crisis," said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, director of the Bloomberg American Health Initiative at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "There's no question this legislation in the House of Representatives would cost American lives."\u000a\u000a, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was asked about the bill's provisions for opioid treatment. At a CNN town hall event last weekHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was asked about the bill's provisions for opioid treatment.\u000a\u000aHe responded that state governors had "wonderful ideas about how to address it" but that they felt "hamstrung by the federal government."\u000a\u000a"There are wonderful ways if we keep the focus on the patient -- not the government, but on the patient," he said.\u000a\u000aMoss looks back on his days on the campaign trail, on how he sold his trucks to finance the trip, how he sang his heart out and went from restaurant to restaurant to hand out "Donald Trump for President" CDs.\u000a\u000aKraig Moss, once dubbed "Trump Troubadour," now feels betrayed by the candidate over the proposed health care bill.\u000a\u000a"I did a lot to promote his candidacy," he said. "Now, I wish I had never sold my equipment."\u000a\u000aBut he doesn't like to think about regrets. He's looking to the future.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, more than 300 people showed up in 6-degree weather for a fundraiser Moss organized in his son's memory.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHe raised $3,000 for a local drug treatment center, but he said the greatest gift of the evening was that people who'd lost loved ones to drug addiction came together and comforted one another.\u000a\u000a"We all felt less alone," he said.

aVPhotos: The A to Z of watches A is for Accuracy \u2013 Though quartz watches and atomic clocks (like the one that controls your smartphone) will always be more accurate than even the best mechanical watch, the pursuit of high precision in mechanics is still alive today. The fascination behind achieving precision timekeeping in a watch with gears and a mainspring, rather than a battery and an integrated circuit, is a big part of what's kept traditional watchmaking alive in the 21st century. Hide Caption 1 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches B is for Breguet \u2013 Abraham-Louis Breguet was one of the most inventive watchmakers who ever lived. Perhaps his most famous invention is a type of watch called a tourbillon. To prevent gravity negatively affecting accuracy, Breguet put the most critical parts of a watch in a tiny, rotating cage (the word "tourbillon" means "whirlwind" in French). The company he founded is still alive today, making tourbillon watches, for a very select clientele.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 2 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches C is for Chronograph \u2013 You can tell a chronograph by the presence of smaller dials within the larger dial, for reading off elapsed time, as well as buttons set into the side of the case for starting, stopping and re-setting the stopwatch function. (Chronographs are often confused by watch newbies with chronometers, watches guaranteed to perform to a certain accuracy standard.) Chronographs are often associated with motorsports and aviation. One famous model, the Omega Speedmaster, was standard issue for Apollo astronauts and is still used in manned space flight today. Hide Caption 3 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches D is for Dive Watches \u2013 If there's one type of watch that competes with the chronograph for popularity, it's the dive watch. Watches designed for diving first appeared in the late 1930s, from naval suppliers like the Italian firm Panerai. However, the modern dive watch dates back to the mid-1950s, when Blancpain's 50 Fathoms and Rolex's Submariner both appeared. These watches established the design of modern dive watches: significant water resistance; a screwed-down winding and setting crown; instant legibility and a rotating bezel (the grooved ring which holds the watch face in place) for timing dive times and decompression stops.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aToday the term "dive watch" is regulated by an international standard that requires those features, as well as a minimum of 100 meters' (328 feet) water resistance. But the appeal of the dive watch is so wide that most are worn by owners who'll never dive at all.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 4 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches E is for Escapement \u2013 Imagine a pendulum swinging back and forth. If you have a mechanism to keep the pendulum swinging and additional parts for counting the swings, you have a clock. In a mechanical watch, a mainspring keeps the watch going (that's right, a mechanical watch is a wind-up toy) and instead of a pendulum, a balance-wheel swinging on hair-fine steel pivots oscillates back and forth, but the principle is the same: there's a mechanism for keeping it swinging, and counting the swings. This is the escapement. Fun fact: the lever escapement, used in virtually all modern watches, was invented in England in 1755. Hide Caption 5 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches F is for Flat \u2013 Recently there's been a huge revival of interest in extra-flat watches. Making this type of watch presents big challenges. Extreme care and precision are necessary to achieve accuracy and reliability. Traditional leaders in the field, like Jaeger-LeCoultre, Vacheron Constantin, and Piaget, vie to create ultra-elegant ultra-flat watches, but relative newcomers like Bulgari make excellent examples as well. Hide Caption 6 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches G is for Grand Seiko \u2013 Think Switzerland is the only country making killer timepieces? Think again. Seiko is often thought of as a maker of entry-level quartz watches and tough but affordable mechanicals, but they also make Grand Seiko, a range of watches with quality fit, finish, and precision. For many years, Grand Seikos were made in small numbers and only available in Japan but today they are increasingly sold internationally. They offer a level of quality that would cost significantly more from a Swiss manufacturer, which is why they've been a watch insider's cult favorite for many years. Hide Caption 7 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches H is for Hermès \u2013 Though their watch straps are legendary among aficionados (the high-end brand Parmigiani Fleurier is known to source most of their straps from Hermès), they also make a wide range of fashion-forward wristwatches, as well as unusual, complicated mechanical watches and even pocket watches, often decorated with beautiful engraving and enameling. Hide Caption 8 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches I is for IWC \u2013 The International Watch Company of Schaffhaussen, Switzerland, is an anomaly. The Swiss firm was founded in the late 19th century by an American Civil War veteran by the name of Florentine Ariosto Jones, who was one of the first to attempt to introduce American manufacturing methods to the Swiss watch industry. Today, IWC is perhaps best known for its many high-profile film tie-ins, but behind that is a company that's made some of the most famous "tool" watches of all time. This includes their Aquatimer dive watches and the legendary "Mark" series of antimagnetic pilot's watches, which were widely used by both military and civilian flyers post-World War II, and are still in production today. Hide Caption 9 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches J is for Jaquet Droz \u2013 Jaquet Droz is named for an 18th-century watchmaker who was also famous for making automatons, clockwork robots that could perform tasks in a human-like fashion. Today the company keeps this tradition alive with its own automaton wristwatches. At the top of the heap: the "Charming Bird" wristwatch in which a tiny robot bird spins and chirps a song, thanks to a built-in mechanical pipe organ. Hide Caption 10 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches K is for Key Wound Watches \u2013 If you don't know what a key-wound watch is, don't worry -- they've been gradually falling out of fashion since the mid-1800s. But once upon a time, all watches were wound by sticking a key into the back and turning it. It was troublesome, and often led to dirt inside the watch where it shouldn't be. (In a Sherlock Holmes story, the great detective deduces that a man was a drunk from the many scratches around the hole for the winding key on his pocket watch.) Nowadays, you can wind and set a watch just by turning the crown, or pulling the crown out to set the time -- the first modern version of this system was developed by the high-end watchmaking firm of Patek Philippe in 1845. Today such mechanisms are called "keyless works." Hide Caption 11 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches L is for Luminova \u2013 The first clocks and watches with glowing hands used an incredibly dangerous radium-based paint that was bright, beautiful and, unfortunately, highly radioactive. Many of the workers who applied radium paint succumbed to cancers. Nowadays, most watches with glow-in-the-dark hands use a material called Luminova. It may not glow spontaneously like radium (it needs to be "charged" by exposure to light), but it is completely safe. Hide Caption 12 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches M is for Magnetism \u2013 This was particularly a problem for anyone working around electrical equipment -- pilots, for instance, since airplane engines generate strong fields. Rolex developed its magnetism-resistant Milgauss in the 1950s for industrial and scientific engineers and technicians. Today, Omega makes a watch -- the Seamaster Aqua Terra -- that is so immune to magnetism that it won't even be thrown off by the powerful magnetic field of an MRI machine.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 13 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches N is for Nanotechnology \u2013 To make watches more reliable, accurate, and durable, modern watchmaking uses manufacturing methods capable of producing micron-level precision, from computer-guided milling machines (standard in watchmaking today) to nanotech manufacturing techniques like silicon fabrication and even more exotic methods like the micro-lithography technique known as LIGA. A watchmaker from 100 years ago would understand how a watch of today works, but the processes would make his jaw drop. Hide Caption 14 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches O is for Omega \u2013 Over the course of its history, Omega has been an industry leader in just about every way that matters. They've developed everything from wristwatches and marine chronometers, to pioneering watches for deep diving and ocean exploration. Omega timepieces have been just about everywhere -- including space. The Omega Speedmaster's most famous moment as "the Moonwatch" came when it was used by the Apollo 13 crew to time critical firing of their crippled spaceship's rocket to ensure a safe reentry. (Cabin instruments were shut down to save precious battery power.) Hide Caption 15 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches P is for Patek Philippe \u2013 Founded in 1851, the name has, since its inception, been synonymous with the very highest level of finesse. Patek Philippe's watches are beautifully crafted, often mechanically innovative and, just as importantly, they're some of the most collectible and valuable watches on the planet. Want proof? Patek Philippe watches routinely break and set records. The highest price ever paid at auction was by an anonymous collector who, in 2015, paid $24.4 million for an ultra-complex pocket watch made in the 1930s for American banker Henry Graves. Hide Caption 16 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches Q is for Quartz \u2013 Though they're commonplace nowadays, quartz watches were not only the very hottest thing in watchmaking, but also coveted luxury items when they were first released. The very first quartz watch ever was Seiko's Astron, which went on sale in Japan on Christmas, 1969, and cost as much as a new car. Mass production and lowered manufacturing costs meant that eventually anyone could have chronometer accuracy on their wrist. Many thought the so-called "Quartz Crisis" would kill off mechanical watches completely, but today, fine mechanical and durable, dependable watches, like Casio's famous G-Shock, happily coexist in the marketplace.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 17 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches R is for Rolex \u2013 People who've never heard of any other watch company have heard of Rolex. And for good reason: no company has been so successful at insinuating itself into the public mind as this Swiss watch brand. Rolexes have been seen on innumerable wrists in the movies, starting with Sean Connery's Bond. The classic novice's goof is to think of Rolex as all show and no go, but real horological insiders know that Rolex's movements are some of the most accurate, robust and reliable on the planet. Hide Caption 18 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches S is for Silicon \u2013 Lighter than steel and, critically, non-magnetic, silicon has a huge advantage over traditional alloys. Silicon is part of what's behind the resistance to magnetism of Omega watches, and you might be surprised to hear that Patek Philippe, a company that's identified with doing things the old-fashioned way, has embraced silicon technology for moving parts in many of its watches as well. Hide Caption 19 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches T is for Timex \u2013 Timex is an older company than most might imagine. It was originally founded in 1854 as the Waterbury Watch Company and, in one form or another, has been around ever since. Timex was one of the first brands to make inexpensive watches accessible to the masses. The brand continues that tradition today. Their biggest hit in advertising was a series of TV ads in which they would do spectacular torture tests -- involving things like jackhammers, paint mixers, and outboard motors -- and then show the watch running unscathed, with the world-famous tagline: "Takes a licking and keeps on ticking." Hide Caption 20 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches U is for UTC \u2013 These watches have an extra hour hand that shows the time in a different time zone. Typically, the main hour hand can be reset, independently of the other hands, in one-hour increments as you cross time zones while traveling, so it always shows the correct local time. A second hour hand, pegged to a 24-hour scale, shows home time, so at a glance you can see the time where you are, and the time at home. The classic model is the Rolex GMT Master, originally produced by the company for Pan Am pilots to help fight jet lag. Hide Caption 21 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches V is for Vintage Watch Collecting \u2013 Vintage watch collectors are incredibly varied in terms of what catches their eye, and focuses can be narrow and intense. Some people, for instance, collect only vintage Rolex Submariners with rare or unusual dials. You need deep pockets if you're one of them: vintage Rolex, like vintage Patek, have skyrocketed in price in the last decade, with some vintage Omega models, like the Speedmaster, not far behind. But buyer beware: the incredible prices some vintage watches routinely hit at auction have made creating fakes a lucrative business.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 22 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches W is World Time Watch \u2013 A ring on the dial, showing the names of major cities in each time zone, has inside it a 24-hour disc that rotates once a day. Whichever hour is lined up with a given city is the current time in that city. A practical and beautiful complication, its only drawbacks are that it can't compensate for Daylight Savings time, and that some time zones are not a whole hour apart. However, some modern manufacturers have created world time watches that show the time even in those oddball time zones -- a beautiful, if pricey, example is the Traditionnelle World Time wristwatch from Vacheron Constantin.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 23 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches X is for Xtremely Tough \u2013 The inventor of G-Shock is Casio engineer Kikuo Ibe, whose beloved mechanical watch broke accidentally. He then vowed to make a watch that was unbreakable. The first G-Shocks came out in the mid-1980s and they were tough alright. Ibe famously tested prototypes by throwing them out of the fourth-floor men's room window at Casio's research laboratory, into the parking lot below. Hide Caption 24 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches Y is for Year \u2013 The challenge is that there aren't a whole number of days in a year. Instead, it's about 365 and a quarter days to make one trip around the Sun -- which is why months are different lengths, and why February has a day added once every four years to keep the calendar in sync with the seasons. The watchmaker's solution is a type of watch called a perpetual calendar. Such watches contain a tiny mechanical computer that automatically detects the correct length of each month, and always displays the correct date -- even at the end of February in a leap year. These watches are traditionally very expensive, but a major trend nowadays is creating more affordable perpetual calendar watches, like the Montblanc Meisterstück Heritage Perpetual Calendar, which starts at less than $10,000.

aVStory highlights Julian Zelizer: Some Republicans are publicly criticizing President Trump\u000a\u000aBut it would be hard for them to really dissociate themselves from him\u000a\u000aJulian Zelizer is a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University and the author of "The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society." He's also the co-host of the "Politics & Polls" podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) More and more Republicans are becoming openly critical of President Trump. The GOP congressional delegations who control the House and Senate headed home last week without any major legislation to show for their first six months of united government and Trump himself went on vacation.\u000a\u000aIn recent weeks, we've seen Sen. John McCain defy the President by sinking the effort to repeal Obamacare. Sen. Lindsey Graham warned Trump to back off his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions or it would be the beginning of the end of his presidency. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake published a new book lambasting Republicans for remaining silent as they watch the dysfunction of this administration play out in real time. People are already speculating about potential primary challengers to Trump, should he run for reelection in 2020.\u000a\u000aAnd a growing number of conservative pundits feel comfortable expressing doubts about President Trump, even in the conservative holy land of Fox News.\u000a\u000aBut this is not an easy stance for Republicans. In fact, they own President Trump. They can try to disassociate themselves from him, but they and their party are as culpable as anyone for creating a path in American politics that allowed him to win election and to govern in the way that he does. He is in fact a Republican, given what the party has become, and is not some maverick who has stolen away the party. It wasn't that he outwitted the Republican establishment, it's that the Republican establishment has changed.\u000a\u000aTo understand the roots of President Trump, it is vital to remember that the Republican Party thus far has generally stood behind him and his agenda. Evangelical voters entered into a Faustian bargain with their support for a candidate who personally seems to be the antithesis of everything that their movement supports.

aVArguably, other than World War II, no conflict has been subject to as many interpretations, examinations or adaptations as America's controversial intervention into South East Asian geopolitics.\u000a\u000aThe key texts, such as Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now," Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter," Paul Hardcastle's "19" and Credence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son," depict the war as vivid, violent, surreal and futile. They often recreate the drug-fueled experiences of American soldiers and the unspeakable things they saw in that strange war.\u000a\u000aBut with the benefit of time and distance, younger artists are channeling their childhood perceptions of the war into bold new work.\u000a\u000aWhy Vietnam?\u000a\u000aConcerning Vietnam " -- which opens in September at the David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles -- looks at the war from a very different perspective, moving away from the frontline towards places of detachment: the offices of the US Presidents who made the orders and the cockpits of helicopter pilots.\u000a\u000a"Why Vietnam?" Brannon pondered on the phone from his studio in New York. "It's such a simple question, but so large. It's really the question that still plagues America and has ripped apart a few presidencies."\u000a\u000a"My own personal interest in Vietnam has always been there but, for a long time, I was hesitant to investigate it," he explained. "I think that says something about my generation. I was born in the Nixon years, it was the last thing anyone wanted to talk about."\u000a\u000aBrannon's interpretations of the war don't conform to the usual tropes of Vietnam-inspired films and books.\u000a\u000aThere are no decorated helmets or napalm fires here -- his visions come in the form of clean, cartoonish collages and prints that could almost be mistaken for tasteful birthday cards if it wasn't for the subject matter.\u000a\u000aCropped view of "Bell UH-1D Iroquois, Cockpit" (2016-2017) by Matthew Brannon\u000a\u000aFor Brannon, his unusual approach to Vietnam adds a certain depth: "I'm very interested in a first read and a second read," he explained. "I want the second read to be the more complicated one ... but I want someone to like it before they understand it."\u000a\u000a"Even with this project, on the most difficult of subject matters, I've tried to make it so that as a viewer you're still drawn to it. There's no blood, no burned out buildings, there is something in not beginning from a place of upset that allows for a longer, slower read. I think part of the American consciousness is that we want to know what side everyone is on, we want shorter answers, and I'm interested in complexity."\u000a\u000aCropped view of "Situation Room - February, 1965" by Matthew Brannon (2016)\u000a\u000aFor Brannon this project isn't so much an anti-war statement, but a rumination, not just on Vietnam but the American predisposition towards war, which he believes is still there today.\u000a\u000a"Often when artists make art about war it's usually very clear: war is bad. What I'm trying to say is that this is not protest art. I see myself acting as more of a historian or a biographer, I'm taking one war and trying to understand it, and I'm allowing the viewer to make whatever bridges they can to our contemporary situation."\u000a\u000aA borderline obsession\u000a\u000aLooking at the works, full of recreated documents and artifacts from the time, it's clear that this is an extremely thorough process, a borderline obsession perhaps.\u000a\u000a"Research is the horizon of the work," he confirmed. "I pick a moment in time and then I read and read, swimming around it, coming closer and closer. With my books, half of it is going to be bibliography and footnotes. I usually end up with a pile of notes and it gets closer to being visual art at that point. I've read tens and thousands of pages. There are times when I've become overwhelmed by it."\u000a\u000a"Chipped Teeth, 2016" by Matthew Brannon\u000a\u000aA major theme within these works seems to be the disconnect between the banality of everyday -- the paper envelopes and coffee dispensers on presidents' desks -- and the terrible acts that these innocuous items belie.\u000a\u000a"I think that's always been there in everything I've done. I like to be able to show a bottle of baby shampoo and show there's something disturbing in it. In this case there's a tension between something that's innocent and something that's very much not, there's a traction and a repulsion that's constantly in emotion.\u000a\u000a"One of the most potent things about visual art is that it can hover in a space like this. One that's very different to a film or a book."\u000a\u000aClearly Brannon's take on Vietnam is forged in his approach, which in turn offers us a different perspective and, just maybe, a higher level of understanding when it comes to this great American disaster story.

aVDayton, Ohio (CNN) When Cyndi and Jesse Swafford were certified to become foster parents 10 years ago, they were told to expect to wait for a baby up to two or three years. Fast forward to today -- with a foster license, a new baby can be placed with them within a week.\u000a\u000a"It blows my mind," Cyndi says. "There are babies in the hospital waiting because of this heroin epidemic for a family that will be able to take care of them."\u000a\u000aWalk into the Swafford home and you'll find it filled with baby bottles, cribs and framed family portraits. In the last decade, Cyndi and Jesse have taken in 15 foster children.\u000a\u000a"We're a temporary gap between their parents getting clean and sober, and then, if we can reunify them, we will," Cyndi says.\u000a\u000aFoster care systems in many states are struggling to manage children whose parents are addicted to opioids. Nationally, 32% of children were removed from their homes due to drug abuse by a parent as of September 30, 2015, the most recent data available , according to the US Department of Health and Human Services foster care reporting system.\u000a\u000aIn Ohio, where the Swaffords live, that percentage is even higher . Fifty percent of children taken into custody in 2015 faced parental drug use when they were removed, and 28% of children removed that year had parents using opioids, according to Public Children Services Association of Ohio . "Nearly a third of children in custody are there because of the epidemic, and that number doesn't count many children who continue to be served in their homes or who are placed with kin," the association noted.\u000a\u000aOhio has become the crossroads of the crisis, as the intersection of interstates 70 and 75 has been dubbed by law enforcement the "distribution hub of America," according to Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer. And children of parents addicted to opioids are the "invisible victims of the epidemic," according to the C hildren Services Association.\u000a\u000aOf the 15 foster children Cyndi and Jesse have taken in over the last decade, 13 were there because one or both of their birth parents struggled with drug addiction.\u000a\u000a"I'm confident that if we opened another bed in our home, it would be filled with another baby with an opiate issue," Cyndi says, "It's hard to hold a baby as they are withdrawing from heroin."\u000a\u000aCyndi and Jesse Swafford, shown with their foster, adopted and biological children. CNN obscured a portion of this image to protect the identities of two foster children.\u000a\u000aBetween 2000 and 2013 , the rate of babies born addicted to drugs increased five times in the United States.\u000a\u000aHelen Jones-Kelley, who runs the addiction services and mental health programs in Montgomery County, says foster parents aren't rushing into the system to help the way they have in the past.\u000a\u000a"There's a fearfulness and it's an understandable fearfulness because some of the children are grappling with their own addiction," Jones-Kelley tells CNN. "It's hard to understand that as a foster parent, you have to watch out for things going missing or the potential of a child dying from an overdose while in your care."\u000a\u000aBut Jesse Swafford feels they have a responsibility to help young children of addicts.\u000a\u000a"I hate to say it this way, but we clean up a little bit of the mess, so we need more people to help clean up the messes with us, but it's just normal for us," Jesse says. "People think we're crazy and they don't understand why we do it, or how we do it."\u000a\u000aJewell Good, director of Children and Family Services in Montgomery County, says it's increasingly a challenge to find placement for children of addicts.\u000a\u000a"We've suffered a 25% reduction in foster families over the last year," Good says, "We're investing more this year in recruiting and training foster families."\u000a\u000aChildren of addicts often need special care and counseling, and data shows they are staying in foster care longer because it can take months or years for their parents to get clean. Some never do.\u000a\u000aThe Swafford family has legally adopted two children, and is in the process of adopting a third.\u000a\u000aKalib at 5 years old with Cyndi Swafford.\u000a\u000aTwelve-year-old Kalib and 10-year-old Brandon are biological brothers removed from their birth family in 2008 because of addiction issues. After 18 months in foster care, Cyndi and Jesse Swafford finalized their adoption.\u000a\u000aThe Swaffords have helped Kalib and Brandon deal with the long-term cognitive effects that Cyndi and Jesse believe stem from opioids they were exposed to and the trauma of separation from their birth parents.\u000a\u000a"It's just been a lot better than I would've done with my other parents," Kalib says, "These parents, Mom and Dad, never kept anything from me."\u000a\u000aBut after 10 years, Kalib was ready to reunite with his birth father, James Fuller, who says he has been clean for the last 18 months.\u000a\u000a"It's his choice if he wants to go back on them, but I feel I can help in some way to motivate him to not use it again," says Kalib.\u000a\u000aFuller says he was addicted to heroin for more than a decade. It cost him his family, his job, and even his home.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"It took my whole life from me," Fuller tells CNN anchor Poppy Harlow , "All my children, my job at one time, I was homeless out here for three years.

Many, many jail stays."\u000a\u000aFuller says a recent overdose that nearly killed him is what forced him to get clean.\u000a\u000aAt a park in Dayton, Kalib and his adopted family invited CNN as he reunited with Fuller.\u000a\u000aKalib Swafford sees his birth father, James Fuller, for the first time in 10 years.\u000a\u000a"God, I've missed you so much. Ain't a day went by I haven't thought about you," Fuller says to Kalib. "We were going through so much when you was that age, man. I didn't have no means to get you guys where you guys needed to be. I let you guys just stay where you was. I knew you were well took care of."\u000a\u000a"Glad you're feeling better so I can see you," Kalib told Fuller. "I'm glad now that you are able to be clean."\u000a\u000aThat night, before he went to bed, Kalib told his adopted mother, Cyndi, that reuniting with his birth father, James, was the best day of his life.\u000a\u000aIt's moments like these, Cyndi says, that encourage her and Jesse to continue fostering children of addicts, but she says "the realization that more kids for us means that someone else is hurting in a rough spot ... whether the heroin epidemic comes to an end or not, there's still going to be babies out there."

The county says all of them had been swimming at Lake Wildwood Beach near Grass Valley.\u000a\u000aThe family of one boy spoke with FOX40 on Sunday.\u000a\u000a"He started coming down with symptoms earlier this week, around Monday or Tuesday. Real upset stomach, digestive issues, blood in his stool," said Sara Dunn.\u000a\u000aDunn is the 3-year-old boy's aunt. The family does not want to release his name. But Dunn says her sister, the boy's mother, took him to Lake Wildwood Beach last week and they went swimming near the clubhouse -- a place the Nevada County Public Health Department believes exposed the boy and four others to E. coli.\u000a\u000a"Was taken to Sierra Nevada Tuesday, admitted to ICU shortly afterwards. And was admitted to UC Davis yesterday because he tested positive for E. coli and it's now affecting his kidneys," Dunn said.\u000a\u000aThe health department says five children became very ill, and three have now tested positive for E. coli. Dunn says her nephew knows at least one of the other sick boys, and she believes some adults are also being treated.\u000a\u000a"They are friends, know each other. So they very well might have been there the same day. But, yeah, the mother's also pregnant, who is also affected, and her son," Dunn said.\u000a\u000aThe health department has closed down the beach after water tested there had high levels of fecal coliforms -- bacteria that can cause serious illness.\u000a\u000aThere are wastewater treatment plants near the lake, but the county public works department said it didn't find any leaks and the system appears to be working normally.\u000a\u000aLake Wildwood is a gated community. When FOX40 tried to speak with the administrative offices, a guard at the gate told us to check back Monday.\u000a\u000aDunn feels like more could have been done to prevent people getting sick.\u000a\u000a"Alert residents, posting more signs on beaches, maybe caution don't swim," she said.\u000a\u000aFOX40 didn't see any swimmers at the lake Sunday, but many people were boating and some were even fishing.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Dunn hopes the community prays for her sister's family.\u000a\u000a"I can't imagine the pain and stress. They're holding up OK, the best they can, but it has been hard for all of us," Dunn said.

But in addition to planning a day's activities, it's just as important to think about what you'll be eating during your travels, especially if you don't want to derail your diet.\u000a\u000a"Planning ahead can help you make more nutritious food and beverage choices when you're on the road," said Elisa Zied, registered dietitian and author of "Nutrition at Your Fingertips."\u000a\u000aAnd there are some proven tips, tricks and strategies for eating well at fast food restaurants if you're hitting the road.\u000a\u000aPack a snack bag. Protein- and fiber-rich snacks can help fill in nutrition gaps when pickings are slim. "Before you head out on a road trip, pack some single-serve nut butters and pre-portioned nuts and seeds in baggies," Zied said. Whole-grain crackers and dried fruit are other good road snacks. By pre-portioning snacks, you are less likely to overeat while on the road.\u000a\u000aConsider a cooler. Bringing more diverse snacks in a cooler is a great idea, especially for longer trips. "Fill a cooler with fresh fruit, preferably with peels, or berries in small containers, individually wrapped cheeses, low-fat yogurt or milk boxes, hummus and cut-up veggies," Zied said. You can use these foods in between meals or to help round out fast food fare, she said.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVGeorge Takei is an actor and activist. His Broadway show "Allegiance" screens across cinemas in the United States on the Day of Remembrance, February 19. Follow him on Twitter @GeorgeTakei. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.\u000a\u000aI remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.\u000a\u000aThat was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion. On its face, the order was "neutral," authorizing the military to designate whole swaths of land as military zones, and evacuate any persons from it as they saw fit.\u000a\u000aBut behind that facade lay a much darker purpose: to tear 120,000 innocent Japanese-Americans from their homes along the West Coast and relocate them to 10 prison camps scattered throughout the United States.\u000a\u000aIt didn't matter, back then , that most of us were US citizens and had never even been to Japan. We were presumed guilty, and held without charge for four years, simply because we happened to look like the people who had bombed Pearl Harbor. For that crime, we lost our homes, our livelihoods and our freedoms.\u000a\u000aEvery year, on February 19, we Japanese-Americans honor this day as Remembrance Day, and we renew our pledge to make sure what happened to us never happens again in America. I am always amazed, and saddened, that despite our decadeslong efforts, so many young people today are not even aware that such a tragedy and miscarriage of justice took place here.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Portraits from 'a great injustice' In 1943, legendary photographer Ansel Adams took portraits of Japanese-Americans interned at Manzanar Relocation Camp in California. "The purpose of my work was to show how these people, suffering under a great injustice, and loss of property, businesses and professions, had overcome the sense of defeat and despair by building for themselves a vital community in an arid (but magnificent) environment," Adams stated in a letter written when he offered the collection of images to the Library of Congress.

Instead, he suggested that it was a tough call, and that he "would have had to be there" in order to know whether it was the wrong one.\u000a\u000aI cannot help but hear in these words terrible echoes from the past. The internment happened because of three things: fear, prejudice and a failure of political leadership. When the administration targets groups today, whether for exclusion from travel here on the basis of religion and national origin, or for deportation based on their undocumented status, I know from personal experience that these are not done, as they claim, truly in the name of national security.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Reflecting on life in a WWII prison camp (2016) Replay More Videos ...

These are the acts of a despot, not an elected leader.\u000a\u000aI have dedicated my life to standing against our nation's impulse toward demagoguery and tyranny by the whipped-up masses. The answer lies not just in education, but in empathy. The false narrative -- that there are those who belong here and those who do not -- is designed precisely to divorce us from the truth that we are all here and in this together.\u000a\u000aWe are an interdependent people, sharing a common bond of humanity. The most pernicious aspect of Trump's policies is thus the denial of those basic bonds and that humanity. I will not stand for it, and no people of good conscience should.\u000a\u000aThe question before us, then, on Remembrance Day is a simple one: Will America remember? The internment is not a "precedent," it is a stark and painful lesson. We will only learn from the past if we know, understand and remember it. For if we fail, we most assuredly are doomed to repeat it.

aVStory highlights Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Stephen Miller's use of the word "cosmopolitan" during a discussion of immigration should alarm all Americans.\u000a\u000aThe word has terrible echoes from history, and was used by authoritarians to tag those who oppose them for harassment and worse, she writes\u000a\u000aRuth Ben-Ghiat is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, and professor of history and Italian studies at New York University. Follow her on Twitter @ruthbenghiat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When I was a child, we had a next-door neighbor, an elderly woman. She spoke only to my mother, who was blonde, green-eyed and Scottish. When my dark-skinned father (who was from the Middle East, but often taken for Indian or Hispanic) would cross her path, she would stare stonily into the distance. It was awkward.\u000a\u000aRuth Ben-Ghiat\u000a\u000aMy father was the American citizen, with a security clearance for the contract work he did for the United States Navy, but my mother, a green card holder, was the one who apparently made this lady comfortable. One day my ball went over the fence and I had to knock on her door. I decided to ask her why she only said hello to my mother. Referring to my father, she replied, "I am never sure how good his English is. He seems ... rather cosmopolitan."\u000a\u000aThis episode, and her use -- for whatever reason -- of that curious word, stayed with me, and came back to me Wednesday when President Trump's senior adviser, Stephen Miller, accused CNN's Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta of showing "cosmopolitan bias" in challenging an administration-backed immigration plan. The proposed legislation would sharply limit legal immigration and privilege "skilled" workers for, among other things, speaking English. "It sounds like you're trying to engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country," Acosta said\u000a\u000aIn fact, that's exactly what a long tradition of racist regimes have tried to do, while branding those who oppose them as "cosmopolitan." The word has served as a convenient way to tag people suspected of having extra-national allegiances or elitist cultural tastes, or of being insufficiently "assimilated" because of how they look, speak or live.\u000a\u000aFor both fascist and communist regimes in the 20th century, Jews were the biggest "cosmopolitan" offenders. They were easy to accuse of being somehow foreign. The Jewish community of Rome had been around for thousands of years, and yet was included in Mussolini's 1938 racial laws that targeted Italian Jews, who were widely implicated in the state press as the agents of a "cosmopolitanism" led by a people "without countries, ideals, or traditions."\u000a\u000aRead More

Mark Bryant, the public information officer for the Mobile County Health Department.\u000a\u000aAnother case occurred in April after a local resident consumed raw oysters in Mobile County.\u000a\u000a"Then in June, we had two people that went into the waters south of Mobile County and also were infected," Bryant said.\u000a\u000aInfection with any form of these Vibrio bacteria causes vibriosis, the symptoms of which include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. If Vibrio infects an open wound, it can cause pain, redness and swelling.

aVStory highlights Gerald Early: The NAACP's travel warning is a way to emphasize that Missouri is not only provincial, but dangerously so\u000a\u000aThe challenge to authority symbolizes the burden many African-Americans in Missouri feel as a result of Ferguson, Early writes\u000a\u000aGerald Early is Chair of the Department of African and African American Studies at Washington University in St. Louis and editor of the online journal, The Common Reader. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Missouri may be the borderline reality, the psychic edge, emblematic of the deeply divided American mind itself.\u000a\u000aGerald Early\u000a\u000aThe shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, at the hands of police in 2014 and the violent disorder that resulted from it seem to have both traumatized and energized those of us who live here, radicalized and retrenched us. If some are hoping our breaches can be mended, others are more determined that ever to, as a popular military saying goes, "re-fight the last war." Surely, Ferguson gave us Black Lives Matter ("to whom?" remains a vital question) and the protests against racism at the University of Missouri. It also helped Donald Trump win Missouri last fall and helped Republican Eric Greitens capture the governor's seat after eight years of a Democratic governor, Jay Nixon, tussling with a GOP-controlled legislature.\u000a\u000aThe legislature and Governor Greitens are in the spotlight lately because of Missouri Senate Bill 43 , which goes into effect at the end of this month. The measure drastically shifts the burden of proof from defendant to plaintiff in employment and other discrimination cases. Before, a plaintiff had to show that race or gender bias was a contributing factor to dismissal. Under 43 , the plaintiff must prove that bias was, in effect, the sole reason that explains the treatment he or she received.\u000a\u000aThe NAACP has responded to this bill, which it vigorously opposed for months, by issuing its first ever racial "travel warning," telling African-Americans to take extra care and precaution when traveling in Missouri -- a state whose tourism industry hardly needs the challenge of fighting this particular stigma. No one mistakes the picturesque towns of Ste. Genevieve or Hannibal for the beaches of California or Florida, and the St. Louis Arch, beautiful as it is, is no Grand Canyon. We are, regardless of our resentment toward the idea, flyover country -- not a destination but a route to a destination. The travel warning is a way for the NAACP to emphasize that Missouri is not only provincial, but dangerously so. One way of looking at the travel warning is that the NAACP is saying that blacks are too cosmopolitan to go to places like Missouri in its current political state.\u000a\u000aRepublican and conservative supporters say that the change is part of larger legislative program of tort reform in the state that will make Missouri more attractive to businesses by reducing frivolous or opportunistic lawsuits. Right now, St. Louis has the reputation as one of the capitals of generous tort settlements. Liberal opponents say the bill is itself an act of discrimination against protected minority groups who will not be able to bring suits as readily as they were in the past to combat workplace racism.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 20th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Home to a cool 88 million people, the Yangtze River Delta is the most populated region on Earth. In the center of it all is Shanghai -- China's commercial capital and a must-visit destination\u000a\u000aShopping, ancient gardens, temples and dynamic architecture make it one of the most fascinating megacities. But that's not the only reason to go. Shanghai also happens to be an easy jump-off point for more rustic side trips.\u000a\u000aFrom the canals of Shaoxing to Hangzhou's famous West Lake, China's ancient "water towns" and lush tea plantations are just a 20- to 30-minute bullet train ride away. Here are five day trips you'll enjoy:\u000a\u000a1. Hangzhou\u000a\u000aBoating on West Lake in Hangzhou.\u000a\u000aA 45-minute bullet train ride from Shanghai (on a "D" or "G" train), Hangzhou has been praised by poets and explorers alike (including Marco Polo) as one of the most photogenic places in China.\u000a\u000aThe city revolves around West Lake, which is best explored by bike in the morning, when the byways are empty and willow tree-lined causeways are shrouded in ethereal mist. Around the lake, travelers will find dozens of ancient pagodas, gardens, carp ponds, half-moon bridges and temples -- not to mention easy treks through the hillsides.\u000a\u000aThe majority of hotels -- including a Four Seasons Hotel Hangzhou at West Lake and the historic Shangri-La Hotel, Hangzhou -- are along the western shores. Nearby, a cluster of gardens and islands were once part of Emperor Qianlong's holiday palace, back in the 19th century.\u000a\u000aBut the countryside is half the reason to go. Outside of town, travelers can explore the Dragon Well Tea Village for fresh air and Longjing green tea.\u000a\u000a2. Shaoxing\u000a\u000aA fan shop in Shaoxing.\u000a\u000aA 20-minute bullet train ride southeast of Hangzhou will drop travelers in Shaoxing, which -- perhaps optimistically -- has been dubbed the "Venice of Asia." A small city (by China's terms) of 5 million, Shaoxing is best known for its romantic canals and stone bridges.\u000a\u000aMore than 4,000 bridges connect the cityscape and a stroll along the cobbled pathways will take you past traditional white houses with slate-tiled roofs. Shaoxing is also famous for its literary history, once home to Chinese scholar Zhou Enlai and famous writer Lu Xun.\u000a\u000aMost of the action revolves around the eponymous Lu Xun Road pedestrian strip, where travelers can walk through Lu Xun's 19th-century residence.\u000a\u000aThe most charming hotel in Shaoxing is the Xianheng Hotel , which dates back to 1894 -- supposedly opened by the writer's uncle. Here you'll find beautiful lotus ponds, antique furniture and a restaurant serving traditional Shaoxing cuisine. And what exactly is that?\u000a\u000aTravelers will find stinky tofu, braised pork belly and Shaoxing wine (a Chinese rice wine) -- said to be made with special water from the nearby Jianhu-Mirror Lake and then buried underground to mature.\u000a\u000a3. Moganshan\u000a\u000aThe villa at Le Passage Moganshan.\u000a\u000aAbout a 30-minute drive northwest of Hangzhou, or 2.5 hours southwest of Shanghai, the small village of Moganshan is a refuge for nature lovers. Part of the beauty of Moganshan is there's not too much to do, aside from explore the bamboo forests and tea plantations.\u000a\u000aA typical day might include an easy bike ride through the hills, a tea tasting, a bit of lounging by the pool or a zip-line outing at Discovery Adventure Park . While it might feel completely untouched, Moganshan was actually a popular hill station during the 19th and 20th century.\u000a\u000aThis is where Shanghai's foreign expats and politicians (including Chairman Mao) came for cool mountain air during the city's steamy summers. The exclusive nature of Moganshan attracts elite jetsetters who gravitate towards eco-friendly retreats like Naked Stables and Le Passage Mohkan Shan\u000a\u000aOffering an ultra-posh experience, there's also La Residence -- a villa with 30-feet-tall ceilings and eclectic Scandinavian furniture that's been built into the tea hills above sister property Le Passage Mohkan Shan. Costing roughly $28,000 a night, the eight-bedroom villa might be part of the reason the area's been called "The Hamptons of China."\u000a\u000a4. Ningbo\u000a\u000aA view of Xuedou mountain, near Ningbo.\u000a\u000aAn easy drive from Shanghai across the Hangzhou Bay Bridge -- the world's longest trans-oceanic bridge -- Ningbo is a rapidly modernizing city with a long history. Not only is Ningbo home to one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, but it's also one of China's oldest cities.\u000a\u000aDating back to 4800 BCE, Ningbo was an important stop on the Silk Road. Beautifully preserved pagodas and towers can still be seen today, including the Tang Dynasty-era Tianfeng Tower.\u000a\u000aOne of the city's most scenic areas is the centrally located Moon Lake, where travelers will find the Tianyi Pavilion, an ancient library, temple and stunning Chinese pavilions.\u000a\u000aHistory is everywhere, from China's oldest wooden structure -- the Baoguo Temple in the north -- to the Tang Dynasty-era Qita Zen Buddhist Temple downtown.\u000a\u000aThe city has also drawn attention for its exciting architecture, such as the Ningbo History Museum . Designed by Pritzker Prize-winner Wang Shu -- of Amateur Architecture Studio -- the contemporary museum is made of concrete and bamboo, incorporating traditional tiling techniques and handmade bricks that pay homage to demolished houses in China.\u000a\u000a5. Suzhou\u000a\u000aA sightseeing boat sails on a canal in Suzhou.\u000a\u000aAbout a 20-minute train ride west of Shanghai, Suzhou is another beautiful canal city -- split north to south by the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal.\u000a\u000aNearly half of this 2,500-year-old town is covered in water, with rivers and canals dividing the streets into a checkerboard.\u000a\u000aThe romance continues in the cobbled streets and Chinese gardens, of which there are more than 60 scattered about the city. The main sights include the 12.85-acre Humble Administrator's Garden, a World Cultural Heritage site that dates back to 1509. A walk -- or bike ride -- here uncovers lotus pools, poetic temples, bamboo groves and elegant courtyards.\u000a\u000aCome evening, Pingjiang Lu is the best pedestrian street for a stroll past historic white houses and trendy new teahouses. Meanwhile, the Suzhou Silk Museum shows off the city's 4,000-year-old silk-weaving traditions. If you're looking for a souvenir -- this is the place.\u000a\u000aShould time allow, there are few other "water towns" nearby that are worth a visit, including

aVWar & Fashion\u000a\u000aCarnage: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria. Catwalk: Armani, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWar is ugly. Fashion is beautiful. War projects the worst of humanity. Fashion displays sartorial splendor in its highest. War is fraught with danger, even for journalists and especially for photographers who must get up close to their subjects to frame an image. Fashion is far less perilous, though photographers must also get intimate with their subjects on and around the runways. There are photographers who shoot both: battlefields and runways, guns and glamour. At first, photographing war and fashion appear as incongruous acts that are difficult to reconcile.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUntil, perhaps, you take a deeper look.\u000a\u000aGaza, 2000. Gaza, 2000. Paris, 2006. Paris, 2006. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aI laid out photographer Christopher Anderson's images of war and fashion before him. He was on a lunch break from a New York Magazine cover shoot in a Manhattan studio.\u000a\u000a"Amazing," he said.\u000a\u000aHe'd never seen his own photographs juxtaposed like that. War belongs in one intellectual compartment; fashion in another. The two don't usually mix in project portfolios -- or in the mind.\u000a\u000aHe called over the magazine's photo director, Jody Quon, for a look. She, too, was astonished by the common threads.\u000a\u000aAnderson captured a Palestinian youth in Gaza during the second intifada and a Giorgio Armani show in Paris. Both images are blurred, the figures airy, almost diaphanous in the light.\u000a\u000a"It's about the optics," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 2006, Anderson shot rescuers attempting to remove bodies from the rubble of a Beirut apartment building hit by Israeli jets. "Lebanon horrified me," he said.\u000a\u000aTwo years later, he clicked his camera behind the scenes at a Proenza Schouler show in New York. The composition feels eerily similar. Both images show a cacophony of chaos.\u000a\u000aBeirut, Lebanon, 2006. Beirut, Lebanon, 2006. New York, 2008. New York, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThen there is a photograph of 3rd Infantry Division soldiers clearing a building during the battle for Baghdad after U.S. forces entered the Iraqi capital in 2003. And a shot showing models at a L'Wren Scott show in 2008. The movement in the Iraq photo mirrors that of the models in their high heels.\u000a\u000a"I see scared little girls who have come from all over the world, all dressed up to be something they're not," Anderson said. Just like the young men in the U.S. Army who got dressed up to fight, terrified, at times, of a still-invisible enemy.\u000a\u000aIraq, 2003. Iraq, 2003. New York, 2008. New York, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"People are people," Anderson said. "I see the human experience in these photos. When I'm looking to make a picture, I'm peeling back layers to get that emotional quality."\u000a\u000aAs in the photo of an Iraqi army sergeant surrendering to the Americans in Najaf.\u000a\u000a"I don't see war," Anderson said. "I see a man who is frightened."\u000a\u000aThe idea to juxtapose war and fashion evolved after CNN's Director of Photography Simon Barnett came across a war photograph that reminded him of a fashion shot he'd seen. (See Barnett's selection of images on CNN's photo blog.)\u000a\u000a"I got to thinking about a number of established combat photographers who have in recent years been turning their cameras toward fashion," Barnett said. "I wondered what we would find if we went deeper into their work."\u000a\u000aBarnett did just that; he asked Magnum Photos to send him a collection of images made by four photographers -- each of whom has won major photojournalism awards.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2005. New York, 2005. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aWhen they arrived in Atlanta, Barnett plastered the photographs all over CNN's media lab, and began moving them around.\u000a\u000a"We saw that many photos taken by the same photographer seemingly started pairing themselves together." Barnett said. "In a very immediate and simplistic way I found this stimulating to look at, but wondered whether this meant anything."\u000a\u000aHe was intrigued by the prospect of presenting the photographers with an edgy new body of work they'd created with no conscious awareness of having done so.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Jerome Sessini were both surprised at first but the more they talked about their work, the more it became apparent how the pairings made sense. Paolo Pellegrin and Alex Majoli, the two other photographers whose work is showcased here, were shooting a project in a war zone and could not be reached for comment.\u000a\u000aTo others, the idea of this odd juxtaposition seemed unfair. Disturbing, even.\u000a\u000aKabul, Afghanistan, 2004. Kabul, Afghanistan, 2004. Paris, 2008. Paris, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"Appalling," said Sonya Fry, executive director of the Overseas Press Club, which bestows the prestigious Robert Capa Gold Medal for courage and enterprise in photography.\u000a\u000aShe perceived war as serious; fashion, not.\u000a\u000aStill, she found it interesting to compare the dynamics of the photos.\u000a\u000aThat someone had put them together fascinated Anne Tucker, curator of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston: "It's kind of ballsy," she said.\u000a\u000aLook at the photographs, she said. Take away the first three things you see. Perhaps the number of people. Or gender sameness. Or chaos.\u000a\u000aThen you begin to see other realms -- of coded clothing, body posture, the relationships of people to their environment.\u000a\u000a"Its total unexpectedness is its value. It ain't ho-hum," Tucker said.\u000a\u000a"My experience is that combat photographers are some of the smartest people I have met. They're not just interested in conflict photography. They are image connoisseurs. It doesn't surprise me that one would inform the other."\u000a\u000aIraq, 2003. Iraq, 2003. Paris, 2008. Paris, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aProvocative. That's how Stefano Tonchi saw it. The mastermind behind The New York Times style magazine, T, and now the executive editor of W magazine, has worked with combat photojournalists in many fashion shoots.\u000a\u000a"Not to say that fashion is not war," he joked. "But what is compelling about the images is the technique."\u000a\u000aIn both situations, the photographers must move fast, quick to make decisions about light and composition. They are used to catching a moment, capturing something people believe in.\u000a\u000a"I think there are more believers in fashion," Tonchi observed, "than there are in human rights."\u000a\u000aAuthor and documentarian Sebastian Junger admitted he knew nothing about fashion. But when he saw the war and fashion photos, he felt that perhaps the fashion world was a bit of a battlefield.\u000a\u000a"It makes the world of fashion seem kind of brutal and filled with conflict," said Junger, whose collaboration with the late combat photographer Tim Hetherington in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley resulted in the gritty film "Restrepo."\u000a\u000aKosovo, 1999. Kosovo, 1999. Paris, 2009. Paris, 2009. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThe fashion world for Junger is all about performance. The emotions are exaggerated, even fake. The gestures, for the most part, posed.\u000a\u000a"It's funny, in my eye. They all look like they're trying very hard to stand out, striking very aggressive, confident poses.\u000a\u000aNot different, perhaps, than a rebel fighter posturing in front of a camera, trying to appear invincible.\u000a\u000aThat's evident in Sessini's portrait of a fighter in Libya along the road to Ajdabiya in 2011.\u000a\u000aWar, too, said Junger, can be about performance. Only the anguish is real.\u000a\u000aAjdabiya, Libya, 2011. Ajdabiya, Libya, 2011. Milan, Italy, 2012. Milan, Italy, 2012. Photographs by Jerome Sessini/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"It's not how a photographer looks at the world that is important. It's their intimate relationship with it." The words of French photographer Antoine d'Agata synthesize the work of Sessini.\u000a\u000a"I would say shooting is conditioned by the attitude on the ground, the emotional connection with the subject. That is, my personal relationship," Sessini said.\u000a\u000a"When this relationship is strong, my eyes and my perception take precedence over the subject, whatever it is."\u000a\u000aThe difficulty for photojournalists lies in balancing truth with emotion, information with appearance. In the 2004 Falluja offensive, Sessini photographed two Marines who were clearing houses. They are shown sitting back to back on a metal bed in a house clearly ravaged by war.\u000a\u000a"I felt their fear. Very young and very scared. They were lost in this space, wondering what they were doing there," Sessini said.\u000a\u000a"That's what I tried to transmit -- the psychology of the soldiers. Anxiety, fear. No sense of purpose."\u000a\u000aIn another photo that Sessini shot just last September at an Armani show, two models appear backstage, back to back, wearing the same dress, their uniform of sorts. As with the case of the Marines, you cannot see their faces but Sessini captured the essence of their emotions with their pose. Lost in the middle of a big show.\u000a\u000aFalluja, Iraq, 2004. Falluja, Iraq, 2004. Milan, Italy, 2012. Milan, Italy, 2012. Photographs by Jerome Sessini/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"Showing expression most of the time, it's too easy," Sessini said. "A smile -- it's the first thing that you can see. If you search more, you can find something in the body or the posture."\u000a\u000aJunger saw the same mechanics in those two photos but took away two completely different stories. The two women didn't seem connected.\u000a\u000a"In fashion, there's some kind of implicit competition of who is the prettiest. In combat, it's the exact opposite. Those guys are completely connected."\u000a\u000aIt made sense to Junger that photographers focus on the same physical statements they make about individuals in fashion as they do in war. But the human form has limited focus points, the face being the most obvious one.\u000a\u000aPellegrin used the face, gesture and posture to get across two very different situations, said Tucker of Houston's fine arts museum.\u000a\u000aThere is a man with his arms outstretched in Tahrir Square and a model with her left arm in the air at New York's Fashion Week. The two images look similar. One emits rage, the other grace.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2004. New York, 2004. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThe anger in the faces of Egyptians protesting the rule of Hosni Mubarak in Cairo's Tahrir Square is evident in Paolo Pellegrin's 2011 photo. His shot of four models at Fashion Week in New York in 2005 is composed and framed in very much the same vein. Only this time, audiences come away with a look of speculation.\u000a\u000aAnother Pellegrin photo shows a man with his face covered, running during the anti-Mubarak protests. Next to it is a Paul Smith model running through brush in a corseted skirt.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. Paris, 2010. Paris, 2010. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThere's no mistaking the circumstances in which each subject is running. The model is wearing high heels and holding up a black bag. Her jaunt lacks desperation. The man, perhaps, is running for his life.\u000a\u000aWar and fashion. Opposite worlds?\u000a\u000aYes, of course.\u000a\u000aA photographer is not likely to be injured or killed at backstage Balenciaga. But take away the danger element and to Anderson, much of it feels the same.\u000a\u000aTo get through the logistics, to be able to position yourself just right is as difficult at Armani as it is in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a"You have to anticipate where you need to be so that when things unfold you're reacting to what's in front of you," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aBoth situations are uncontrolled. If you click too late, you've missed the drama of the moment.\u000a\u000aAnderson sees the same sensibility in all his photographs. The same person behind every frame.\u000a\u000aHe no longer shoots war. At a certain point, he believes, he was playing with statistics.\u000a\u000a"From a creative standpoint, I don't know what else to say about war."\u000a\u000aBut the thing is, there is beauty in war. Powerful beauty.\u000a\u000aTo understand it, you have to first understand war's ugliness.\u000a\u000a"The volume is turned up in war," Anderson said. "If it's beautiful, it's more beautiful. The ugly is uglier."\u000a\u000aIn war, you look for beauty of the human spirit. In a single gesture. Or act.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2009. New York, 2009. Photographs by Alex Majoli/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aFor many combat photographers, fashion is the tougher subject in that it is less familiar. Pellegrin, in a 2010 interview with Reuters, said this about fashion: "It's a world I do not frequent or know well. But I did not want to dismiss it as superficial. There is a lot of talent and creativity in fashion. I came with respect and wanting to discover a world I knew not so much about."\u000a\u000aStrangely, shooting war is sometimes less complicated, from a purely artistic standpoint. There is so much that is happening in front of you, Sessini said. It's easier to tell an extraordinary tale than craft one from the ordinary.\u000a\u000a"For me, war photography is easier," he said. "The thing happens in front of you. You just have to frame and shoot. It's very easy to get a strong picture. At Fashion Week, it's much more difficult. You have to work, you have to find something different and find your own vision."\u000a\u000aShooting fashion was a challenge for Sessini. "I can feel stressed in the same way in Falluja that I feel in Milan."\u000a\u000aSessini found my questions interesting. No one had asked them before. He, too, had never studied his photos of war and fashion next to one another.\u000a\u000aWhen you have a vision of the world, it comes through in your work, he supposed. That is true whether in war or fashion.

aVDanny Cevallos is a CNN legal analyst who practices in the areas of personal injury, wrongful conviction and criminal defense in Pennsylvania, New York, and the US Virgin Islands, at the law firms of Cevallos & Wong in Philadelphia, and Edelman & Edelman in New York, where he is Of Counsel. Follow him on Twitter @CevallosLaw . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Jeff Sessions' Department of Justice filed an amicus brief in a case before a federal appeals court, taking the position that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit employment "discrimination based on sexual orientation."\u000a\u000aThe original language of Title VII prohibits private employers from discriminating against an individual "because of such individual's... sex."\u000a\u000aWhether you disagree with the DOJ's position or not, the brief makes one thing glaringly apparent: Title VII needs to have a definition of "sex" that reflects how the word has changed from 1964 to 2017. Whether or not the word "sex" in the law ultimately protects the LGBTQ community should be a decision for the people, through their elected Congress. It should not be a decision made by unelected judges or unelected government agency officials.\u000a\u000aAccording to CNN, the case in question is about Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor. He used to tell his female tandem-jumping customers that he was gay to allay any concerns their boyfriends might have about Zarda being strapped so tightly to their girlfriends. One woman's husband complained to Zarda's boss about the comment, and Zarda's employer fired him as a result. Zarda sued the company, Altitude Express, but died in a skydiving accident before the case went to trial.\u000a\u000aThe DOJ's amicus submission on behalf of Altitude Express sparked swift reaction. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, known as GLAAD, tweeted : "The DOJ says Title VII shouldn't protect LGBTQ people, while Trump's #TransBan proves exactly why it needs to."\u000a\u000aIt certainly seems like there is a reasonable argument that Title VII's protections should extend to LGBTQ persons.\u000a\u000aThere's just one small problem: Title VII's protections do not directly do that.\u000a\u000aMore specifically, the language of Title VII doesn't protect LGBTQ people at all. Rather, it was a federal appellate court and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that looked at the statute, and the word "sex," and decided that LGBTQ discrimination should be included.\u000a\u000aWe've pretended in the past that our laws say things they don't -- with results that many are happy with today. Roe v. Wade is a terrific example. The seminal decision on abortion rights was based on a constitutional "right of privacy," one that is not explicitly in the Constitution. The court reasoned that the Constitution's First, Fourth, Ninth, and 14th Amendments created a sort of "zone of privacy." It further reasoned that this "zone of privacy" was "broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy." If you're a fan of the right to choose, then Roe and subsequent cases reached the right result, even if it was the product of some creative writing by the court.\u000a\u000aEven the DOJ acknowledges in its brief it's possible that, as a matter of policy, sexual orientation discrimination should be prohibited by law. The DOJ concedes that Congress and the executive branch have prohibited this kind of discrimination in other situations, such as in federal employment.\u000a\u000aThe ultimate issue is whether Title VII, as written, actually extends its protections to sexual orientation. The DOJ says it doesn't, and it has a point.\u000a\u000aOf course, the definition of Title VII has been defined and refined over the years -- adding greater degrees of specification. In 1978, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act added the following to Title VII's definitional section: "The terms 'because of sex' or 'on the basis of sex' include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions."\u000a\u000aThat was it. Nothing about sexual orientation, though the phrase "include, but are not limited to" does leave an opening. In 1991, Congress again amended Title VII. It made a number of changes, including expanding employment discrimination protection to employees of Congress and some political appointees. It still chose to say nothing about the definition of the LGBTQ community.\u000a\u000aThe DOJ points out that the court hearing the case, other courts, and even our own dictionaries have historically agreed that the term "sex" in Title VII refers only to membership in a class delineated by biological gender. The Justice Department suggests that the recent 7th Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College holding otherwise is a mere aberration.\u000a\u000aThe DOJ points out that 10 other courts of appeals, including the court currently hearing the argument, have held that Title VII does not include sexual orientation discrimination.\u000a\u000aOpposing the DOJ's position is another "amicus" federal agency, the EEOC. In 2015, the EEOC took the position that sexual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination. But until then, the DOJ argues that even the EEOC had long taken the position that sexual orientation discrimination is not actionable under Title VII.\u000a\u000aShould Title VII include sexual orientation in its protections? Probably. We've changed a lot as a society since 1964, 1972 and even 1991, when Congress last spoke on the issue.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aBut if a change is to happen, it should come from a democratically elected body -- Congress -- and not the courts and federal agencies, which are unaccountable to the people.\u000a\u000aAre the DOJ's motives in the right place? That's a totally different issue, and reasonable minds could conclude that this brief is not motivated by a neutral adherence to the text of a statute. One could reasonably infer that the real motive behind this amicus is an animus against a certain class of persons.\u000a\u000aBut the legal argument is grounded in logic -- at least for now.

aVStory highlights Karthick Ramakrishnan: The collection of detailed ethnicity data is essential for the justification of government programs that benefit Asian-Americans\u000a\u000aNew Asian immigrants and elected officials are not on the same wavelength, which has prompted protests opposing such data collection, says Ramakrishnan\u000a\u000aKarthick Ramakrishnan (@karthickr) is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside and is the founder of AAPI Data. He was a member of the California State Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs when it endorsed state legislation that would provide Asian ethnicity data in health and public higher education. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) A group of about 50 Chinese Americans, many of them children, gathered on the steps of the State House in Rhode Island last week to oppose a new law on collecting detailed origin data on Asian-Americans. The organizer of the protest compared the law to "Nazi Germany's 1935 Nuremberg Law that singled out Jews in the pretense of data collection, only to be conveniently used as a basis for genocide in the following decade."\u000a\u000aThis is not the first time Asian-American data collection has gotten pushback. Similar protests in California erupted with the proposal of a bill that sought to increase the specificity of ethnicity data collected by state education and health agencies. Opponents there ominously warned that the bill may be the first step to Asian exclusion and internment.\u000a\u000aKarthick Ramakrishnan\u000a\u000aThese assertions are outrageous, and they ignore the purpose and history of Asian-American data collection, which dates back to the 1970s when a wave of Southeast Asian refugees joined a growing number of Asian immigrants who were coming to the United States. Most of the Asian immigrants who came after 1965, when the United States ended its restrictive national origin quotas, were high-skilled immigrants such as doctors, nurses, and engineers from countries like India, China, South Korea, and the Philippines. By contrast, most of the refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos lacked college degrees, and many did not even have a high school diploma.\u000a\u000aAsian-American community leaders quickly realized that government statistics on education, poverty, and English proficiency could not simply be provided for the racial group as a whole. Such data tended to show Asian-Americans as a "model minority," a relatively prosperous and highly educated group that did not need any public assistance. But by gathering more detailed ethnicity data, they could make the case for targeted government programs on matters ranging from poverty alleviation to language assistance and mental health services.\u000a\u000aSince 1980, this detailed data has been essential to the justification of programs that benefit Asian-Americans -- so essential that data and research on Asian-American subpopulations was a high priority for the White House Initiative on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders when it was created in October 2009 , and it remains an important issue for the initiative today\u000a\u000aRead More

aVAnyone who knows me also knows that I have a huge sweet tooth. I always have.\u000a\u000aMy friend and fellow graduate student Andrew is equally afflicted, and living in Hershey, Pennsylvania -- the "Chocolate Capital of the World" -- doesn't help either of us.\u000a\u000aBut Andrew is braver than I am. Last year, he gave up sweets for Lent. I can't say that I'm following in his footsteps this year, but if you are abstaining from sweets for Lent this year, here's what you can expect over the next 40 days.\u000a\u000aSugar: natural reward, unnatural fix\u000a\u000aIn neuroscience, food is something we call a "natural reward." In order for us to survive as a species, things like eating, having sex and nurturing others must be pleasurable to the brain so that these behaviors are reinforced and repeated.\u000a\u000aEvolution has resulted in the mesolimbic pathway , a brain system that deciphers these natural rewards for us. When we do something pleasurable, a bundle of neurons called the ventral tegmental area uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to signal to a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens.\u000a\u000aThe connection between the nucleus accumbens and our prefrontal cortex dictates our motor movement, such as deciding whether or not to taking another bite of that delicious chocolate cake. The prefrontal cortex also activates hormones that tell our body: "Hey, this cake is really good. And I'm going to remember that for the future."\u000a\u000aNot all foods are equally rewarding, of course. Most of us prefer sweets over sour and bitter foods because, evolutionarily, our mesolimbic pathway reinforces that sweet things provide a healthy source of carbohydrates for our bodies. When our ancestors went scavenging for berries, for example, sour meant "not yet ripe," while bitter meant "alert -- poison!"\u000a\u000aFruit is one thing, but modern diets have taken on a life of their own. A decade ago, it was estimated that the average American consumed 22 teaspoons of added sugar per day, amounting to an extra 350 calories; it may well have risen since then. A few months ago, one expert suggested that the average Briton consumes 238 teaspoons of sugar each week.\u000a\u000aToday, with convenience more important than ever in our food selections, it's almost impossible to come across processed and prepared foods that don't have added sugars for flavour, preservation, or both.\u000a\u000aThese added sugars are sneaky -- and unbeknown to many of us, we've become hooked. In ways that drugs of abuse -- such as nicotine, cocaine and heroin -- hijack the brain's reward pathway and make users dependent, increasing neuro-chemical and behavioural evidence suggests that sugar is addictive in the same way, too.\u000a\u000aSugar addiction is real\u000a\u000a"The first few days are a little rough," Andrew told me about his sugar-free adventure last year. "It almost feels like you're detoxing from drugs. I found myself eating a lot of carbs to compensate for the lack of sugar."\u000a\u000aThere are four major components of addiction: bingeing, withdrawal, craving, and cross-sensitisation (the notion that one addictive substance predisposes someone to becoming addicted to another). All of these components have been observed in animal models of addiction -- for sugar, as well as drugs of abuse.\u000a\u000aA typical experiment goes like this: rats are deprived of food for 12 hours each day, then given 12 hours of access to a sugary solution and regular chow.\u000a\u000aAfter a month of following this daily pattern, rats display behaviours similar to those on drugs of abuse. They'll binge on the sugar solution in a short period of time, much more than their regular food. They also show signs of anxiety and depression during the food deprivation period.\u000a\u000aMany sugar-treated rats who are later exposed to drugs, such as cocaine and opiates , demonstrate dependent behaviors towards the drugs compared to rats who did not consume sugar beforehand.\u000a\u000aLike drugs, sugar spikes dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Over the long term, regular sugar consumption actually changes the gene expression and availability of dopamine receptors in both the midbrain and frontal cortex\u000a\u000aSpecifically, sugar increases the concentration of a type of excitatory receptor called D1, but decreases another receptor type called D2, which is inhibitory.\u000a\u000aRegular sugar consumption also inhibits the action of the dopamine transporter , a protein which pumps dopamine out of the synapse and back into the neuron after firing.\u000a\u000aIn short, this means that repeated access to sugar over time leads to prolonged dopamine signalling, greater excitation of the brain's reward pathways and a need for even more sugar to activate all of the midbrain dopamine receptors like before. The brain becomes tolerant to sugar -- and more is needed to attain the same "sugar high."\u000a\u000aSugar withdrawal is also real\u000a\u000aAlthough these studies were conducted in rodents, it's not far-fetched to say that the same primitive processes are occurring in the human brain, too. "The cravings never stopped, [but that was] probably psychological," Andrew told me. "But it got easier after the first week or so."\u000a\u000aIn a 2002 study by Carlo Colantuoni and colleagues of Princeton University, rats who had undergone a typical sugar dependence protocol then underwent "sugar withdrawal." This was facilitated by either food deprivation or treatment with naloxone, a drug used for treating opiate addiction which binds to receptors in the brain's reward system.\u000a\u000aBoth withdrawal methods led to physical problems, including teeth chattering, paw tremors, and head shaking. Naloxone treatment also appeared to make the rats more anxious, as they spent less time on an elevated apparatus that lacked walls on either side.\u000a\u000aSimilar withdrawal experiments by others also report behaviour similar to depression in tasks such as the forced swim test. Rats in sugar withdrawal are more likely to show passive behaviours (like floating) than active behaviours (like trying to escape) when placed in water, suggesting feelings of helplessness.\u000a\u000aA study published by Victor Mangabeira and colleagues in Physiology & Behavior reports that sugar withdrawal is also linked to impulsive behaviour. Initially, rats were trained to receive water by pushing a lever.\u000a\u000aAfter training, the animals returned to their home cages and had access to a sugar solution and water, or just water alone. After 30 days, when rats were again given the opportunity to press a lever for water, those who had become dependent on sugar pressed the lever significantly more times than control animals, suggesting impulsive behaviour.\u000a\u000aThese are extreme experiments, of course. We humans aren't depriving ourselves of food for 12 hours and then allowing ourselves to binge on soda and doughnuts at the end of the day. But these rodent studies certainly give us insight into the neuro-chemical underpinnings of sugar dependence, withdrawal, and behaviour.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThrough decades of diet programmes and best-selling books, we've toyed with the notion of "sugar addiction" for a long time. There are accounts of those in "sugar withdrawal" describing food cravings, which can trigger relapse and impulsive eating.\u000a\u000aThere are also countless articles and books about the boundless energy and new-found happiness in those who have sworn off sugar for good. But despite the ubiquity of sugar in our diets, the notion of sugar addiction is still a rather taboo topic.\u000a\u000aAre you still motivated to give up sugar for Lent? You might wonder how long it will take until you're free of cravings and side-effects, but there's no answer -- everyone is different and no human studies have been done on this.\u000a\u000aBut after 40 days, it's clear that Andrew had overcome the worst, likely even reversing some of his altered dopamine signalling. "I remember eating my first sweet and thinking it was too sweet," he said. "I had to rebuild my tolerance."\u000a\u000aAnd as regulars of a local bakery in Hershey -- I can assure you, readers, that he has done just that.

aVIf you think it's the flames or the heat, that's understandable: those are dangerous, too. But both from a victim's and a firefighter's perspective, the deadliest enemy is smoke.\u000a\u000aSmoke causes more fire deaths than flames, according to the National Fire Protection Association , because people are incapacitated by fumes so quickly that they can't get to safety.\u000a\u000aAnd it leaves firefighters blind, because it's impossible to see anything in a smoke-filled room.\u000a\u000aThat's why firefighting teams use special cameras that allow them to see through the smoke, rendering images based on heat rather than light.\u000a\u000aThey've been around for decades, but they've always had one crucial flaw.\u000a\u000aSee-through\u000a\u000aHumans lose consciousness when oxygen concentration drops below 9 percent, but start losing judgment and coordination at around 17 percent, a whiff below the normal amount in breathable air of 21 percent.\u000a\u000aIn a building on fire, that means smoke can often hide unconscious or disorientated victims. To be able to spot them -- and also see danger areas by gauging heat levels -- rescue teams must be equipped with thermal imaging cameras, which show heat in brighter colors over darker backgrounds.\u000a\u000aBut here's the problem: "Conventional systems require you to hold the camera, so you can look into the screen - but for firefighters to not have a free hand in a dangerous environment is not ideal," said Graham Wilson, director at Design Reality, His UK-based company was tasked by firefighting equipment manufacturer Scott Safety to create a product that could address this specific concern.\u000a\u000aHands-free\u000a\u000aScott's idea was to integrate the thermal camera into the mask all firemen already use, the respirator. It has multiple functions, but primarily it protects from particles and smoke.\u000a\u000aThe new camera, called Sight, is small and -- at around 8 ounces -- light enough to not add significantly to the heft of the mask. But it projects a small thermal image inside the mask, at nine frames per second. Further settings can be easily configured through a smartphone app.\u000a\u000aSince it is mounted on an essential piece of equipment, every member of a rescue team gets one, which it's hoped will increase safety as it means firemen can see for themselves, rather than rely on voice indications from a team leader wielding the camera.\u000a\u000aAccording to its makers, it's the first of its kind in production: "But in the industry the idea is not that novel, because everyone has wanted it for so long," said Wilson. "The challenge was to turn it into a product."\u000a\u000aAnother challenge was to not bog down the mask itself: "It was tricky to fit new tech into an existing mask, because we can't afford to lose any performance on the respirator -- it has standards we need to respect," said Wilson.\u000a\u000aThe solution? No cables: the camera sends information to the in-mask display system wirelessly, so there's no need to penetrate the mask with a cable, which would limit the field of vision.\u000a\u000aLife-saving\u000a\u000aFrom the conceptual stage, Sight was developed in collaboration with actual firefighters, who were engaged in tests and training sessions: "The key tell to whether this was gonna do well," said Wilson, "Was when it was launched and firemen were coming up to our stands at conventions to say 'Hallelujah, we've been wanting this for so long!'"\u000a\u000aCompared to traditional hand-held cameras, which can cost thousands of dollars, the Sight is also more affordable: it retails for around $1,500 inclusive of the mask.\u000a\u000aBut Wilson believes the real selling point is elsewhere. "This product is going to save lives," he said. "What more could you want?"

They think they will be instantly critiqued -- which they will be -- but it's not the job of athletes to avoid critique."\u000a\u000a"That is an anti-risk-taking behavior, which is anti-athletics," Amaechi, now an organizational psychologist in London, tells CNN.

"If we aren't confident at the World Cup, coming to Russia, we (won't) come."\u000a\u000aToure, who retired from world football in September, did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this story through his agent.\u000a\u000aOther players including Brazilian forward Givanildo Vieira de Sousa, better known as Hulk, Ghanaian Emmanuel Frimpong and former Brazil great Roberto Carlos -- who twice had bananas brandished at him in 2011 -- have complained about facing racial abuse in Russia, while the football watchdog FARE Network documented over 200 cases of racism in Russian football in a 2015 report\u000a\u000aDespite the closing of its anti-racism task force in September, FIFA insists that its work is not done.\u000a\u000aYaya Toure (center) is surrounded by Manchester City teammates during the October, 2013 UEFA Champions League match at CSKA Moscow, where he endured racist chancts from the stands.\u000a\u000a"FIFA's position on any form of discrimination is unequivocal: There is no place for racism or for any form of discrimination in football, as clearly described in the FIFA Statutes," it said in a statement.\u000a\u000aFIFA has also defended its selection of Russia, while appealing for all players to participate.\u000a\u000a"History has shown so far that boycotting sport events or a policy of isolation or confrontation are not the most effective ways to solve problems," it said in a 2014 statement.\u000a\u000a"We can achieve positive change in the world, but football cannot be seen as a solution for all issues, particularly those related to world politics."\u000a\u000aNo poppies for the British\u000a\u000aFurther talks of a Russian boycott by prominent minority players "would make a very powerful statement," says Maguire, "but it won't happen."\u000a\u000aMaguire cites a number of hurdles, including lack of "group solidarity among African players" -- even among those who have earned millions playing in Europe -- because of the enormity and diversity of the continent.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, the economic stake of losing out on a precious World Cup qualifying spot for most member countries is too high to risk a FIFA ban for political interference.\u000a\u000aFIFA recently opened disciplinary procedures against the English and Scottish football associations for ignoring a ban on players wearing commemorative poppies during a match on Armistice Day. Wales and Northern Ireland also face punishment for the mere display of poppies -- the symbol of remembrance for fallen British soldiers -- during their matches.\u000a\u000aThe leeway to protest in sports other than soccer -- including the NFL, which does not require its players to stand for the national anthem -- is higher, says Maguire.\u000a\u000aIn 2004, England cricketer Steve Harmison refused to travel to Zimbabwe for political reasons, and the England & Wales Cricket Board did not take action against him.\u000a\u000a'Why does he stand alone on this?'\u000a\u000aGayle says that an "overwhelming call from a senior black professional" would be necessary to garner support for a boycott of Russia 2018. "There has to be solidarity," he says, in order to pressure other athletes to take a stand.\u000a\u000aCNN has requested comment from 23 active black footballers who have represented England regarding playing in Russia, though they were not immediately available.\u000a\u000aAmaechi, whose father is Nigerian, also has reservations about FIFA hosting its showcase tournament in Russia.\u000a\u000a"One of their principles is that sport is a human right," he says. "When they talk about their principle of inclusion of all people regardless of race, sexuality, gender, etc., that means they can't go to a country like Russia."\u000a\u000aThe responsibility, however, should not land on the players in the first place, he insists.\u000a\u000a"Why is it the athletes' job to solve this problem, when there are old men being paid to do just that in football?" asks Amaechi.\u000a\u000a"When Yaya Toure says something so reasonable -- that we should have secure places for athletes to play where they won't be abused -- why is it that he stands with a couple of athletes alone on this?"

aV(CNN) Bold, disruptive and totally unapologetic, a new Nigerian online magazine 'A Nasty Boy,' is set to ruffle a few feathers.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes our visual content will not be safe for the workplace... we won't make it any easier for you with our provocative editorials and swear words; take it in good spirits," read's the magazine's disclaimer.\u000a\u000aThe magazine is filled with provocative images, featuring nude models, articles contain swear words and avant-garde ideas.\u000a\u000aIn Nigeria, a conservative country, where public expressions of nudity are uncommon, 'A Nasty Boy' is unsurprisingly causing controversy.\u000a\u000aBut for editor Richard Akuson, the publication is sending out a clear message: he's not interested in fitting the status quo.\u000a\u000a'There has to be room for people that don't fit in'\u000a\u000aGrowing up, Akuson says he was bullied for being different.\u000a\u000a"I was always called a boy-girl," Akuson told CNN.\u000a\u000a"In university, I was called a yansh man which means a guy with a big butt...my classmates thought I was too polite, in their words too polished and that was not the way guys were meant to be."\u000a\u000aIt was this idea, that a man or woman is meant to behave in a particular way, that Akuson sought to challenge through 'A Nasty Boy.'\u000a\u000aPhotos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson In his editorial 'Boys' Richard Akuson hopes to challenge the concept of Nigerian masculinity. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson Taken by Photographer Zamani Istifanus, they put together three muscular male models who are completely naked. Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson With the photos, Akuson challenges the perceived notion of strangeness that comes with men being naked around one another. Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson After publishing the photos on his website , he decided to post on his personal Instagram page and observed a certain hesitation to like his photos despite analytics revealing a wide reach. Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson "I could see a fear to associate with an editorial like that." Akuson says. "If a friend sees someone looking at a post like that, there would be questions. They might have liked it but didn't have the confidence to show that openly." Hide Caption 5 of 5\u000a\u000a"There cannot be one singular kind of Nigerian man or woman, there has to be room for other definitions that don't necessarily fit that opinion," he adds.\u000a\u000aAkuson had previously launched three other publications but says none of them felt right, he was pushed to publish 'A Nasty Boy,' after a run in with internet trolls.\u000a\u000aCelebrating 'otherness'\u000a\u000a"I once did a story on EJ Johnson... and how I felt his wardrobe could inspire, but the conversation in the comment section completely moved from the subject matter to me. 'Why are you always interested in stories like this?; and some responses were 'Oh you know Richard is gay'"\u000a\u000a"That was the awakening for me," he said. "And from that morning I knew I would start 'A Nasty Boy.'"\u000a\u000aAkuson says after his experience he knew the time had come for a platform that allowed for self-expression and shape-shifting ideas and explored "otherness in fashion, people and culture."\u000a\u000a"There are people who do not fit the status quo but are however very Nigerian," he explains. "We should hear their stories and also celebrate them."\u000a\u000a'Fear of association'\u000a\u000aWhile the public is slowly warming up to his publication, there is still fear and hesitation to be publicly associated with the magazine Akuson claims.\u000a\u000aA large chunk of the magazine's readership resides in Nigeria, Akuson notes that the number isn't reflected in their social engagement. He feels it's because people are still weary to be publicly associated with subject matter that could be considered taboo.\u000a\u000aIn an photo editorial called 'Boys', Akuson tried to challenged the perceived notion of strangeness surrounding men being naked around one another. After it was published, he observed something unusual.\u000a\u000a"I could see from my analytics that the photo had been seen many times but the engagement was not as much. Then I got messages and calls from people who thought it was impressive work and I asked, 'why didn't you leave a comment?'"\u000a\u000aFunding also poses a huge problem for his ambitious publication with potential investors questioning its importance.\u000a\u000a"We have met people who just say outright that this is not a necessary publication, it could be something else, and it doesn't have to be this. They don't understand why it's necessary."\u000a\u000aBold and unapologetic\u000a\u000aBut Akuson does, and is driven by the effect the magazine has on people who connect to the message and need to celebrate difference.\u000a\u000aAkuson shares the story of a photographer who collaborated with him on an editorial, whose father broke his camera because he found photos of naked men on it. The incident prompted the photographer to give up on photography, but seeing his work in 'A Nasty Boy' feature on a British website lit his fire again.\u000a\u000aFinancial setbacks and going against the grain of Nigeria's conservative principle aside, Akuson's focus is in one direction and he is doing it boldly, and unapologetically.

The opinions expressed are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I was proud to join thousands of concerned citizens, scientists and engineers in Saturday's March for Science. With more than 600 marches taking place around the world, we conveyed that science is political, not partisan, and science should shape our policies.\u000a\u000aAlthough it is the means by which humankind discovers objective truths in nature, science is and has always been political. Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution refers to promoting "the progress of science and useful arts" to motivate innovators, stimulate the economy and establish just laws.\u000a\u000aThe US has become the most powerful nation on Earth and among the greatest in history, because it has long respected and promoted science. Countless policies, from military deployments to regulations that control the formula of a shampoo, are based on science.\u000a\u000aScientific research depends on government investment (approximately $65 billion in the US last year), which itself relies on a social compact: that basic research across all fields is beneficial to a nation.\u000a\u000aCurrently, science is being actively undermined by ideological forces motivated to maintain the status quo rather than advance the nation's long-term interest. This is especially true of the extractive fossil fuel industries. When facing tides of deliberate misinformation, scientists, engineers and researchers have taken it upon themselves to organize and raise awareness about their professions and the vital importance of the scientific enterprise.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) The unrecognized nation of Somaliland, a semi-autonomous region of Somalia, has secured its largest ever foreign investment deal.\u000a\u000aDubai-based development firm DP World will pump $442 million into transforming the country's Berbera Port on the Gulf of Aden, with the ambition of creating a regional trade hub.\u000a\u000aDP World has committed to managing the port for 30 years. The company plans to develop an ambitious new shipyard, quay, and free trade zone on the site.\u000a\u000aThe Somaliland government hopes the development will enable it to rival neighboring Djibouti as a point of entry for East African trade, and the project could also prove a much-needed economic boost.\u000a\u000aState-in-waiting\u000a\u000aSomaliland declared independence in 1991, breaking away from war-torn Somalia.\u000a\u000aBut despite maintaining relative stability and holding free elections, not a single country has recognized its statehood. The international community has prioritized the development of Somalia as a united country.\u000a\u000aThe deal with DP World represents a major coup for Somaliland as it demonstrates the country's clout on the world stage.\u000a\u000aThe investment is timely. Somaliland is blighted by youth unemployment of over 60%, and its worst drought in years has affected 1.5 million people - over 30% of the population.\u000a\u000aThe development divides opinion among the local population.\u000a\u000aJama Jusse Jama, the director of the Red Sea Cultural Association in Somaliland's capital Hargeisa, believes the project will create opportunities.\u000a\u000a"Berbera Port is extremely fundamental for Somaliland," he told CNN. "(This investment) will boost the connection with the rest of Africa, especially Ethiopia. It's too early to say it's all positive, but I am confident it's a step forward."\u000a\u000aBut there are fears that land around the site will be bought up by wealthy businessmen at the expense of the wider population.\u000a\u000a"The makeup of Berbera will definitely change," Mohamed Aden Hassan, head of local news channel StarTV, told Reuters . "It is already showing signs of becoming an increasingly exclusive club."\u000a\u000aThe port development could improve Somaliland's international standing.\u000a\u000aStrategic location\u000a\u000aDP World's interest in this little-known fishing town is largely explained by its location, sitting conveniently at the apex of trade routes in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and East Africa.\u000a\u000a"The Horn of Africa is a fast growing region with some of the fastest growing economies in the world," says DP World CEO Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem. "DP World Berbera builds on growth in the region where we are enabling trade."\u000a\u000aThe location also offers opportunities to landlocked Ethiopia, which is heavily reliant on neighboring Djibouti, with 90% of trade passing through the tiny state.\u000a\u000aEthiopia currently imports limited quantities of food through Berbera, but the imminent development will allow it to vastly scale up traffic through the port.\u000a\u000aThe Somaliland government claims it has an agreement for Ethiopia to take a 19% share of the port, which should deliver mutual benefits.\u000a\u000a"Ethiopia having access to the sea is a major deal for Somaliland, and Ethiopia," says Laura Hammond, an East Africa specialist at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London.\u000a\u000a"Ethiopia has already built a road up to the border with Somaliland basically advertizing the fact that they're waiting to do business."\u000a\u000aFor its part, Somaliland will gain a powerful partner and ally. Ethiopia is one of the most dynamic economies in Africa, the host nation of the African Union, and a key driver of international diplomacy.\u000a\u000aAfter two decades in the economic and political wilderness, the unrecognized state may finally be establishing itself on the world stage.

aVIt was an unoriginal argument: Women aren't biologically fit to succeed in tech.\u000a\u000aOver the weekend, a 3,300-word manifesto written by one of Google's male engineers was leaked to the press. In the memo, the rank-and-file engineer mused that women aren't suited for tech jobs for "biological" reasons. Men have "higher drive for status," and women have higher rates of anxiety disorders -- making for "lower numbers of women in high stress jobs."\u000a\u000aGoogle (GOOG) quickly condemned the document's assertions. And on Monday, CEO Sundar Pichai emailed the company's staff blasted portions of the memo for "advancing harmful gender stereotypes" in the workplace. "To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK," Pichai wrote.\u000a\u000aThe memo has generated widespread outrage.\u000a\u000aIn fact, in terms of abilities, attitudes and actions, the differences between the sexes are scarce and minimal, Wharton professor of management and psychology Adam Grant pointed out on Monday.\u000a\u000aSarah Allen, a senior technical leader at Google, told CNN Tech that the memo "distracts everybody from the real issues. It's really frustrating to have to respond to an ill-thought out series of arguments."\u000a\u000aRelated: Google CEO slams anti-diversity memo as 'offensive'\u000a\u000aAllen said she was speaking in an individual capacity, not as a representative of the company. She joined Google more than a year ago and is a member of one of its diversity teams, but she's been working as an engineer and manager in the industry for more than two decades.\u000a\u000aAllen, who publicly commented on the memo on her blog, said it illustrated conscious bias.\u000a\u000aIt "undermines the people who you are saying are different. There is no evidence that we even understand what makes someone a good software developer. It is not linked to math, it's not linked to good education," she told CNN Tech. "I hope he did not mean to imply that his female peers are neurotic. However, that is a message that is underlying it ... It was not thoughtful about the impact it would have on his colleagues."\u000a\u000aLack of women and minority employees continues to be a deep-rooted and painful problem in tech.\u000a\u000aRelated: Google's open culture tested by engineer's anti-diversity memo\u000a\u000aAllegations of sexism and harassment at Uber opened a flood of conversations around Silicon Valley's sexist culture. Despite publishing diversity reports and expressing a desire to increase minority hires, companies haven't shown much measurable improvement in workplace demographics over the last few years.\u000a\u000aTurnover in the tech industry caused by the mistreatment of employees costs companies $16 billion a year in replacement costs, according to a recent study from the Kapor Center. The study also found that women "experienced and observed" much more unfair treatment than men.\u000a\u000aAllen, who said her personal experience working at Google has been a good one, said the industry needs to focus on "addressing actual toxic work environments and insuring that people treat their colleagues with respect. This work is creative work, you cannot do creative work in a climate of fear."\u000a\u000aRelated: Facebook's minority workforce gains are "still disappointing"\u000a\u000aIt isn't that women aren't cut out to be engineers.\u000a\u000aA grassroots attempt to shatter the stereotypes of what an engineer "looks like" went viral in 2015. That same year, a documentary, "CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap," premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. It highlighted women who played integral roles in computer science history, like Ada Lovelace, considered to be the first computer programmer, and Grace Hopper, a U.S. Navy admiral and programming pioneer. The film aimed to create awareness of what's really behind tech's current gender and diversity issues.\u000a\u000aRobin Hauser, the director of "CODE," concluded that tech's gender gap is caused by a mix of stereotypes, startup culture, dearth of role models, pervasiveness of sexism, and inadequate educational pipelines.\u000a\u000aHauser told CNN Tech on Monday that the memo making the rounds now is "totally missing the point."\u000a\u000aRelated: Sexual harassment in tech: Women reveal their stories\u000a\u000a"The part that's most offensive to me is the assumption that women don't seek leadership roles, don't want leadership roles, and don't have the drive for leadership roles," Hauser said. At Google, women hold just 25% of leadership roles, according to Google's latest diversity report.\u000a\u000aLea Coligado, 23, is a software engineer at Google. She said it was difficult to read the manifesto, which purported to be based on science and biology but lacked citations to any evidence or research. She said that her team is supportive and has about an equal number of men and women. But she said the memo was a reminder that it's not this way for everyone.\u000a\u000aPrior to joining Google, Coligado said she experienced a lot of what others had warned her about in the tech industry, including sexual harassment. In 2014, she started a blog while an undergraduate at Stanford University called "Women in Silicon Valley" to celebrate women who've stayed in tech "despite the macro and micro aggressions." She continues to work on the blog, even recruiting a team of three other Googlers to help with it. They post twice a month. "The point is to show their resilience."

aVDean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program "The Dean Obeidallah Show" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @deanofcomedy . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Within moments of Donald Trump announcing his 17-day vacation -- at his golf club in New Jersey -- which begins Friday, his detractors in the media, the political world and beyond, slammed him for this new Trump hypocrisy.\u000a\u000aRecall that Trump had regularly skewered Barack Obama for taking vacations while he was President, and had even tweeted, quoting from his own book, that if you like your job you don't need a vacation . "Don't take vacations," he wrote in "Think Like A Billionaire." What's the point? If you're not enjoying your work, you're in the wrong job."\u000a\u000aBut Trump's critics have it all wrong.\u000a\u000aWe should be applauding this vacation. Not because Trump has earned a taxpayer-funded holiday. No, as a Quinnipiac poll released this week found, Trump's approval rating is now at the lowest point ever for a president at this point in his term: an abysmal 33%.\u000a\u000aWhat's more, Trump has already spent millions and millions of dollars of our money -- yours and mine -- jetting off to spend weekends at one of his private country clubs to get a break and often play golf . In fact, Trump is on pace to spend more in his first year on personal travel than Obama did in his eight years in the White House.\u000a\u000aSo while Trump is clearly not deserving of a 17-day vacation only six months into his new job, we, the people, desperately need one! Typically presidents, like Lincoln, will visibly age while in office. In this case, Trump is doing a reverse-Lincoln: he is aging all of us. That is, all of us who are responsible for his dismal 33% approval rating.\u000a\u000aBetween his alarming policies, his alarming tweets and his alarming gaffes, he may actually be generating enough agita to shorten my life expectancy.\u000a\u000aThe Trump presidency reminds me of this season of "Game of Thrones," which has been trimmed from the typical 10 episodes to seven. As a result, more action than ever had to be crammed into a smaller period of time.\u000a\u000aSo let us hope that for the next 17 days, we can all have a Trump-cation. We can return to the lives that we enjoyed B.T. (Before Trump.) We can spend more time with the family. Take up a new hobby that is actually healthy. Maybe even figure out what the Kardishians have been up to (kidding; the one upside to Trump has been we don't hear about the Kardishians anymore).\u000a\u000aOf course, the big question is: will Trump ruin our Trump-cation? It's very possible. I get the sense Trump is like the boss who calls you just after you finally got comfortable on the beach on day one of your getaway to ask you a "quick work question." (It's never quick!)\u000a\u000aThe fact is, it's hard to believe Trump will tolerate being out of the headlines for too long. Reporters will be trailing the President at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. And he will likely call a press conference at some point to lash out at someone or something. And of course, with even less work to do, he may fill his spare time by tweeting.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aBut here's hoping that Trump's new chief of staff John Kelly has the foresight to cut off Trump's data plan as part of his new reining in of the President. We all need a rest from his Twitter tirades.\u000a\u000aSeventeen days will come and go so quickly. But let's pray that for at least a few of those days, we can all get the Trump-cation we have earned.

aVCarol Costello anchors the 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET edition of CNN's "Newsroom" each weekday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single.\u000a\u000aI did. And I do.\u000a\u000aRecently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want.\u000a\u000a"I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom," 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. "There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well."\u000a\u000aJackie Demate, also 21, agreed. "I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe."\u000a\u000aCarol Costello\u000a\u000aAt first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, "Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!"\u000a\u000aJackie didn't blink. "But, Europe!" she exclaimed. "I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy."\u000a\u000aBefore you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once . That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960.\u000a\u000aWhat a fine example my generation is! Not.\u000a\u000aStill, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29.\u000a\u000aReligious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction.\u000a\u000aA study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says: "From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being." On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be "more desirable marriage prospects."\u000a\u000aBingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt.\u000a\u000a"Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt," Emily Crille told me. "That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home."\u000a\u000aI felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable?\u000a\u000aPerhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right.\u000a\u000aScandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today : "In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying."\u000a\u000aThe article also points out that "Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth."\u000a\u000aIn an effort to understand the joys of "sambo," the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden.\u000a\u000a"To put it short," he told us, "marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation."\u000a\u000aWow.\u000a\u000aFifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, "I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it."\u000a\u000aMaybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: "The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities."\u000a\u000aMy Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, "Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for."\u000a\u000aMarriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough.\u000a\u000aWhich brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point?\u000a\u000aIn the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with "I dos"?\u000a\u000aI don't know. But I would love to know if you do.\u000a\u000aRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.

aVMarc J. Randazza is a Las Vegas-based First Amendment attorney and managing partner of the Randazza Legal Group. Follow him on Twitter: @marcorandazza. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Donald Trump has said a lot of strange things -- some funny, some creepy, but none scarier than what he said on Friday : that if he is elected president, he will "open up our libel laws" to make it easier to sue the media and "win lots of money." No matter what you may think about his other policy ideas, if he keeps this promise, we won't be able to effectively express dissent against anything else he might want to do. We can fight any bad policy if we have a robust First Amendment.\u000a\u000aSome say that Trump is just being a blowhard, that he doesn't know what he is talking about, and that for all his bluster, there is nothing he could or would do.\u000a\u000aI am not so sure. Trump has a history of filing SLAPP suits. SLAPP stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. This describes a lawsuit filed against someone for exercising his or her First Amendment rights -- filed with little chance of success, but with the knowledge that the lawsuit itself is the punishment. After all, if people have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves because they criticized Donald Trump, they might think better of doing so again in the future.\u000a\u000aHowever, some states, like California and Nevada , have strong anti-SLAPP laws, which dispense with such cases early and force the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorneys' fees. (Full disclosure: I was instrumental in urging passage of the Nevada Anti-SLAPP law.)\u000a\u000aTrump recently got stung with an anti-SLAPP decision, which he probably had in mind when he spoke about "opening up" our libel laws. In fact, he isn't the first big shot to try to make it easier to sue for defamation after having a SLAPP suit blow up in his face.\u000a\u000aTherefore, Trump is clearly frustrated with anti-SLAPP laws (which shows that they work) and the landmark defamation case, New York Times v. Sullivan.\u000a\u000aWhen people say that Trump can't do anything about defamation law at the federal level, I think they miss the point that there is a lot of support for a federal anti-SLAPP law. I think we need one, and in fact, HR 2304 was one such proposal this last session. If it passes, we could expect President Trump to veto it.\u000a\u000aBeyond new federal legislation, defamation law is a matter of state law, leaving little for a president to do about it. To win a defamation case, the plaintiff must show publication of a false statement of fact that damages the plaintiff's reputation. This standard can vary a bit from state to state, but it generally fits that general set of requirements.\u000a\u000aTherefore, what could Trump do to "open up" the libel laws? He personally? Nothing legally, but if elected, he could pick Supreme Court justices willing to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan, which is in my view the most important case protecting our First Amendment rights. It is the greatest protection we have from government officials or powerful businesses choking the life out of public debate and a free press. Overturning it would change everything we know about freedom of the press.\u000a\u000aIn a defamation case involving an ordinary citizen suing for defamation, the citizen only needs to show that the defendant knew the statement was false, or failed to exercise "reasonable care" before publishing it. So let's say that a blogger writes an article about a private citizen accusing that person of a crime, based on a false statement by a witness, without following up. That might be a failure to exercise reasonable care, and the blogger might lose the case.\u000a\u000aBut if the same blogger wrote one about a public figure, like Trump, then Trump has to prove that the blogger did so with "actual malice."\u000a\u000aEven some judges and lawyers get this wrong, so don't feel bad if you didn't know what "actual malice" means. It has nothing to do with "malice" at all. It means that the defendant published the statement knowing it was false or with a reckless disregard for the truth.\u000a\u000aSo if we return to my example, let's say someone wrote a blog post about Donald Trump, accusing him of a crime, but based it just on an anonymous email, without following up -- that might be considered to be "reckless disregard."\u000a\u000aWhy the different standard depending on the plaintiff?\u000a\u000aFrom New York Times v. Sullivan: "(W)e consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."\u000a\u000aDebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open... Justice William Brennan\u000a\u000aHow beautiful that language is. It encapsulates what America is all about, the way only Justice William Brennan could.\u000a\u000aThe court recognized that public figures have access to the media to defend themselves, and it went on to reject any notion that the speaker must prove truth; instead the plaintiff must prove falsity. This is all because the First Amendment needs "breathing space" in order for free speech to survive. And if we impose liability for merely erroneous reports on political conduct, it would reflect the "obsolete doctrine that the governed must not criticize their governors."\u000a\u000aSo what if Trump appoints one or two Supreme Court judges who are willing to overturn Sullivan? Justice Elena Kagan has already voiced skepticism about the extension of Sullivan too far into other kinds of libel cases. The only member of the court I think we could count on to be strongly opposed to overturning it is Chief Justice John Roberts.\u000a\u000aNo matter how flawed it is, our democracy depends upon robust free speech and free press rights. New York Times v. Sullivan matters more than anything else. If we lose the right to criticize the government in wide-open and robust debate, we lose an important part of what it means to be free.

aVThree months ago, CNNMoney examined six barometers of the economy to gauge how America was doing under President Trump.\u000a\u000aIt's time to take another look under the hood.\u000a\u000aThe good news for Trump is that many parts of the economy are still humming. Trump is taking credit particularly for strong job growth and record high stock prices. The housing market is another bright spot. And the trade deficit has narrowed.\u000a\u000aHere's a more detailed look at the economy, 200 days into the Trump presidency.\u000a\u000a1. Jobs\u000a\u000aIt's hard to find fault with the latest jobs numbers. The unemployment rate is 4.3%, a 16-year low. The economy has added more than 1 million jobs since Trump took office.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, wage growth has yet to really pick up. Employers still don't feel pressure to offer big salaries to attract the workers they need. Average hourly earnings have increased only 2.5% over the past 12 months. The Federal Reserve would rather see 3% to 3.4%.\u000a\u000aStill, because inflation is low, those wage gains are helping many Americans.\u000a\u000a2. Housing prices\u000a\u000aThey're red hot.\u000a\u000aThe average price for an existing home in June was a record $263,800, or 6.5% higher than a year ago. June was the 64th consecutive month of gains compared with a year earlier.\u000a\u000aAnd borrowing money to buy a house remains relatively affordable, despite recent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage is just 3.93%, according to Freddie Mac, down from 4.02% three months ago.\u000a\u000a3. Lending\u000a\u000aConsumers aren't borrowing just to buy homes. They're taking on debt for cars and using credit cards for lots of other things.\u000a\u000aAmericans had $3.843 trillion in loans outstanding in May, up from $3.766 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Fed.\u000a\u000aAnd businesses are borrowing more, reversing a trend from earlier this year. That could be a good sign for Trump and the economy. Consumers can't prop up the economy alone: Companies need to pull their weight and invest.\u000a\u000a4. Consumer spending\u000a\u000aBig stores including Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and J.C. Penney (JCP) report earnings this week, and the results could be lousy.\u000a\u000aThe dominance of Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) is one reason. But Americans may also be spending less on clothes, toys and other smaller purchases -- even though they're taking out more loans.\u000a\u000aRetail sales fell 0.2% in June. Economists were expecting a slight increase. And overall consumer spending was up just 0.1% in June.\u000a\u000aSpending has increased 2.8% over the past 12 months, a bit below the 3% pace many experts feel is necessary to keep the economy on track.\u000a\u000a5. Trade\u000a\u000aTrump wants more consumers -- in the United States and around the globe -- to buy American. And it looks like that's starting to happen.\u000a\u000aThe trade deficit fell slightly in June from three months ago, to $43.6 billion. That's the lowest since just before the election.\u000a\u000aAmerica's suddenly vibrant oil industry is a big reason the balance is shifting. Thanks to technologies like fracking, the United States exported more crude in June and imported less.\u000a\u000aExports to Canada and Mexico rose in June, too, a possible sign that Trump's tough talk is working with America's two big North American trading partners.\u000a\u000aChina is still a sore spot. The U.S. trade deficit with China is up more than 6% this year.\u000a\u000a6. Stocks\u000a\u000aAn undeniable win for the president. Fears of a market collapse under Trump have proved to be misguided.\u000a\u000aThe Dow keeps hitting records and is up 12% this year.\u000a\u000aAnd the blue chips are lagging. The Nasdaq has surged nearly 20% thanks to big gains in Amazon, Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30).\u000a\u000aFor now, Wall Street is willing to ignore the turmoil in the Trump administration. Investors are hoping for eventual changes to the tax code and deregulation of the financial industry.\u000a\u000aStrong earnings don't hurt, either. Profits for the companies in the S&P 500 are up more than 10% from a year ago.

aV(CNN) Meals from the sunny Mediterranean have been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life, along with a reduced risk for diabetes and high blood pressure.\u000a\u000aNow you can add lowering your risk for dementia to the ever growing list of reasons to follow the Mediterranean diet or one of its dietary cousins.\u000a\u000aNew research being presented at the Alzheimer's Association International conference in London this week found healthy older adults who followed the Mediterranean or the similar MIND diet lowered their risk of dementia by a third.\u000a\u000a"Eating a healthy plant-based diet is associated with better cognitive function and around 30% to 35% lower risk of cognitive impairment during aging," said lead author Claire McEvoy, of the University of California, San Francisco's School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aMcEvoy stressed that because the study was conducted in a nationally representative older population "the findings are relevant to the general public."\u000a\u000a"While 35% is a greater than expected decrease for a lifestyle choice, I am not surprised," said Rudolph Tanzi, who directs the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and recently co-authored a book with Deepak Chopra on genes and aging called "Super Genes."\u000a\u000a"The activity of our genes is highly dependent on four main factors: diet, exercise, sleep and stress management," said Tanzi, who was not involved in the study. "Of these, perhaps diet is most important."\u000a\u000aMcEvoy's study investigated at the eating habits of nearly 6,000 older Americans with an average age of 68. After adjusting for age, gender, race, low educational attainment and lifestyle and health issues -- such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, depression, smoking and physical inactivity -- researchers found that those who followed the MIND or Mediterranean diet had a 30% to 35% lower risk of cognitive impairment.\u000a\u000aThe more people stayed on those diets, said McEvoy, the better they functioned cognitively.\u000a\u000aThose who marginally followed the diet also benefited, but by a much smaller margin. They were 18% less likely to exhibit signs of cognitive impairment.\u000a\u000aWhat are the Mediterranean and MIND diets?\u000a\u000aForget lasagne, pizza, spanakopita and lamb souvlaki -- they are not on the daily menu of those who live by the sunny Mediterranean seaside.\u000a\u000aThe true diet is simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra virgin olive oil. Say goodbye to refined sugar or flour and fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all.\u000a\u000aMeat can make a rare appearance, but usually only to flavor a dish. Instead, meals may include eggs, dairy and poultry, but in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. Fish, however, are a staple.\u000a\u000aThe MIND diet takes the best brain foods of the Mediterranean diet and the famous salt-reducing DASH diet, and puts them together. MIND encourages a focus on eating from 10 healthy food groups while rejecting foods from five unhealthy groups.\u000a\u000aMIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, with DASH standing for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.\u000a\u000aMIND was developed by Martha Clare Morris, a nutritional epidemiologist at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center in the US.\u000a\u000aThose who follow MIND reject butter and stick margarine, red meats, cheeses, fried or fast food and sweets. Instead, they eat at least six servings a week of green leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale, and at least one serving a day of another vegetable. Three servings a day of whole grains are a must.\u000a\u000aThey also add in at least three servings of beans, two or more servings of berries, two servings of chicken or turkey, and once serving of fish each week. Olive oil is their main cooking ingredient, and they drink a glass of wine a day.\u000a\u000aMorris has some powerful stats behind her diet.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, she studied 923 Chicago-area seniors and found those who say they followed the diet religiously had a 53% lower chance of getting Alzheimer's, while those who followed it moderately lowered their risk by about 35%. Follow-up observational studies showed similar benefits.\u000a\u000aMorris and her colleagues are currently recruiting volunteers for a three-year clinical study to try to prove the link.\u000a\u000aAdditional evidence\u000a\u000aA second study presented at the conference also examined the impact of the MIND diet. Researchers from Wake Forest School of Medicine followed 7,057 women, average age 71, over almost 10 years and found those who most closely followed the MIND diet had a 34% reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer's.\u000a\u000aA third study at the conference looked at the dietary habits of 2,223 dementia-free Swedish adults over six years who followed the Nordic Prudent Dietary Pattern (NPDP) diet, which avoids sweets and fatty and processed foods. Instead, the diet emphasizes eating non-root vegetables, apple/pears/peaches, pasta/rice, poultry, fish, vegetable oils, tea and water, and light to moderate wine intake.\u000a\u000aSwedes who stuck to the diet at a moderate or higher level preserved their cognitive function better than those who ate more processed and fatty foods.\u000a\u000aLastly, a fourth study examined MRI brain scans of 330 cognitively normal adults, with an average age of 79, and found eating foods that raise inflammation in the body -- such as sweets, processed foods and fried and fatty foods -- raised the risk for a shrinking "aging" brain and lower cognitive function.\u000a\u000aThat comes as no surprise to neurologist Rudy Tanzi.\u000a\u000a"Foods that keep blood pressure normal, provide us with antioxidants, and maintain healthy bacteria in our gut, or microbiome, will serve to help keep chronic inflammation in check in the brain and entire body," said Tanzi.\u000a\u000aDespite the similarities of the results, experts point out that all of this research is observational, meaning that it is based on reports by individuals as to what they eat. To prove the connection between diet and dementia risk, said McEvoy, researchers will need to move to scientifically controlled experiments.\u000a\u000a"I think the studies, taken together, suggest a role for high quality dietary patterns in brain health and for protection against cognitive decline during aging," said McEvoy. "Diet is modifiable, and in light of these studies we need clinical trials to test whether changing diet can improve or maintain cognition."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aUntil that definite proof is available, say experts, there's no harm in using this information to makes changes in your diet and lifestyle that could help protect your brain.\u000a\u000a"Although the idea that a healthy diet can help protect against cognitive decline as we age is not new, the size and length of these four studies demonstrate how powerful good dietary practices may be in maintaining brain health and function," said Keith Fargo, Alzheimer's Association Director of Scientific Programs and Outreach.\u000a\u000aTanzi agrees. "It's about time we started placing a greater emphasis on what we eat as we strive to have our 'healthspan' keep up with our increasing 'lifespan'."

aV(CNN) The suicide rate among girls between the ages of 15 and 19 reached a 40-year high in 2015, according to new data from the National Center for Health Statistics .\u000a\u000aIn the shorter term, the suicide rate for those girls doubled between 2007 and 2015, the research indicates.\u000a\u000aBy comparison, the 2015 suicide rate for boys in this age group was lower than in the peak years of the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. The researchers derived suicide rates from official data from death certificates.\u000a\u000a"These data show that between 2007 and 2015, there's substantial increases in suicide rates for both young males and young females," said Tom Simon, an author of the report and associate director for science in the division of violence protection at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which published the new data Thursday.\u000a\u000a"For young males, there was a 31% increase in suicide rates, and for young females, the suicide rate doubled," Simon said.\u000a\u000aPotential factors\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the suicide rate for males between 15 and 19 increased from 12 per 100,000 population in 1975 to 18.1 per 100,000 in 1990. It then declined to 10.8 per 100,000 by 2007 and then increased again to 14.2 per 100,000 by 2015.\u000a\u000aAmong females, the suicide rate increased from 2.9 per 100,000 in 1975 to 3.7 per 100,000 in 1990, dipped to 2.4 per 100,000 in 2007 and then spiked to 5.1 per 100,000 in 2015.\u000a\u000a"We know that overall in the US, we're seeing increases in suicide rates across all age groups," Simon said, putting the new report in perspective.\u000a\u000a"We're not seeing the same kind of increases among the oldest adults, but we are seeing substantial and sustained increases now for the other age groups really going back to 2000," he said, adding that the the pattern is "pretty robust."\u000a\u000aIf you suspect someone may be at risk: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any \ufb01rearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

For more tips and warning signs, click here.\u000a\u000aCarl Tishler, an adjunct associate professor of psychology and psychiatry at the Ohio State University who was not involved in the report, said the high suicide rates among older teens in 2015 "could be the result of a lot of things."\u000a\u000a"Some of the opiate or heroin overdoses in adolescents may be interpreted by emergency departments as suicides. There may be more Internet suicides," Tishler said.\u000a\u000aSimon said it's "unlikely" that increases in suicide rates are due to any single factor. Possible risk factors for suicide include a history of substance abuse, exposure to violence, social isolation, conflict within relationships, stigma and a lack of available support.\u000a\u000aSimon suggested that the lingering effects of the Great Recession in the late 2000s may have contributed to stress within families, causing anxiety in teens.\u000a\u000a"In times of economic prosperity, suicide rates go down," he said. "In times of economic instability, suicide rates go up."\u000a\u000aGender differences\u000a\u000aSocial media can have either negative or positive effects, Simon said. Cyberbullying and harmful content might push a vulnerable teen toward self-harm, yet "social media can help increase connections between people, and it's an opportunity to correct myths about suicide and to allow people to access prevention resources and materials."\u000a\u000aDorian A. Lamis, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine/Grady Health System, theorized that use of social media and cyberbullying may affect teenage girls more than boys, resulting in rising suicide deaths among older teen girls.\u000a\u000a"Some research has suggested that the timing of puberty in girls is a contributing factor for the increased suicide rate," said Lamis, who was not involved in the new research. Puberty starts as early as 8 in some girls. The psychosocial and physical changes may leave girls "vulnerable to depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders earlier on in life." These known risk factors for suicide may catch up with a girl as she grows older.\u000a\u000aTishler noted that previous studies from the CDC have indicated that males take their own lives at nearly four times the rate of females and thus represent 77.9% of all suicides. Yet females are more likely than males to have suicidal thoughts.\u000a\u000a"If you look at suicide attempts by girls, it's typically that girls attempt suicide about four to one or three to one over boys, yet boys complete suicide in the reverse," Tishler said. "That tends, we think, to have to do with the modality of suicide attempt."\u000a\u000aSimon noted that in this older teen age group, the primary method chosen by boys is firearms, yet for girls, the most common method is suffocation. Still, a significant number of females may choose to poison themselves with an overdose , which can be remediated in an ER in some cases, Tishler said.\u000a\u000aHe theorized that girls now have access to pills that may be more lethal -- or more quickly lethal -- than those available to girls in the past, and this may have contributed to the rising rate of suicide deaths among teen girls. Similarly, Lamis conjectured that girls may have access to "more lethal methods in their suicide attempts, resulting in an increased number of deaths."\u000a\u000aThe new report also does not indicate how many of the teens who completed suicide were in treatment with a medical health professional and how many were receiving medication for depression or other mental illness, Tishler said. He added that he's convinced that the quickness to start or change these medications, which are categorized as psychotropic, "is done in such a manner that makes people more vulnerable to attempting suicide."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Physicians need to be careful" when increasing, starting or stopping psychotropic medications, because this may "give someone energy to die by suicide," Tishler said.\u000a\u000aOne symptom of depression can be psychomotor retardation, which medication reduces, helping people become more active. They may attempt more activities to do better in school or to be more social. The medicines may give depressed teens more energy to plan and follow through with a suicide attempt or die by suicide. Psychotropic drugs also can change mental status and in some cases may increase suicidal thoughts, which is why some of them come with warnings.

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 18th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 On the shores of Dong Mo Lake, about 40 kilometers east of Hanoi, sequined dancers twirl with ribbons, while guitarists perform intimate concerts on rafts.\u000a\u000aThere's camping, yoga and swimming -- not to mention 40 hours of non-stop live music.\u000a\u000aIt might sound like Glastonbury but this, in fact, is Quest , a lifestyle festival now in its fifth year.\u000a\u000aIt's not alone. Hanoi, which has long been the country's creative heart, is challenging regional powerhouses such as Tokyo, Singapore and Seoul for the festival capital of Asia title.\u000a\u000a"Hanoi absolutely has potential to become a music hub in Asia -- there's a strong cultural underpinning to work with," Jeremy Wellard, co-founder of Quest, tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"As Vietnam's economy keeps growing, and as social structures change, we are going to see the country become a player in the arts and culture scene."\u000a\u000aA new beat\u000a\u000aHanoi's 7.5 million inhabitants famously buzz around in an impenetrable, deafening sea of motorbikes.\u000a\u000aDespite this, the city retains a quaint, historic feel with its low-rise colonial architecture and leafy promenades.\u000a\u000aIt was this romantic vibe that inspired Wellard to relocate to Hanoi from Australia, where he'd helped organize music events such as Brisbane's hip-hop festival Stylin'Up and the G20 Cultural Celebrations , a citywide arts and culture festival.\u000a\u000aIn 2011, Wellard and a few friends spent a weekend at Son Tinh Camp, at Dong Mo.\u000a\u000aA freshwater lake, forests, tents for rent ... they quickly saw its potential.\u000a\u000a"We wanted to bring that festival atmosphere to Hanoi, at a place that felt like an escape, without the city bearing down on us," he says.\u000a\u000aA performance at Quest.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Quest launched as a "really DIY project," with roughly 250 festival-goers. This year, it'll be 20 times that size, with five stages and about 5,000 guests between November 10 and 12.\u000a\u000aEnglish pioneers of ambient house The Orb are on the line-up, alongside gypsy-electro-nu-rave act Slamboree Sound System, Hanoi's own house and techno artist DJ Tùng Tím and dreamy Indonesian pop act Stars and Rabbit.\u000a\u000a"We were lucky to be around at a time when Hanoi really started to open up to the outside world and the tastes of Vietnamese were opening up," says Wellard.\u000a\u000aPlease don't stop the music\u000a\u000aQuest isn't an anomaly.\u000a\u000aThis April, house and techno festival Equation joined Hanoi's festival scene, at the same camp site as Quest at Dong Mo Lake.\u000a\u000aEquation festival debuted in April.\u000a\u000aIts founders -- the team behind Cliche Records , a Hong Kong-based music label, booking and promotion agency -- tell CNN that Hanoi was the obvious choice for their event.\u000a\u000a"Hong Kong was saturated and too hard to pull off," Ouissam Mokretar, one of the festival's co-founders, tells CNN. "Seoul and Japan have the same problem, with space and pricing.\u000a\u000a"China, Manila and Bangkok are so hard with the politics and the laws. But Vietnam is still emerging. Travelers are coming and falling in love with the country and local kids want to experience new things."\u000a\u000aEquation revolves around two main stages, with a third platform in the wings for yoga, film screenings and craft workshops.\u000a\u000aMore than 30 acts performed over three days, including American electronic musician DJ Shlomo Alex from Tokyo (now based in Berlin), and Norwegian act Telephones\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Monsoon Music Festival -- which has hosted Grammy-winner Joss Stone and German rock band the Scorpions -- returns for the third time this autumn, with thousands of guests expected at the Citadel of Thang Long, a historic fort south of West Lake.\u000a\u000aA city on the move\u000a\u000aMokretar says Hanoi's expanding festival scene is thanks, in part, to the city's growing network of budget flights.\u000a\u000aIn the past year, VietJet has launched direct routes from Hanoi to Yangon, Seoul, Busan, and Siem Reap -- with a link to Kuala Lumpur to follow this September.\u000a\u000aFellow low-cost carrier Jetstar Pacific Airlines also introduced affordable, direct flights to Osaka earlier this year.\u000a\u000aOuissam Mokretar, Equation festival co-founder \u201c(Hanoi is) much more connected now than just a year ago -- the difference from 2016 is crazy.\u201d\u000a\u000a"(Hanoi is) much more connected now than just a year ago -- the difference from 2016 is crazy," recalls Mokretar.\u000a\u000a"Tickets are almost 50% cheaper. Last year, flying between Taipei and Hanoi cost around $400, but now VietJet opened a route and it's only $150."\u000a\u000aThe relative affordability of attending a festival in Hanoi, compared with Hong Kong or Tokyo, also has an impact.\u000a\u000aTickets to Quest, for example, cost $57 for the three-day weekend, compared with $208 for a three-day ticket to Hong Kong's annual Clockenflap festival.\u000a\u000aAn appetite for music\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 8 Down time at the Japan Ultra Music Festival . A glittery haven for hardcore EDM junkies, the festival takes place again this September in Tokyo's Odaiba Ultra Park.\u000a\u000aNana Nguyen, a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman who has attended Quest for the past four years, says it has an open-minded, "free love" mentality -- much like what you might expect to find at European or American festivals.\u000a\u000a"The (countryside) festival location might be a little inconvenient, but once you're there in nature, you feel really refreshed, relaxed and free," Nguyen tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"It's good to have that break from the city. We're all working all the time, and there you can feel like there's another side of Hanoi."\u000a\u000aShe also put Quest's success down to a voracious appetite for new music in Vietnam.\u000a\u000a"This generation, they are really into entertainment -- much more than before. They want to be modern, up on all the new fashion and music trends," says Nguyen.

aVStory highlights Nikki Haley: Widespread human rights violations a warning sign that breakdown in security is coming\u000a\u000aSyrian war just one example of how such violations can spiral into all-out war, she says\u000a\u000aAmbassador Nikki R. Haley is the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. The views expressed are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Imagine you are the parent of a boy -- a teenager. Policemen come to your home in the middle of the night and take your boy away. He is held without explanation for weeks. And when he finally comes home, your boy has all the marks of having been tortured. Bruises from being beaten. Red, open wounds from being burned. Then you look at his hands and the worst is confirmed. Where his fingernails once were, there are only raw, bloody, exposed nerves. Grown men with pliers, he tells you, ripped his fingernails off in prison.\u000a\u000aFor a group of parents in Syria in 2011, this was not an exercise in imagination but a horrifying reality. Their boys were arrested and tortured for the crime of writing anti-government graffiti on the wall of a school. When the parents marched in protest to demand their children's release, security services opened fire on them. When more people came out to protest the killings, the government fired on them again. Soon, the point of no return was reached.\u000a\u000aNikki Haley\u000a\u000a"We were asking in a peaceful way to release the children but their reply was bullets," a relative of one of the boys told a reporter . "Now we can have no compromise with any security branches."\u000a\u000aThe Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.\u000a\u000aAs the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVKarla Cripps, CNN \u2022 Updated 27th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 When a luxury resort developer wants to create a truly spectacular property that'll be talked about for years to come, there are only a handful of designers in Asia up to the task.\u000a\u000aBangkok -based Bill Bensley is among the top on that list.\u000a\u000aAfter nearly four decades in the business with a portfolio of more than 200 luxury hospitality properties in nearly 40 countries he's in a position to be choosy about the projects he'll take on. And there's one overlying philosophy that guides his decisions.\u000a\u000a"If it's no fun, don't do it," Bensley tells CNN, his eyes lighting up with enthusiasm. "If you're not having fun, then you're not going to do a good job. Everybody in our studio here -- 100 people -- we're all about having fun."\u000a\u000aIt'd be hard not to have fun while working at the BENSLEY design studio, a large complex with an art deco feel that once housed Bangkok's Iraq Embassy.\u000a\u000aIt's more like a giant artistic playground than an office. Practically every room, from the fine arts studio to the architecture department, is a colorful buzz of creativity. (See the video at the top of this story for a peek inside.)\u000a\u000a'There are no boundaries'\u000a\u000a"There are no rules to what we do in this studio. There are no boundaries. Anyone can pick up anything."\u000a\u000aIt's fitting, given most of projects with Bensley's involvement are often quite whimsical, places where you'll spend days marveling at the attention to detail.\u000a\u000aThe Harvard-educated American has designed a huge chunk of Asia's most incredible hotels and resorts. These include Oberoi Vilas projects in India , Four Seasons' award-winning resorts in Thailand , St. Regis in Bali and two of Vietnam 's most talked about projects to date, JW Marriott Phu Quoc and the InterContinental Danang.\u000a\u000aHe's been invited to New York to be inducted into the Hospitality Designs Hall of Fame in November.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 15 Bensley says his favorite project to date is the Four Seasons Golden Triangle Tented Camp in Chiang Rai, which he designed over 10 years ago. He recently returned to design a new two-bedroom pool villa for the project.\u000a\u000aWhile Bensley's whimsical stamp is increasingly being seen on projects around the world, a global outlook hasn't weakened his focus.\u000a\u000a"What makes a project magical is the ability to finish down to the smallest detail," he says.\u000a\u000aThis isn't hyperbole.\u000a\u000aBENSLEY studios is known to handle everything from uniform design, menu design, signage and graphics to even the music that people hear as they're wandering around a resort. It's fitting, given Bensley prefers to think of his work in terms of a storyline. And he doesn't focus on the trendiness of materials.\u000a\u000a"Not a whole lot of people think like that so a lot of the hotels being built now are strictly utilitarian and don't have much soul," he says. "Even if it's as simple as the story that we created 25 years ago with Four Seasons Chiang Mai -- living on a farm. It's surrounded by a rice field. It was a such a simple story but it will never go out of style."\u000a\u000aOperating in all design facets -- landscaping, interiors and architecture -- wasn't part of the original plan for Bensley.\u000a\u000a"I started out just doing landscapes and I just got so tired of doing nice gardens for bad buildings," he says. "What I'm trying to do that's a little bit new is to create this mesh between all of these different traditionally separate design companies, where graphic designers, landscape designers and interior designers can all come together in this place where they can work together and create a new product."\u000a\u000aRaiding the cabinet of curiosities\u000a\u000aMuch of the art that Bensley includes in his hospitality projects was created in his studio or handpicked during his travels.\u000a\u000aIn his warehouse, or the "cabinet of curiosities" as he calls it, you'll find everything from animal antlers to a spiral staircase he found in a house in Myanmar.\u000a\u000a"Buy first, think later," he says, reasoning that if he comes across a unique piece he knows he'll use it somewhere eventually. "I select, design and make things for the rooms that are very happy. That are joyful. That are representative of that place."\u000a\u000aBensley says he often chooses projects based, not just on fun, but on whether he's been to a location or not. Hence the reason his portfolio includes projects in nearly 40 countries. Still on his design wish list: Japan and Morocco.\u000a\u000a"What I like the most about [my job] is working in a new place," he says.\u000a\u000a"Someplace where I can learn a new architectural language, can be challenged to try to see something through somebody else's eyes. Inspiration comes from everywhere. But mostly it comes from traveling to new places for me."\u000a\u000aEscapism\u000a\u000aSet inside the InterContinental Danang, this pre-function foyer leads the all black ballroom.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Bensley released the first of a series of books that showcases 26 projects in 12 countries over the last two decades.\u000a\u000aAppropriately called " Escapism, " the 500-page volume features beautiful, large photographs and detailed explanations of the inspirations and design processes behind each project.\u000a\u000aSo where does Bensley go to escape? Definitely not a beach resort.\u000a\u000a"It's funny. I've designed 200 resorts -- a lot of them are on beaches -- but you know what, the last place in the world that I want to go is go and sit on the beach. I would find that really boring."\u000a\u000aHis vacation of choice: fly fishing in Mongolia, where he's been going to unplug for the last four years. Last year, he took 12 of his Thai staff with him.\u000a\u000a"We're up there on the border and we don't see anybody for two, three weeks," he says. "That's one thing I do every year. There's no telephone, there's no computer there. It's completely unplugged and when I come back from there I feel like I can jump over a house."\u000a\u000aComing soon: A Cambodian luxury tented camp\u000a\u000aComing in 2018: Shinta Mani Wild, a tented camp in the wilds of Cambodia.\u000a\u000aOne of Bensley's current projects marries his philanthropy work with his passion for design. Called Shinta Mani Wild, it's part of Bensley's own Shinta Mani hotel brand.\u000a\u000aThe associated Shinta Mani Foundation , which promotes responsible tourism in Cambodia , will be spearheading the conservation and community outreach programs for the camp and provide long-term employment opportunities to those in region.\u000a\u000aBensley says it's his most ambitious luxury camp project to date.\u000a\u000aSet along 1.5 kilometers of river and waterfalls, there are 16 large luxury tents perched over swift waters and waterfalls between southern Cambodia's Bokor and Cardamom national parks. It's due to open in mid-2018.\u000a\u000a"I think this is gonna really change what a camp looks like for the whole world," he says. "It's so luxurious and beautiful."\u000a\u000aBear in mind this is the same man who over a decade ago kick-started the luxury camp phenomena with the Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle in Chiang Rai , which he admits is one of his favorite projects of all time. He was recently invited back to design a new two-bedroom pool villa.\u000a\u000aSo what advice would Bensley offer any budding luxury resort designers?\u000a\u000a"I would urge anyone that's coming into hospitality for the first time to do something weird," he says. "Do something different. Do something that's going to surprise people. Don't do the norm."

aVAlbert Stumm, CNN \u2022 Published 26th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Uniform rows of identical white headstones fill the green space in the small yards of mosques and churches throughout Sarajevo, each one bearing a date that seems too recent for a European war.\u000a\u000aOnly a few blocks outside the city center, some buildings are still pockmarked with bullet holes.\u000a\u000aReminders of the war that dissolved Yugoslavia are everywhere, but the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina is due for a fresh look as signs of a vibrant future begin to outshine those of the nearly four-year siege that devastated Sarajevo during the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aNew hotels add a measure of comfort to what has mostly been a backpacker destination, and five airlines announced new services to the city in the last year, including Qatar Airways and the budget carrier Wizz Air.\u000a\u000aNow the enigmatic city exudes a modern cool in numerous ways, such as a sculpture garden skate park in the restored Austro-Hungarian quarter and margaritas served in the preserved Ottoman bazaar within earshot of the Muslim call to prayer.\u000a\u000aTimothy Clancy, an American who came to Bosnia as a volunteer in 1992 and never left, said he's spent most of his adult life shining a positive light on a place that most travelers think of as a war-torn wasteland.\u000a\u000a"One advantage is, people have low or no expectations," he says. "And Sarajevo drastically exceeds them every time."\u000a\u000aHere are 11 things to do there:\u000a\u000a1. See the Ottoman bazaar\u000a\u000aThe Ottoman bazaar boasts the majority of the historical sights in town, such as the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque.\u000a\u000aThe heart of Sarajevo, which was founded by the Ottomans in the 15th century, still lies in the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija, a tight quarter of one-story market stalls that date to the city's earliest years.\u000a\u000aThe market runs through a few car-free streets along the Miljacka River, leading up the wooden Sebilj fountain in a square teeming with pigeons.\u000a\u000aThroughout the bazaar, exotic aromas of spice markets float among those of sizzling meats, sometimes a whole lamb spit-roasted in full view of passersby. Grizzled men in other stalls use metal tongs to pull searing copper from a fire and then hammer it into intricately designed plates, trays and goblets.\u000a\u000aSome vendors veer closer to kitsch, selling cheap souvenirs and pens made from the shell casings of high-caliber rifles. Others stick with classics such as gooey Turkish delights, their gelatinous cubes redolent of fruit flavors and dusted in flour or coconut.\u000a\u000aThe area also has the majority of the historical sights in town, such as the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and its lunar clock tower. The Hotel President, which opened in 2015 at the edge of the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija, makes a good home base within sniffing distance of the action.\u000a\u000aHotel President , +387 33 575-000, Bazard\u017eani 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a2. Savor a cultural pick-me-up\u000a\u000aYounger Sarajevans enjoy meeting at hookah bars.\u000a\u000aThere are dozens of places for an espresso or cappuccino in the old town, but it's worth searching out Bosnian coffee.\u000a\u000aThick, rich and strong as jet fuel, the local version is such a part of the culture that it's the drink of choice for everyone from courting couples to businessmen closing a deal. Visitors to a Bosnian's house will have coffee served whether they like or not.\u000a\u000aThe coffee grounds are boiled with water in a long-handled copper pot on top of the stove, which most people associate with Turkish coffee. But the beans are generally roasted in Bosnia for a brew that's even more potent.\u000a\u000a"It's 10 times better," Clancy says. "Turks are great at tea but not so much at coffee."\u000a\u000aIn the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija, the Male Daire hookah bar, which is another activity enjoyed by younger Sarajevans, is a laid-back place to perk up and meet some friends. Or for a great people-watching corner, there's the sidewalk cafe outside Kaffa.\u000a\u000aMale Daire , +387 62 434 384, Luled\u017eina 6, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000aKaffa , +387 33 538-633, Sara\u010di 70, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a3. Take in a view from above\u000a\u000aWork began in 1729 on five fortifications built onto the old city wall, but the \u017duta Tabija, or the Yellow Fortress, is basically all that's left. It looms above the city from Jekovac Cliff on the eastern end of the old town, offering a fantastic view and a spectacular place to see the sunset.\u000a\u000aThe red roofs and minarets of the old town give way to the neoclassical heft of an Austo-Hungarian expansion during the late 1800s, and eventually to the skyscrapers of the modern city in the distance. All of it is set against a backdrop of thick forested hills that surround Sarajevo.\u000a\u000aA basic cafe opened in the fortress last year, with picnic tables that make the operation resemble a beer garden. Except no alcohol is served, and in the middle of the tables, a red velvet rope circles a cannon that's fired at sunset during the holy month of Ramadan.\u000a\u000aDespite a few dry locations, the predominately Muslim city prides itself on its secular attitude, and you're much less likely to see a woman covering her hair than one click-clacking down the cobblestones in high heels.\u000a\u000a4. Go on one of the world's best hikes\u000a\u000aVia Dinarica is a mega-network of paths that runs through the Western Balkans from Albania to Slovenia.\u000a\u000aAll those hills surrounding Sarajevo lead to the mountains of the Dinaric Alps, which gave the city reason to host the Winter Olympics in 1984. Well-marked hiking trails wind through the woods on all sides of the city, meaning a hiker could walk out its eastern edge, head north and west along a ridge, and end up back on the other side of town that afternoon.\u000a\u000aThose trails also lead to the Via Dinarica, a mega-network of paths inspired by the Appalachian Trail that runs through the Western Balkans from Albania to Slovenia. Along the way are traditional mountain villages and opportunities for rafting, hiking and climbing.\u000a\u000aThe network was named the best new trail of 2014 by Outside magazine and was on National Geographic Traveler's list of places to go in 2017. ViaDinarica.com is a comprehensive resource.\u000a\u000a"You can print a miniguide for each section of the trail," says Clancy, who helped stitch the trial network together as an ecotourism consultant for the United Nations. "It'll show you where you the water holes are, can give you turn-by-turn directions. It's pretty sophisticated."\u000a\u000a5. See where World War I began\u000a\u000aThe Latin Bridge, which crosses the shallow Miljacka River to connect the old town with the Skenderija neighborhood, is the city's oldest. But as 16th-century bridges go, the structure itself isn't what stands out.\u000a\u000aOn one end of this bridge in 1914, the heir to Hapsburg throne was assassinated by an 18-year-old Serbian, sparking World War I and leading to the extinction of two great empires, the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman.\u000a\u000aA modest museum at the northern end of the bridge tells the story how Gavrip Princip happened to see Archduke Franz Ferdinand's motorcade after other would-be assassins failed to kill him.\u000a\u000aThe museum has changed with the evolving perception of Princip, who over the years has been seen as both a nationalist wing nut and a socialist hero. Now the museum focuses on the 40 years Sarajevo was ruled by Austria-Hungary, with particular attention for the end.\u000a\u000aMuseum of Sarajevo 1878-1918 , +387 33 533 288, Zelenih beretki 1, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a6. Dive into the steampunk and skater scene\u000a\u000aToward the west end of town, skateboarders shoot around the ramps at Hastahana Park while families linger on the grassy areas. When the sun starts going down on nice days, it can be a cool scene of young and old mingling together, some hanging out drinking beers while others watch the world go by.\u000a\u000aA gigantic sculpture by German artist Helmut Lutz, which was installed in 2005 next to one of the ramps, dominates the park. It's a steampunk mix of steel horns, fabric bellows and fanciful busts that looks like a yacht-sized musical instrument from Dr. Seuss' Whoville.\u000a\u000aThe sculpture was funded by residents of one of Sarajevo's sister cities, the German town of Freiderichschafen. Each winter, the park also hosts a holiday market.\u000a\u000aThe neighborhood around the park exhibits the building boom during a massive expansion of the city during Austrian rule. Another Austrian contribution: the street car, which arrived in Sarajevo in 1885 as a test run for Vienna's public transit.\u000a\u000aHastahana Park , Mar\u0161ala Tita 12, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u000a\u000a7. Hike up to the abandoned Olympic bobsled track\u000a\u000aThe Olympic ruin is now a daredevils' playground.\u000a\u000aWhen the Olympics came to Sarajevo, the games were hailed as a Cold War success in semi-neutral territory (Yugoslavia was communist but not aligned with the Soviet Union).\u000a\u000aThe war in the 1990s damaged many of the sporting venues, including the bobsled and luge track on Trebevi\u0107 Mountain south of town. Despite some recent efforts to restore the track for training, it's basically abandoned and covered in graffiti.\u000a\u000aVideos abound on YouTube of people riding bikes or rollerblades down the track, but it also attracts non-daredevils who hike through thick pine forest on well-marked trails and climb onto the track at various spots along the way. The trailhead is a cheap, 10-minute taxi ride outside the city for a rare opportunity to see a bizarre Olympic ruin.\u000a\u000aThe Pino Nature Hotel, which opened near the top last year with a mid-century-meets-Aspen ski lodge feel, has a spa and a terrace with spectacular views of the mountain. It too, however, is a dry venue, but the restaurant is worth a visit for its hearty, updated Bosnian fare.\u000a\u000aPino Nature Hotel , Trebevi\u0107 - Ravne 1, 71000 Sarajevo, BiH +387 33 257 800\u000a\u000a8. Drink rakija on a night out\u000a\u000aThroughout the Balkans, rakija is a staple served at parties and weddings, with dinner at home, and at most bars as a boost of liquid courage. A clear brandy similar to grappa, it's distilled from various fruits, often plum, pear or apple but also from more exotic ingredients such as quince or walnuts. Just don't be fooled by the fruit flavors. This is potent stuff.\u000a\u000aBarhana in the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija serves many varieties as well as mezze, or small snacks, and tablets of cured meat and cheese similar to what you'd find at Spanish tapas bars. All that toasting and tasting leads to some late nights -- some bars in Sarajevo don't close until 6 a.m. -- and lots of new friends.\u000a\u000a"Sarajevo is the kind of place where you leave your place with five marks in your pocket, and somehow you come home at 6 a.m. with 10 marks and a full pack of cigarettes," says Cat Norman, who opened the Doctor's House Hostel about three years ago.

Get your kicks at an old porn theater\u000a\u000aA night at Kino Bosna is a singular experience, Norman says. Before the war, it was a movie theater showing Hollywood movies and eventually porn films, but the owner fled and never came back.\u000a\u000aOne of the employees decided to open it as a bar, bringing in wooden chairs and red-checkered tablecloths and leaving up the old film posters.\u000a\u000aThe owner has since become a Sarajevo legend. Because she's essentially squatting in her old boss' business, she can't register to pay taxes. "The bar will get closed down for a week here and there, but she always finds a way to reopen it," Norman says. "It's what the party people want when you come to the Balkans."\u000a\u000aMonday night is the best of the week, she says.

Glimpse at horrors or war from siege to Srebrenica\u000a\u000aThe tunnel that was a link to the outside world when the city was cut off by Serbian troops.\u000a\u000aAlthough there's much more to Sarajevo than war, the city has embraced its tortured past. Serbian troops cut the city off from the outside world, and rooftop snipers fired at anyone walking on the streets.\u000a\u000aThe only lifeline for supplies was an 800-meter tunnel that connected the people with smugglers from outside the city. The War Tunnel Museum has preserved a section of it and tells the tale of the family that risked their lives by allowing the entrance to pop up in their cellar.\u000a\u000aAnother exhibition, the Srebrenica-Galerija 11/07/95, focuses on the worst genocide in Europe since the Holocaust. In one month near the end of the war, Serbian troops slaughtered more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in one town, mostly men but also women and children, and buried the bodies in mass graves.\u000a\u000aA photographer chronicled the lives of the survivors, who more than 20 years later still don't have all the answers about what happened to their family members.

Then when the wife dies, they go to an ascinica."\u000a\u000aAscinica means a cafeteria that serves cheap, hearty food, often stews, and everything is served with somun, a type of grilled flatbread similar to pita.

For the most authentic, locals recommend Zeljo or Petica.\u000a\u000aRoast lamb is also serious business, particularly at the fine-dining 4 Sobe Gospodje Safije, which translates to the 4 Rooms of Mrs. Safije.

aV(CNN) We're all used to seeing "concept cars" -- those bits of automotive frippery that manufacturers trot out at motor shows every few months. Generally, they're either design tinsel that will never see the light of day, or previews of cars that will soon appear in showrooms.\u000a\u000aAnd then there's the Mercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion.\u000a\u000aCatchy name aside, this odd-looking creation has had such a varied life that its maker refuses to call it a "concept." It's a research project instead, hence the name (the 'F' is a German prefix denoting 'research vehicle' status).\u000a\u000aDesigned for living\u000a\u000aThe Mercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion: Forerunner of a mobility revolution\u000a\u000aThe F 015 made its debut at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas more than two years ago. It's packed with advanced (or what was considered advanced in 2015) autonomous technology, and can, in theory, run for almost 900 kilometers on a mixture of pure electric power and a hydrogen fuel cell.\u000a\u000aBut while countless other vehicles are still trying to prove that cars can, literally, drive themselves, Merc's offering takes this for granted. Instead, this vehicle wants us to consider what we'll actually do while the car is driving us around.\u000a\u000aThe steering wheel slides into the dashboard to create more of a "lounge" space. The seating configuration allows four people to face each other if they want to talk. And when the onboard conversation dries up, a bewildering collection of screens -- one on the rear wall, and one on each of the doors -- offers plenty of opportunity to interact with various media.\u000a\u000aThe F 015 could have done all of this as a flash-in-the-pan show car -- seen at a couple of major events before vanishing without trace. But in fact it has been touring almost constantly since that Vegas debut.\u000a\u000aOn the day that I managed to get up close with the car at a Mercedes facility in the UK, engineer Thomas Jaeger admitted that the F 015 had probably racked up tens of thousands of air miles.\u000a\u000aNot bad for a car that is estimated to have been driven less than 500 kilometers under its own steam (or battery, at least) during the same period. More than a quarter of a million people have now managed to get up close and interact with the F 015 during its lifetime.\u000a\u000a"We have learned so much from this project," Jaeger said. "The most important thing is that people aren't afraid of autonomous vehicles. They see them as an opportunity -- and they are already interested to know what else they'll be able to do when they don't have to look at the road."\u000a\u000aThe key, Jaeger said, is communication. "Of course, people are keen to experience movies or games while they're on the move," he said.\u000a\u000a"But they also want to be productive, whether it's using this time to sort out things with their lives, or to catch up with friends -- either in the car or on social networking. Their feedback says that they're ready and excited by the extra time that autonomous cars can give them."\u000a\u000aA work in progress\u000a\u000aClimbing aboard the F 015, you see how it could work. The powered doors slowly open to reveal a huge aperture through which you enter the car, albeit with a significant duck of the head.\u000a\u000aThe futuristic seats aren't particularly comfortable, but with a decent set of padded Mercedes armchairs, this environment would be a pretty pleasant.\u000a\u000aMercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion in San Francisco 2015\u000a\u000aOn the move, the F 015 creaks and shudders, as all one-off vehicles do. And it feels heavy. But that's because it is -- carbon fiber body panels notwithstanding, the amount of bespoke engineering and technology on board makes the car heavier than many large SUVs.\u000a\u000aWhen the vehicle is at rest, the only noise it produces is the constant whoosh of computer fans under the hood. There are a total of 14 processing devices on board, but only four are involved in making the car autonomous. The rest -- 10 MacBook Pros, as it turns out -- are dedicated to operating the user interface and throwing graphics around on the screens.\u000a\u000aParts of this car have dated in the two-and-a-half years since its debut. The 32in touchscreens in the doors, for example, are relatively poor-contrast LCD displays, not hi-tech, ultra-crisp OLED. And the rear-projection instrument panel that wraps around the dashboard isn't particularly clear, especially in sunlight.\u000a\u000a"When we made the car, the idea of a single curved display was just impossible," Jaeger said. "Nowadays we know we could go to one or two suppliers and have it made."\u000a\u000aNonetheless, Jaeger said that the engineering team hasn't tinkered with the vehicle, preferring to compile a (lengthy) list of ideas of what to do next. He also admitted that work has just started on the next "research project."\u000a\u000aWhatever form it takes, it will be pushed forward by the technical know-how of gifted engineers and designers. But now, thanks to the F 015, feedback from the general public will play its part too.

That's only the beginning.\u000a\u000aAnd yet people hate her. Her negative ratings, in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party.

So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal.

We cherry-pick the past, highlighting what we like and leaving out the things we don't, even if they were closely intertwined.\u000a\u000aSo when Trump says let's "make America great again" and Clinton says let's make it 'whole again,' they neglect to mention how much the prosperity of the postwar era depended on a system of regulation and taxation that neither of them shows any inclination to reinstate."\u000a\u000aRead more here\u000a\u000aStephanie Coontz teaches history at the Evergreen State College and wrote the newly revised "The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap."\u000a\u000aMel Robbins: Show rape victim's letter to your sons\u000a\u000aMel Robbins\u000a\u000aJune 7\u000a\u000a"We women know all too well about victim blaming, alcohol as an excuse for assault.

The long-term aftermath of Pearl Harbor was not only a decisive Allied victory in the war but also decades of American leadership and dominance.\u000a\u000aAfter its initial success in Afghanistan following 9/11, victory was not decisive for the United States.

Authorities found Cornell-Duranleau's body with multiple stab wounds in Lathem's Chicago apartment.\u000a\u000aLathem's attorney, Kenneth Wine, said his client was charged for "murder and fleeing" in Illinois, but he has not been formally arraigned on those charges.\u000a\u000aWine said in a statement Monday that the alleged crime is "totally contrary to the way (Lathem) has lived his entire life" and urged the ex-professor's supporters to "be patient."\u000a\u000aLathem waived his extradition rights in Alameda County Superior Court on Monday, and a judge determined that Lathem must be removed from California by September 6. Lathem invoked his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, and law enforcement officials will not be allowed to ask him any questions without an attorney present.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Orania is often described as a relic of apartheid.\u000a\u000aThe rural town in South Africa's Northern Cape province was established in 1991, shortly before the collapse of the apartheid regime, and it has been exclusively inhabited by white Afrikaners ever since.\u000a\u000aSpokesmen say there is no racial discrimination in Orania, but the foundational imperative to preserve Afrikaner culture effectively prohibits racial diversity.\u000a\u000aIn one respect, however, the controversial community is forward-looking. Orania is about to launch its own digital currency.\u000a\u000aOra tradition\u000a\u000aThe town of around 1,300 people already uses a local currency, the ora, which is printed by Orania's own chamber of commerce and distributed through its central bank.\u000a\u000aOra notes are technically vouchers, pegged to the South African rand, which expire after three years.\u000a\u000aThe digital version will be accessible via an app that allows users to buy "e-ora" from the central bank, and then trade them with each other and local businesses on smartphones. The digital ora will have no expiry date.\u000a\u000aThe initiative is intended to further the town's independence -- some Oranians even aspire to an independent Afrikaner state -- as well as to allow more efficient transactions. "E-ora" would save Orania the cost of printing its paper currency, and trading digital currencies between smartphones can avoid the fees that apply to certain credit card transactions.\u000a\u000a"It is basically electronic cash that will be moved from wallet to wallet with every transaction without the commercial banks standing in the middle," says Peter Krige, Orania's co-ordinator of the scheme. "In this way friction and cost is removed from the transaction. Both consumers and retailers will save between three and five per cent per transaction."\u000a\u000aPrototypes have already been successfully tested, he says, and the new currency could be in circulation within a year.\u000a\u000aProof of concept\u000a\u000aThe Afrikaner town is partnering with prize-winning economist Dawie Roodt to create the currency. Roodt is aware that working with Orania is controversial, but says the opportunity was too exciting to turn down.\u000a\u000a"I'm going out of my way to explain that my interest is purely academic," says Roodt. "Where else is there an opportunity for an economist to do an experiment like this? This is like a petri dish...I want to see what environment is created by digital currency."\u000a\u000aRoodt has studied digital currencies extensively and has great faith in their disruptive power. He expects the "e-ora" to allow cheaper transactions, giving rise to wider economic benefits and reduced reliance on traditional banks. He believes it could eventually be decoupled from the rand to become a full currency.\u000a\u000aIf the Orania initiative is successful, the economist hopes to introduce digital currencies into other communities. He says that South Africa offers the perfect breeding ground.\u000a\u000a"The economy is contracting and the state is highly inefficient," says Roodt. "We have more private security guards than policemen in South Africa -- you have to look after yourself because the state won't do it.\u000a\u000a"The conditions here are a driving force for these developments (with digital currency), people are looking for alternatives. This is one of the best places to experiment."\u000a\u000aDigital currencies such as Bitcoin have grown rapidly in recent years. The overall digital currency market is now estimated to be worth around $100 billion.\u000a\u000aMaking waves\u000a\u000aThe experiment could also have an influence beyond South Africa.\u000a\u000aDigital currency experts suggest "e-ora" could potentially reach the point of being traded on digital currency exchanges, and even inspire sympathetic communities around the world to develop their own currencies. Orania has a strong following among white nationalist groups.\u000a\u000a"In this case, the only viable long-term strategy derived from going digital with the currency is to eventually get onto digital token exchanges which might increase the value of the currency over time and could be used to fund 'me too' operations globally," says Rik Willard, managing director of the Agentic Group, a consultancy on digital currency.\u000a\u000a"The obvious goal would be to engage same-minded people globally in supporting the currency by buying, trading and using it."\u000a\u000aPeter Krige is hopeful that "e-ora" will eventually be traded on global exchanges.\u000a\u000aBut a higher profile could come at a cost.\u000a\u000a"I'd be worried about hacking resistance and traceability," says Corin Faife, a journalist who specializes in digital currencies. "The nature of the project is likely to bring them under fire from anti-racist groups."\u000a\u000aThe currency might also attract the attention of law enforcement if it is interpreted as part of a white supremacist movement, Faife adds.\u000a\u000aSuch risks might deter a less bloody-minded community. But the Oranians are used to swimming against the tide.

aVTonight at 9 p.m., "Piers Morgan Tonight" welcomes one of the most-decorated Olympic athletes in history, 16-time medal winner Michael Phelps.\u000a\u000aJoining Piers Morgan tonight, the 27-year-old swimming legend is asked to extend his thinking outside of the pool, as the host dives in with a deeper, and broader question:\u000a\u000a"Who are your sporting idols?" Morgan asks.\u000a\u000a"Michael Jordan," responds Phelps. "He changed the sport of basketball in my eyes. On and off the court, the guy made basketball what it is. And, you know, what he did."\u000a\u000aWhat the basketball Hall of Famer did, was rewrite the history of his craft, much in the same way Phelps is doing with his. A six-time NBA champion, and two-time Olympic gold medalist, Jordan's overall talent was rivaled only by his overwhelming will to win, a trait not lost on the equally-competive Phelps:\u000a\u000a"I think one of the coolest things that I loved about him was it didn't matter what he had going on off the court or if he was sick or this, that. He never used an excuse," explains the man who has twice tied the record with eight medals of any type at a single Olympics. "He came out every single night on the court and did what he had to do to get his job done. That's what champions do. It doesn't matter what else is going on when you walk in to your arena, whatever you excel at, you\u2019re there to take care of the job that you have to do."

aVHawaii agriculture officials say a small live bat was found Tuesday morning on a container ship that arrived in Honolulu Harbor from San Diego.\u000a\u000aThe Pasha Hawaii crew was able to capture the bat and called state officials.

aV(CNN) In the nutritional world, conventional wisdom suggests that the more often you eat, the more likely you are to burn off those calories and control hunger pangs. And so the notion of eating six or more "mini-meals" each day, just enough to fuel your body and tide you over until your next bites, has often been recommended as a more waistline-friendly dieting approach than eating three larger meals. But science evolves, and the answer to whether you should eat many mini-meals or three bigger meals is no longer a straightforward one.\u000a\u000a"Years ago, we all believed that you needed to eat multiple times a day to keep your metabolism stoked. ... You had to keep feeding the fire and keep the furnace burning. But that theory goes back and forth, and newer research is showing that it really doesn't slow metabolism if you're not eating multiple times a day," said Martha McKittrick, a registered dietitian in New York City who has provided weight-loss counseling for over 20 years.\u000a\u000aSmall frequent meals vs. fewer big meals\u000a\u000aBut while eating small frequent meals can discourage large swings in blood sugar, decrease hunger and prevent impulsive snacking throughout the day, other studies suggest that eating more often may not be optimal.\u000a\u000aAnd despite the notion that eating more often means more opportunities to burn calories, thanks to the energy involved in digesting, absorbing and metabolizing food's nutrients, research suggests that doing so does not appear to significantly enhance metabolism or total calories burned.\u000a\u000a"In the '80s, grazing was thought to be an optimal way of losing weight ... but human studies did not support this at all," said David Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has researched the topic of meal frequency and its effects on calorie intake. "It was thought that if you ate more frequently, the amount of calories you retain would go down, and more calories would be burned. But controlled experiments in humans show that there is no metabolic advantage to eating 12 smaller meals versus eating three or four meals per day, with the same total number of calories."\u000a\u000aOther experts agree. "Meal frequency does not affect metabolic rate and thus has no direct effect on weight loss," said Carla Wolper, a registered dietitian and nutrition consultant at the ColumbiaDoctors Executive Health assessment program who spent 25 years on the nutrition faculty at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center.\u000a\u000aIn fact, some research suggests that eating even fewer than three meals may be best in terms of controlling calories: In one study , when individuals skipped breakfast, they consumed about 400 fewer calories for the entire day compared to when they ate breakfast.\u000a\u000a"If you decrease the number of occasions to eat, your total calorie intake goes down," said Levitsky, who authored the study. "People think if you skip breakfast, you will overeat later ... and that doesn't happen. Your intake goes up, but not nearly as much as the amount that you skipped."\u000a\u000aAn eating pattern for every body\u000a\u000aSo should you give up on a diet plan of six or more mini-meals, spaced a few hours apart? Not necessarily. The optimal timing of eating may depend on various factors unique to each individual.\u000a\u000a"Some folks are grazers by nature, so six small meals might be more in line with their natural inclinations. Other folks eat by the clock, at 7 a.m., 12 p.m. and 6 p.m., for example. The real issue regarding temptation at mealtime is planning. If people have a great food plan, they will probably do well," Wolper said.\u000a\u000aMcKittrick agrees. "Some are grazers; some are meal-eaters. ... It's fine if they graze, but make sure calories are controlled so it's not an ongoing graze-fest."\u000a\u000aThe case for small, frequent meals\u000a\u000aWhile some may enjoy sitting down to three meals each day, others may find that it's just too much food at once.\u000a\u000a"Some people don't have huge appetites. ... If they have a 600-calorie sandwich, they may have half at noon and eat the other half at 3 p.m.," McKittrick said. "Eating large meals may also make them tired ... so they're better off with small frequent feedings because it promotes more stable blood sugar and they get more energized."\u000a\u000aOne's daily routine may not allow for the opportunity to take a big lunch break -- and so a grazing style of eating is a better fit.\u000a\u000aFor a new mom, eating three meals a day can be particularly challenging. "Lots of mothers spend so much time with their kids that they can't sit down and have a full lunch ... so eating more frequently better suits their lifestyle," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aHealth issues may also dictate which style of eating is best. For example, people who have diabetes or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can feel shaky, tired and weak if they go too long without eating, so six small meals may be best. Those who have other health conditions including gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome and acid reflux may feel better by eating small meals spaced three or four hours apart. The same may be true for seniors.\u000a\u000a"A lot of seniors can only have a piece of toast and an egg, and then they get full. As you get older, you just don't have as much of an appetite, and you feel full more quickly," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aThe case for three bigger meals\u000a\u000aExperts say that eating more frequently may be problematic for those who have trouble with portion control or something known as stimulus-bound eating, when the sight of a specific food prompts you to eat it, which can lead to weight gain.\u000a\u000a"The bulk of the evidence suggests that humans are opportunistic eaters ... and if we are given more chances to eat, the more we will eat," Levitsky said. "If people did nothing other than eliminate snacks, their total calorie intake will go down."\u000a\u000aA 500-calorie smoothie, for example, will defeat the strategy's purpose. "If you want to eat small frequent meals, take a look at your calories and really divide them up. If you're on 1,500-calorie diet, are you really having five 300-calorie mini-meals?" McKittrick asked.\u000a\u000aAn "all or nothing person" may be better off with three meals per day if a small snack quickly turns into a bigger one, as in the case of nuts. "Nuts are super healthy, but some people can't stop once they start eating nuts, and that can be a problem," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aThe environment plays a role, too. If your office has a kitchen full of free snacks, it's a lot easier to go in and grab something like chips or cookies instead of planning your own healthy meals and bringing them in. Working from home, with constant access to the kitchen, can present similar challenges.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAnd then there are others who just don't want to be bothered with making eating an all-day affair. "Some just want to eat and get it done with, so they don't do well with small snacks. ... They're really busy, and they just don't have the time to deal with it, and so those people may be better off with three meals per day."\u000a\u000aThe bottom line is that either style of eating can offer health and weight-loss benefits. But what matters most is what will work for you.\u000a\u000a"Maybe, down the line, we'll be able to test people to determine which eating frequency is optimal, but in the meantime, it's probably best to go by how you feel," McKittrick said.

For a short while, he sat alone, looking intently ahead of him, a striking contrast to the continuous fanfare he had received from colleagues since returning to Washington after his brain cancer diagnosis and surgery.\u000a\u000aSomething was off for GOP leaders. McConnell and his top deputies, including Sen. John Cornyn and Roy Blunt, were gathered with heads bowed, talking quietly.\u000a\u000aThen, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska approached McCain. Murkowski was one of two senators who had voted "no" earlier in the week on a procedural vote and was speculated as a possible "no" vote again on Friday. As McCain spoke to his colleague, he was so animated -- pumping his fists and speaking slowly for emphasis -- that it was possible to read his lips.\u000a\u000a"I promise," he seemed to say to Murkowski. Moments later, he gestured with his index finger several times. "One senator," he appeared to say, with space between the two words.\u000a\u000aThere was soon another conspicuous sign: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one senator widely expected to vote "no" on Friday, walked up to McCain. When she did, the group broke into laughter. Collins got comfortable, setting down her bright pink bag.\u000a\u000aBy this point, Vice President Mike Pence had arrived. If 50 senators voted yes, he would need to be the final, tie-breaking vote.\u000a\u000aMcCain and Pence spoke for a long stretch, with the vice president standing and the senator still sitting. Once again, McCain was spirited and energetic.\u000a\u000a"I promise you," were the words that the senator appeared to say to Pence at one point.\u000a\u000aBy 1 a.m. ET, it was more than clear that the problem was serious. What was supposed to be a relatively quick procedural vote had dragged out for almost an hour, stuck in limbo as GOP leaders were huddled in hushed conversations. Many eyed McCain from around the room.\u000a\u000aSuddenly, the senator was on the move. He stood up from his desk, hugging and kissing Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, before walking over to the other side of the room where the Democrats sit.\u000a\u000aSurrounded by colleagues from the other party including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, McCain abruptly flexed his armed inward like a gorilla. It was with such force and playfulness that reporters watching from above collectively laughed, prompting some of the senators to look up. Schumer smiled at the press.\u000a\u000aSen. Chris Coons, one of the senators in that huddle, said this was the moment that McCain informed them of his decision. "He stood with a group of us and said, I am a 'no,'" Coons told CNN afterwards. "I was trying not to jump up and down and smile."\u000a\u000aIt was also during this conversation that McCain urged his Democratic colleagues to take up the defense bill as quickly as possible after health care was behind them. McCain has hinted that he would likely be returning to Arizona for cancer treatment next week, and he hoped to have a vote on the defense bill on Friday.\u000a\u000aShortly before the roll call began to be called, McCain briefly stepped out of the Senate chamber.\u000a\u000aReporters would later learn that McCain spoke on the phone with President Donald Trump off of the Senate floor. The President tried -- with no success -- to change McCain's mind.

aVMonzer Akbik is a Syrian activist advocating for democracy and human rights. He is a former member of the Syrian Opposition Coalition, a former spokesman in Geneva peace talks and is currently spokesman for Syria's Tomorrow Movement, or Tayyar Al Ghad. He trained as an engineer in Damascus and now works in the construction industry in the Persian Gulf. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It seems that the defeat of ISIS in the Syrian city of Raqqa is now inevitable.\u000a\u000aArab, Kurdish and Syrian Christian forces -- trained and supported by a US-led coalition -- are making steady progress on the ground, liberating large swaths of Syria from terrorists.\u000a\u000aA key component of the fight in Raqqa has been the American special forces and the Sunni Arab rebel fighters affiliated with the Syrian Elite Forces, who have received both training and arms from the United States.\u000a\u000aThe fight to liberate the city has brought Arabs, Kurds and Syrian Christians together under a common cause.\u000a\u000aUS-led coalition fighters are now deep inside Raqqa, a city that ISIS declared as the capital of its so-called caliphate more than three years ago.\u000a\u000aOnce the liberation is complete, the forces will then move toward the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor. ISIS leadership has long since relocated from Raqqa and moved deeper into the mid and lower Euphrates River Valley. The coming fight against ISIS in that part of Syria will be more complicated than Raqqa.\u000a\u000aWhile previous phases of the war in Syria suggest that the liberating forces will defeat ISIS, this is only a small part of the challenge awaiting the coalition. Some time ago, Bashar al-Assad's forces -- supported by Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah proxy militias on the ground, and Russian air force on the air -- realized that ISIS was in retreat, so they moved quickly to grab as much territory as they could: in the north to west of Raqqa; in the middle of the country moving east of Palmyra, toward Al Sukhna -- a crossroads town considered a gateway to Deir Ezzor; and in the south along the Jordanian and Iraqi borders in Tanf, blocking the path to Deir Ezzor. It's obvious that Assad and his allies are eyeing Deir Ezzor.\u000a\u000aAssad's movement did not go unnoticed by the United States: There were at least four incidents in which coalition planes bombed regime armor convoys that were approaching US allies. Only last month, a US warplane shot down a Syrian jet.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN obtains undercover video from Raqqa Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN obtains undercover video from Raqqa 02:49\u000a\u000aDespite this resistance, Assad's forces are still finding alternative routes and ways to bypass coalition positions, benefiting from the rules of engagement by which the coalition abides: Fire on regime forces for self-defense only.\u000a\u000aWhat does all this mean? If Assad and his allies reach Deir Ezzor and the strategic border town of Abu Kamal before the coalition forces advancing from north, then it's game over for the coalition. The coalition forces will have to stop wherever they are and allow Assad and the Iranians to take the Abu Kamal border crossing with Iraq.\u000a\u000aFor a reminder as to why the Assad regime and Iran controlling the Iraqi border will not offer a lasting security solution to the problem of extremism, we only have to look back from the 2005-2010 era, when thousands of foreign fighters and al Qaeda in Iraq recruits flowed across from Abu Kamal into Iraq at the discretion and watchful eye of Assad's security services.\u000a\u000aAssad and Iranian occupation will also come as very bad news to the people of Deir Ezzor. They have been fighting against Assad's forces since 2011. After liberating their province from the regime, it fell to ISIS.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Exclusive: on the front lines inside the old city of Raqqa Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Exclusive: on the front lines inside the old city of Raqqa 03:06\u000a\u000aFor many, it would be unpalatable for the city to end up back under Assad's tyranny -- especially in the absence of a political settlement that would put the country on the path of genuine democratic transition.\u000a\u000aIt would also be a setback to President Donald Trump, who has spoken of his ambition to cut Iran's claws in the region. A second uprising may lead to renewed war, from which some terrorist group other than ISIS could benefit.\u000a\u000aWe still don't know who is going to win the race to Deir Ezzor. However, it might end with a deal between Moscow and Washington in light of the recent agreement over a ceasefire in the southwest, and the latter's decision to end a covert CIA program supporting moderate rebels opposing the Russian-backed Assad regime.\u000a\u000aStill, people in Raqqa are optimistic. They know they are going back to their cities and villages and that the Assad regime is not going to be there. Make no mistake, it's going to be very difficult to normalize life in Raqqa after the level of destruction the city has suffered. But it is possible, so long as the area is protected from bombing and supported by the international community.\u000a\u000aThe people of Raqqa are hoping for a gradual move to relative prosperity and creating a model for the rest of Syria to look up to.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, in order for this to succeed, international forces need to stick around for some time post-ISIS. If they don't, hell's doors will open: Turks could attack from the north, the Assad regime from the west and Iraqi Shia extremist militias from east.\u000a\u000aThis means the US-led coalition needs to have a strategy that goes beyond just defeating ISIS and forming governance councils. The coalition must create a proper plan for the parts of Syria it liberates from ISIS, complete with a plan to protect the people living there while rebuilding the areas destroyed.\u000a\u000aWith multiple warring factions in Syria, the scene is complicated. In some areas, ceasefire agreements have been reached. Some kind of partitioning of the country into areas of influence seems now a sensible option as discussions about the post-ISIS future of the country begin.\u000a\u000aSuch a vision requires a political agreement between these warring factions of Syrians as well as the international and regional players -- especially the United States and Russia.\u000a\u000aThe agreement for Syria's final status must include guarantees on constitutional principles, the system of governance in the transitional period and detailed plans for the safe return of refugees.\u000a\u000aOnly a plan such as this can guarantee peace and prevent the ultimate return of terrorism.

aVAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) The four Arab countries leading an embargo against Qatar are ready to talk but not to back down from their demands, the quartet's foreign ministers said in a joint press conference Sunday in Manama, Bahrain.\u000a\u000a"Dialogue doesn't mean there are concessions," Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have been enforcing an economic and diplomatic boycott of Qatar since June 5, saying the Gulf country supports terrorism.\u000a\u000aThe quartet issued 13 demands that included shutting down Qatar's al Jazeera TV network and severing ties with Iran.\u000a\u000aQatar denies the charges and calls the demands a breach of its sovereignty.\u000a\u000aEmergency air corridors\u000a\u000aAs part of their restrictions, the quartet countries severed transport links to Qatar, closing their airspace to Qatari-owned or registered flights. The airspace closures cost Qatar Airlines about 50 flights a day, according to CNNMoney\u000a\u000aThe state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said Sunday that Qatar Airways can now use nine designated air corridors for emergencies under an agreement with the countries' aviation authorities.\u000a\u000aOne of the nine aviation corridors will be over the Mediterranean Sea and will be managed by Egypt's National Air Navigation Services Company, according to the SPA.\u000a\u000aThe Saudi aviation authority said in a statement that "this procedure affirms our commitment to safety of the International air navigation. And as it is customary in such circumstances to agree on alternative air corridors for emergencies overseas under our supervision to ease navigation and support air safety."\u000a\u000a@MOTC_QA, @CAAQATAR deny what reported by Saudi agency that the blockading countries have dedicated emergency air routes for Qatari aircraft pic.twitter.com/GOYoDluGnT \u2014 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a (@MOTC_QA) July 30, 2017\u000a\u000aHowever, Qatar's Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation Authority denied that the four countries had dedicated emergency air routes for Qatari aircraft.\u000a\u000a"The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Civil Aviation Authority confirm that those countries have issued no navigation announcements as followed at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and call upon the blockade countries to not leak such incorrect news before the ICAO Coincil's extraordinary session, scheduled for tomorrow Monday in Montreal, Canada," the ministry said in a statement.\u000a\u000a'Real intention'\u000a\u000aThe quartet Sunday said negotiations are possible if Qatar shows "real intention" to stop supporting terrorism and interfering in neighboring countries.\u000a\u000aBahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al-Khalifa, said none of the demands were dropped.\u000a\u000a"It has to be black or white," Al-Jubeir said, saying Qatar either funds terrorism or it doesn't.\u000a\u000aThe four countries also rejected charges about Saudi Arabia's handling of Qatari travel for Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. It is scheduled to start August 30 this year.\u000a\u000aQatar alleges travel restrictions\u000a\u000aQatar's National Human Rights Committee said Saturday that Saudi Arabia is restricting Qatari access into the country for the rituals of Hajj and Umrah.\u000a\u000aForeign Minister of Qatar Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani\u000a\u000aQataris may enter Saudi Arabia through only two airports; and those living outside of Qatar must first return to Doha before entering Saudi territory, the committee said.\u000a\u000aThe Qatari committee also said similar "violations" occurred during Umrah in the month of Ramadan.\u000a\u000aIn defending Saudi Arabia, the quartet called the criticism "unacceptable." The joint statement said Qatar was obstructing its own citizens from attending the pilgrimage.\u000a\u000a"We reject what Qatar is doing in politicizing (the pilgrimage)," Al-Jubeir said.

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.\u000a\u000aNanjing, China (CNN) \u2014 Nanjing has always been a destination for history buffs.\u000a\u000aFrom the magnificent medieval battlements of the city's ancient wall to the impressive final resting place of modern China's founding father Sun Yat-sen, Nanjing is packed with some of the country's most famous landmarks.\u000a\u000aBut the old capital's magic isn't only found at grand monuments, mausoleums and temples.\u000a\u000aHere's our guide to exploring the hidden corners that really make this city of eight million a place worth lingering.\u000a\u000aThe station time forgot\u000a\u000aThe abandoned station is popular place to dress up in 1930s clothing and take wedding photos.\u000a\u000aAt first glance, with its peeling paint and shuttered windows, Pukou Railway Station, on the north side of the river that divides Nanjing, is an unlikely tourist destination.\u000a\u000aBuilt in the early 1900s in European style, it was a major transport hub until a rail and road bridge was built across the Yangtze River in 1968.\u000a\u000aToday it lies largely abandoned in a ramshackle suburban neighborhood but the building, which must have been striking in its heyday, attracts a small but steady stream of visitors keen to capture a slice of a bygone era.\u000a\u000aIt's been used as a location in several Chinese movies set in the Republican era (1912-1949) -- and it's a popular place for local couples to take wedding shots dressed up in 1930s-style clothing.\u000a\u000aA walk along the eerily empty platforms, lined with elegant columns, takes you past a water fountain and discarded empty carriages that are no longer used on China's high-speed modern rail network.\u000a\u000aFor college student Summer Wang, 20, visiting from Hubei province more than 300 miles away, the station's appeal lies in its literary links.\u000a\u000aIt was the setting for "My Father's Back," a touching 1925 essay about a father's love for his son by poet Zhu Ziqing -- a classic of modern Chinese literature.\u000a\u000aThere are plans to redevelop the station as a shopping arcade but Wang thinks this would spoil its unique atmosphere.\u000a\u000a"There's a real sense of history here. You feel like you're going back in time," she says.\u000a\u000aA hotel built with 600-year-old bricks\u000a\u000aThe Yangtze Hotel is built with bricks from the city's 600-year-old wall.\u000a\u000aNanjing's 33-kilometer Ming Dynasty (from the mid-1300s to mid-1600s) wall and its 13 fortified gates are arguably the city's main attraction -- it's listed as a monument of national importance.\u000a\u000aBut China's "other Great Wall" wasn't always as well protected and once held more of the city in its grasp.\u000a\u000aThe 600-year-old bricks -- instantly recognizable by their blue-black color, large size and unusual inscriptions -- make cameo appearances in many of the city's older buildings.\u000a\u000aIn the chaos before and after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, the wall was plundered as a high-quality and easily accessible building material.\u000a\u000aLook out for the bricks on the campus of South East University in the city.\u000a\u000aThe embossed calligraphy tracked where the bricks were made. If they weren't up to standard the emperor could order the brickmaker's execution.\u000a\u000aRemarkably, the Yangtze Villa Hotel on Zhongshan North Road near the city's old port was built using only Ming Dynasty stone slabs, which are 40 to 50 centimeters long and 20 centimeters wide.\u000a\u000aAn unusual example of rural European architecture in China, the three-story structure was built between 1912 and 1914 by a French man who traded with the Nanjing government in 1914 for a massive consignment of the Ming Dynasty bricks.\u000a\u000aLocal architect Zhou Qi has worked to preserve the former guesthouse, which from the 1950s until 2012 contained municipal offices.\u000a\u000aThe renovation is almost complete and next year will open to paying guests once more.\u000a\u000a1865 Creative District\u000a\u000aDirecting Nanjing's trends since 2013.\u000a\u000aEvery major city needs an "it" neighborhood where young creative types cluster and set trends.\u000a\u000aIn Nanjing, authorities hope it'll be the 1865 Creative Park -- where turn-of-the-century machinery factories and a decommissioned military arsenal have been turned into an art zone and business hub.\u000a\u000aIt's similar in feel to the 798 Art Zone in Beijing , which now has world-class galleries, loft-style apartments and trendy book stores, but it's not quite as happening -- the park opened in 2013, so it's still early days.\u000a\u000aOn a typical weekday morning, the galleries, curio shops, bars and cafes are largely empty -- unless there's a film crew using the historical backdrop for a shoot.\u000a\u000aThe renovated buildings have kept much of their industrial character, with double-height windows, brick walls and exposed metal beams -- at least one with a five-ton winch still attached.

aVStory highlights Dean Obeidallah: Trump has transformed his White House into a bad reality show\u000a\u000aThis political drama would be entertaining if the stakes weren't so high\u000a\u000aDean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program "The Dean Obeidallah Show" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @deanofcomedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) President Donald Trump has finally done it. He has turned his administration into a B-level reality show. A cross between "Celebrity Apprentice" and "Jersey Shore," the characters in this White House drama even have theatrical nicknames like "Mad Dog," or Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and "The Mooch," referencing Anthony Scaramucci, the newest director of communications.\u000a\u000aAnd while it may be fun to watch, it's a travesty for our nation. We deserve a president who is thoughtful, informed and focused on working for all Americans. Instead we have Trump, who seems preoccupied with creating a televised spectacle.\u000a\u000aTrump stunningly appears to be intentionally managing the White House like he did his long running reality show "The Apprentice." But don't take my word for it. Just listen to how Leeza Gibbons, of "Entertainment Tonight" fame and winner of "Celebrity Apprentice" in 2015, detailed Trump's way of running his reality show while she was a contestant.\u000a\u000aGibbons told me in February that Trump is "very good at pitting people against each other" adding, "because that made for great reality television." Gibbons described how Trump would create drama on "Celebrity Apprentice": He would "walk in the room, pull a pin out of a hand grenade and walk out and let everyone just kind of fight it out."\u000a\u000aShe added that Trump "notices vulnerabilities with people and will go for that." Why? Well according to Gibbons, "because that can equate to opportunity." But more on that later.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Beef jerky, bottled water, and Fireball whiskey. This is where my journey began, at the grocery store, buying "survival" items on Thanksgiving Day.\u000a\u000aI was meant to join a gaggle of screaming children at the kids' table. But Gatsby, my ex-race-horse-turned-ungrateful-teenager, had just spiked a 105-degree fever. I was in for a long night.\u000a\u000aI hurried back to the barn, parked, locked my car, and started heading in. But something stopped me in my tracks: a familiar, gravitational pull which begins as a small thought in the back of my mind, and pushes its way front and center within a matter of seconds. The sum of all its parts become greater than logic, evidence and truth.\u000a\u000aI walked backed to my car and started the ritual. Tap each window five times. Stop. Go back, and do it again. Check the door locks. Pull each handle up five times. Stop.\u000a\u000aMove to the trunk. Open. Close. Check the lock five times.\u000a\u000aThe last trick is to move away from the car without having any "bad" thoughts. I had to keep only "good" thoughts in my mind, because if I didn't do it correctly, a catastrophic event would occur. A friend would suffer a heart attack. My neighbor's dog would get hit by a car. The tree above my bedroom window would come crashing down. But the good news is, I could prevent it all from happening, if I "secure" my car a certain way.\u000a\u000aAm I nuts, you ask? Perhaps. But this is just another day, living with obsessive compulsive disorder, known as OCD.\u000a\u000aHere's a shocker. I missed a tap that night, and absolutely nothing happened.\u000a\u000aHome is where the horse is\u000a\u000aGatsby was my dream horse.\u000a\u000aCorrection: Gatsby was my idea of a dream horse.\u000a\u000aGrowing up, my horses were teachers, baby-sitters, co-conspirators and confidants. There were haughty and naughty ponies, and mares who ran through sprinklers with me in the summer.\u000a\u000aA typical afternoon growing up in the 1990s, with sweet Honey Bear and Sandy, the golden retriever.\u000a\u000aBut a beautiful thoroughbred with natural athleticism and a born-to-be-bad attitude -- now that was my type of horse.\u000a\u000aBut then, life happened. I moved away to college, joined the workforce and started navigating life in Los Angeles, where the pace is always set at a medium-high.\u000a\u000aFor years, horses weren't within the realm of possibility.\u000a\u000aBut in 2012, I got back in the saddle, and eased back into life at a barn. I befriended a young mare, who was rescued on her way to slaughter outside the United States. She only knew how to do two things: speed-walk, and gallop with her hair on fire.\u000a\u000aMisty quickly became my partner -- we spent our days trail riding, sharing watermelon and developing our own language where words aren't necessary.\u000a\u000aPeople often ask me why I love horses. This is why.\u000a\u000aMisty was nervous and shy, but what I saw in her was the most soulful being I'd ever encountered. She still is.\u000a\u000aBut the dream horse -- a tall glass of water with a confident spirit -- that dream lived on.\u000a\u000aUnder lock and key\u000a\u000aMy earliest memories of OCD date back to when I was 7 or 8 years old. I lay in bed at night, my mind whirling with thoughts about whether the doors and windows were locked. Mind you, we lived in a safe, rural neighborhood in Encinitas, California, during the glorious 1980s. As kids, we'd ride bikes to the beach after breakfast, eat ice cream for lunch, and return around sunset.\u000a\u000aBut when the lights went out, the negative images played on repeat. A home invasion robbery. Broken glass. Gunmen wearing ski masks. Serial killers would finish us off, and terrorize our neighbors. They'd hit up the next street, and the next. The entire town would be wiped out. Gone. My mind would spin and spin. It was annoying as it sounds.\u000a\u000aThe only way to settle my thoughts was to give in to the obsession. This manifested itself in a bizarre lock-checking ritual after my parents were asleep.\u000a\u000aI started upstairs, checking six windows and a sliding door.\u000a\u000aPush the locks repeatedly. Stare at it. Still locked? Yup. Repeat. Don't touch it. What if the lock unlocked itself? (There's a riddle for you). Check again. Then tiptoe through the rest of the house. If an intruder dared to climb through our tiny window that a cat could barely fit into, they wouldn't be able to get in anyway. Because it was locked!\u000a\u000aTwenty-one locks, multiplied by two minutes each. It was time-consuming to say the least. And to say the most, OCD robbed me of many peaceful nights in my childhood.\u000a\u000aBorn to be wild\u000a\u000aOne afternoon in 2014, I was at the bottom of the Rattlesnake trail in Griffith Park, deep in negotiations with a horse named Dunbeath. He was for sale, and I was trying him out for fun. And because he was handsome.\u000a\u000aDid I need two horses ? No.\u000a\u000aDid I need a "beautiful thoroughbred with natural athleticism, and a born-to-be-bad attitude?" Yes.\u000a\u000aI was on the fence. He was feisty, arrogant and a troublemaker -- I knew he'd make me work for his heart and mind.\u000a\u000aSo I made him a deal. I told Dunbeath we'd race up Rattlesnake to the highest ridge -- we'd be reckless, stupid and take blind turns with no abandon. If I was still on him when we reached the top, and not in a ditch somewhere, I would keep him.\u000a\u000aWell ... guess who stayed on?\u000a\u000aI changed Dunbeath's name to Gatsby's Mint Julep. But let's be real, I call him G.\u000a\u000aHe's not a mean-spirited punk, but he pushes my buttons and drives me to the brink of insanity. Over the years, he's amassed a comedic repertoire, which includes:\u000a\u000aScreaming and jumping in the air, upon encountering a small pig walking on the street.\u000a\u000aCrafting a Houdini-style escape from an arena, and trampling someone's rose garden.\u000a\u000aKicking me with his giant horseshoes ... because he didn't want to take a bath.\u000a\u000aDismantling his entire Mad Hatter Halloween costume (long story) in less than two minutes (short story).\u000a\u000aHis penchant for mischief and mayhem is unrivaled. But, he gets credit for never reaching a level of naughtiness I wouldn't be able to handle.\u000a\u000aBecause I know he's tempted.\u000a\u000aHiding in plain sight\u000a\u000aOutside the barn on Thanksgiving, I pulled myself away from my lock-checking extravaganza after four attempts. Round five was cut short by a passing car. I stopped immediately when I saw headlights approach, and let my thoughts fester in my head. By that time, keeping OCD hidden was second-nature to me.\u000a\u000aOld friends, new friends, colleagues, family. Even my Mom had no clue.\u000a\u000aI barely knew it myself.\u000a\u000aThe night unfolded in a spectacular fashion. Our veterinarian came out for an emergency field trip and confirmed my worries.\u000a\u000aEarlier that month, the Burbank horse community was dealt a rare outbreak of the equine herpesvirus. The highly contagious virus didn't reach our barn, but the facility next door was quarantined, as mandated by the California Department of Food and Agriculture.\u000a\u000aSeveral horses were seriously ill, and sadly, others died. A primary symptom of EHV is a high fever, so Gatsby's blood samples were put on a plane to undergo testing at a laboratory in Sacramento.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the night, Gatsby was sequestered in a dark isolation area, with only a small window to peer out into the world.\u000a\u000aAlbatross\u000a\u000aThe following day, I had this great idea to buy a boom box radio so Gatsby could listen to Christmas carols. If you didn't think I was bonkers before ... well, I think this confirms it!\u000a\u000aMy ideal Black Friday is spent light-years away from OCD-and-anxiety-inducing retail festivities. But I was on a mission to buy an entertainment system for a horse, so I had to get over myself and go to Target.\u000a\u000aThroughout my life, the intensity of OCD has ebbed and flowed, as I developed new obsessions and compulsions.\u000a\u000aMaking contact with certain objects -- like tile flooring and grass -- often leaves me feeling absolutely disgusting until I take a shower. Whenever I pass a public restroom, I experience crippling anxiety over germs in my hair. But the most ridiculous obsession is fear of driving through certain freeway underpasses, where the air flow is restricted.\u000a\u000aSometimes, my symptoms are on full blast, but there are also blissful stretches where I'm relatively fine. My college years were nearly symptom-free. I was probably too busy making jungle juice to care.\u000a\u000aHamasaki's first horse, Lindy, an Appaloosa mare who loved to run off as they rode.\u000a\u000aI wish there were a rhyme or reason for this madness. I'm happy spending all day with horses, covered in dirt and bugs. But I avoid walking too close to garbage cans at the barn, so as to avoid airborne contaminants. When I see others touching them with bare hands, my heart starts racing.\u000a\u000aIt's the nature of the beast.\u000a\u000aStanding outside Target, I didn't make my usual game plan to avoid "contamination" from certain locations and objects. I went inside wearing mental blinders. Get a cart. Touch it. Push it. Turn left. Get the radio. Batteries. Grab a basketball for Gatsby to play with (or destroy, depending on his mood.) Stand in the checkout line. Don't think. Get in the car and drive off.\u000a\u000aI had to get it done. So I did.\u000a\u000aI spent the next 10 days convincing Gatsby he wasn't part of a strange Medieval science project.\u000a\u000aI brought a camping chair into his stall, and sat there for hours. I did my Christmas shopping online, and scared myself silly reading mysteries in the dark. He ate carrots while I had lunch, and we listened to the news on the radio.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the lab results started coming back. The first one was negative. So was the second. On day 11, the third test came back, and he was a free man. We chalked up his fevers to a different virus strain, and he stepped outside, squinting in the sunlight.\u000a\u000aThe entire barn celebrated his release. I felt the love, and so did he. I began to think of Gatsby and me as friends. Maybe even family.\u000a\u000aWhen I arrived at his stall three days later, he wasn't eating breakfast. He stood in the corner, and gave me a withering look. I don't why I said this out loud, but I told him "Nobody puts baby in the corner," and took his temperature.\u000a\u000aThe thermometer read 104.6 degrees.\u000a\u000aTruth vs. fiction\u000a\u000aDeath is a recurring theme in my OCD sequences.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, I had a medical scare which had me spinning, and of course, it turned out to be nothing. But in the six days I lived in purgatory between doctors' appointments, I convinced myself I was going to die. Always prepare for the worst, hope for the best right? For me, that's a dangerous road to travel.\u000a\u000aI was furious no one took me seriously. I started lashing out and threw tantrums like 3-year-old. And one wonders why I'm still single! Really, I can't imagine why.\u000a\u000aBack then, I didn't know there's a psychological term for it: Catastrophizing.\u000a\u000aWhen Gatsby fell ill again, there wasn't time to catastrophize. Call the vet. Encourage him to drink. It was though I were outside myself, telling this other person what to do.\u000a\u000aI thought Gatsby was going to die.\u000a\u000aTurns out, this time, I wasn't far from the truth.\u000a\u000aTo live or to die\u000a\u000aIt didn't take long for the switch to flip, as Gatsby's condition worsened. His eyes grew sleepy, his fluffy coat went drab, and I could see this soul was tired of fighting.\u000a\u000aI was, too.\u000a\u000aThe sugar-coated version is that I pondered this at home on a chilly afternoon.\u000a\u000aThe truth is, I sat on my bed, stoned off a cocktail of anti-anxiety meds and anti-depressants. I felt nothing. I was just there, staring at the clock and letting time pass.\u000a\u000aThe phone rang. My friend Bristol had found Gatsby on the ground, having a seizure.\u000a\u000aMy horse was thrashing violently, his eyes rolling back into his head \u2014 while I was completely checked out. I should have been there with him. I was horrified and ashamed of myself.\u000a\u000aThis was my crossroads -- the moment I decided to get out of my head for good.\u000a\u000aA path to mindfulness\u000a\u000aBristol got him on his feet, and an hour later, he was trotting around the arena like nothing happened.\u000a\u000aBut his rise from the ashes was short-lived. He was deteriorating. His eyes fluttered erratically, as he slipped in and out of lucidity.\u000a\u000aI contemplated euthanasia. Nobody ventured to say it out loud, but it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where things were going. I brought Misty into the arena, and she stood quietly next to him, his silent partner.\u000a\u000aLocking rituals, tapping windows, and dirty shopping carts meant nothing to me in that moment, and in those that followed.\u000a\u000aWhile he was dying, I became fully present to life.\u000a\u000aEverything had always been there, I just never had the mindset to notice: my coworkers laughing, the hint of chimney smoke in the air, the streets decked out in twinkly lights. They were all new to me.\u000a\u000aThe next day, lab tests revealed abnormalities with Gatsby's liver system. He was admitted to Chino Valley Equine Hospital and monitored 24/7 while we waited for a diagnosis.\u000a\u000aBut instead of hiding at home in a drug-induced trance, I made a point to visit him, focus on work, and simply be mindful and present to my surroundings. My thoughts were quiet, humbled, if you will ... for now.\u000a\u000aI received the news in rush hour traffic, surrounded by blinking red and yellow lights.\u000a\u000aGatsby had a form of liver disease called biliary hyperplasia, an extremely rare condition his surgeon hadn't seen in 30 years.\u000a\u000aTurn the beat around\u000a\u000aThe veterinarians worked tirelessly to treat him and determine a prognosis -- and before I knew it, the light in Gatsby's eyes began to return.\u000a\u000aOn Christmas Eve, a horse trailer pulled up in front of the barn. After 10 days in the hospital, Gatsby was home.\u000a\u000aIt felt bittersweet. I was happy he was alive, nervous because he wasn't out of the woods, and terrified of caring for him largely on my own. But I could actually feel these emotions. In another time, a term like "biliary hyperplasia" would have sent me into a tailspin. This time, the emotions overtook the anxiety and panic that constantly occupy my mind.\u000a\u000aWhen my OCD grew out of control, I shut out my friends. I was in a perpetually bad mood, and chose to ignore or be snarky to people.\u000a\u000aIt was the wrong choice.\u000a\u000aHamasaki's friends at the barn provided tremendous support when Gatsby was ill.\u000a\u000aDuring Gatsby's illness, I re-learned the meaning of friendship and camaraderie. On Thanksgiving night, Davee and Vivian stood with me outside in the cold. Bristol and Colleen spent an entire afternoon with me at the equine hospital. Donna and Molly cared for Misty when I couldn't. And I spent hours texting Maggie and Nancy, who had recently moved to other barns, but made me feel like they never left.\u000a\u000aMy friends sent "good vibes" and "positive energy" over Facebook. I used to laugh at people and their "healing thoughts" \u2014 until they were directed towards me.\u000a\u000aI didn't deserve them.\u000a\u000aThe veterinarians prescribed Gatsby a powerful antibiotic which can cause dangerous bone marrow suppression to humans who are exposed.\u000a\u000aHe had to be dosed every six hours, and I was under strict orders to wear latex gloves, a mask, goggles and a smock. When I approached him in my Hazmat costume, he would pin his ears back in disgust, walk to the corner and sulk. I would often sulk alongside him, in solidarity.\u000a\u000aThis went on for days, which turned into weeks, which turned into months. There were baby steps, backward steps, temper tantrums -- and days full of leaps and bounds. His wonderful vet, Dr. David Wheat, remained positive about his prognosis, and so did I.\u000a\u000aMy eyes were open. There wasn't space to spin into a never-ending abyss of checking locks and fleeing trash cans. There was just this horse, my friend, my family.\u000a\u000aFive months later, Gatsby got the all-clear. My champion pulled through.\u000a\u000aWe were both fully present. And alive.\u000a\u000aThe great Gatsby\u000a\u000aGatsby's plight pushed me to seek help. He was the sole, unlikely being on Earth who could pull me from the deepest waters -- but it was up to me to find the shoreline.\u000a\u000aGatsby's brave, sensitive spirit had always been there, merely awaiting recognition. I didn't listen and allowed OCD to nearly paralyze me. But this horse forced me to listen, and although I wish it were under different circumstances, I finally heard him.\u000a\u000aThis spring, at the suggestion of my psychiatrist, I entered outpatient treatment at the OCD Center of Los Angeles.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aI'm learning how to restructure my thought patterns and address some of my irrational fears.\u000a\u000aThrough cognitive behavioral therapy combined with other methods, I am finally making progress toward being free from the chains of this disease.\u000a\u000aMaybe one day, I'll be able to touch a trash can, then touch my hair, and just let it be dirty for hours! There will definitely be champagne that day.\u000a\u000aBack in December, in the midst of this mess, I ran into Faye, an animal communicator who often visits our barn. Whether I believe in this type of conveyance is irrelevant -- I simply find it fascinating to hear what she has to say.\u000a\u000aI brought Gatsby to her and asked, "Is he going to die?"\u000a\u000aI will never forget her response: "He says he won't give up on you, if you don't give up on him. You're his hero."\u000a\u000aI didn't think much of it afterward ... but today, I understand what this means.\u000a\u000aGatsby saved me from myself without saying a word.\u000a\u000aHow humbling it is to be my hero's hero.

aVNew York (CNN) For years, we only had one photo of Chelsea Manning: that iconic black and white image she sent to her Army supervisor.\u000a\u000aIt was made public by the Army in 2013 and remained the only photo portraying her as a woman until her release from prison in 2017 -- other photos were prohibited while she was in custody.\u000a\u000aIt's strangely fitting, then, that 30 lifelike 3D portraits of her face now hang from a ceiling in the Fridman Gallery in Manhattan.\u000a\u000aThey are part of a project called " A Becoming Resemblance ," by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who created them from computer-generated images made using Manning's DNA.\u000a\u000a"This is a sampling of thirty possible faces that could be produced algorithmically reading Chelsea's DNA data," said Dewey-Hagborg during the exhibition's private view.\u000a\u000a"They represent a wide range of the diversity that exists within Chelsea's genome, a diversity in which that same DNA data can be read."\u000a\u000aChelsea Manning greets fans at New York's Fridman Gallery.\u000a\u000aPen pals\u000a\u000aManning spent seven years in prison for leaking government documents to WikiLeaks. During that time, she had gender transition surgery\u000a\u000aOriginally sentenced to 35 years when she was still known as Bradley Manning , she was pardoned in January 2017 by then President Obama -- on his third-to-last day in office -- and then released on 17 May.\u000a\u000aThe DNA samples were recovered from cheek swabs and hair clippings that were part of a correspondence between Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.\u000a\u000a"Stranger Visions"\u000a\u000aIt's a similar process to Dewey-Hagborg's groundbreaking 2012 project "Stranger Visions," which used random bits of DNA found on cigarette butts and other litter to create portraits of strangers.\u000a\u000a"In 2015 I received an email more or less out of the blue from Paper magazine. She couldn't be visited and photographed at that time and so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made."\u000a\u000aA handful of letters were exchanged over the next two years through an intermediary.\u000a\u000a"Chelsea was excited about the idea, but also concerned the she might appear too male in a portrait generated just based on her DNA," said Dewey-Hagborg.\u000a\u000a"I'm hoping that people will take away the idea that genetics is not destiny and a kind of push for self-determined identity and a push against efforts to inscribe identities into us, or for external forces to tell us who we are rather than listening to us say this is who I am."\u000a\u000aChelsea Manning signs an autograph at her gallery opening.\u000a\u000aA poetic investigation\u000a\u000aRoddy Schrock, the curator of the exhibition, defined it as a "a poetic investigation Heather took into issues of identity and ownership of oneself."\u000a\u000aAround 250 people were in attendance at the opening. Manning arrived accompanied by friends and her agent, but declined to speak with the media.\u000a\u000aShe was followed around by the documentary team for "Chelsea XY," which will be released at Sundance Film Festival in January 2018.\u000a\u000aShe did engage with fans and supporters and took photos with them.\u000a\u000a"To have Chelsea out, in a dress, creating art, on this wonderful journey with other activists and people in the media, it's really moving," said Suzie Glbert, one of the attendees.\u000a\u000aJeff Seelbach, a fan of Chelsea and producer at the company funding her documentary, said: "The thing that fascinates me about it is the very unique and terrible situation she was in, that her identity and her ability to have an image and a representation was completely suppressed by the government and by our legal system."\u000a\u000aArtist Heather Dewey-Hagborg also got to meet Chelsea in person for the first time after their mail exchange.\u000a\u000a"It was both totally amazing and then completely normal. I mean we had brunch, avocado toast, you know, your typical New York thing. But then it was also just completely stunning to see someone you've pictured in your head," she noted.\u000a\u000a"She's [Chelsea] really excited about it, this is her kind of art debut."

aV(CNN) The race to the top has just gotten tighter, with two rising mega-towers in the Middle East battling to become the world's tallest.\u000a\u000aConstruction has now begun on The Tower at Dubai Creek Harbor , a vast waterfront development, with completion scheduled for ahead of Dubai's Expo 2020 world fair, which kicks off in October that year.\u000a\u000aPiercing through a canopy of clouds, The Tower, at 3,045ft (928m), aims to take the title of world's tallest tower, which the 2,723ft-tall (830m) Burj Khalifa , also in Dubai, has held since 2010.\u000a\u000aBut it's got competition. The Jeddah Tower , in Saudi Arabia, is also slated to finish in 2020.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, this gleaming vertical will be 236ft (72m) taller than Dubai's creation.\u000a\u000aIf The Tower in Dubai wants the world title, even for a short time, it has to open its doors before the Jeddah Tower.\u000a\u000aThe Tower will be the heart of Dubai Creek Harbour, one of the largest tourist and lifestyle developments in the world stretching across 2.3 square miles (6 sqkm).\u000a\u000aReady, steady, go!\u000a\u000aBoth of these towers are feats in modern engineering.\u000a\u000aThe Tower , in Dubai, is being constructed by Emaar, the real estate giant also behind the Burj Khalifa, and will anchor the Dubai Creek development, serving -- developers hope -- as a magnet for tourists.\u000a\u000aDesigned by Swiss-Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava Valls , it will feature The Pinnacle Room -- an observation point offering 360-degree views of the emirate -- and public vertical gardens, while 18 to 20 floors have been reserved for homes, restaurants, shops and a boutique hotel.\u000a\u000aIf construction runs to schedule, this $1 billion tower will have been thrown up in just three years.\u000a\u000aThe Jeddah Tower, in Saudi Arabia, will have taken a little longer.\u000a\u000aConstruction on this graceful arrow to the sky began on April 1, 2013, and was originally slated for completion in 2018, but its opening date has already been pushed back twice.

This $1.23 billion construction project is, however, already40 floors off the ground, with 212 left to build -- it's undeniably farther along than the Dubai Tower.\u000a\u000aBut to think Dubai could finish first is not "as farfetched as it sounds", according to Jason Gabel, communications manager for the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).\u000a\u000a"The Dubai project is an observation tower, and therefore won't require nearly as much lead time as a full-blown skyscraper," Gabel tells CNN. "2020 is a real possibility for completion."\u000a\u000aBecause less than 50% of The Tower's height is occupied by usable floor space, it is defined by the CTBUH as a "supported tower" rather than a "building".\u000a\u000aThis technicality precludes The Tower from achieving the distinction of being the world's tallest building. Rather, it would be the world's tallest man-made structure, or tower, until the Jeddah Tower is completed.\u000a\u000aThe power of a skyline\u000a\u000aHome to more than 65 highrises over 656 feet (200m) tall and counting, Dubai has become synonymous with futuristic skyscrapers, and has been a pioneer of this in the Middle East.\u000a\u000a"Historically, no Middle Eastern country has come close to building skyscrapers at the rate and height of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but notable pockets of high-rise development are occurring in Qatar, Israel, and Saudi Arabia," says Gabel. "The competitive situation we now see between Saudi Arabia and the UAE very unique."\u000a\u000aDubai's lofty intentions debuted in 1979, with the 39-story Dubai World Trade Center. It was the city's first high rise, and the tallest building in the Middle East.\u000a\u000aSubsequent iconic buildings, such as the Burj Khalifa and the Burj Al Arab , have given Dubai global notoriety.\u000a\u000aBurj Al Arab\u000a\u000a"Height produces iconicity and visibility on a global stage," says Gabel, explaining why Dubai has focused on building big. "Visibility is itself an asset that can have a positive impact on real estate valuation, investment flows, tourism numbers, and public identity.\u000a\u000a"Put simply, structures like this are very expensive upfront, but the benefits of having the 'tallest' are often worth the trouble -- as was the case with the Burj Khalifa."\u000a\u000aAric Chen, the design and architecture curator M+ visual culture museum in Hong Kong, tells CNN that for emerging economies a skyline can be a powerful communications tool.\u000a\u000a"These soaring profiles are in many ways symbolic," Chen tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"Places like Dubai and, to some extent, places like China, are still trying to put themselves on the map and prove that they have arrived as modern global and technologically advanced nations."\u000a\u000aTesting the tower\u000a\u000aThe rapid speed at which Dubai can throw up a mega-tower has not, however, escaped criticism.\u000a\u000aA series of fires in the past few years, including a blaze that tore through a luxury skyscraper on the Palm Jumeirah artificial island in Dubai this month -- have called into question the quality of some towers, and their fire-proofing.\u000a\u000a"Super tall buildings are not unproblematic and there are safety concerns," says Chen.\u000a\u000aValls, however, is confident that The Tower will not succumb to such issues.\u000a\u000a"Extensive studies were undertaken in preparation for the ground breaking, and the learning that we have gained from the experience will add to the knowledge base of mankind," he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aDevelopers have installed multiple damper and shock absorption systems throughout the building, to ensure its stability.\u000a\u000aThey also completed a series of wind tunnel, climate and seismic tests analyzing 12 scenarios across varying heights to check the behavior of the building under stressful conditions.\u000a\u000a"We need to have a balanced and careful look at skyscrapers," says Chen. "But they do serve to again push technologies, and push what's possible.\u000a\u000a"We can certainly learn from that experimentation."

aVBeijing (CNN) At the dinner table, if there is one topic that Lu Yuping's family is careful to avoid, it's medicine.\u000a\u000aHer husband and other relatives chide her for making weekly trips to the local pharmacy to buy large piles of traditional herbs to treat her daily ailments.\u000a\u000a"They're always telling me to stop wasting money on Chinese medicine and just go to a Western hospital to get real care," said Lu, a 60-year-old retired hospital accountant who lives in Shanghai. "But I don't care what they say. I know that it works."\u000a\u000aLu Yuping is a 60-year-old retired hospital accountant who lives in Shanghai and a regular user of Chinese medicine\u000a\u000aLu recalls when traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) played a greater role in Chinese society. "Now, I'd say nearly 80% of people just rely on Western medical treatment," she said.\u000a\u000aThrough a new law, which will go into effect on July 1, the Chinese government hopes to reverse that shift.\u000a\u000aWhat is Chinese medicine? More than 2,000 years old, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) covers five main areas: acupuncture, massage, plants and herbs, dietary therapy and qigong exercises. Most practitioners learn from a master rather than studying the discipline at university -- although this is also possible. China has some 3,966 TCM hospitals and 42,528 TCM clinics, which employ around 452,000 practitioners. The new law will give practitioners the opportunity to qualify as licensed physicians. Source: CCTV\u000a\u000aThe new legislation will aim to raise the status of TCM by requiring local governments to launch TCM institutions in all medical centers, increasing funding for its development, and widening the scale of TCM education.\u000a\u000aSu Rui, an assistant researcher at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, believes that the new law might successfully promote the development and practice of Chinese medicine, which has been on the decline in China in recent decades.\u000a\u000aOne of the challenges of getting doctors to come on board, she says, is closing the profit differential between TCM and Western medicine.\u000a\u000aAs opposed to using expensive laboratory tests and X-rays to diagnose illness, TCM doctors often simply rely on external signs such as a person's pulse, and the color and texture of their tongue -- known as she tai.\u000a\u000a"Doctors are often reluctant to use Chinese medicine because it's not lucrative. If a doctor can make 50 yuan from using TCM medicine and 100 yuan from Western medicine, then of course they'll use Western," said Su.\u000a\u000aSkeptics and advocates\u000a\u000aThe other challenge is skepticism among some Chinese, particularly a younger generation that is more familiar with Western medicine.\u000a\u000aLast year, the death of a young Chinese actress who chose to treat cancer with TCM instead of chemotherapy triggered a debate around the effectiveness of Chinese medicine.\u000a\u000aLiu Guiming, a retired factory worker in Chengdu, says he has lost several friends to illnesses who, he believes, might have survived if they had not solely relied on TCM.\u000a\u000a"Western medicine is more common nowadays, and rightly so. That's because you can actually see the effect, especially with more serious diseases," said Liu. "I think TCM will eventually die out."\u000a\u000aProponents of TCM argue that compared with Western medicine, the traditional form places more emphasis on prevention.\u000a\u000aEvery day, Lu Yuping stews a large pot of bitter herbs to treat even the slightest of discomforts like dry mouth.\u000a\u000a"My husband tells me that I'm not sick, but I feel that these are signs of imbalances in the body," she said. "So I go to the doctor or pharmacist to get the necessary treatment before it gets serious."\u000a\u000aWorkers at a traditional chinese medicine store prepare various dried items.\u000a\u000aWang Chunyuan, a 30-year-old yoga instructor in Beijing, said he uses TCM because it focuses on the root of the problem instead of simply on outward symptoms.\u000a\u000a"You might have a headache, but it could be caused by a number of things. It might be dryness in the environment, or it might be imbalances in your bodily energy, or maybe it's psychological," he said. "TCM takes those nuances into account."\u000a\u000aThere is much disagreement, however, about which illnesses can be effectively treated by TCM.\u000a\u000aNot subject to Western testing standards such as randomized controlled clinical trials, and comparison with placebos, TCM efficacy has been difficult to study or provide evidence for.\u000a\u000aBut surgeon Jiang Ping believes that even for some serious conditions like collapsed lungs and brain tumors, TCM can be more effective than Western medicine and has fewer side effects.\u000a\u000a"We still can't explain why it works, but we know that it works (in certain situations)," said Jiang. "You can't explain it using science, and that's because the scientific means are currently too limited."\u000a\u000aIn Hong Kong, the two medical traditions exist side by side and both are commonly covered by private health insurance policies. The city, which is a special administrative region of China, has a Chinese Medicine Council that regulates the industry.\u000a\u000aGeneration gap?\u000a\u000aLu, the retired accountant from Shanghai, says that while she and her husband frequently argue over TCM, most people her age see its value.\u000a\u000aThe same, however, does not prove true for those under 60 years old, she says. "Younger people have less exposure to TCM, and fewer people are studying it," she said.\u000a\u000aShan Liyun, a pharmacist at a popular vendor of TCM in Beijing, also sees cause for concern. He worries that if nothing is done the practice won't be passed down to increasingly-Westernized future generations.\u000a\u000aThat includes 22-year-old Zhang Xiaoyi, who graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in the US this year. She has suspicions that if TCM has any effects, they are mostly psychological.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese herbal medicine Lu Yuping buys each week.\u000a\u000aBut not all young people are skeptics.\u000a\u000aA 29-year-old PhD student at Peking University in Beijing, Wu Pengzheng, contends that people his age should not be so quick to dismiss a medical tradition that has existed for more than 2000 years.\u000a\u000aHowever, he doesn't feel that the government needs to go out of its way to support it. "Just let it go its normal path, and if it's useful then it will naturally develop," he said.\u000a\u000aAs for Lu, who intends to continue brewing her herbs twice daily despite her husband's grumbling, she thinks that the key to TCM's survival is just what the government plans: "mutual learning" and "integration" with Western medicine.\u000a\u000a"That way, they can make up for each other's deficiencies," she said.

aV(CNN) When it comes to the hit Netflix series " 13 Reasons Why ," many viewers find themselves on either side of a controversial debate.\u000a\u000aOn one end, fans of the binge-able show applaud the series for raising awareness about the tragedy of youth suicide and shedding light on how to spot warning signs of depression or suicidal thoughts.\u000a\u000aOn the other end, mental health experts describe the show as worrisome and point to how its relatable characters and graphic depiction of suicide can pose a health risk for young people already struggling with mental health issues.\u000a\u000aIt turns out that following the show's premiere in March, online searches for terms related to suicide awareness and prevention increased, but so did search terms associated with ideation -- and those had greater relative upsurge, according to the paper, which published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday.\u000a\u000aAfter the premiere of "13 Reasons Why," the search phrase "how to commit suicide" rose 26% above what would normally have been expected for that time; "suicide prevention" went up 23%; and "suicide hotline number" climbed 21%, based on the paper's data.\u000a\u000a"The time for rhetorical debate is over," said John Ayers, research professor at San Diego State University and lead author of the paper.\u000a\u000a"While '13 Reasons Why' has certainly caused the conversation to begin -- it's raised awareness, and we do see a variety of suicide-related searches increasing -- our worst fears were confirmed," he said. "That is, thousands of people, thousands more, are searching online about ways to kill themselves."\u000a\u000aBased on best-selling author Jay Asher's 2007 young adult book of the same title, the show follows the fictional story of a teenage girl named Hannah Baker, played by actress Katherine Langford. Hannah leaves behind 13 mysterious cassette tape recordings after killing herself. Each audio recording is addressed to a person who Hannah says played a role in her devastating decision to end her own life.\u000a\u000aThe show, co-produced by actress and pop star Selena Gomez, has been renewed for a second season. Filming for the upcoming season reportedly has commenced in parts of California's Bay Area\u000a\u000aDue to the findings in the new paper, Ayers called for the second season to be postponed and changes to be retrofitted to the already released first season.\u000a\u000aIn a statement that Netflix provided to CNN, the entertainment streaming company said, "We always believed this show would increase discussion around this tough subject matter. This is an interesting quasi experimental study that confirms this. We are looking forward to more research and taking everything we learn to heart as we prepare for season 2."\u000a\u000aA surge of suicide searches\u000a\u000aFor the paper, researchers collected data on suicide-related Google search trends in the United States from March 31, when "13 Reasons Why" premiered, through April 18, before former NFL player Aaron Hernandez's suicide , which would have skewed the search data.\u000a\u000aThe researchers also eliminated search terms in the data related to the popular superhero movie "Suicide Squad," resulting in a final database of 20 suicide-related search terms.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that searches for 17 of those 20 terms were higher than expected for 12 of the 19 days that were studied following the release of "13 Reasons Why."\u000a\u000aFor instance, suicide-related searches were 15% higher on April 15 and then 44% higher on April 18, the researchers found. The queries that focused on suicidal ideation had the largest increases, the data showed.\u000a\u000aOverall, the increase over the 19-day period represented a total of about 900,000 to 1.5 million more searches than otherwise expected, Ayers said.\u000a\u000aNetflix gave "13 Reasons Why" a TV-MA rating , which is for mature audiences, and the first season's episodes 9, 12 and 13 - which contain more explicit material - had specific warnings prior to the beginning of each episode.\u000a\u000aAt midnight on the day of the show's debut, 13ReasonsWhy.info , a website built by Netflix, launched. It includes links to various suicide helplines\u000a\u000aAdditionally, during production of the first season, "13 Reasons Why" executive producers consulted with several mental health professionals and doctors who helped guide the show's storytelling approach to suicide, sexual assault and bullying, according to the Netflix statement.\u000a\u000aYet in the new paper, the researchers wrote that the show could have done more to reduce associations with suicidal ideation by closely following the World Health Organization's media guidelines for preventing suicide (PDF).\u000a\u000aFor instance, the guidelines recommend avoiding detailed descriptions or portrayals of a suicide method, among other recommendations.\u000a\u000a"Psychiatrists have expressed grave concerns because the show ignores the World Health Organization's validated media guidelines for preventing suicide. The show's staff instead continue to prefer their gut instincts," Ayers said. "The show's makers must swiftly change their course of action, including removing the show and postponing a second season."\u000a\u000aIn an op-ed published in Vanity Fair in April, a writer for the "13 Reasons Why" series defended the decision not to shy away from main character Hannah's suicide and to include a gruesome scene of her death in the first season.\u000a\u000a"From the very beginning, I agreed that we should depict the suicide with as much detail and accuracy as possible. I even argued for it -- relating the story of my own suicide attempt to the other writers," wrote Nic Sheff, one of the show's writers.\u000a\u000aIn the op-ed, Sheff detailed how a woman once told him about her painful suicide attempt and her account caused him to reconsider his own suicide attempt.\u000a\u000a"If that woman had not told me her story, I wouldn't be here now. I would've missed out on all the amazing gifts I have in my life today," Sheff wrote.\u000a\u000a"So when it came time to discuss the portrayal of the protagonist's suicide in '13 Reasons Why,' I of course immediately flashed on my own experience. It seemed to me the perfect opportunity to show what an actual suicide really looks like -- to dispel the myth of the quiet drifting off," he wrote.\u000a\u000aThe risk of suicide 'contagion'\u000a\u000aAll in all, the new paper suggests an association between "13 Reasons Why" and suicide-related Google searches. However, the analyses cannot definitively conclude that the show caused the searches. Also, it could not be ascertained from the data whether any of the searches actually led to a suicide attempt.\u000a\u000aMore research is needed to determine the true risk-benefit when it comes to the association between "13 Reasons Why" and heightened interest in suicide among viewers, said Madelyn Gould, a professor of epidemiology in psychiatry at Columbia University, who was not involved in the new paper.\u000a\u000a"These analyses, by Ayers and his team, seem to indicate that suicide awareness was heightened and I think that that is a relief, but unfortunately at what price was that awareness raised?" Gould said.\u000a\u000aA separate paper previously suggested that some online searches for suicide-related terms could be tied to suicide deaths. In that paper, searches such as "complete guide of suicide" correlated with actual suicide deaths between 2004 and 2009 in Taiwan. That research published in the Journal of Affective Disorders in 2011.\u000a\u000aAs for the new paper, although there were some limitations in the study design, the authors took a creative first step in examining the influence of "13 Reasons Why" by analyzing online search trends, said John Ackerman, suicide prevention coordinator at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\u000a\u000aHe was not involved in the new paper, but wrote a blog post in April about "13 Reasons Why" and guidance for parents.\u000a\u000a"It addresses an important question: Are we seeing actual suicidal thinking and behavior being influenced by a television show?" Ackerman said about the paper.\u000a\u000a"I believe most people working on the show felt like by raising awareness of youth suicide and portraying it graphically, they would somehow discourage young people from engaging in suicidal behavior. Sadly, this is not how suicide contagion works," he said.\u000a\u000aSuicide contagion refers to when exposure to suicide within a family, group of friends, military unit, or through the media may be associated with an increase in suicidal behaviors, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services\u000a\u000aGould said that such contagion can be demonstrated in a theory termed the Werther Effect , which refers to how negative stories about engaging in suicidal behavior can be linked to an increase in deaths by suicide.\u000a\u000aThe Werther Effect's name stems from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1774 novel, " The Sorrows of Young Werther ," which ends in suicide and was reportedly linked to a wave of young men in Europe deciding to kill themselves in the late 1700s.\u000a\u000a" 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' elicited a kind of epidemic of copycats, of people dressing up like this character in the book," said Dr. Victor Schwartz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the new paper.\u000a\u000aWhile most teens can read novels or watch shows, like "13 Reasons Why," and not have suicidal thoughts or behaviors as a result, not all can, said Schwartz, who serves as chief medical officer of the JED Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on emotional health and suicide prevention among teens and young adults.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Cyberbullying blamed in teen suicides Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cyberbullying blamed in teen suicides 02:39\u000a\u000a"Looking at it from a prevention standpoint, it's concerning when a young person already has a prehistory or an existing mental health problem with anxiety, depression, and, for a smaller group, actually psychotic illnesses," Schwartz said, adding that such illnesses are risk factors for suicidal behavior.\u000a\u000a"If a young person has a history of serious mental health or substance concerns, then obviously that adds a layer of vulnerability" when consuming media about suicide, he said.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, positive contagion has been more recently termed the Papageno Effect , which refers to how positive stories of overcoming suicidal thoughts can be linked to a decrease in deaths.\u000a\u000aSo, fictional tales or news reports about a character finding coping strategies for suicidal thoughts can have an inverse relationship with suicidal behaviors. The Papageno Effect's name stems from the character Papageno in Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute." In the opera, the character overcomes a suicidal crisis.\u000a\u000aThe new "13 Reasons Why" paper adds to a body of research conducted by Ayers and his colleagues that highlights the influence that celebrities and the media can have on public health outcomes.\u000a\u000aPreviously, Ayers and his colleagues analyzed how actor Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago was associated with an increase in Google searches for HIV testing kits and a boost in kit sales. Their study published in the journal Prevention Science in May.\u000a\u000aThe researchers wrote in their new paper that further examinations of "13 Reasons Why" might reveal whether the show also could be tied to actual changes in behaviors, from calls placed to national suicide hotlines or estimated suicide attempts.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aGlobally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15- to 29-year-olds, according to the WHO. In the US, about 4,600 young people between 10 and 24 die by suicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u000a\u000a"Maybe this will have some impact on the producers of '13 Reasons Why' as they develop their second season," Gould said about the new paper. "None of us know what that second season is going to be about. I hope that they recognize that it's not just suicidal behavior that can get modeled and that there are other deleterious behaviors that can get modeled as well."

aVMichael Smart is an assistant professor of transportation planning at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The views expressed are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Imagine being able to travel from New York to Los Angeles without having to step on a plane, yet be able to do so in a fraction of the time it would take to drive. On the surface, that tantalizing prospect took a step closer with the news last month that a Japanese maglev train had reached a top speed of close to 400 mph, breaking its own world record in the process.\u000a\u000aAnd the sight of futuristic looking trains whizzing past platforms at hundreds of miles per hour isn't confined to Japan: China, France and Spain, to name a few, have their own high-speed rail networks. Indeed, while these bullet trains may look futuristic, they have been around for decades; they're a tried and tested technology that the Japanese debuted over 50 years ago.\u000a\u000aSo surely it's only a matter of time before large numbers of U.S. passengers are doing a daily commute to New York from Washington and Boston in about the time it would take them to drive to work in their own cities, right?\u000a\u000aNot anytime soon.\u000a\u000aWhile several countries have undertaken the tough work of raising the money to invest in bullet trains, it's unlikely the United States will ever see the vast network of high-speed trains that blanket other countries. Indeed, passenger rail service in the United States lags behind much of the rest of the developed world, for several reasons.\u000a\u000aFor a start, much of the United States is not exactly an ideal market for high-speed rail. Compared to places where rail really flourishes -- Japan and Western Europe, for instance -- the United States is geographically vast. As a result, in much of the country, cities are far enough apart that air travel provides significant time savings, even compared to some of the fastest trains.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Japan's trains as safe as they are fast Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan's trains as safe as they are fast 02:19\u000a\u000aThe layout of cities matters, too. When you arrive in Tokyo, Paris or Barcelona, it's often convenient (and even pleasant) to walk to your final destination. When it's not, a fast and frequent mass transportation system awaits to whisk you away. This is not the case in many American cities, where arriving by train typically means jumping into a cab or renting a car for the last leg of your journey. Simply put, in many sprawling U.S. cities, getting to your destination by train can still mean you've got quite a way yet to get home. We could change that. And we probably should. But we're not there yet.\u000a\u000aStill, there are several parts of the United States where high-speed rail makes a great deal of sense.\u000a\u000aThe Northeast Corridor (Boston-New York-Washington) comes in at the top of just about every list of potential candidates for high-speed rail, with the distances involved being considered within the "Goldilocks" zone for fast trains. For example, at just over 200 miles from New York to both Boston and Washington, fast trains could compete with even faster airplanes by offering centrally located stations and providing an alternative to the hassle of airport security lines. These cities are dense, have strong downtowns, and extensive mass transit systems once you arrive.\u000a\u000aJust as importantly, rail on the Northeast Corridor can also compete with driving, mainly because traffic congestion makes driving in the region so slow and unreliable, while tolls and parking costs can make it an expensive and time-consuming option. Rail in the northeast even has a great track record; after Amtrak's almost-high-speed Acela service began on the Northeast Corridor in 2000, ridership exploded, quickly outstripping air travel between New York and Washington.\u000a\u000aHowever, the biggest barrier to improved rail service in the United States is simply the lack of political will. At the federal level, support for passenger rail service has languished and Washington has devolved decision-making (and increasingly, funding) to the states. With the nation's transportation trust fund nearly broke and no permanent solution in sight, it seems unlikely the federal government will champion high-speed rail -- a costly endeavor -- in the near future.\u000a\u000aWithout leadership from the federal government, the states are largely in control. Yet many of the most promising corridors for high-speed rail cross state lines, making it difficult to plan for better rail service. In 2009, the Obama administration awarded nearly a billion dollars of stimulus money to plan and upgrade a high-speed rail line connecting Chicago to Milwaukee and Madison. A year later, Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, rejected his state's portion of the money and the project was, for the time being, at least, derailed. (The money quickly found its way to a grateful California for its high-speed rail line.)\u000a\u000aStill, all is not lost for those hoping to see high-speed rail in the United States.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours 01:17\u000a\u000aCalifornia is committed to building its high-speed rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles, paying for the line largely with state money raised by a new cap-and-trade market on carbon emissions. Several privately funded projects are also in the planning stages. For instance, a Dallas-to-Houston line promises 205 mph service in 2021 without a single dollar from the taxpayer. Meanwhile, another private company has already begun construction on a Miami-to-Orlando line with a more modest speed of 125 mph, with service expected to begin in 2017.\u000a\u000aAll this points to how high-speed rail will likely progress in the United States: piecemeal. It is doubtful that we will have a nationwide system of fast trains soon. And this is not necessarily a bad thing; through a combination of private and public action, we should target markets where high-speed rail makes sense. That means looking for shorter corridors connecting dense places with existing mass transit infrastructure.\u000a\u000aHigh-speed rail won't be cheap, so we'll have to choose wisely. Some of the most promising corridors are also the most expensive; Amtrak estimates upgrading the Northeast Corridor to true high-speed rail would cost upward of $150 billion . Such an undertaking requires careful consideration of the economic, environmental and other costs and benefits of individual projects. But more importantly, it requires the kind of long-term planning that seems to have become vanishingly rare.\u000a\u000aThankfully, high-speed rail doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach. And while given the choice I would rather be riding Japan's speeding bullet trains, even the incremental improvements we've seen in services like Amtrak's Acela can make rail travel a lot more appealing for the hundreds of thousands of passengers who rely on it every year.\u000a\u000aRead CNN Opinion's Flipboard magazine.

aVPhotos: The A to Z of watches A is for Accuracy \u2013 Though quartz watches and atomic clocks (like the one that controls your smartphone) will always be more accurate than even the best mechanical watch, the pursuit of high precision in mechanics is still alive today. The fascination behind achieving precision timekeeping in a watch with gears and a mainspring, rather than a battery and an integrated circuit, is a big part of what's kept traditional watchmaking alive in the 21st century. Hide Caption 1 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches B is for Breguet \u2013 Abraham-Louis Breguet was one of the most inventive watchmakers who ever lived. Perhaps his most famous invention is a type of watch called a tourbillon. To prevent gravity negatively affecting accuracy, Breguet put the most critical parts of a watch in a tiny, rotating cage (the word "tourbillon" means "whirlwind" in French). The company he founded is still alive today, making tourbillon watches, for a very select clientele.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 2 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches C is for Chronograph \u2013 You can tell a chronograph by the presence of smaller dials within the larger dial, for reading off elapsed time, as well as buttons set into the side of the case for starting, stopping and re-setting the stopwatch function. (Chronographs are often confused by watch newbies with chronometers, watches guaranteed to perform to a certain accuracy standard.) Chronographs are often associated with motorsports and aviation. One famous model, the Omega Speedmaster, was standard issue for Apollo astronauts and is still used in manned space flight today. Hide Caption 3 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches D is for Dive Watches \u2013 If there's one type of watch that competes with the chronograph for popularity, it's the dive watch. Watches designed for diving first appeared in the late 1930s, from naval suppliers like the Italian firm Panerai. However, the modern dive watch dates back to the mid-1950s, when Blancpain's 50 Fathoms and Rolex's Submariner both appeared. These watches established the design of modern dive watches: significant water resistance; a screwed-down winding and setting crown; instant legibility and a rotating bezel (the grooved ring which holds the watch face in place) for timing dive times and decompression stops.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aToday the term "dive watch" is regulated by an international standard that requires those features, as well as a minimum of 100 meters' (328 feet) water resistance. But the appeal of the dive watch is so wide that most are worn by owners who'll never dive at all.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 4 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches E is for Escapement \u2013 Imagine a pendulum swinging back and forth. If you have a mechanism to keep the pendulum swinging and additional parts for counting the swings, you have a clock. In a mechanical watch, a mainspring keeps the watch going (that's right, a mechanical watch is a wind-up toy) and instead of a pendulum, a balance-wheel swinging on hair-fine steel pivots oscillates back and forth, but the principle is the same: there's a mechanism for keeping it swinging, and counting the swings. This is the escapement. Fun fact: the lever escapement, used in virtually all modern watches, was invented in England in 1755. Hide Caption 5 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches F is for Flat \u2013 Recently there's been a huge revival of interest in extra-flat watches. Making this type of watch presents big challenges. Extreme care and precision are necessary to achieve accuracy and reliability. Traditional leaders in the field, like Jaeger-LeCoultre, Vacheron Constantin, and Piaget, vie to create ultra-elegant ultra-flat watches, but relative newcomers like Bulgari make excellent examples as well. Hide Caption 6 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches G is for Grand Seiko \u2013 Think Switzerland is the only country making killer timepieces? Think again. Seiko is often thought of as a maker of entry-level quartz watches and tough but affordable mechanicals, but they also make Grand Seiko, a range of watches with quality fit, finish, and precision. For many years, Grand Seikos were made in small numbers and only available in Japan but today they are increasingly sold internationally. They offer a level of quality that would cost significantly more from a Swiss manufacturer, which is why they've been a watch insider's cult favorite for many years. Hide Caption 7 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches H is for Hermès \u2013 Though their watch straps are legendary among aficionados (the high-end brand Parmigiani Fleurier is known to source most of their straps from Hermès), they also make a wide range of fashion-forward wristwatches, as well as unusual, complicated mechanical watches and even pocket watches, often decorated with beautiful engraving and enameling. Hide Caption 8 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches I is for IWC \u2013 The International Watch Company of Schaffhaussen, Switzerland, is an anomaly. The Swiss firm was founded in the late 19th century by an American Civil War veteran by the name of Florentine Ariosto Jones, who was one of the first to attempt to introduce American manufacturing methods to the Swiss watch industry. Today, IWC is perhaps best known for its many high-profile film tie-ins, but behind that is a company that's made some of the most famous "tool" watches of all time. This includes their Aquatimer dive watches and the legendary "Mark" series of antimagnetic pilot's watches, which were widely used by both military and civilian flyers post-World War II, and are still in production today. Hide Caption 9 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches J is for Jaquet Droz \u2013 Jaquet Droz is named for an 18th-century watchmaker who was also famous for making automatons, clockwork robots that could perform tasks in a human-like fashion. Today the company keeps this tradition alive with its own automaton wristwatches. At the top of the heap: the "Charming Bird" wristwatch in which a tiny robot bird spins and chirps a song, thanks to a built-in mechanical pipe organ. Hide Caption 10 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches K is for Key Wound Watches \u2013 If you don't know what a key-wound watch is, don't worry -- they've been gradually falling out of fashion since the mid-1800s. But once upon a time, all watches were wound by sticking a key into the back and turning it. It was troublesome, and often led to dirt inside the watch where it shouldn't be. (In a Sherlock Holmes story, the great detective deduces that a man was a drunk from the many scratches around the hole for the winding key on his pocket watch.) Nowadays, you can wind and set a watch just by turning the crown, or pulling the crown out to set the time -- the first modern version of this system was developed by the high-end watchmaking firm of Patek Philippe in 1845. Today such mechanisms are called "keyless works." Hide Caption 11 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches L is for Luminova \u2013 The first clocks and watches with glowing hands used an incredibly dangerous radium-based paint that was bright, beautiful and, unfortunately, highly radioactive. Many of the workers who applied radium paint succumbed to cancers. Nowadays, most watches with glow-in-the-dark hands use a material called Luminova. It may not glow spontaneously like radium (it needs to be "charged" by exposure to light), but it is completely safe. Hide Caption 12 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches M is for Magnetism \u2013 This was particularly a problem for anyone working around electrical equipment -- pilots, for instance, since airplane engines generate strong fields. Rolex developed its magnetism-resistant Milgauss in the 1950s for industrial and scientific engineers and technicians. Today, Omega makes a watch -- the Seamaster Aqua Terra -- that is so immune to magnetism that it won't even be thrown off by the powerful magnetic field of an MRI machine.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 13 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches N is for Nanotechnology \u2013 To make watches more reliable, accurate, and durable, modern watchmaking uses manufacturing methods capable of producing micron-level precision, from computer-guided milling machines (standard in watchmaking today) to nanotech manufacturing techniques like silicon fabrication and even more exotic methods like the micro-lithography technique known as LIGA. A watchmaker from 100 years ago would understand how a watch of today works, but the processes would make his jaw drop. Hide Caption 14 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches O is for Omega \u2013 Over the course of its history, Omega has been an industry leader in just about every way that matters. They've developed everything from wristwatches and marine chronometers, to pioneering watches for deep diving and ocean exploration. Omega timepieces have been just about everywhere -- including space. The Omega Speedmaster's most famous moment as "the Moonwatch" came when it was used by the Apollo 13 crew to time critical firing of their crippled spaceship's rocket to ensure a safe reentry. (Cabin instruments were shut down to save precious battery power.) Hide Caption 15 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches P is for Patek Philippe \u2013 Founded in 1851, the name has, since its inception, been synonymous with the very highest level of finesse. Patek Philippe's watches are beautifully crafted, often mechanically innovative and, just as importantly, they're some of the most collectible and valuable watches on the planet. Want proof? Patek Philippe watches routinely break and set records. The highest price ever paid at auction was by an anonymous collector who, in 2015, paid $24.4 million for an ultra-complex pocket watch made in the 1930s for American banker Henry Graves. Hide Caption 16 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches Q is for Quartz \u2013 Though they're commonplace nowadays, quartz watches were not only the very hottest thing in watchmaking, but also coveted luxury items when they were first released. The very first quartz watch ever was Seiko's Astron, which went on sale in Japan on Christmas, 1969, and cost as much as a new car. Mass production and lowered manufacturing costs meant that eventually anyone could have chronometer accuracy on their wrist. Many thought the so-called "Quartz Crisis" would kill off mechanical watches completely, but today, fine mechanical and durable, dependable watches, like Casio's famous G-Shock, happily coexist in the marketplace.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 17 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches R is for Rolex \u2013 People who've never heard of any other watch company have heard of Rolex. And for good reason: no company has been so successful at insinuating itself into the public mind as this Swiss watch brand. Rolexes have been seen on innumerable wrists in the movies, starting with Sean Connery's Bond. The classic novice's goof is to think of Rolex as all show and no go, but real horological insiders know that Rolex's movements are some of the most accurate, robust and reliable on the planet. Hide Caption 18 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches S is for Silicon \u2013 Lighter than steel and, critically, non-magnetic, silicon has a huge advantage over traditional alloys. Silicon is part of what's behind the resistance to magnetism of Omega watches, and you might be surprised to hear that Patek Philippe, a company that's identified with doing things the old-fashioned way, has embraced silicon technology for moving parts in many of its watches as well. Hide Caption 19 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches T is for Timex \u2013 Timex is an older company than most might imagine. It was originally founded in 1854 as the Waterbury Watch Company and, in one form or another, has been around ever since. Timex was one of the first brands to make inexpensive watches accessible to the masses. The brand continues that tradition today. Their biggest hit in advertising was a series of TV ads in which they would do spectacular torture tests -- involving things like jackhammers, paint mixers, and outboard motors -- and then show the watch running unscathed, with the world-famous tagline: "Takes a licking and keeps on ticking." Hide Caption 20 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches U is for UTC \u2013 These watches have an extra hour hand that shows the time in a different time zone. Typically, the main hour hand can be reset, independently of the other hands, in one-hour increments as you cross time zones while traveling, so it always shows the correct local time. A second hour hand, pegged to a 24-hour scale, shows home time, so at a glance you can see the time where you are, and the time at home. The classic model is the Rolex GMT Master, originally produced by the company for Pan Am pilots to help fight jet lag. Hide Caption 21 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches V is for Vintage Watch Collecting \u2013 Vintage watch collectors are incredibly varied in terms of what catches their eye, and focuses can be narrow and intense. Some people, for instance, collect only vintage Rolex Submariners with rare or unusual dials. You need deep pockets if you're one of them: vintage Rolex, like vintage Patek, have skyrocketed in price in the last decade, with some vintage Omega models, like the Speedmaster, not far behind. But buyer beware: the incredible prices some vintage watches routinely hit at auction have made creating fakes a lucrative business.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 22 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches W is World Time Watch \u2013 A ring on the dial, showing the names of major cities in each time zone, has inside it a 24-hour disc that rotates once a day. Whichever hour is lined up with a given city is the current time in that city. A practical and beautiful complication, its only drawbacks are that it can't compensate for Daylight Savings time, and that some time zones are not a whole hour apart. However, some modern manufacturers have created world time watches that show the time even in those oddball time zones -- a beautiful, if pricey, example is the Traditionnelle World Time wristwatch from Vacheron Constantin.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 23 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches X is for Xtremely Tough \u2013 The inventor of G-Shock is Casio engineer Kikuo Ibe, whose beloved mechanical watch broke accidentally. He then vowed to make a watch that was unbreakable. The first G-Shocks came out in the mid-1980s and they were tough alright. Ibe famously tested prototypes by throwing them out of the fourth-floor men's room window at Casio's research laboratory, into the parking lot below. Hide Caption 24 of 26\u000a\u000aPhotos: The A to Z of watches Y is for Year \u2013 The challenge is that there aren't a whole number of days in a year. Instead, it's about 365 and a quarter days to make one trip around the Sun -- which is why months are different lengths, and why February has a day added once every four years to keep the calendar in sync with the seasons. The watchmaker's solution is a type of watch called a perpetual calendar. Such watches contain a tiny mechanical computer that automatically detects the correct length of each month, and always displays the correct date -- even at the end of February in a leap year. These watches are traditionally very expensive, but a major trend nowadays is creating more affordable perpetual calendar watches, like the Montblanc Meisterstück Heritage Perpetual Calendar, which starts at less than $10,000.

aVStory highlights Johan Bavman photographed fathers in Sweden, which has generous parental leave\u000a\u000aSweden's policies encourage fathers to take just as much leave as mothers\u000a\u000a(CNN) When photographer Johan Bavman became a father for the first time, he took more than a passing wonder about how his native Sweden is said to be the most generous nation on Earth for parental leave.\u000a\u000aHe immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over, you might say.\u000a\u000aHe used his photography to document the real-life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of Sweden's extraordinary program, which allows mothers and fathers to take long, long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns.\u000a\u000aGet this: Sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave, with 390 of them paid at 80% of income, with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $3,474. The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day, or $22.\u000a\u000aBut there's a catch. Fathers have to share that leave with mothers.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVThe 19-year-old was the darling of the Games, winning four gymnastics gold medals and dazzling the watching world with her skill and sunny temperament.\u000a\u000aHer excellence proved the early pinnacle of a journey that presented Biles with formidable obstacles, not only in terms of her early family life, but also her own body image.\u000a\u000aIt can be a touchstone issue for teenage girls in the sport, their muscular physiques marking them out as different to their peers, and Biles says she was teased at school, mostly by the boys.\u000a\u000a"I think in the gymnastics world, it is your body figure because you get a little bit shy about your body because you are very muscular," Biles told CNN when asked what was the biggest personal challenge she has had to overcome.\u000a\u000a"But we wouldn't be able to do the things or achieve the things we did without our bodies so we're very grateful for them."\u000a\u000aIf her tumble skills look effortless, Biles' ability to shrug off taunts about her body shape only came through some painful experiences.\u000a\u000aIn a 2016 interview with CNN, Biles explained: "Going to public school nobody really had a body build that I did, and I was a girl, so the guys would sometimes make fun of me.\u000a\u000a"I think they were just jealous because they didn't have the muscle definition I did. I would try to hide my muscles, not show them, and I would always wear a jacket."\u000a\u000aIt's just another strand of the intense scrutiny Biles has been under since her Olympic success.\u000a\u000aAfter taking gold in the all-around, vault, floor and team competitions, as well as winning bronze in the beam, the conversation around her looks intensified, leading to negative comments on social media.\u000a\u000aIt prompted her to hit back at her accusers: "You all can judge my body all you want, but at the end of the day it's MY body. I love it & I'm comfortable in my skin."\u000a\u000aTwo of Biles' gold medal-winning teammates from Rio have encountered similar problems.\u000a\u000aGabby Douglas, a gold medal-winning teammate of Biles, suffered at the hands of online trolls and Aly Raisman has described as "completely normal" her feelings of insecurity relating to her body.\u000a\u000aIf Biles encounters any element of insecurity relating to her ability, recalling that brilliance in Brazil should help.\u000a\u000aNever before had a woman from the US won four gold medals at a single Olympics, and her complete haul of five medals in Rio cemented her status as America's most decorated gymnast.\u000a\u000aEarly troubles\u000a\u000aBiles' difficult upbringing has been well documented, but key to her success has been positive role models within her extended family.\u000a\u000aShe was placed in foster care aged just three due to her mother Shanon's ongoing battle with drug and alcohol addiction.\u000a\u000aIn 2003, Biles and her sister Adria were adopted by her grandparents, Ron and Nellie Biles and moved to live with them in Spring, Texas, while her two brothers moved in with Ron's sister.\u000a\u000aThe grandparents' influence was pivotal in Biles' early life and she credits her adoptive mom and dad as being one of her biggest inspirations.\u000a\u000a"Outside of gymnastics it was my parents because they're such good role models," she said.\u000a\u000a"They've never steered us wrong and they've always let us choose what we've wanted to do and they would just help us guide that the best way they could.\u000a\u000a"And then in gymnastics either the 2008 or 2012 Olympic Team because we wanted to be just like them."\u000a\u000aHer journey to gold was down to a field trip visit to a gymnastics studio in Houston as a schoolgirl.\u000a\u000aBiles returned home with a note suggesting she be enrolled into a class such was her natural aptitude for the sport.\u000a\u000aBy the time she was 13, it was decided that home schooling would be the best to fit around her training regime, which was upped to 32 hours a week.\u000a\u000aHer promise was clear for all to see but after a wobbly performance at an event in 2013, the family enlisted the help of a sports psychologist to help her with big-event nerves.\u000a\u000aThe rest is history. So what has had the biggest impact on her career?\u000a\u000a"I think it's not just one person," she said. "I think it takes a whole team that impacts my whole entire gymnastics career.\u000a\u000a"It really does take an army to get you where you are.

It's to stop being so stubborn because I was a very stubborn kid," she laughed. "Very crazy too! I think it kind of halted a bit of stuff but I think it turned out for the best."\u000a\u000aShe has quickly become a role model for a legion of young people, especially young women, not only for her prowess but also for her poise and personality.\u000a\u000aSo what advice would she give those who look up to her?\u000a\u000a"Just to never give up and to write down your goals and to always wake up in the morning with something you love to do and that you have a passion for," she said.

aVOn a special edition of Amanpour, former New York governor Eliot Spitzer joined Christiane Amanpour to discuss the aftermath and the coordinated federal and state disaster response in the wake of the destructive North American "superstorm," Hurricane Sandy. Spitzer says that politicians of both parties, on state and federal levels, have not made investments in long-term improvements in critical infrastructure that are necessary, but very expensive, in order to minimize the impact of a strong storm to the low lying coastal areas of the United States.

aVDaniel Keating is a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and author of " Born Anxious: The Lifelong Impact of Early Life Adversity -- and How to Break the Cycle ," due to be published in April from St. Martin's Press. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) There are new clues that the high levels of stress many people endure every day are taking a deadly toll.\u000a\u000aWhite, working-class Americans are dying in middle age at a rapidly increasing pace, reversing a long-standing trend toward greater life expectancy across all races and social classes, according to a new report from economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton.\u000a\u000aMuch of this alarming trend comes from "deaths of despair," especially opioid addictions and overdoses, suicide, and alcohol-related diseases. To stem this epidemic, they argue that we need to understand the underlying reasons why this is happening. Case and Deaton make a plausible case that "slow moving and cumulative" social forces -- lack of labor market opportunities and fraying of the accustomed social fabric -- are key explanations. They reject arguments that attribute this trend to income alone or to a decline in virtue.\u000a\u000aBut an even more basic cause lies hidden at the intersection of psychology and biology -- a widespread stress epidemic that is affecting this group dramatically at the present but threatens all of us unless we soon understand the source of this trend and take steps to address it.\u000a\u000aStress-related disorders and diseases have been on the rise in the whole population for decades, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including those leading to these deaths of despair, but also to heart disease obesity , and diabetes\u000a\u000aNational surveys by the American Psychological Association that also capture how stressed, anxious and overwhelmed we feel show a similar increasing pattern. And it shows up in our bodies, even before we get sick or start down the many roads to self-harm.\u000a\u000aA recent study by the Hamilton Project looked at the "physiological stress load" in the US using biological markers tied to cardiovascular, kidney and liver function to create a stress load index. This physical stress load, a precursor to many diseases, has increased in striking fashion since the late 1970s, and it is getting worse as each new age group enters adulthood.\u000a\u000aWe should see this increase in mortality for what it is -- a leading indicator of what could be in store for many of us. What social forces are producing the broader stress epidemic, and how do they "get under the skin" to cause long-term damage? One major clue comes from a closer look at the stress load index.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED White working class says Christian values under attack Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White working class says Christian values under attack 03:42\u000a\u000aIt has increased for everyone, but with marked inequality -- it has risen more sharply for those with fewer social and economic resources but also more for the middle class compared to the well off. There is a clear line that connects increasing inequality in income and opportunities, to increases in stress and mortality that hits some groups earlier than others.\u000a\u000aA central biological pathway is from excess cortisol -- the fight-or-flight hormone -- that characterizes being over-stressed for long periods of time. This "stress dysregulation" leads to risky health decisions, like addiction or overeating, and directly to many health problems linked to excess cortisol.\u000a\u000aWhy are white, working-class Americans showing the earliest effects? Surely African-Americans and Hispanics have been experiencing inequality at equal or higher levels over these same decades. The key lies in different starting points in perceptions of control -- stress is largely a psychosocial phenomenon, though, of course, material deprivation also plays a role.\u000a\u000aMinorities have gained some ground materially, in relative terms, over recent decades, but they also did not start with an assumption of being in control in the wider society. Losing a sense of control that you believed you had, whether real or not, justified or not, creates stressful dislocations.\u000a\u000aWe have seen this pattern before. In the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the group that saw itself as having substantial control -- middle-aged Russian men in particular -- experienced a similar loss of control, economically and in terms of cultural identity as the "socialist vanguard." They also died younger, suffering dramatic increases in early mortality\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Type 2 diabetes hitting a younger generation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Type 2 diabetes hitting a younger generation 02:33\u000a\u000aIf we understand what is actually happening -- socially, psychologically and biologically -- we can see that this effect is not going to be limited to just one group in the future. My colleagues and I have reported a pattern of increasing inequality being tied to worsening population outcomes -- not for mortality, but for the health, achievement and social engagement of adolescents in rich Western countries. But what we also found was that this was not inevitable.\u000a\u000aCountries (Austria, Denmark, France, Sweden and others) that controlled income inequality and maintained investments in human development -- such as early childhood and parenting support, education, and social safety nets in health care and unemployment -- did not experience these increasing problems in adolescent and youth development.\u000a\u000aSlow-moving and cumulative social forces "get under the skin" early in life and can show up decades later in morbidity and mortality. The risk is magnified in light of very recent research showing that high levels of stress experienced by expectant mothers or by babies can make fundamental biological changes in infancy -- through what are known as epigenetic changes , which alter how genes work -- that can endure over a lifetime.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThis burden of stress dysregulation in young Americans from early life adversity amplifies the stress epidemic by making more of us vulnerable, and by increasing the total amount of ambient stress we all experience everyday in our schools, our workplaces, our social media, on our highways, in our malls -- in effect, throughout our communities.\u000a\u000aIncreasing inequality and decreasing investment in human development place all of us at risk -- a stressful recognition itself in the current political environment where there is the potential for going even further in the risky direction. Resisting these trends is essential to health, because the consequences will show up for all of us for decades to come.

aVFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It's too bad Superman is not running for president of the United States; this would have been his year. Americans, as we have discovered, are angry, frustrated, disillusioned -- and yearning for a savior.\u000a\u000aThis happened before, almost a century ago in Europe. It was a time of despair; a time when the old models didn't seem to be working, when the world was changing in confusing ways, and hyperconfident individuals proposed a way out by blaming scapegoats and promising exciting, almost miraculous change. The results proved catastrophic.\u000a\u000aNo, America is not 1930s Germany, not by a long shot. But the images of Europe after World War I keep coming to mind. The parallels are not precise, but we hear the echoes, see the shadows. We should heed the warnings.\u000a\u000aWho would have thought that in the 21st century, American voters would be seriously considering as presidential candidates a neofascist and a neosocialist -- throwbacks to the old, failed utopias? Talk about fashionably retro!\u000a\u000aLooking at Donald Trump stoking his supporters into a frenzy, attacking "them" -- whoever "they" happen to be at the moment -- vowing to return American to greatness and then flashing his self-satisfied smile, the mind harks back to those grainy newsreel images of Benito Mussolini , the theatrical Italian "Duce," the leader, who became the central figure of fascist Italy a century ago.\u000a\u000aIs Trump a fascist? No, not quite. In fact, Trump doesn't propose anything close to a coherent ideology. He's a Trumpist. And we're only learning what that means, along with him, as he makes it up.\u000a\u000aFascists viewed the nation as an organism superseding the needs of the individual. That does not match Trump's rhetoric. But fascists also ridiculed and suppressed the opposition, and they embraced a level of authoritarianism that we can only hope Trump would reject. But who knows?\u000a\u000aCult of personality\u000a\u000aOne distinct similarity between Trump and the populist politicians of the 1930s is his ability to create and draw power from a cult of personality. The Republican front-runner's main campaign platform is that he will make everything OK. Trump will fix it. Trump will make America great again. How? That's not clear. He will do it by the power of his Trumpness. And we know it will work because look at him; look at how successful he is. Look how strong and fearless he is. There's very little in the way of substance. There's just a lot of Trump.\u000a\u000aAnd to prove how much America needs him, he reminds voters that America is in deep, deep trouble. He hints at nefarious conspiracies; he highlights every problem and every threat, making it sound as ominous as possible. And then he vows to tackle it without mercy, even if it means committing war crimes, violating the Constitution , and expelling millions of people from the country. That, incidentally, would create the digital color version of those 1930s deportations : armed U.S. security forces (very armed) leading frightened people to the trains. (Or would he make them walk across the border?)\u000a\u000aCharisma is a dangerous power in the wrong hands. When combined with popular discontent and disorienting change it can make a travesty of democracy and it can disfigure a society.\u000a\u000aValidating prejudices\u000a\u000aTrump has an uncanny ability to bring out the worst instincts in people. He validates the prejudices that people try to erase from their hearts. Trump seems alarmingly reluctant to distance himself from support from the KKK. Instead of debating ideas and policies, Trump insults and mocks people. He routinely appears to advocate violence against protesters, another disturbing throwback to the 1930s, and he draws a sharp distinction between "us" and "them."\u000a\u000aWe don't know what kind of a president he would be. It's hard to imagine he would continue to speak of punching people in the face, or that he would continue to mock people with disabilities, or follow through with any of his illegal or nonsensical proposals as a head of state. But there's no telling. He has already defied all predictions.\u000a\u000aIn a new turn of events since Thursday's GOP debate, Trump's opponents, who had seemed intimidated by Trump's savaging of Jeb Bush, have finally decided to take him on. It's good to see them challenging his empty offerings, but it's unsettling to see Sen. Marco Rubio also resorting to personality-driven attacks, eliciting uproarious laughter from his supporters. Despite the laughs, it's a sad sight.\u000a\u000aSanders found a scapegoat\u000a\u000aThen there's the other end of the political spectrum: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the longtime Independent socialist politician now running as a Democrat.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlight Photos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlight U.S. Sen.

But in the spirit of his socialist convictions, he too has found a scapegoat for all that ails America. Sanders would squeeze the rich, for whom he does not hide his contempt. In the manner of a demagogue, he declared , "Fraud is the business model of Wall Street."\u000a\u000aSanders proposes social programs containing the seed of potentially useful ideas, and he undoubtedly points to very real flaws in the system. But his overall approach, if it could ever be implemented, has the makings of an economic disaster . We know that because it was already tried.\u000a\u000aHillary Clinton's overwhelming victory in South Carolina may mark the beginning of the end for the Sanders movement, perhaps a sign that voters know Sanders' idealistic offerings, no matter how appealing, are disconnected from what is possible.\u000a\u000aHis plans would create deficits so large that there are not enough zeroes in calculator displays to hold them. His plans would produce deficits of between $18 trillion to $30 trillion (with a T) from new spending. You can squeeze the Wall Street billionaires as hard as you want. Even they don't have that much money. And while you're at it, see what happens to the economy if you impose the taxes required to even start those programs.\u000a\u000aSanders running honorable but mistaken campaign\u000a\u000aBoth Trump and Sanders are advocating granting much greater powers to the government. To be sure, Sanders appears to be aiming to force discussion of important issues in the campaign, and, unlike Trump, has run an honorable, throughtful and respectful campaign.\u000a\u000aTrump would apparently expand government to secure the country from enemies and from immigrants. Sanders would do it to pay for social plans. Both positions carry a faint whiff of Nirvana, telling voters who feel unsettled -- by growing inequality, expensive unwon wars, and a sense that America is starting to fall behind -- that they have an answer to repair the country, to make them feel safe.\u000a\u000aAgain, this is not Europe in the 1930s, but the European experience carries a warning: Beware of politicians offering easy fixes. Rousing speeches are no guarantee of a better future.

aV(CNN) Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE , was found in 99% of deceased NFL players' brains that were donated to scientific research , according to a study published Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA .\u000a\u000aThe neurodegenerative brain disease can be found in individuals who have been exposed to repeated head trauma. The disease is pathologically marked by a buildup of abnormal tau protein in the brain that can disable neuropathways and lead to a variety of clinical symptoms. These include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, anxiety, impulse control issues and sometimes suicidal behavior.\u000a\u000aIt can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, and most cases, although not all, have been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football.\u000a\u000a"There's no question that there's a problem in football. That people who play football are at risk for this disease," said Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University's CTE Center and coauthor of the new study. "And we urgently need to find answers for not just football players, but veterans and other individuals exposed to head trauma."\u000a\u000aThe JAMA study is the largest of its kind and all of those studied were required to have football as their primary exposure to head trauma. The criteria for submitting a brain was based on exposure to repetitive head trauma, regardless of whether that individual exhibited symptoms during their lifetime.\u000a\u000aThe study points out potential bias because relatives of these players may have submitted their brains due to clinical symptoms they noticed while they were living. It also acknowledges the lack of a comparison group that represents all individuals exposed to college-level or professional football. Without that, the study lacks an overall estimate on the risk of participation in football and its effects on the brain.\u000a\u000aKevin Turner, Out of 202 deceased former football players total -- a combination of high school, college and professional players -- CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177, the study said. The disease was identified in 110 out of 111 former NFL players. It was also found in three of the 14 high school players and 48 of the 53 college players. The study included brains of individuals who have been publicly confirmed to have had the disease, including Ken Stabler Bubba Smith and Dave Duerson\u000a\u000a"The medical and scientific communities will benefit from this publication and the NFL will continue to work with a wide range of experts to improve the health of current and former NFL athletes," the NFL told CNN in a statement, noting that "there are still many unanswered questions relating to the cause, incidence and prevalence of long-term effects of head trauma such as CTE."\u000a\u000aIn 2016, the NFL publicly acknowledged for the first time a connection between football and CTE . In June 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players, providing up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma.\u000a\u000a"The NFL is committed to supporting scientific research into CTE and advancing progress in the prevention and treatment of head injuries," the NFL statement on the study said. "In 2016, the NFL pledged $100 million in support for independent medical research and engineering advancements in neuroscience related topics. This is in addition to the $100 million that the NFL and its partners are already spending on medical and neuroscience research."\u000a\u000aQuestions raised\u000a\u000aThe study examined both the brain pathology -- which is the behavior of the disease in the brain -- and clinical history of every participant. It identified four stages of pathological CTE severity among the brains, based on amounts of tau buildup and distribution. Stages one and two are considered to be mild and stages three and four are considered severe.\u000a\u000aIndividuals who were reported to have experienced more behavioral mood symptoms during their lifetime were more likely to have findings indicative of mild disease as opposed to severe. These symptoms occurred in 96% of mild cases and 89% of severe cases. People with a mild build up and distribution of tau were also more likely to have died by suicide. Those with a more severe build up, on the other hand, were more likely to have experienced cognitive symptoms, such as memory loss.\u000a\u000aThe behavioral and mood symptoms in people with mild disease evidence may be the result of other influences, such as neuroinflammation or axonal injury, which is an injury to the brain cells, McKee said. The question of pathology's relationship to clinical symptoms is one they're hoping to answer in future studies, she said.\u000a\u000aDr. Jeffrey Kutcher, national director of the Sports Neurology Clinic at the Core Institute, who was not involved in the study, agreed with the need to further understand this relationship.\u000a\u000a"Just because we are describing the same CTE pathology, the collection of tau and the distribution that's consistent with CTE, that doesn't mean it's the only pathological process," Kutcher said. "There could be others that we are yet to identify. So I think its important that we don't just focus on one pathology, and that we start looking for others."\u000a\u000aSeeking help\u000a\u000aStudies like this have the potential to create a powerful narrative for football players who read them, but may not have a full understanding of the science or the bias in the sample, Kutcher said. This could lead players to believe that they are damaged and that there is no use in seeking help, he said.\u000a\u000a"To me, that is one of the biggest issues we have right now," Kutcher said. "Not emphasizing that people should seek treatment for their problems."\u000a\u000aAlthough the disease cannot be formally diagnosed until after death, many of the symptoms of CTE that may be experienced during a lifetime, such as depression or anxiety, are treatable, Kutcher said. That is why its important for someone experiencing these symptoms to access a comprehensive evaluation by a neurologist, and work with them to figure out a treatment plan.\u000a\u000aKutcher said its also important to consider that the brains examined in the study came from players who played decades ago. Most of the participants with CTE played football during the 1950s, '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s, McKee said, with the rest having played in the 2000s and 2010s.\u000a\u000aThe experiences of the majority were different from those who play the sport today, Kutcher said, and there was not the same awareness, medical protocols or equipment to prevent brain injuries.\u000a\u000a"My rule as a physician, as a neurologist, is to protect and promote the brain health of my patients over the course of a lifetime, no question about that.

aV(CNN) She's faced death threats, violence and depression, but the former captain of Afghanistan's women's football team Khalida Popal refuses to be silenced.\u000a\u000a"There are so many women who can't get out of Afghanistan and die," Popal told CNN during a recent visit to London, where she attended the Beyond Sports awards. "I have a voice -- I feel a responsibility to those who can't speak out."\u000a\u000aThe 29-year-old Popal was hounded out of Afghanistan by those who believed women had no right to kick a ball around a field and assaulted by angry gangs. In the end it got too much for her and she made a daring underground escape to the safety of Europe.\u000a\u000aPopal can speak freely now -- those who wanted her dead because she dared to promote women's football and would not be cowed still remain -- but at least they are now thousands of miles away.\u000a\u000aAnd in the safe haven of Denmark, and with her parents having been granted asylum to join her, Popal's world is a very different place.\u000a\u000aNever did she think that just kicking a ball around a school yard with a friend would lead to such upheaval -- nor provide the opportunities which have enriched her life.\u000a\u000aFootball has brought a new sense of freedom to the women of Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aGame time\u000a\u000aIn 2004, at the age of 16, Popal began playing football at a time when the Taliban had banned women from participating in sports or attending stadiums -- the local football arena had also been used for public executions.\u000a\u000aSo, in the shadow of the school, the girls found a secluded yard with high walls in which they could practice -- though Popal says they had to make sure not to make a sound in case of discovery.\u000a\u000aThe Afghan women's national football team played a friendly against the local NATO force.\u000a\u000aSlowly but surely, more girls began to join in, finding solace and escapism in the sport even while prying eyes continued to disapprove.\u000a\u000aEmboldened, the girls then took to the field, a move which led to stones being thrown and full out assaults, says Popal.\u000a\u000aSo taken with the girls' plight, the local NATO base allowed them to train on its field -- as long as they vacated it whenever a helicopter came in to land.\u000a\u000aThe NATO women's team even played a friendly against the Afghan national side to show their support.\u000a\u000aThe US is approaching the 15th anniversary of its war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. It's the longest foreign conflict in US history, with little sign that the NATO allies can disentangle themselves from the country's continuing problems.\u000a\u000aAfghanistan's women's national football team members take a break from training as a US Black Hawk helicopter lands.\u000a\u000aLiving underground\u000a\u000aAmid the conflict and as the profile of women's football grew, Popal, by now captain of the national team, continued to speak out, and her critics began to take more threatening action.\u000a\u000a"I had to leave Afghanistan -- it wasn't safe for me," she said. "I had death threats -- I felt in danger and insecure."\u000a\u000aIt was April 2010 that she began the mission to leave Kabul, the capital, by stealth.\u000a\u000aAfghan women practising on the NATO field.\u000a\u000a"I'll never forget that day. It all happened so quickly. I had to leave everything and save my life. I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my own family, or my teammates. I didn't get the chance to tell them to stay strong.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to tell them I am not giving up but was going away to become stronger -- and come back stronger."\u000a\u000aFor two months she lived underground, slowly working her way towards the border with Pakistan and onto India. Popal says her escape involved people risking their lives to help her leave Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aWhile in India she applied for asylum in Denmark with the help of sports kit manufacturer Hummel, which had made the uniform for the Afghan women's team.\u000a\u000aThrough her work with Hummel she was able to reach Denmark, though Europe was to provide Popal with equally testing challenges.\u000a\u000aDepression\u000a\u000aEnsconced in an asylum center, Popal's journey began to catch up with her. Alone, without family or friends, she found herself struggling to deal with her new surroundings.\u000a\u000a"It was the worst period of my life," Popal said. "When I escaped I left everything behind and had no idea where I would end up. I didn't know about how the asylum center worked -- it was so hard."\u000a\u000aDepression set in -- she remembers feeling "sick" and wondering about her fate. Many of those who had arrived at the center some months before her had yet to find out about their future.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Lionel Messi's biggest fan?

aV(CNN) Boniface Mwangi is Kenya's most famous provocateur; a poverty-boy done bad -- at least in the eyes of the political elite.\u000a\u000aHe's upset the establishment in nearly every way thinkable. He was arrested for letting pigs loose in front of parliament to highlight the greed of politicians and claimed that President Uhuru Kenyatta is an alcoholic, to name a few.\u000a\u000aMwangi has spent the last decade ridiculing parliament and now -- not content with leading protests from the sidelines -- he wants to join it. On August 8 he will contest the Starehe constituency in Nairobi.\u000a\u000aRecent elections around the world have given rise to anti-establishment candidates. Will Mwangi be next?\u000a\u000aHis newly created political party, Ukweli , which means truth, is standing on an anti-corruption platform and looking to encourage active participation in politics.\u000a\u000aMwangi faces an uphill battle to win the seat. It's held by incumbent President Kenyatta's Jubilee Alliance who this year are fielding Charles Njagua Kanyi , known as "Jaguar", a well-known pop singer. The opposition party's MP aspirant is businessman Steve Mbogo\u000a\u000aWho is Boniface Mwangi?\u000a\u000aMwangi grew up in Pangani, a suburb in Nairobi, with his mother who he helped sell books on the street. After getting kicked out of school and failing to graduate he eventually took up photography -- and found he had an eye for it.\u000a\u000aIn 1998, Mwangi's received his first commission for photos of the bombed-out United States Embassy in Nairobi.\u000a\u000aBut it was in 2007 that Mwangi was thrust into the world's spotlight.\u000a\u000aHis images of Kenya's post-election violence -- in which over 1,200 people were killed -- spoke to a reeling nation and revealed the crisis to the world. Afterwards, he traveled the country with a public exhibition of his photography, "Pitchamtaani," to encourage reconciliation and healing after the violence.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Photographer's view on the Kenyan vote Replay More Videos ...

Mwangi used PAWA254 as a vehicle to organise and protest. Their hub in central Nairobi was their action base.\u000a\u000aMwangi's protests are theatrical and disruptive. He's led donkeys down the streets in Nairobi to symbolize the nation's fatigue with politics, and littered the roads with polystyrene babies to call-out the immaturity of Kenya's politicians.\u000a\u000aMwangi's electoral chances\u000a\u000aIn Kenya the two main alliances, The Jubilee Alliance which supports incumbent President Kenyatta, and the opposition coalition, the National Super Alliance, dominate the political landscape.\u000a\u000aThese two alliances are deeply-rooted in the public's minds. This means a start-up political party, like Ukweli, has the extra challenge of introducing itself to an electorate well-versed and conscious of longstanding organizations with established party machines and financial backing.\u000a\u000aKenyan politics is also still largely divided along tribal lines, with groups aligned to various mainstream parties.

The opinions expressed here are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) A vocal minority of Asian-Americans are c ollaborating with white conservative advocates to tear down affirmative action, perceiving it as a hindrance to greater Asian-American admission into colleges. And they're being recruited as the plaintiffs of choice for conservative lawsuits against elite educational institutions like Harvard.\u000a\u000aStrange bedfellows, to be sure, given that Asian-Americans have made the greatest leftward political shift of any group of US voters in the last 25 years \u2014 going from just over 30% Democrat in 1992 to supporting President Obama's re-election by a staggering 73% in 2012. In 2016, 79% of Asian-American voters chose Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aBut with affirmative action, Asian-Americans appear to veer, relatively speaking, to the right.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, the National Asian American Survey found that 52% of Asian-American voters agreed that "affirmative action programs designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses" are a positive force in society. By contrast, a similarly phrased Gallup question found slightly higher support for affirmative action among white Americans (53%), and considerably more among African-Americans (77%) and Latinos (61%)\u000a\u000aConservative activists like Ed Blum and Ron Unz have spent two decades trying to use affirmative action as a wedge to split Asian-Americans from the coalition of voters of color who tend to vote Democratic.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Chokal-Ingam: Trump will end affirmative action Replay More Videos ...

This wave of immigrants saw educational access as a primary motivation to migrate, even if they themselves were often unable to make full use of the educational capital they brought with them because of racist prevailing attitudes.\u000a\u000aI have numerous friends whose parents went from respected positions in academia and government in their native lands to running dry cleaners and restaurants in the United States, which was still better than getting killed in a civil war or insurrection, of course. And my immigrant father had multiple advanced degrees and a sterling record as a physician, but was turned down repeatedly to run his department in favor of white doctors, some of whom he had trained. Hospital administrators explained to him that he was technically adept but "not leadership material."\u000a\u000aDespite these experiences with prejudice, our immigrant parents \u2014 and the millions of Asian immigrants who have arrived here since \u2014 see education as the key means by which their children, less linguistically and culturally isolated than they, might advance within American society. And some mistakenly believe that dismantling of affirmative action will remove barriers to elite educations.\u000a\u000aThis position ignores that affirmative action is one of a long series of socially transformative changes won by black activists to open doors for all nonwhite Americans \u2014 and it was paid for in blood and tears, life and limb.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Late night airs white discrimination PSA spoof Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Late night airs white discrimination PSA spoof 01:21\u000a\u000aIn June 1960, eight years before he was assassinated, Martin Luther King Jr. met secretly with the presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, urging him to make civil rights a key part of his agenda if elected. In March 1961, President Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, directing the government and its funding recipients to take "affirmative action" to ensure that employees and applicants were not discriminated against "because of race, creed, color, or national origin."\u000a\u000aThis order merely sought to stem the tide of active prejudice against Americans who were not white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. It did little to change private institutions. It would take years for legislation to begin to truly shift the racist current of American society \u2014 beginning with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and continuing with landmark laws like the Immigration and Nationalization Act of 1965.\u000a\u000aThe Civil Rights Act made nondiscriminatory practices the law of the land. The 1965 law eliminated the "nation of origin" quotas that artificially restricted nonwhite immigration to America. As Vice President Hubert Humphrey declared, "We have removed all elements of second-class citizenship from our laws by the Civil Rights Act. ... We must in 1965 remove all elements in our immigration law which suggest there are second-class people."\u000a\u000aBlack activism paved the way for these historic changes \u2014 but arguably, no other group has benefited more from them than Asian-Americans. If it weren't for the Civil Rights Act, it would be legal to not only bar us from whites-only education, but also from whites-only housing, employment and public facilities.

At the time of the 1978 Supreme Court decision in University of California vs. Bakke, which upheld the notion of racial diversity as a "compelling interest" in education, about 200,000 Asian-Americans were enrolled at all levels of higher education in the United States, or 2% of all university students. By 1988 \u2014 a few years after Berkeley and other University of California colleges determined that Asian-Americans were no longer "underrepresented" as a group relative to our population \u2014 there were nearly 500,000, or 4% of all university students (and over 35% of the U.C. system).\u000a\u000aWith that seed of opportunity planted, the numbers of Asian-Americans enrolled in US universities has continued to climb : By 1998, there were over 900,000 Asian-Americans enrolled in US universities. By 2008, that number grew to around 1.3 million enrollments.

Affirmative action ensured that that door was propped open wide enough for us to be represented in substantial numbers. And yet, now that many Asian-Americans \u2014 but far from all \u2014 no longer need it to be fairly represented on college campuses, nearly half of us are willing to see it go away.\u000a\u000aThis self-interested minority of our community would do well to remember that many of the same conservative activists who are looking to destroy affirmative action are also seeking to curb legal immigration to the United States, as seen in the horrific RAISE Act being backed by the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aThat's not just blind to history, it's dangerously shortsighted about the future. Because as soon as conservative attention shifts to issues in which their largely white constituents' interests lie elsewhere \u2014 say, for example, immigration \u2014 they'll move on, leaving our community in the lurch.\u000a\u000aAsian-Americans should know better than to sacrifice their relationship with a coalition that represents the America of tomorrow for a political one-night stand today.

aVNetflix just made a deal with the creative mind behind blockbuster movies including Captain America: Civil War and Logan.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, the streaming service announced its first-ever acquisition: Comic book publisher Millarworld.\u000a\u000aYou may not be familiar with Millarworld, but you've likely heard of founder Mark Millar's work. Before he created Millarworld, Millar wrote a number of comic books for Marvel including Old Man Logan and Civil War, which were brought to the silver screen as the blockbuster hits Logan and Captain America: Civil War. He also authored the comic book series Kick-Ass and Kingsman: The Secret Service, both of which have been turned into successful feature films.\u000a\u000aRelated: Netflix surges on strong subscriber growth\u000a\u000aIn a statement, Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) said that it will develop new films, series and shows with Millarworld, and will also draw on Millarworld's existing portfolio.\u000a\u000aNetflix's investment in original programming has paid off. Last month, the company said it added 5 million subscribers in the June quarter, bringing its total number of subscribers up to about 104 million worldwide.\u000a\u000aMore than 4 million of those new subscribers came from the international market, where movies like Captain America have been especially successful.\u000a\u000aRelated: 'Captain America: Civil War' nabs $200 million at overseas box office in days\u000a\u000aNetflix has plenty of experience bringing graphic novels to life. Back in 2013, the company landed a deal with Disney (DIS) to develop original Netflix series around Marvel TV characters Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil and Iron Fist.\u000a\u000aIt's not clear which of Millar's projects will be developed by Netflix. Millar said Kick-Ass and Kingsman are not part of the deal.\u000a\u000a-- Seth Fiegerman contributed reporting.

aVStory highlights Tammy Duckworth: In and out of uniform, I've always held a deep -- nonpartisan -- concern for the security of our country\u000a\u000aThat concern is why I am so appalled that our commander in chief refuses to recognize that Russia is working against us\u000a\u000aTammy Duckworth is a Democratic senator from Illinois. She is an Iraq War veteran, Purple Heart recipient, and former assistant secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs under the Obama administration. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When I enlisted in the United States Armed Forces in 1992, I swore an oath \u2014 the same oath members of my family dating back to the Revolution had sworn \u2014 to protect and defend our Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic and to "bear true faith and allegiance to the same." I also pledged to follow the orders of the officers appointed above me, as well as the President of the United States.\u000a\u000aTammy Duckworth\u000a\u000aIn 2004, I lost my legs fighting in a war with which I disagreed, and following orders from a President for whom I did not vote.\u000a\u000aThat oath, this country and its institutions meant more to me than any political party could, and they still do. It didn't matter who occupied the Oval Office.\u000a\u000aI retired from military service in 2014, but during my 23 years, I regularly trained and participated in exercises to keep our military prepared to fight at the Fulda Gap. That area in Germany is one of the avenues of approach that the former USSR would likely have used to launch a kinetic strike (a military strike involving lethal force) against the West. Nearly all Americans who've served in the last 50 years have taken part in similar exercises, because our military leaders \u2014 and commanders in chief from both political parties \u2014 recognized the threats posed to our country by the Soviet Union's, and later Russia's, expansionist desires.\u000a\u000aWhen I enlisted in the 1990s, our main security concerns with the USSR were the threat of ground invasion of our allies in Europe, and the threat their stockpile of nuclear weapons posed to our own nation. After the demise of the USSR and its Cold War ideological struggle with democratic nations, former KGB officer Vladimir Putin has shifted Russia's focus toward espionage, hacking and cracking, and destabilizing democracies to support the expansionist goals of their country, and personal profit for their leaders. The wolf may put on slightly different clothing, but it is still a wolf. Russia is not our friend.\u000a\u000aRead More

It's not going to change the balance of effort there, five guys, but it's just something we are - watch as we go forward. \u2026 I say presume, because you have to assume to worst case in a case like this. We can't have assumed to have changed their thinking in a time they were in our captivity, I mean, anymore than we would want an American who had been held by the enemy to change his thinking.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn having extended military operations in Afghanistan: \u201cI think it is just a recognition that we can get a balance. Most of the fighting on the ground is being done by Afghan police and military and they are bearing most the casualties. I think America brings some very specific capabilities to do precision operations with Afghan partners in many cases. But I think it goes back to confidence as well. Afghans will do well if they believe they have got the kind of strategic partnership that President Obama offered them in 2009 when he explicitly said, we will be your strategic partner. You can't put a number on that. It's not a specific number of Americans planes or boots on the ground. It's the sense that we are an absolutely committed friend that will help them protect their sovereignty.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn running for president of the United States: \u201cNo, Jim.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\u000a\u000aJIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOST: Welcome back. I am Jim Sciutto in Washington. General Stanley McChrystal is four star general and commander of American forces - coalition forces in Afghanistan. He was - he's credited with transforming the U.S. forces into the elite fighting force they are today. He is author of a new book "Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World." And it is certainly a very complex world.\u000a\u000aGeneral McChrystal, thanks very much for joining us. Had the pleasure of seeing you when you were commander in Afghanistan. You've been travelling around the country a little bit so it's nice to see you out of the uniform.\u000a\u000aGEN. STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, U.S. ARMY (RET.): It's great to be here. Thanks.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: I want to begin with the case of Bowe Bergdahl, Taliban Five because today that deal is expiring and we are still waiting here what the next step will be. But first I want to ask you about Sergeant Bergdahl.\u000a\u000aYou were commander when he was taken. Were you a deserter?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I've been in command for about a month and when he left his base we didn't know. We had reason to believe he walked off his base but he could have been a confused young man, and that may still be the ruling, I am not sure. So, we made every effort we could like we would for your son or daughter to try to recover him as fast as we could.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: Now, if it was discovered at the time, and I know that the questions - the details were certainly murky then and to some degree there are still questions today, but if he was a deserter, would that change at all U.S. efforts to rescue him?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: It's hard to make that kind of judgment because it would have been impossible to know at the moment if he was a deserter. We were trying to prevent him from being taken into Pakistan where we thought he would fall into the hands of Haqqani for two reasons. One, because he's an American citizen and one of ours, a comrade. And second, because he would then become a chip in the power gain there, and we were concerned about both of those.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: Do you have any concerns about the deal that was made a year ago to trade these five senior Taliban leaders for his freedom?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I think if you look going forward getting back an American soldier was important particularly until he is adjudicated it impossible to say what was the cause. So, it was important to get him back. I think now we've got to move forward. We got to decide what we deal with. The five that are back - presumably, they will go back to the battlefield but they won't change the dynamics. It's not going to change the balance of effort there, five guys, but it's just something we are - watch as we go forward.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: But that's an enormous concern. You say presumably they will go back to the fight, first of all that's an alarming assumption. And yes, there are a number of members of Taliban who won't change but they are quite senior in the organization. Would that not be a loss? Would that not put U.S. forces in danger there?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: I wouldn't make it too important. They were in captivity quite awhile. They're not going to go back, I think, to a key operational role. I say presume, because you have to assume to worst case in a case like this. We can't have assumed to have changed their thinking in a time they were in our captivity, I mean, anymore than we would want an American who had been held by the enemy to change his thinking. So, I think we have to presume that their bonds with their old organization are probably going to be pretty strong and just go from there.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: And if they do go back, that deal you still think was a good deal to gain his freedom?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: It's hard to make a judgment on a deal like that. It's an American soldier and so getting him back to me is a pretty sacred responsibility.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: I want to ask you about Iraq. The fight against ISIS is not going well. The map really immutable for the last several months despite a massive U.S.-led air campaign and a massive advantage among the Iraqi and Kurdish forces aligned against the forces of ISIS. You have been very public in saying you need U.S. forces - boots on the ground to fight this fight and win. Is that what is necessary to turn this around?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Well, what I have actually said is we first need a very clear strategy to deal with ISIS and to establish a framework for the region. Because if we don't have a direction of where we are going, where the instate will be, the just defeating ISIS will just be a sort of a meaningless act.\u000a\u000aSecond, we have got to recognize what ISIS is, and it's a phenomenon of the 21st century. It's based on some age-old ideas but as you and I both know is they are operating in a way that is disorienting to organizations of the region. They've got this incredible tactical ability to combine suicide bombers with pretty flexible tactics on the ground and this superb information warfare campaign. It's very decentralized. It makes us all worry about what they are doing.\u000a\u000aI think we are going to have to show leadership in the region. I think American presence and leadership is going to be critical to build a team of teams against ISIS.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: To demonstrate leadership do you have to commit American forces on the ground?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: I think you have got to demonstrate American revolve and leadership. In some cases it could be Americans on the ground with Iraqi forces helping leverage as you know one (INAUDIBLE) army in a difficult time like the Iraqi army is needs that feel of the cloth of comrades. And I think Americans can be a big part of that, but I don't think thousands and thousands of American forces on the ground to be ground forces (INAUDIBLE) would do that is probably the right move right now.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: So, you mean - and this is something that General Dempsey and others have raised, the idea of forward deployed advisers. So, in other words military advisers instead of back in the base, they are on the forward lines or forward ground controllers. Is that what you're talking about?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Yes, it is. Because war is about confidence.\u000a\u000aIf you know when the Iraqis pulled out of Ramadi, it was a military calculus, but in reality it was much more a loss of confidence. Sometimes just the presence of American advisers with their connection to air power and whatnot can bolster the confidence of leaders and provide additional advice as well.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: And confidence seems to be key because you here this - the words of Secretary Ash Carter saying, they didn't have the will to fight.\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Confidence is everything at every level. It starts having confidence in your leaders all the way up to your national leaders and then in yourselves. And I think that's something we could potentially help with.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: I want to ask you about Afghanistan because this was meant to be the year of the end of the U.S. Military presence in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aThe president has extended the smaller force that is there for a bit of a longer period of time. But the reporting on the ground is that those forces are doing more kinetic activity than the president had described. Initially he said, well, they will protect U.S. forces for its protection et cetera but there is evidence that they are doing offensive operations, going after Taliban leaders. Is this a stealth extension of the U.S. war in Afghanistan?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: I think it is just a recognition that we can get a balance.\u000a\u000aMost of the fighting on the ground is being done by Afghan police and military and they are bearing most the casualties. I think America brings some very specific capabilities to do precision operations with Afghan partners in many cases. But I think it goes back to confidence as well.\u000a\u000aAfghans will do well if they believe they have got the kind of strategic partnership that President Obama offered them in 2009 when he explicitly said, we will be your strategic partner. You can't put a number on that. It's not a specific number of Americans planes or boots on the ground. It's the sense that we are an absolutely committed friend that will help them protect their sovereignty.\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: But that sounds like a long commitment. And I'm harkening back a number of years.\u000a\u000aI remember you said to me when we were in Kabul, and this is a good five years ago, you made the comparison to U.S. troops in Germany and Korea, they of course been there for decades. That that kind of commitment is not unusual when you are facing an enemy, in this case like the Taliban. Are you saying that you need an American force presence in Afghanistan for years and years to come to give that confidence?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I think you make that calculus. I think both Japan and Germany turned out pretty well and they could have turned out very differently. And so, I think, that if you look in the long sweep, wars don't have a set beginning and set end. As you know, all the things you do that lead up to a war and of course more importantly after a war prevents the next one.\u000a\u000aSo I think, if we look at our policy as a long continuum, and not being in a hurry and say, we may have people there for a long time. But in reality it's cheaper than doing spasmodic moves of big forces into (INAUDIBLE).\u000a\u000aSCIUTTO: Finally, as you write this book about leadership, you have got a very strong reputation, of course, from your commands in Afghanistan. There are some who talk about you as a future political candidate. Do you plan or have any ideas or thoughts or ambitions to run for office?\u000a\u000aMCCHRYSTAL: No, Jim.

aVAmir Daftari, CNN \u2022 Updated 3rd August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Among the thousands of shops that line the labyrinthine alleyways of Tehran's Grand Bazaar sits the Haj Ali Darvish teahouse.\u000a\u000aIt's not the only teahouse in the bazaar, but having first opened in 1918, it's definitely one of the oldest. And according to some, it's also the smallest -- not just in the bazaar but in the whole world.\u000a\u000aFor those who find their way to this closet-sized, two-meter-wide cafe, owner Kazem Mabhutyan is on hand to serve up a wide range of teas and advice about their healing properties.\u000a\u000a"I've traveled abroad and tested different styles such as English, Turkish and Arabic, but nothing matches Persian-style tea," he tells CNN.\u000a\u000aCoffee and hot chocolate are on the menu, too.\u000a\u000aMabhutyan took over the business from his father, Haj Ali Mabhutyan, who bought the teahouse in 1962 from its original owner Haj Mohammad Hasan Shamshiri.\u000a\u000aBefore the 1979 Iranian revolution, the teahouse provided tea for many of the shops at the bazaar, Mabhutyan says. Since then, however, people working at the bazaar began to prepare tea themselves. But that hasn't stopped the shop from thriving.\u000a\u000aMabhutyan serves an increasing number of tourists. The number of foreign visitors traveling to Iran has boomed in recent years, rising from 2.2 million in 2009 to 5.2 million in 2016.\u000a\u000a"I ask all my customers to leave a message in the visitors' book, and everybody who drinks tea here for the first time is presented with a souvenir coin."\u000a\u000aMabhutyan is also a big believer in the marketing power of social media. He launched the Haj Ali Darvish Instagram account a couple of years ago.

aVWow, so it looks like we have a budget deal in Washington. A debt ceiling and spending crisis has been averted. It\u2019s good news. But let\u2019s all calm down. It\u2019s only temporary. The agreement does not address the long-term fiscal problems we have. Problems that were mostly created by none other than the \u201cbaby boomer\u201d generation. Yeah, you know who you are.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re tanned and healthy and living way past average life expectancy. You\u2019ve got a defined benefit pension plan from a large company or government that was created years ago when people didn\u2019t understand how horribly these plans can go wrong and now can\u2019t afford to meet its liabilities, but you don\u2019t care as long as you get your check which you don\u2019t really need anyway. And your social security check. And your Medicare reimbursement check. You once hated the government. You smoked pot and protested against Vietnam and President Nixon. That was a long, long time ago.\u000a\u000aLife has been good for you. You\u2019re a baby boomer. You were born between 1946 and the early 1960\u2019s. You had Woodstock and the Stones in the \u201960s, discos and coke in the \u201970s, Wall Street in the \u201980s, Bill Clinton in the \u201990s and now you\u2019re retiring to Arizona and Florida on the backs of your stressed-out kids whose own children stay at home with them into their 20s because they have no jobs. Tom Brokaw once wrote a book about the greatest generation, those brave people who survived the depression and fought in World War II. Unfortunately that great generation spawned a generation of narcissists: the baby boomers.\u000a\u000aThe boomers have created liabilities that will take generations to pay off. Our national debt is now at around $17 trillion, larger for the first time in recent history than the size of our entire economy. And it\u2019s projected to continue to significantly grow over the next few decades unless something dramatic is done to reduce it. Boomers don\u2019t like to talk about fiscal responsibility or living within their means. They like their credit cards and government secured mortgages on overvalued properties. They enjoy their malls and their cars and their houses and as long as someone\u2019s willing to lend them the money to buy this stuff they don\u2019t seem to care much about how it will be one day paid. They still represent an enormous voting block and have no intention to have this lifestyle threatened. This is the real reason Washington can\u2019t create a long-term deficit reduction plan. The boomers love their safety nets.\u000a\u000aThese safety nets were created over the past few decades by boomers and for boomers, with little regard to the future. One of the major reasons our national debt is so high is because 40 percent of our government\u2019s spending goes to some type of insurance: social insurance, retirement, health benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. These systems are bankrupt. But they\u2019re needed to pay for the boomers\u2019 healthcare and pension plans. People that were born after 1965 are working hard to make sure that the boomer generation gets their retirement and disability paid for by the government. But it\u2019s still not enough. So our government has to borrow and print money. And our debts balloon. Who will pay these debts? Ah, who cares says the boomers. Not my problem.\u000a\u000aThey are the source of one of the biggest problems with Obamacare. Whether you support the Affordable Care Act or not (and I think there are lots of great things about it), one undeniable fact is that the cost of this new system is being put squarely on the shoulders of the young. People in their 20s need less health care than the boomers in their 60s and 70s. This is not only because younger people today have healthier lifestyles but because many boomers spent most of their young lives smoking, drinking sugary sodas and engaging in risky, unprotected sex. There are 34 million mostly young and uninsured people who will be required on January 1, 2014, to pay for health insurance just so the boomers can take advantage of the added benefits that health insurance companies have to now legally provide.\u000a\u000aThey are, thank God, the last reminders of our racist, homophobic, sexist past. When you look at those \u201cwhite only\u201d diners and drinking fountains in those photos from the 1960s you just can\u2019t believe it. Or how women were treated. And gays. But many of our beloved boomers were teenagers back then, living with parents who watched Ozzie and Harriet and were raised to believe that people who weren\u2019t white weren\u2019t to be trusted, women were meant to stay at home, and gays were sinners. Over time, these attitudes have changed, mainly because people in their 20s and 30s are smarter, better educated and more open-minded. Unfortunately, and although we now have a black President, the last remnants of the boomer generation who still wield power in their churches and companies are doing their best to keep women out of the corporate suite, protest against gay marriage and fight immigration reform.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re scrambling to fix the environment because of their excesses. For years, and despite warnings, the boomers refused to recycle and ran companies that spewed ozone-destroying chemicals into the air. There are countless plots of land that are unusable because of chemicals and pesticides dumped by this generation. I\u2019m no environmentalist, but even I have to shake my head at the destruction laid upon the planet over the past 40 years alone: decimated forests, extinct species, smog filled skies, islands of plastic floating in the ocean. Only recently are steps being taken by younger generations to attempt to reverse this trend.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that the baby boomer generation is quickly getting older. Ten thousand boomers are retiring each day. We can\u2019t ship them all off to an island, unfortunately. But I\u2019m optimistic that the next generation of leaders will not make the same mistakes. Governments will take care of people who are truly needy \u2014 not just because they turned 65 and have a car payment \u2014 and this will help fix our deficit problems. Racism will continue to decline as the world becomes smaller and more social. Our environment will improve because kids in elementary school are being taught to care about the planet. Ultimately, these generations will fix the problems that the boomers created. And we can soon bid farewell to that horrible generation.\u000a\u000aFollow @GeneMarks on Twitter.

aV(CNN) There's a long list of reasons why Republicans' plan to overhaul the nation's tax system is going to be complicated this fall.\u000a\u000aActually, tax reform is always complicated. The last time it was signed into law was in 1986.\u000a\u000aFast-forward 31 years, and the conditions for smooth sailing on this issue haven't gotten any easier. In fact, there's a hashtag used by tax policy wonks, #TRIH, an acronym for "Tax reform is hard."\u000a\u000aSo far there is no bill with specifics on how exactly the White House and Republicans intend to accomplish tax reform. The White House released a one-page blueprint earlier this year , and it teamed up late last month with congressional leaders to release a broad set of principles.\u000a\u000aThe White House says it will be working behind the scenes during the August recess to get the House and Senate on the same page before a bill goes for a committee mark-up in September, with the ultimate goal to send a bill to the President's desk by mid-November.\u000a\u000aAnd Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week the goal was to finish tax reform "sometime this year."\u000a\u000aThat's an extremely fast timeline considering how complicated tax reform is and how partisan gridlock has already resulted in multiple stalemates this year, from nominations to health care.\u000a\u000aNot to mention, there's a host of other issues and deadlines that Congress will face this fall that have the potential to derail or at least delay tax reform.\u000a\u000aHere's a look at just a few.\u000a\u000aBudget\u000a\u000aMcConnell said last week that he plans to use reconciliation to pass tax reform, a method that would allow the Republicans, who hold a 52-48 majority, to advance the bill with 51 votes only, rather than the usual 60.\u000a\u000aThis strategy allows Republicans to pass a bill without any help from Democrats.\u000a\u000aBut to use reconciliation, Congress would first have to pass a budget for 2018. The Senate can use reconciliation only once per fiscal year, and Republicans already used it the 2017 fiscal year trying to pass health care.\u000a\u000aThe House has been busy debating a budget, but its Republican majority is seeing ideological splits between conservatives and moderates. While the House budget committee approved a budget last month, it didn't go to the floor before lawmakers left for the August recess.\u000a\u000aSo the issue is awaiting continued debate when they return in September, but it's unclear when exactly the House will pass the budget (though it faces a deadline of September 30, when the current fiscal year ends).\u000a\u000aAnd even after that, it still has to pass the Senate. Intra-party divides exist there, too.\u000a\u000aDebt ceiling\u000a\u000aAnother urgent matter for Congress when it returns will be a deadline at the end of the month to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default . That issue will undoubtedly take up time from key players in the tax reform debate -- like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and congressional leaders heavily involved in fiscal matters.\u000a\u000a(That deadline, however, is just Mnuchin's best estimate as to when Treasury will face a cash crunch, meaning it won't have enough cash and revenue on hand to pay all the country's bills in full and on time. The actual date could turn out to be somewhat earlier or later, since revenue inflows and outflows aren't entirely predictable.)\u000a\u000aA week before recess, Mnuchin was on Capitol Hill to work with Senate leaders toward an agreement, but nothing was announced before lawmakers left town.\u000a\u000aDebt ceiling showdowns in the past have evolved into bitter fights over spending. Mnuchin is currently pushing for a "clean" debt ceiling hike -- meaning an agreement to raise the debt limit without any extra conditions attached.\u000a\u000aBut Republicans, especially fiscal conservatives, want to see spending cuts to go along with any debt increase. Getting enough Democrats on board for that could prove tricky, since those spending cuts are often proposed for massive programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which have large and vocal activist groups that mobilize to fight such fights -- as they did in the health care debate.\u000a\u000aHealth care\u000a\u000aWhile the House passed a health care bill earlier this year, the overall failure by Congress to send a bill to the President's desk doesn't bode well for another major legislative task like tax reform. It showed that even though Republicans are in power and share common goals, they don't always agree on the fine print.\u000a\u000aThe President has made public comments that he still wants Congress to focus on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act -- former President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislation also known as Obamacare -- to uphold a major campaign promise that Trump and other Republicans made for years.\u000a\u000aA few senators closely linked to health care have had recent one-on-one meetings with the President, but Republicans didn't come close to reaching a consensus on their next health care step before they left for the August recess last week.\u000a\u000aThe Senate health committee is scheduled to hold hearings when it returns in September on stabilizing the markets and enforcing current provisions in Obamacare. Depending on how much oxygen that takes up and how involved the President gets in pushing for another push on repeal-and-replace, tax reform could struggle to break through.\u000a\u000aBut Republicans were also hoping for a health care win in part to help make the transition to tax reform a bit smoother. By repealing Obamacare, they would have nixed some or all of the taxes on the wealthy that were being used to pay for it -- worth about $800 billion.\u000a\u000aNow there's some pressure on Republicans to use tax reform to rid of those same taxes. But that looks highly unlikely. For one, even if they eliminated the taxes, Republicans would have a gaping hole in revenue to continue funding Obamacare.\u000a\u000aThat challenge would be in addition to the pending battle to offset the list of tax cuts that the White House and congressional Republicans are hoping to make in tax reform.\u000a\u000aHow to pay for it?\u000a\u000aOn top of timeline issues are debates over how to pay for any potential package. Democrats and some Republicans have insisted that the bill must not add to the deficit , meaning any tax cuts must be paid for.\u000a\u000aTo make a bill "revenue neutral," which means tax cuts would be offset through other methods involving the tax code, like closing up loopholes and deductions, for example.\u000a\u000aTo make it "deficit neutral," that would entail raising the money through spending cuts in other parts of government, which can be a large ambition to take on, especially after passing a budget where cuts were also likely made.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, McConnell said tax reform would have to be revenue neutral, but it's unclear what path Republicans will take on this since the White House hasn't laid out how they plan to offset the loss of revenue from tax cuts.\u000a\u000aIf they choose not to lay out ways to make up the revenue, then that could spark pushback not only from Democrats, but also from conservative Republicans and deficit hawks.\u000a\u000aIf the White House and Republican leadership go with the revenue neutral path, as McConnell suggested, then they'll start looking at potential deductions to get rid of. That path in itself is a potential landmine field, given the wide array of deductions and the various special interest groups and lobbyists who will be fighting to keep them in place.

aVChoosing to retire is one of the biggest financial decisions you'll ever make. Giving up your salary means having to live from other sources of income, and if you haven't planned extensively, then you might not even be aware of the resources at your disposal, let alone how much money they might provide toward your support.\u000a\u000aBy considering the following questions, you'll be in a much better situation to decide whether now's the right time to take your gold watch and end your career.\u000a\u000aHow will you take care of your healthcare needs?\u000a\u000aOne of the most important issues that would-be retirees need to address is how they intend to cover their healthcare expenses. If you've had health insurance coverage at work, then quitting your job means giving up that coverage.\u000a\u000aThose who wait until age 65 can generally qualify for Medicare, which goes a long way toward covering healthcare expenses for retirees. If you're thinking about retiring earlier, then you'll need to know how to bridge the time gap before Medicare kicks in.\u000a\u000aIf you're married and your spouse is still working, then you might be eligible for coverage under your spouse's group health plan. Continuation coverage under COBRA can also be an option to cover short periods of 18 months or less, but you'll have to pay the full monthly cost of insurance yourself -- not just the employee portion that you used to pay when you were still working. That can be shockingly expensive if you're not prepared for it.\u000a\u000aOther alternatives include marketplace coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but with healthcare legislation in limbo, it's dangerous to assume that such coverage will be there for you as long as you need it.\u000a\u000aHow much of your income will you be able to replace?\u000a\u000aLosing your paycheck means having to figure out how you'll be able to afford your living expenses. Some of your costs will fall when you stop working, but you might also want to do more things with all of your newfound spare time. Many retirees find that the pastimes they take up in retirement are just as expensive as the work-related expenses they use to have to pay when they had a job.\u000a\u000aTo figure out how much income you'll have, you'll want to look closely at two things. First, Social Security will likely kick in at some point to provide you with stable monthly income that tracks inflation each year, and you can estimate what your benefit will be.\u000a\u000aSecond, using a simple guideline like the 4% rule to determine how much you can safely withdraw each year from your retirement nest egg will provide another basis for financial support.\u000a\u000aAdd those two things up and compare it to your after-tax pay. If they're roughly comparable, then you're likely in good shape. If there's a big shortfall, then you'll have to figure out how to economize -- or wait on retiring a bit longer.\u000a\u000aWhat will you do with your time?\u000a\u000aBefore you retire, you need to understand exactly what you expect from retirement. Many people look forward to retiring for years, only to find that when they leave work, they're also leaving behind their closest social network.\u000a\u000aIf you're retiring just for retirement's sake without any concrete plans about what you want to do with your time, then you're opening the door to potential unhappiness.\u000a\u000aMany workers have started looking into the idea of phasing into retirement by staying on in a part-time or advisory role at their place of work. That's especially useful if you're in a financial position where having some extra income is helpful, and it also makes sure that you don't lose touch with the people you spent time with during your career.\u000a\u000aRegardless of whether you go that route, be sure to plan how you'll maintain your social relationships so that you can avoid feeling isolated and lonely.\u000a\u000aHow should you invest after you retire?\u000a\u000aFinally, would-be retirees need to know how they'll need to handle their investment portfolios once they quit work. If you've followed a gradual path toward more conservative investing as you age, then you probably won't have to make major changes on the day you retire.\u000a\u000aHowever, if you've been an aggressive risk-taker with your investments when you had a paycheck coming in, retirement is a good time to think about making your portfolio last.\u000a\u000aYou won't want to give up on stocks entirely even after you retire. With many retirements lasting 30 years or more, you'll need the growth that stocks can provide. Yet by focusing on dividend-paying stocks and companies that are in more stable and mature businesses, you can reduce the risk of your stock portfolio while still having growth potential to make your money last longer.\u000a\u000aRelated links:\u000a\u000a\u2022 Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\u000a\u000a\u2022 This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\u000a\u000a\u2022 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\u000a\u000aRetirement is a huge decision, and you have to get it right.

aVNairobi, Kenya (CNN) A week out from Kenya's highly-anticipated August 8 election, increasingly fake news reports are circulating on social media platforms in the country.\u000a\u000aSlickly-produced news bulletins that at first glance appear to be from major international broadcasters including CNN and the BBC have surfaced in recent days.\u000a\u000aOne bogus report cuts from a legitimate CNN Philippines broadcast to a fake voiceover segment which falsely implies that one candidate is leading over the other in a recent poll.\u000a\u000aPolling numbers have the two leading candidates -- incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta and long-time rival and veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga -- in a much tighter race, with neither garnering enough support for an outright victory.\u000a\u000aTo unequivocally win the election, a candidate has to receive 50% of the votes plus one as well as at least 25% of the votes in half of Kenya's 47 counties. If no winner is declared, the election will go into a run-off, for the first time in Kenya's history.\u000a\u000aFake news came to the fore during the 2016 US election and the Brexit referendum in the UK earlier that year. Now social platforms like Facebook are working to combat the growing problem.\u000a\u000aHow to spot the fakes\u000a\u000aThe fake poll video was made to look like a CNN broadcast with the familiar red and white logo carefully superimposed in the corner of the shot, but the font in the headline is very different to the one used in CNN's reports.\u000a\u000aThere is no way of gauging just how many people shared the fake CNN report but it has been widely shared on social platforms. After CNN was made aware of the fake report, it debunked it in a tweet.\u000a\u000aThis report on Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta is fake. CNN did not produce or broadcast this story. \u2014 CNN International PR (@CNNPRUK) July 27, 2017\u000a\u000aThe BBC's Focus on Africa program was also manipulated last week; edited to include the same false poll.\u000a\u000aAlphonce Shiundu is the Kenya editor of Africa Check , a not-for-profit working to promote accuracy in the media across the continent. He says videos like these can seriously influence voting behavior.\u000a\u000a"People who don't watch CNN or the BBC would not know that these videos were fake," Shiundu explains. "When this fake report is putting Kenyatta ahead, and you're sending this video to Kenyatta's stronghold, it just reinforces the belief that he has the numbers and he's going to win."\u000a\u000aConvincing forgeries\u000a\u000aAnd it's not just voters who have been tricked by these bogus news segments.\u000a\u000aSuzanne Silantoi, 23, is running for the Kenyan Senate as an independent candidate to represent Nairobi. She told CNN she thought the distributed video, which was shared on her timeline, was real.\u000a\u000a"I didn't know it was fake. But I didn't believe the poll the fake report was talking about."\u000a\u000aSilantoi says Kenyans can spot some fake news but it becomes harder when the hoax imitations are made to look like international news outlets.\u000a\u000a"We know that if you want to get credible news you just get it from the mainstream media. There are a lot of bloggers and Internet based news in Kenya which are not trustworthy and most of them are fake," she says.\u000a\u000a"If you get a certain news that's saying something and then you go to the mainstream and if they are saying the same thing then you believe it's true."\u000a\u000aBut Silantoi says she does not believe Kenyan voters are being swayed by these phony videos because much of the population tends to select which politician to support according to their own ethnicity.\u000a\u000a"... in Kenya, it's very hard to get objectivity. Many times people would just tend to stay in their own political affiliations, regardless of whether the news is fake or not," she says.\u000a\u000aBe on the lookout\u000a\u000aHowever, Shiundu says sophisticated videos like this could be damaging to undecided voters who might inadvertently pass on false information to friends and family, believing it to be true.\u000a\u000a"If they send that video to a community group or a family group in the village -- they will believe that it's true -- and are likely to vote for the side that has the numbers," says the Nairobi-based fact-checker.\u000a\u000aHe says there is a lot of fake news being disseminated on "dark" social media platforms.\u000a\u000a"That means it's coming from Telegram or WhatsApp groups that are not easily traceable -- and not quickly debunked," Shiundu says, adding "So you get people -- even politicians -- making wrong decisions based on unverified information."\u000a\u000aAs the race enters its final days, with campaigning due to end on Friday, Shiundu is warning voters to be vigilant.\u000a\u000a"Politicians will still find a way to push for people to campaign for them via social media, and that's when we will see a spike in more fake news."

aVBut there's a catch: how do you develop technology that can withstand the sea's harsh environment with minimum disruption to the ecosystem?\u000a\u000aOne Israeli-based company, Yam Pro Energy -- believes it can offer the ideal solution and is set to build a wave-energy plant on the coastline of Accra, Ghana's capital city.\u000a\u000aWave technology is an endeavor that has recently been trying to catch up with the likes of solar and wind energy.\u000a\u000aIt exploits a resource -- the oceans -- that covers 71 per cent of our planet, it's environmentally friendly, mostly cost-free once set up and it could be revolutionary to coastal countries.\u000a\u000a"There's so many wave power companies and as many different devices, so finding one that actually works best is trial and error," said Mark Jacobson, who is a Stanford University professor and director at The Solutions Project , a company which aims to help the world move to 100% renewable energy.\u000a\u000aHowever, Yam Pro Energy says its innovative technology is the "best choice in renewable energy systems."\u000a\u000aThe machinery will utilize the crashing waves to harvest hydraulic pressure and turn it into electricity.\u000a\u000a"It was easy," laughed Yam Pro Energy's CEO, Zeev Peretz. "We negotiated (with Ghana) for many years, but in the end we succeeded."\u000a\u000a"The demand (for energy) is very big and I think it will help people (improve) their life."\u000a\u000a"Floaters" will be connected to wave breakers on the coastline and will bob up and down as waves crash in.\u000a\u000aPeretz said their technology was much more efficient than other renewable energy sources because it can generate 65% of energy per year, compared to solar panels and wind turbines which generate between 22-24%.\u000a\u000a"The rest is heat and just waste," Peretz said.\u000a\u000aThe technology will be built on Ghana's coastline in Accra.\u000a\u000aThe advantages of wave power, the company argues, is that their machines do not emit pollution, waves are more predictable than other renewable sources and despite the original set up being costly, the running and maintenance costs are low.\u000a\u000a"If the waves are too high we are given forecasts days ahead which helps to analyze the situation," Peretz said.\u000a\u000aWhile construction in Accra won't begin until well into 2017, Yam Pro Energy has already secured the coastline to build its power station. It has also teamed up with local partners, secured its power purchase agreement (PPA) from the local electrical company and has been given space on the grid so it can sell the energy produced.\u000a\u000aPeretz said 10,000 households will benefit from the project.\u000a\u000aNo impact on wildlife?\u000a\u000aAccording to Emanuele Taibi, an island energy analyst from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the biggest challenge with wave power is proving it can withstand the sea's harsh environments.\u000a\u000a"There are quite a lot of prototypes and they're doing quite well, but (for an investor), the main point is over 20 years -- how will the machine perform?"\u000a\u000aPeretz said Yam Pro Energy had taken this into consideration and that it will conduct maintenance frequently.\u000a\u000aThe "floaters" can be pulled up out of the water if maintenance needs to be done or if the conditions are too rough.\u000a\u000aCompared to other devices -- like buoys -- which can become destroyed and sink in rough seas, Yam Pro Energy's patent is more efficient, it says.\u000a\u000a"We don't have to send scuba divers or boats out. All the maintenance is from the land, so we just put floaters up and you (can) do whatever you need to do (then) put them back down."\u000a\u000aThe company prides itself on providing renewable energy that's clean and affordable in an environmentally responsible way. But Greenpeace's UK Chief Scientist and Policy Director, Doug Parr told CNN that while it supported wave power, checks needed to be in place to ensure the technology doesn't impact wildlife.\u000a\u000a"No source of power has zero impact on the environment," he said, adding that assessments need to be made to "judge whether the clean energy benefits are justified."\u000a\u000aFuture predictions\u000a\u000aJacobson, from The Solutions Project, supported the development of wave technology in Ghana, but said that its growth won't be as rapid as solar and wind. "While there's a reasonable resource of wave power to exploit, if you're comparing it to other technologies it's just not going to be penetrating as much," he said.\u000a\u000aInstead, it will compliment other renewable energy technologies. "It's definitely worthwhile doing ... We should invest (in it) as much as we can."\u000a\u000aThe Solutions Project predicts that if Ghana can transition to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2050, wave energy will account for 1.4 per cent of it.\u000a\u000aAnd while that may seem small, Jacobson insisted it wasn't. "The amount of energy worldwide is enormous. So something that is large is actually small in comparison to the power demand worldwide."\u000a\u000aHe said there was "no downside" in transitioning into a world which only uses renewable energy.\u000a\u000a"These countries can become more energy independent. There's less risk of conflict, less terrorism because there's fewer centralized plants and you solve the climate problem simultaneously."\u000a\u000aIRENA's Taibi was more optimistic. He said that while the growth of wave power has been gradual, it was only "a matter of time" before it became the "sixth pillar" of renewable energy that will become commercialized.\u000a\u000a"The good news is there's quite a lot of innovation coming from different approaches to the same resource."

aV(CNN) The moment is different for everyone.\u000a\u000aMaybe it was when a young girl was burned alive while her parents watched complicitly. Perhaps it was the orchestrated slaughter of a family, a pregnant woman's belly stabbed again and again like the film over a frozen TV dinner. Was it when a psychopath ate a sausage next to his freshly-castrated hostage? Or one of the uncountable, imaginative depictions of rape and psychological abuse?\u000a\u000aEvery "Game of Thrones" fan has had it, the moment when they looked away from the screen and wondered:\u000a\u000a"Is suffering the only thing these people do?"\u000a\u000aIt's exhilarating and exhausting, attending this renaissance faire from hell. But we are approaching the final episodes of the penultimate season, when plots converge and some of the more painful story lines are being resolve. In turn, the surviving characters have started down a fascinating and oft-neglected path: They are actually having to deal with the aftermath of their trauma. And we, for better or worse, get to watch.\u000a\u000aReal life problems, but with dragons\u000a\u000a"The Moment," for many, happened two years ago in the fifth season when Sansa Stark, a teenage member of the show's most sympathetic and suffering family, was raped and belittled by her psychopathic new husband, Ramsay, on their wedding night.\u000a\u000aThe story arc, which wasn't included in the books, was a brutal nadir for the show. Sansa had already risen above several seasons' worth of manipulation and abuse, and viewers were turned off by the regression\u000a\u000aMercifully, in time, things got better for Sansa. She eventually escaped and fed her husband to a pack of starving dogs before returning home and reuniting with her scattered, broken family.\u000a\u000aWhere some narratives would treat this new chapter of her life as a clean slate, it's clear Sansa carried her trauma with her, as a laurel on her head and an albatross around her neck.\u000a\u000aSansa reunites with her long-lost siblings after seasons of abuse.\u000a\u000aSometimes, it pulls her down. This season, she speaks with alarming admiration about an enemy who previously held her hostage and manipulated her. She conflates justice and revenge when she tries to banish two children whose disloyal houses had chosen to support the now-dead Ramsay.\u000a\u000aTV and movie writers are often criticized for using rape as a piece of character development and then ignoring whatever comes after. As ominous as they appear, Sansa's uneasy interludes make her trauma journey realistic.\u000a\u000a"Sansa is a victim of complex trauma, particularly in the form of domestic violence," says Sharie Stines, a therapist, relationship coach and writer who specializes in complex trauma recovery and personality disorders. "She was betrayed by everyone and abused and objectified."\u000a\u000aThat's not something a person just gets over, Stines says. In fact, even when someone is healed, the ordeal is never completely erased.\u000a\u000a"All of our experiences mold and shape us, so recovery is a lifelong process, not a destination."\u000a\u000aCome for the action, stay for the complex character decisions\u000a\u000aLet's look at a slightly less sympathetic character. In the opening episodes of this season, Theon, a man of middling morals who was held hostage, tortured, castrated and brainwashed (by Ramsay, as it so happens), is faced with saving his sister during an attack on their ship.\u000a\u000aAs he contemplates his choice, you can see his mind retreating to the days of his captivity. His eyes flick around, observing the present horror. Someone is getting their tongue cut out. Death is everywhere.\u000a\u000aHe jumps overboard, leaving his sister behind.\u000a\u000aWhat are we to make of that?\u000a\u000aSome viewers jeered: What a coward! What a selfish man. On cue, the Twitter machine churned out memes mocking his quick escape.\u000a\u000aEven though Theon has never been a favorite character, others recognized the decision as a realistic manifestation of his pain, perhaps even symptomatic of post-traumatic stress disorder.\u000a\u000aTheon shaves Ramsay Bolton, showing his full acquiescene to his servile 'Reek' character\u000a\u000a"You see, when people experience trauma their personality splits off into 'sub-selves' or personas or 'modes,'" to compartmentalize and protect themselves, Stines says.\u000a\u000aThis hits home for Theon, who was groomed to become a servant named Reek during his captivity, a manipulation so strong he struggled with his identity even after he was rescued.\u000a\u000aWhile Theon as Theon is intense and full of swagger, "Reek represents the part of a person triggered by trauma," says Stines. "And he has a learned response to acquiesce to that trauma."\u000a\u000aIn other words, Reek came roaring back, and with him came compelling conversations about choices and why they're made, and what it means to recognize someone's internal struggle.\u000a\u000aThe viewer feels it, too\u000a\u000aWith any piece of good storytelling, there's a symbiotic relationship between the viewer and the characters they care for. Whether or not we feel for Theon, how we react to Sansa's abuse, it shows us something about ourselves.\u000a\u000a"Because of the power of TV and film, people experience certain emotions while watching. With a show such as this, where the traumatic experiences never stop coming, the audience is definitely going to feel something," Stines says.\u000a\u000aThe importance of the characters' journeys are not lost on the actors, either. Alfie Allen, who plays Theon, spoke at a press event in 2015 about a moving fan encounter\u000a\u000a"She pulled me aside and said 'I get beaten by my husband. He hits me in places that no one ever sees, in the way that you receive abuse in 'Game of Thrones,' it's not pathetic and it gives me strength'," he said. "...(I)t kind of made me realize that I do have responsibilities as an actor."\u000a\u000aIndeed, Stines says watching fictional drama can actually help people work through their own trauma.\u000a\u000a"It can break through denial and minimization and assure someone that what they are going through is not trivial, that they are not crazy," Stines says. "It seems to me, if there is some sense of satisfaction from a resolution of some sort (on the show), that could be therapeutic."\u000a\u000aIt's not about a happy ending\u000a\u000aAn interesting byproduct of all of this suffering is that, almost universally, the triumphs of every hero in "Game of Thrones" have been forged by their trauma. By now, even non-viewers could recognize the long silver hair of Daenerys Targaryen, one of the show's most important heroines. So much has happened, it's easy to forget the first time we saw her: About to be sold as a bride to a stranger in a strange land, timid and scared, unprepared for the dark days to come.\u000a\u000aDaenerys is threatened by her brother in Season 1 after he sells her to her new husband.\u000a\u000aSix seasons later, with dragons circling above and a throne at her back, she delivers an affecting speech that shows she has not forgotten a thing:\u000a\u000a"I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me, I don't remember all their names. I have been sold like a broodmare. I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled," she says.\u000a\u000a"Do you know what kept me standing, through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any god, not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen."\u000a\u000aDaenerys is now an ambitious queen.\u000a\u000aHow many viewers could see themselves in that self-affirmation? How many trauma survivors had a much-needed moment of recognition, a reminder that one of the most powerful women on television is also one of their own?\u000a\u000aShowing suffering as a whole experience -- the complex healing, the lifetime of coping, and yes, the possibility of triumph -- isn't wish fulfillment. It's accuracy.\u000a\u000aAfter all, we derive so much more from fiction than pure entertainment. It inspires and challenges us, and when we invest in a story we are doing so with the hope we will be repaid -- not necessarily with a happy ending, but with something that, despite dragons and doom, will be unmistakably, unshakably human.

aVAn action film bursting with patriotic zeal just broke the Chinese box office.\u000a\u000a"Wolf Warrior 2" has raked in 3.5 billion yuan ($520 million) at theaters as of Tuesday, according to Beijing-based movie industry site MTime. That makes it China's highest grossing film to date.\u000a\u000aThe movie takes place in an unnamed African country, where an elite Chinese soldier ventures into a war zone to save trapped Chinese workers. It's loosely based on several true stories involving military evacuations of Chinese workers from Libya back in 2011 and from Yemen in 2015, according to local media reports.\u000a\u000aRelated: Box office slump is hurting AMC theaters\u000a\u000aWith "Captain America" directors Joe and Anthony Russo reported to have consulted on "Wolf Warrior 2," the movie has the look and feel of a typical Hollywood action flick. The difference is it features a Chinese hero saving Chinese citizens.\u000a\u000a"People know Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger, why don't we have this type of actor representing China?" Wu Jing, the movie's lead actor and director said in comments aired on state-run broadcaster CCTV.\u000a\u000aWu also starred and directed in the first "Wolf Warrior" movie, which was far less popular among domestic moviegoers, pulling in just 545 million yuan ($80 million) in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe sequel, however, has succeeded in tapping into audiences' patriotism. It premiered just ahead of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.\u000a\u000aWith the tagline "Whoever offends China will be hunted down and punished wherever they are," the movie was panned as "jingoistic" by RogerEbert.com. The LA Times, however, found its patriotic fervor "bracing."\u000a\u000aThe closing image of "Wolf Warrior 2" is a Chinese passport with a message scrawled across the back: "The citizens of the People's Republic of China: When you encounter danger overseas, do not give up! Please remember, right behind you, there is a powerful motherland!"\u000a\u000aSome moviegoers took to Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, to heap praise on the film.\u000a\u000aRelated: OJ, Netflix and 'Dunkirk': Your summer guide to media and entertainment\u000a\u000a"I'm so proud to hold a Chinese passport," wrote one Weibo user. "I have to say this is the first ever real action movie in China," wrote another.\u000a\u000aThe hashtag "Wolf Warrior 2" has been viewed more than 1.2 billion times on the social media platform.\u000a\u000aThe movie hauled in ten times as much money at the box office as "The Founding of an Army," a state-backed Chinese film that also doled out a hefty dose of patriotism to coincide with the Chinese military's anniversary.\u000a\u000a"Wolf Warrior 2" overtook fantasy flick "The Mermaid," the previous top grossing movie in China.

aV(CNN) It has been described as the guilty pleasure of this year's Tour de France , arguably the race's greatest villain waxing lyrical about the race he once dominated for so long.\u000a\u000aLance Armstrong is back in cycling, in a way. Still an outcast to the race, instead he has set up a daily podcast recorded from a small office at the end of the garden of his Austin home, and at occasional other venues nearby.\u000a\u000aThe 45-year-old is as knowledgeable as you'd expect for a veteran of 13 Tours. Topics have ranged widely from criticizing race organizers for ending the Tour's Queen stage on a treacherous descent to having a hangover as a result of too much rosé wine during his July 4 celebrations.\u000a\u000aFresh off the airwaves of his latest podcast, known as "Stages ," Armstrong tells CNN: "I had two platforms before [his public mea culpa to doping four years ago]: cycling and cancer.\u000a\u000a"I'm not saying it's right or wrong but they went overnight, not just the cycling but the cancer. A man with no platform is a lost man."\u000a\u000aThis is not Armstrong's first podcast. For the past few months, he has had one called "The Forward" [disassociating himself from the past] in which guests have ranged from the author Malcolm Gladwell to the former NFL quarterback Brett Favre.\u000a\u000aBut while that has been well received, Armstrong has been blown away both by the listening numbers and the positive feedback of his latest venture over the airwaves, in which he shares the stage with radio host JB Hager.\u000a\u000aAt the time of speaking to CNN, he was averaging 300,000 listeners a day -- double that of "The Forward" -- with the numbers rising. Much to the chagrin of the Tour organizers no doubt, it has been something of a hit of the race.\u000a\u000a'Not concerned by negativity'\u000a\u000aSurely with his past doping indiscretions on the bike there has been some negative feedback?\u000a\u000a"The team deal with the emails and I'm sure there are plenty of emails that tell me to 'go f*** yourself'," he says.\u000a\u000a"But I'm not overly concerned by the negativity. If someone wants to fire off and make a personal attack, it doesn't affect me. If it's a comment on the accuracy of the show then I'd try to fix that.\u000a\u000a"The feedback on Facebook Live, Twitter and Instagram's been good."\u000a\u000a"Stages" is just part of Armstrong's return to cycling. In the months leading up to it, he was getting back on his bike more and more for general fitness, as well as paying closer attention to the professional peloton.\u000a\u000aArmstrong lists off some of the comments he has received. "I had one saying 'I didn't want to listen but I did and it's good'," or you have people saying 'I shouldn't like it'. One guy called it 'his guilty pleasure'."\u000a\u000aBut the seven-time Tour winner, whose race victories have since been erased from the annals for his doping past, knows his cycling return will not be received well by everyone.\u000a\u000a"It's the first time in years that I've got something to give me a platform," he said. "People can choose not to listen but I'm my own boss with this and nobody tells me what to do."\u000a\u000aThe question is what next -- platform wise -- for Armstrong? He has had some talks with parties about his future.\u000a\u000aBut taking his podcast to France next year is not on the agenda. For one, he knows in all certainty he would be blacklisted.\u000a\u000a"Hey, it's never say never isn't it?" he says. "But I have very little interest in doing that. I can watch the Tour in my house and then walk across to my studio.\u000a\u000a"God bless those on the Tour having to drive three hours every day between the stages. That's miserable -- you need a vacation at the end of it. This works perfectly for me right now."\u000a\u000aBut of the wider question of his future, Armstrong has no idea what lies ahead, with a $100 million lawsuit looming from the US government for fraud for doping while racing in the US Postal Service colors.\u000a\u000a"There's one thing left that you all know about, that's a significant fight so to speak," he says of a case which begins on November 6. "That's looming and I've got no choice but to fight the case. For now, I have to get on with my life."\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, Armstrong will continue with his podcast for which he will be joined by former teammate George Hincapie in the final week.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Lance Armstrong: In his own words (from 2014 CNN interview) Hide Caption 10 of 10\u000a\u000aHe may crop up yet again as he has done in the television mockumentary Pharmacy Road on HBO, telling the story of a 1982 drug-fuelled Tour de France, with Armstrong in a scene-stealing moment.\u000a\u000a"I watched it with my son the other night and I thought it was funny," he says. "It's nicely over the top. It was fun to do, like 'Stages.'"\u000a\u000aHave your say\u000a\u000aFrom the peloton to the podcast, Armstrong continues to prove a divisive figure.\u000a\u000aAsked if the 45-year-old still deserves a platform in the sport, here's what social media users around the world had to say.\u000a\u000a"Lance brought a lot of good to the world of cycling and cancer," said Katrina Kraus. "Let the world forgive, let him return to cycling and let LiveStrong have their hero back."\u000a\u000aVanessa Baumann asked why the public is ready to forgive the actions of some athletes and not others, adding: "That inspiration and the will to be strong and live that he has given me can never be taken away."\u000a\u000aOthers contended his doping merely "leveled the playing field" in an era when cheating was rife.\u000a\u000aBut, six years on from his retirement, not everyone was ready to forgive the fallen star.\u000a\u000aNancy Pope conceded it was Armstrong that initially got her interested in the sport, but stressed "What he does with himself couldn't matter less to me."\u000a\u000a"He has to live with it," posted Tom Cole, saying the cyclist's downfall was "his own doing."\u000a\u000a"Maybe all his sins can't be forgiven, but one should also remember his contributions," said Bernd Ingram.

aV(CNN) A small group of nuns and priests met the woman in the chapel of a house one June evening. Though it was warm outside, a palpable chill settled over the room.\u000a\u000aAs the priests began to pray, the woman slipped into a trance -- and then snapped to life. She spoke in multiple voices: One was deep, guttural and masculine; another was high-pitched; a third spouted only Latin. When someone secretly sprinkled ordinary water on her, she didn't react. But when holy water was used, she screamed in pain.\u000a\u000a"Leave her alone, you f***ing priests," the guttural voice shouted. "Stop, you whores. ... You'll be sorry."\u000a\u000aYou've probably seen this before: a soul corrupted by Satan, a priest waving a crucifix at a snarling woman. Movies and books have mimicked exorcisms so often, they've become clichés.\u000a\u000aThe 1973 film "The Exorcist" shaped how many see demonic possession.\u000a\u000aBut this was an actual exorcism -- and included a character not normally seen in the traditional drive-out-the-devil script.\u000a\u000aDr. Richard Gallagher is an Ivy League-educated, board-certified psychiatrist who teaches at Columbia University and New York Medical College. He was part of the team that tried to help the woman.\u000a\u000aFighting Satan's minions wasn't part of Gallagher's career plan while he was studying medicine at Yale. He knew about biblical accounts of demonic possession but thought they were an ancient culture's attempt to grapple with mental disorders like epilepsy. He proudly calls himself a "man of science."\u000a\u000aYet today, Gallagher has become something else: the go-to guy for a sprawling network of exorcists in the United States. He says demonic possession is real. He's seen the evidence: victims suddenly speaking perfect Latin; sacred objects flying off shelves; people displaying "hidden knowledge" or secrets about people that they could not have possibly have known.\u000a\u000a"There was one woman who was like 90 pounds soaking wet. She threw a Lutheran deacon who was about 200 pounds across the room," he says. "That's not psychiatry. That's beyond psychiatry."\u000a\u000aGallagher calls himself a "consultant" on demonic possessions. For the past 25 years, he has helped clergy distinguish between mental illness and what he calls "the real thing." He estimates that he's seen more cases of possession than any other physician in the world.\u000a\u000aThere was one woman who was like 90 pounds soaking wet. She threw a Lutheran deacon who was about 200 pounds across the room. That's not psychiatry. That's beyond psychiatry. Dr. Richard Gallagher, psychiatrist, professor and demonic possession "consultant"\u000a\u000a"Whenever I need help, I call on him," says the Rev. Gary Thomas, one of the most famous exorcists in the United States. The movie "The Rite" was based on Thomas' work.\u000a\u000a"He's so respected in the field," Thomas says. "He's not like most therapists, who are either atheists or agnostics."\u000a\u000aGallagher is a big man -- 6-foot-5 -- who once played semipro basketball in Europe. He has a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor. When he talks about possession, it sounds as if he's describing the growth of algae; his tone is dry, clinical, matter-of-fact.\u000a\u000aPossession, he says, is rare -- but real.\u000a\u000a"I spend more time convincing people that they're not possessed than they are," he wrote in an essay for The Washington Post.\u000a\u000aSome critics, though, say Gallagher has become possessed by his own delusions. They say all he's witnessed are cheap parlor tricks by people who might need therapy but certainly not exorcism. And, they argue, there's no empirical evidence that proves possession is real.\u000a\u000aStill, one of the biggest mysteries about Gallagher's work isn't what he's seen. It's how he's evolved.\u000a\u000aHow does a "man of science" get pulled into the world of demonic possession?\u000a\u000aHis short answer: He met a queen of Satan.\u000a\u000aA 'creepy' encounter with evil\u000a\u000aShe was a middle-age woman who wore flowing dark clothes and black eye shadow. She could be charming and engaging. She was also part of a satanic cult.\u000a\u000aShe called herself the queen of the cult, but Gallagher would refer to her as "Julia," the pseudonym he gave her.\u000a\u000aThe woman had approached her local priest, convinced she was being attacked by a demon. The priest referred her to an exorcist, who reached out to Gallagher for a mental health evaluation.\u000a\u000aWhy, though, would a devil worshipper want to be free of the devil?\u000a\u000a"She was conflicted," Gallagher says. "There was a part of her that wanted to be relieved of the possession."\u000a\u000aShe ended up relieving Gallagher of his doubts. It was one of the first cases he took, and it changed him. Gallagher helped assemble an exorcism team that met Julia in the chapel of a house.\u000a\u000aObjects would fly off shelves around her. She somehow knew personal details about Gallagher's life: how his mother had died of ovarian cancer; the fact that two cats in his house went berserk fighting each other the night before one of her sessions.\u000a\u000aJulia found a way to reach him even when she wasn't with him, he says.\u000a\u000aHe was talking on the phone with Julia's priest one night, he says, when both men heard one of the demonic voices that came from Julia during her trances -- even though she was nowhere near a phone and thousands of miles away.\u000a\u000aHe says he was never afraid.\u000a\u000a"It's creepy," he says. "But I believe I'm on the winning side."\u000a\u000aHow a scientist believes in demons\u000a\u000aHe also insists that he's on the side of science.\u000a\u000aHe says he's a stickler for the scientific method, that it teaches people to follow the facts wherever they may lead.\u000a\u000aGrowing up in a large Irish Catholic family in Long Island, he didn't think much about stories of possession. But when he kept seeing cases like Julia's as a professional, he says, his views had to evolve.\u000a\u000aSome priests say those who dabble in the occult are opening doorways to the demonic.\u000a\u000a"I don't believe in this stuff because I'm Catholic," he says. "I try to follow the evidence."\u000a\u000aBeing Catholic, though, may help.\u000a\u000aGallagher grew up in a home where faith was taken seriously. His younger brother, Mark, says Gallagher was an academic prodigy with a photographic memory who wanted to use his faith to help people.\u000a\u000a"We had a sensational childhood," Mark Gallagher says. "My mother and father were great about always helping neighbors or relatives out." Their mother was a homemaker, and their father was a lawyer who'd fought in World War II. "My father used to walk us proudly into church. He taught us to give back."\u000a\u000aGallagher's two ways of giving back -- helping the mentally ill as well as the possessed -- may seem at odds. But not necessarily for those in the Catholic Church.\u000a\u000aContemporary Catholicism doesn't see faith and science as contradictory. Its leaders insist that possession, miracles and angels exist. But global warming is real, so is evolution, and miracles must be documented with scientific rigor.\u000a\u000aMore from 'The Other Side' Some stories blur the lines between science, spirituality and the supernatural. These stories are from "The Other Side." Where do coincidences come from?\u000a\u000aSynchronicity is familiar to many people, yet few understand how it works. Are our lives are shaped by unseen hands? Or are we victims of psychological narcissm? Beyond Goodbye\u000a\u000aSome people not only share their life but their moment of death with loved ones. Are these "shared-death experiences" real or a mirage? Why Bigfoot is getting nervous\u000a\u000aMonster stories have been around for millennia. Now hunters are hot on the trail, armed with cameras, drones and night-vision goggles. Can they catch one? Ghost hunters haunted by competition\u000a\u000aWe've heard of ghosts that harass the living. Now people are starting to harass the ghosts. Across America, teams are creeping through people's homes, trying to get rid of their paranormal pests. Heaven popular, except with the church\u000a\u000aPopular culture is filled with accounts from people who claim to have near-death experiences. So why doesn't the church talk about heaven anymore? Bidding farewell from beyond the grave?\u000a\u000aAlthough visits by the spirits of the recently departed can be chilling, they are also comforting, say those who've seen these "crisis apparitions." Can bonds between loved ones defy death?\u000a\u000aOne of Gallagher's favorite sources of inspiration is Pope John Paul II's encyclical "Fides et Ratio" ("On Faith and Reason"). The Pope writes that "there can never be a true divergence between faith and reason, since the same God who reveals the mysteries and bestows the gift of faith has also placed in the human spirit the light of reason."\u000a\u000aThe church's emphasis on faith and reason can even been seen in the birth of its exorcism ritual.\u000a\u000aThe Rite of Exorcism was first published in 1614 by Pope Paul V to quell a trend of laypeople and priests hastily performing exorcisms on people they presumed were possessed, such as victims of the bubonic plague, says the Rev. Mike Driscoll, author of "Demons, Deliverance, Discernment: Separating Fact from Fiction about the Spirit World."\u000a\u000a"A line (in the rite) said that the exorcist should be careful to distinguish between demon possession and melancholy, which was a catchall for mental illness," Driscoll says. "The church knew back then that there were mental problems. It said the exorcist should not have anything to do with medicine. Leave that to the doctors."\u000a\u000aDoctors, perhaps, like Gallagher.\u000a\u000aGallagher says the concept of possession by spirit isn't limited to Catholicism. Muslim, Jewish and other Christian traditions regard possession by spirits -- holy or benign -- as possible.\u000a\u000a"This is not quite as esoteric as some people make it out to be," Gallagher says. "I know quite a few psychiatrists and mental health professionals who believe in this stuff."\u000a\u000aDr. Mark Albanese is among them. A friend of Gallagher's, Albanese studied medicine at Cornell and has been practicing psychiatry for decades. In a letter to the New Oxford Review, a Catholic magazine, he defended Gallagher's belief in possession.\u000a\u000aHe also says there is a growing belief among health professionals that a patient's spiritual dimension should be accounted for in treatment, whether their provider agrees with those beliefs or not. Some psychiatrists have even talked of adding a "trance and possession disorder" diagnosis to the DSM, the premier diagnostic manual of disorders used by mental health professionals in the US.\u000a\u000aThere's still so much about the human mind that psychiatrists don't know, Albanese says. Doctors used to be widely skeptical of people who claimed to suffer from multiple personalities, but now it's a legitimate disorder (dissociative identity disorder). Many are still dumbfounded by the power of placebos, a harmless pill or medical procedure that produces healing in some cases.\u000a\u000a"There's a certain openness to experiences that are happening that are beyond what we can explain by MRI scans, neurobiology or even psychological theories," Albanese says.\u000a\u000aDr. Jeffrey Lieberman, a psychiatrist who specializes in schizophrenia, arrived at a similar conclusion after he had an unnerving experience with a patient.\u000a\u000aLieberman was asked to examine the videotape of an exorcism that he subsequently dismissed as unconvincing.\u000a\u000aThen he met a woman who, he said, "freaked me out."\u000a\u000aLieberman, director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, says he and a family therapist were asked to examine a young woman who some thought was possessed. He and his colleague tried to treat the woman for several months but gave up because they had no success.\u000a\u000aThe film "The Rite" is based on the life of the Rev. Gary Thomas, one of the leading exorcists in the US.\u000a\u000aSomething happened during the treatment, though, that he still can't explain. After sessions with the woman, he says, he'd go home in the evenings, and the lights in his house would go off by themselves, photographs and artwork would fall or slide off shelves, and he'd experience a piercing headache.\u000a\u000aWhen he mentioned to this to his colleague one day, her response stunned him: She'd been having the exact same experiences.\u000a\u000a"I had to sort of admit that I didn't really know what was going on," Lieberman says. "Because of the bizarre things that occurred, I wouldn't say that (demonic possession) is impossible or categorically rule it out ... although I have very limited empirical evidence to verify its existence."\u000a\u000aThe tragic case of the real 'Emily Rose'\u000a\u000aIf you want to know why so many scientists and doctors like Lieberman are cautious about legitimizing demonic possession, consider one name: Anneliese Michel.\u000a\u000aMichel was a victim in one of the most notorious cases of contemporary exorcism. If you have the stomach for it, go online and listen to audiotapes and watch videos of her exorcisms. The images and sounds will burn themselves into your brain. It sounds like somebody dropped a microphone into hell.\u000a\u000aMichel was a German Catholic woman who died of starvation in 1976 after 67 exorcisms over a period of nine months. She was diagnosed with epilepsy but believed she was possessed. So did her devout Roman Catholic parents. She reportedly displayed some of the classic signs of possession: abnormal strength, aversion to sacred objects, speaking different languages.\u000a\u000aBut authorities later determined that it was Michel's parents and two priests who were responsible for her death. German authorities put them on trial for murder, and they were found guilty of negligent homicide. The 2005 film "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" was based on Michel's ordeal and the subsequent trial.\u000a\u000aThe worst thing you can do to a patient who is delusional is to confirm their delusions. Telling a patient who is struggling that maybe they're possessed by a demon is the worst thing you can do. Steven Novella, a neurologist and professor at Yale School of Medicine\u000a\u000aOne of the leading skeptics of exorcism -- and one of Gallagher's chief critics -- is Steven Novella, a neurologist and professor at Yale School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aHe wrote a lengthy blog post dissecting Gallagher's experience with Julia, the satanic priestess. It could be read as a takedown of exorcisms everywhere.\u000a\u000aHe says Julia probably performed a "cold reading" on Gallagher. It's an old trick of fortune tellers and mediums in which they use vague, probing statements to make canny guesses about someone. (Fortune teller: "I see a recent tragedy in your family." Client: "You mean my sister who got hurt in a car accident? How did you know?")\u000a\u000aOr take the case of a person speaking an unfamiliar language like Latin during a possession.\u000a\u000a"A patient might memorize Latin phrases to throw out during one of their possessions," Novella wrote. "Were they having a conversation in Latin? Did they understand Latin spoken to them? Or did they just speak Latin?"\u000a\u000aNovella says it's noteworthy that no one has filmed any paranormal event such as levitation or sacred objects flying across the room during an exorcism. He's seen exorcism tapes posted online and in documentaries and says they're not scary.\u000a\u000a"They're boring," he says. "Nothing exciting happens. The most you get is some really bad play-acting by the person who is being exorcised."\u000a\u000aIn an interview, Novella went further and criticized any therapist who believes his patient's delusions.\u000a\u000a"The worst thing you can do to a patient who is delusional is to confirm their delusions," says Novella, who founded the New England Skeptical Society.\u000a\u000a"The primary goal of therapy is to reorient them to reality. Telling a patient who is struggling that maybe they're possessed by a demon is the worst thing you can do. It's only distracting them from addressing what the real problem is."\u000a\u000aThe 2005 horror film "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" was loosely based on the death of Anneliese Michel.\u000a\u000aDriscoll, the Catholic priest who wrote a book about possession, is not a skeptic like Novella. Still, he says, it's not unusual for people on drugs or during psychotic episodes to display abnormal strength.\u000a\u000a"I have seen it take four grown guys to hold one small woman down," says Driscoll, a chaplain at St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Ottawa, Illinois. "When a person has no fear and is not in their right mind and they don't care about hurting themselves or hurting others, you can see heartbreaking things."\u000a\u000aThat doesn't mean he thinks possession isn't real. He says the New Testament is full of accounts of Jesus confronting demons.\u000a\u000a"Do I still believe it happens? Yes, I do," he says. "It happened then. I don't know why it would be totally eradicated now."\u000a\u000aGallagher agrees and has answers for skeptics like Novella.\u000a\u000aHe says demons won't submit to lab studies or allow themselves to be easily recorded by video equipment. They want to sow doubt, not confirm their existence, he says. Nor will the church compromise the privacy of a person suffering from possession just to provide film to skeptics.\u000a\u000aGallagher says he sees his work with the possessed as an extension of his responsibilities as a doctor.\u000a\u000aIn a passage from a book he is working on about demonic possession in America, he says that it is the duty of a physician to help people in great distress "without concern whether they have debatable or controversial conditions."\u000a\u000aGallagher isn't the first psychiatrist to feel such duty. Dr. M. Scott Peck, the late author of "The Road Less Traveled," conducted two exorcisms himself -- something Gallagher considers unwise and dangerous for any psychiatrist.\u000a\u000a"I didn't go volunteering for this," he says. "I went into this because different people over the last few decades realized that I was open to this sort of thing. The referrals are almost invariably from priests. It's not like someone is walking into my office and I say, 'You must be possessed.' "\u000a\u000aWhat happened to Satan's queen\u000a\u000aHe may not have asked to join the "hidden" world of exorcism, but he is an integral part of that community today. He's been featured in stories and documentaries about exorcism and is on the governing board of the Rome-based International Association of Exorcists.\u000a\u000a"It's deepened my faith," he says of the exorcisms he's witnessed. "It didn't radically change it, but it validated my faith."\u000a\u000aHe says he's received thanks from many people he's helped over the years. Some wept, grateful to him for not dismissing them as delusional. As for letting a journalist talk to any of these people, Gallagher says he zealously guards their privacy.\u000a\u000aBelief in possession exists in many religious traditions. Here, a man enters a state of possession during an African voodoo ceremony.\u000a\u000aJulia, though, gave him permission to tell her story. But it didn't have a happy ending.\u000a\u000aHe and a team of exorcists continued to see her, but eventually, she called a halt to the sessions. She was too ambivalent. She relished some of the abilities she displayed during her trances. She was "playing both sides."\u000a\u000a"Exorcism is not some kind of magical incantation," Gallagher says. "Normally, a person has to make their own sincere spiritual efforts, too."\u000a\u000aAbout a year after she dropped out, Gallagher says, he heard Julia's voice on the phone again. This time, she had called to tell him she was dying of cancer.\u000a\u000aGallagher says he offered to try to help her with a team of priests while she was still physically able, but her response was terse:\u000a\u000a"Well, I'll give it some thought."\u000a\u000aHe says he never heard from her again.\u000a\u000aInevitably, there will be others. His phone will ring. A priest will tell him a story. A team of clergy and nuns will be summoned. And the man of science will enter the hidden world of exorcism again.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe critics, the souls that aren't saved, the creepy encounters -- they don't seem to deter him.\u000a\u000a"Truly informed exorcists don't tend to get discouraged," he says, "because they know it is our Lord who delivers the person, not themselves."\u000a\u000aIs Gallagher doing God's work, or does he need deliverance from his own delusions?\u000a\u000aPerhaps only God -- and Satan -- knows for sure.

aVNew York (CNN) Jadon and Anias McDonald, the twins born joined at the head whose separation surgery captivated millions around the world, were gently placed in a red wagon.\u000a\u000aThey lay side by side, Anias in a blue jumpsuit and Jadon in a gray one. They wore specially fitted white helmets, but there was no evidence of the tubes, IVs or monitors that have been their lifelines since surgery.\u000a\u000aOutside the room, more than 30 doctors, nurses and staff at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center lined the hallway. A red carpet was rolled out for the boys.\u000a\u000aIt was time to say goodbye.\u000a\u000aAmong those on hand Wednesday were lead neurosurgeon Dr. James Goodrich and lead plastic surgeon Dr. Oren Tepper. Both were armed with celebratory baby rattles. Others waved pom-poms and shook tambourines as the boys made their way down the hall of the 10th-floor pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\u000a\u000aThe staff had posted a sign on the wall: "Way to go! You did it! We are so proud of you."\u000a\u000aSitting at the front of the wagon was the boys' 3-year-old brother, Aza.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Conjoined twins separated: New life, apart Anias, left, and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head, something only seen in 1 out of every 2.5 million live births.

Hide Caption 21 of 21\u000a\u000aThe boys' father, Christian McDonald, pulled the wagon as their mother, Nicole, walked with them. Both parents paused to hug almost everyone.\u000a\u000aThe moment stood in stark contrast to the boys' arrival on February 18. On that day, the twins were on a private flight to New York from Illinois. While in the air, Anias stopped breathing and turned blue. Nicole, a pediatric physical therapist, did everything she knew to try to rouse him and worried Jadon would soon be next.\u000a\u000a"It was a 10-minute period when all of this was happening where (Anias) was in and out of consciousness," Nicole said.\u000a\u000aThey were rushed to the emergency room immediately upon landing. It turned out Anias was suffering from a severe strain of the flu.\u000a\u000aAnd now, here the family was, leaving the same hospital amid such jubilation. They were headed to Blythedale Children's Hospital, a specialty facility in suburban New York where they will undergo months of rehabilitation, including physical, occupational and speech therapy.\u000a\u000a"It's the most exciting step for me, because I want to see what they can do," Nicole told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta moments before she left the twins' hospital room for the last time. "We've all come to agreement that it's not goodbye. It's just a see-you-later."\u000a\u000aAdded Christian, "I'm excited. No ifs, ands or buts about it. I'm just so glad. From this point on, we can actually be all together as a family."\u000a\u000aIt marked two months to the day since the 27-hour surgery to separate the boys ended on October 14 -- what their dad described as a moment of "hope and a chance for a normal life." It also marked one of the fastest such recoveries on record\u000a\u000aGoodrich, who earlier in the day performed craniofacial reconstruction surgery on a 9-month-old boy, acknowledged that he'd miss the twins.\u000a\u000a"Am I happy to see them go? No," he said. "But it's time to move on. It's time for the next stage."\u000a\u000a'They're so cute'\u000a\u000aThe day before, Jadon and Anias took a similar wagon ride. It was the first time they'd ever left their room for something non-medical. This time, the staff wanted to throw them a farewell party.\u000a\u000aAza McDonald, 3, crawls into the wagon next to his twin brothers before the party.\u000a\u000aThe wagon carries meaning for the parents. After they were born, the only way the conjoined twins could be moved was for their parents to pull them in a red wagon. As the months passed, the two could no longer fit in it. They had grown too long.\u000a\u000aAs they rode Tuesday, they looked up at their mother and held hands. Jadon's head was fully revealed, with none of the bandages that once covered his scalp. Anias, whose skull cap was removed following persistent post-surgical infections, wore a turquoise knit cap.\u000a\u000aAfter a quick elevator ride to the second floor, the boys made their way through a maze of hallways and into the hospital's Grand Hall banquet room.\u000a\u000aAwaiting them were more than two dozen staff members, from the nurses and doctors on the surgical team to those in the PICU who've gotten to know the boys best. There were tears and hugs, smiles and moments of glee.\u000a\u000aAnd photos. Lots of photos.\u000a\u000aGoodrich, the world's leading expert on craniopagus surgery and the boys' main surgeon, whipped out his iPhone and snapped commemorative shots.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Separated twins 'ahead of schedule' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Separated twins 'ahead of schedule' 03:50\u000a\u000a"It's a pretty emotional day, I've got to say," said Goodrich, who delivered homemade cookies and other treats to the twins' room before the party.\u000a\u000aAnother guest was Martin O'Malley, a longtime Bronx resident who lives across the street from the McDonalds. He's helped raise donations for the family, delivered them food and felt compelled to join the party.\u000a\u000a"It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing," said O'Malley, 83, whose twin sister died at birth. "It's hard to imagine just two months ago they were attached. I'm so happy for this family."\u000a\u000aDr. Carrie Stern, a plastic surgeon resident who took part in the surgery, glanced at the boys in the wagon and whispered, "They're so cute. It's just so amazing seeing them from beginning to end."\u000a\u000a'So many unknowns'\u000a\u000aA week before the party, Nicole and Christian tended to the boys in their room. They couldn't help but wonder about the future for Jadon and Anias.\u000a\u000aThey know about Carl and Clarence Aguirre, craniopagus twins from the Philippines whom Goodrich separated 12 years ago. With twins joined at the head, one is more dominant, his body working overtime to keep the other twin alive.\u000a\u000aCarl was the non-dominant child. He suffered a neurological decline a little over a year after surgery, resulting in permanent disabilities. He speaks only a few words and is confined to a wheelchair.\u000a\u000aWhen the McDonald twins were joined, Jadon was dominant. Since the surgery, Anias has suffered multiple seizures, in addition to having his skull cap removed. He will undergo another surgery when he is 7 to insert bone. For now, his skin is the only thing covering the top of his head, and he will have to wear a protective helmet.\u000a\u000a"There are just so many unknowns," Christian said. "We just don't know how it's all going to turn out."\u000a\u000aAdded Nicole, "Because we know other cases have had that regression, you just hope and pray that that doesn't happen in this circumstance."\u000a\u000aThe couple gave up their jobs in Illinois and moved to the Bronx to be close to the hospital. When the new year arrives, they'll face a $15,000 insurance deductible, plus whatever unexpected costs might arise. Their apartment lease is up in February, and they don't know whether to renew for another year, because it's unclear how long the boys will be in rehab.\u000a\u000aNicole and Christian McDonald with 3-year-old son Aza and the twins before surgery.\u000a\u000aThe couple started a GoFundMe page after the twins were born, but after donations swelled to nearly $300,000, the McDonalds told well-wishers to instead help a friend's child in need of a kidney transplant. With the long-term financial reality of their situation sinking in, they are once again receptive to people giving.\u000a\u000a"I feel like we've got a long ways to go," Christian said.\u000a\u000aHe noted that Anias will be cognizant by age 7, aware of the surgery he will have to face to repair his skull cap: "My heart already goes out to him."\u000a\u000aChristian and Nicole faced a decision no parent should have to make. Craniopagus twins occur in one out of every 2.5 million births. About 40% are stillborn, and another third die within 24 hours. Of those who survive, 80% die of medical complications by age 2 if not separated.\u000a\u000aMom and Dad said they have no regrets about choosing surgery.\u000a\u000a"When you walk into the room and Jadon throws his arms up and wants you to pick him up and you can! He looks at me," Nicole said. "He wiggles from side to side. He giggles. And I can just swoop him up and just hold him and feel his warmth."\u000a\u000aOf Anias, she said, "He has really come full circle and begun doing all the things he used to do. And that's been so encouraging, because I always had that worry about Anias."\u000a\u000aAs she spoke, the boys held hands on a bed where Mom spread them out. At one point, Jadon pulled Anias' hand to his face and then nibbled on his brother's finger. Mom quickly intervened to save Anias from being bitten.\u000a\u000aA sense of parental normalcy, when nothing is normal.\u000a\u000aAfter nine months, 'rebirth'\u000a\u000aAt the goodbye party, doctors, nurses and staff sat around tables, a buffet of chicken, salmon, green beans, mashed potatoes and salad behind them ready for the feast.\u000a\u000aAza bounced around the room, excited for the twins.\u000a\u000aAll eyes were on Dr. Steven M. Safyer, president and CEO of Montefiore Medicine, as he told Nicole and Christian how the 35,000 Montefiore employees have been rooting for their boys and consider them family.\u000a\u000a"I believe that for life, you're members of our world, and this is a wonderful world," Safyer said.\u000a\u000aHe noted that it's been nine months since he first met the family and that "in a way, this is a nine-month deal. This is the rebirth of these two guys."\u000a\u000aTepper, the lead plastic surgeon, told the crowd he was humbled by the fact that the "McDonalds chose us. They put their trust in us to take care of their boys."\u000a\u000a"Hands down, unquestionably, the two leaders of this team are Jadon and Anias," Tepper added. "It's their resilience, it's their determination that steered this voyage. There's a reason the world calls them 'The Little Warriors.' "\u000a\u000aGoodrich told the crowd he remembered speaking by phone with Nicole the first time, back when the boys were in utero and she was wondering what could be done to separate them. She told Goodrich she had just one question. Forty-five minutes later, they were still talking: "Totally in tune and all the right questions."\u000a\u000aThe neurosurgeon thanked everyone in the room, from hospital brass to his team in the operating room to Christian and Nicole. Then he held up a hand-written note he received from Ireland, "to show you how far this story went."\u000a\u000aIt was addressed simply:\u000a\u000aDr. James Goodrich, surgeon\u000a\u000aChildren's Hospital Montefiore Medical Center\u000a\u000aAmerica\u000a\u000aNo ZIP code. No city or street address. "Somebody in the postal system got this to me," Goodrich said.\u000a\u000aWhen it came time for the parents to speak, the room grew quiet. Many clutched tissues and dabbed their eyes.\u000a\u000aChristian told the group that as grateful as he and Nicole are, they will "never be half as grateful" as their sons.\u000a\u000a"Sixteen years down the road," he said, "they're going to be driving their car. They're going to be maybe out on a date. ... Just the fact that they'll be able to go to the bathroom and take a shower by themselves. They're not going to take those things for granted."\u000a\u000aIt's ordinary for people working their jobs, he said, to not fully grasp the significance of their work.\u000a\u000a"Maybe on one of those hard days," he told them, "when it may feel like another day at the office, please know ... you're going to change people's lives, not only individuals' lives for the better, but you're going to impact whole families' lives for the rest of their life. It's a huge thing."\u000a\u000aBefore the crowd broke into loud applause, Christian ended with a message from his boys: "If I may, I just want to be their voice and say, 'Thank you for giving us, Jadon and Anias, a hope and a chance for a normal life.' "\u000a\u000aThen it was Nicole's turn. She wept as she began. She said she had written three pages of material and then tossed it in the trash. "I decided to throw it away and to get up here and to look at you all in the face and tell you just how I feel."\u000a\u000aWhen she was pregnant, she told the crowd, she knew that her boys would be separated and that "this would be the outcome."\u000a\u000a"I knew that I would have a miracle. I didn't know how." She repeated, "I didn't know how."\u000a\u000a"I prayed every day for God to make the how happen, and you are all the how," she said through tears.\u000a\u000aShe said that she considered everyone in the room part of her family and that saying goodbye was extraordinarily difficult. "That is a huge testament to you that we don't want to leave here. That's an odd thing that somebody doesn't want to leave the hospital. Everyone is usually itching to get out. We want to stay. I want the boys to talk here first. I want you to see all that, because it was you that contributed to our miracle."\u000a\u000aShe compared her boys' transition to a caterpillar's metamorphosis into a butterfly.\u000a\u000a"Every one of you have been the fiber of that cocoon. You have been what has brought us to this moment: And now they will fly."\u000a\u000aThere wasn't a dry eye in the room. Nicole handed out gifts, from framed hand-drawn butterfly paintings to photo collages of the boys' progress over the months. Dad tended to Aza while Nicole's mom picked Jadon up and glided around the room with him in her arms.\u000a\u000aMany of the workers were on the clock. They scarfed down food quickly because, after all, there are more kids who need their care.\u000a\u000aThe featured dessert was a cake with white frosting decorated in black with the symbol for infinity, which is also used to represent conjoined twins and, now, the family's infinite love for the hospital team.\u000a\u000a"Anias and Jadon," read the black lettering. "God has answered + God has heard."\u000a\u000aPlastic surgeon Stern stepped up. Two months ago in the operating room, she was the surgeon who made the final cut that separated the twins.\u000a\u000aNow, she made the first cut of the cake that marked the next step of their journey.\u000a\u000aDr. Oren Tepper holds a thank you gift the McDonald family presented to him during the party.\u000a\u000aA new space\u000a\u000aThe boys' wagon ride on Wednesday took them to the lobby of Montefiore, where paramedics and EMTs transferred them to stretchers. Aza jumped onto the stretcher carrying Jadon. More staffers crowded the lobby to send them off.\u000a\u000aTwo ambulances awaited outside, one for each twin. Aza cried uncontrollably when he had to get off the stretcher as Jadon was being placed in his ambulance.\u000a\u000aIt was 2:58 p.m. when the twins left.

aVWhen it comes to taxes, Rand Paul wants them simple and flat.\u000a\u000aThe blunt-spoken, Libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky, who won the 2016 presidential straw poll among leading conservatives, favors a flat tax: a one-rate income tax system with a minimum of tax breaks for individuals and businesses.\u000a\u000aBut Paul hasn't settled on what that rate should be.\u000a\u000aHe has publicly discussed 17%. An aide said if Paul does make a formal proposal, the rate would not be higher than 17% and could be lower.\u000a\u000aMuch would depend on which tax breaks Paul chooses to keep. Two would definitely remain: the standard deduction and personal exemptions. But both would be considerably larger than they are under today's code.\u000a\u000aThe Paul aide said the senator might also consider preserving in some form the tax breaks for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.\u000a\u000aPaul hasn't ruled out other types of tax reform if they "eliminate" complexity and regulation. But he has sketched out his views on a flat tax over the past few years.\u000a\u000a"What you'd have is an attrition if not an outright elimination of the IRS because it would be so simple that people would comply, and it would be very simple to know whether they complied or not," Paul told Fox News last year.\u000a\u000aUnder a Paul flat tax, an individual would owe taxes on his wages, salaries and pension payments. But fringe benefits at work would remain tax free to workers, as they are today. One example of that is the contribution employers make to pay for workers' health insurance.\u000a\u000aCapital gains, dividends and interest would also be tax free at the individual level, but would be taxed at the business level. Capital gains on owner-occupied housing would also be tax free.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Paul would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.\u000a\u000aRelated: Paul takes step toward White House run\u000a\u000aCould a flat tax no higher than 17% raise as much revenue as the current system? No. To do that you'd need to have a rate at least in the low- to mid-20% range, said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate of the Tax Policy Center.\u000a\u000aBut raising the same amount of revenue isn't Paul's goal.\u000a\u000aOn the contrary, Paul favors tax reform that would raise less revenue than today's tax code is projected to. At the same time, he wants to eliminate deficits within five years and proposes to do so in large part by reducing spending (as a percent of the size of the economy) every year over a decade.\u000a\u000aPaul asserts that his flat tax would be progressive since the net percentage of one's wages paid in taxes would rise along with income.\u000a\u000aHere's a simplified example of what that means: Say a married couple with two kids makes $100,000 in wages and is allowed to exempt $35,000 for their standard deduction and $6,500 for each dependent. Their total exemption would be $48,000.\u000a\u000aSo they would pay 17% on the remaining $52,000 of their income, or $8,840 in federal income taxes. That represents 8.84% of their gross income, which is their net effective tax rate.\u000a\u000aIf the same couple made $200,000 in wages, they would owe $25,840 in taxes for an effective tax rate of 12.92%.\u000a\u000aBut the overall effective rate could be lower still for high-income households because they are more likely to have investment income, which would be tax free under Paul's guidelines.\u000a\u000aRelated: Republican tax reform plan unveiled\u000a\u000aAnd, Rosenberg noted, the 15.3% payroll tax -- which is money that workers and their employers pay into Social Security and Medicare -- would still be the biggest tax bite for low-income households.\u000a\u000aA pure flat tax system wouldn't alter the payroll tax, although it's not clear whether Paul would like to.\u000a\u000aIdeally, he would prefer a flat tax in which no one pays more than they currently do. But he has implied, and his aide confirmed, that if the effective rates of the very wealthy go up to ensure that the income tax burdens on lower and middle-income families don't increase, he would be okay with that.\u000a\u000aUnless he puts out a detailed flat-tax proposal, however, it's impossible to say definitively who would be helped or hurt by the changes.\u000a\u000aOf course, if Paul decides to run for president in 2016, he would hardly be the first Republican candidate to call for a flat tax.\u000a\u000aSteve Forbes ran on a 17% flat tax in 2000. Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich ran on an optional flat tax in 2012. Their rival Herman Cain proposed a flat-ish tax called 9-9-9. And there have been plenty of flat-tax proposals introduced in Congress over the years.\u000a\u000aIt's not at all clear when Congress will take up the issue of tax reform seriously, or if a flat tax of some kind would ever garner sufficient support. Many believe not much will happen to overhaul the tax code until the next president takes office in 2017.\u000a\u000aBut should Paul make a run for the White House, you can expect to hear more about the flat tax over the next couple of years.

aVPoliticians are racing to show the world how quickly their countries can go green.\u000a\u000aIndia, France, Britain and Norway all want to completely ditch gas and diesel cars in favor of cleaner vehicles.\u000a\u000aAt least 10 other countries have set sales targets for electric cars.\u000a\u000aWith electric and hybrid vehicles accounting for just 3% of global auto sales, according to IHS Markit, the goals are best viewed as political aspirations.\u000a\u000a"It's really unclear. These are political statements. Until we get more details, it's really hard to understand what the implications really are," said Al Bedwell, a director at LMC Automotive.\u000a\u000aHere's a look at the goals by country:\u000a\u000aBritain: The U.K. said Wednesday that it would ban sales of new gasoline and diesel cars starting in 2040 as part of a bid to clean up the country's air.\u000a\u000aBy 2050, all cars on the road will need to have zero emissions.\u000a\u000a"We can't carry on with diesel and petrol cars," U.K. environment secretary Michael Gove told the BBC. "There is no alternative to embracing new technology."\u000a\u000aRelated: Britain bans gasoline and diesel cars starting in 2040\u000a\u000aNearly 2.7 million new cars were registered in the U.K. in 2016, making it the sixth biggest market for car sales in the world.\u000a\u000aStephanie Brinley, senior autos analyst at IHS Markit, said getting rid of gas-guzzling cars would be difficult. But if politicians are serious, manufacturers will have to respond.\u000a\u000a"The big automakers are highly unlikely to just abandon the market," she said. "They'll find a way."\u000a\u000aFrance: The government announced earlier this month that it wants to end sales of gas and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 as it fights global warming.\u000a\u000aAfter that date, automakers will only be allowed to sell cars that run on electricity or other cleaner power. Hybrid cars will also be permitted.\u000a\u000aNicolas Hulot, the government official in charge of France's "ecological transition," said the goal would help the nation's automakers "innovate and become market leaders."\u000a\u000aThe share of cars powered by electric, hybrid and alternative fuels in France is small -- about 4% -- but growing fast. Sales of those vehicles were up 25% in the first quarter of 2017.\u000a\u000aIndia: New Delhi said earlier this year that every vehicle sold in the country should be powered by electricity by 2030.\u000a\u000a"This is an aspirational target," said Anil Kumar Jain, a government energy adviser. "Ultimately the logic of markets will prevail."\u000a\u000aIndia, which suffers from an especially acute air quality problem, is home to many of the world's most polluted cities.\u000a\u000aRelated: Delhi's fight for clean air\u000a\u000aBut it's also a country where policy can make a big difference.\u000a\u000aThe number of cars on the country's roads is expected to explode over the coming years as four-wheel vehicles become more affordable for the middle class.\u000a\u000aIf families purchasing a car for the first time are able to buy electric, the country could leapfrog ahead of some developed economies.\u000a\u000aNorway: The government's transportation plan outlines a clear target: All new passenger cars and vans sold in 2025 should be zero-emission vehicles.\u000a\u000aThe country is considered a leader in this area. About 40% of all cars sold in the country last year were electric or hybrid vehicles.\u000a\u000aRelated: Why India's transport chief is shunning driverless cars\u000a\u000aThe others: At least 10 other countries have electric car sales targets in place, according to the International Energy Agency.\u000a\u000aAustria, China, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Korea and Spain have set official targets for electric car sales. The United States doesn't have a federal policy, but at least eight states have set out goals.\u000a\u000aChina -- which buys more cars than any other country -- is also the largest electric car market. China accounts for more than 40% of the electric cars sold in the world and more than double the number sold in the U.S., according to the IEA.\u000a\u000aThe IEA report contains an alarming statistic that shows just how far many other countries have to go:\u000a\u000aGlobally, 95% of electric cars are sold in only 10 countries: China, the U.S., Japan, Canada, Norway, the U.K., France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.

See more here.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The lush green planet that we call home may have actually looked purple in its earliest days, according to the "Purple Earth hypothesis."\u000a\u000aNo, this doesn't mean there were purple trees or purple grass or purple animals. It would have been before any multicellular organisms even evolved, when single-cell microorganisms dominated the planet and possibly created a purple hue that could be seen from space.\u000a\u000aThese purple organisms may have reigned supreme and existed in varying concentrations across the planet, said Shiladitya DasSarma, a microbiologist and professor at the University of Maryland. DasSarma has studied one of these microorganisms and created the Purple Earth hypothesis.\u000a\u000aBut what if Earth wasn't the only planet that experienced this purple phase? What if this hypothesis could give us insight into potential life on exoplanets, the planets outside our solar system? Scientists are in the process of figuring that out.\u000a\u000a"That's where it might make a difference when we look at exoplanets. We would want to consider that the pigments on an alien planet might be different than what we have on modern Earth," DasSarma said. "And if the Purple Earth hypothesis was correct and there was a dominance of purple organisms in the early Earth, then we might be able to find another planet that's at an earlier stage of evolution of the planet, where the purple pigments might have dominated."\u000a\u000aRead More

Please see below for a full rushed transcript.\u000a\u000aMANDATORY CREDIT // CNN The Situation Room\u000a\u000aAdditional information: The Situation Room:http://www.cnn.com/shows/situation-room\u000a\u000aSTORY: Clinton agrees to N.H debate\u2014 but won\u2019\u2019t commit to more\u000a\u000aText highlights:\u000a\u000aClinton on the possibility of more Democratic Presidential debates: [BLITZER]:"So you are willing to commit to three specific dates for additional debates after New Hampshire? [CLINTON]: Oh, I said, look, I'm - we have another one shortly after New Hampshire, as I remember, on the calendar. And I said we should start looking for dates and working to get those scheduled. I'm perfectly fine with that.But first things first. We have to agree that we're going to debate in New Hampshire, both the governor and I have agreed and we're waiting for the senator to decide to join us. [BLITZER]: So I just want to be precise. After the Democratic National Committee sanctions debates, you are now ready to commit to three more debates, is that right?[CLINTON]: Well, I have been very public in saying I would like the DNC to work with all of the campaigns, because that's what it did when it set up this schedule and obviously, we want to be supportive. But I am urging publicly that we do this debate next week in New Hampshire. And then I've said I am more than happy for us to start scheduling additional debates as we go through the spring and April and May and try to get those on the calendar.\u201d\u000a\u000aClinton responds to Trump\u2019s veterans event and tonight\u2019s GOP debate: "You know, I am certainly not going to get into the machinations of the Republican Party primary process, other than to say I deeply regret the tone, the rhetoric that you're hearing, not only from Mr. Trump, but a number of the other candidates, the kinds of insulting remarks they're making about groups of people in our country, their strong opposition to The Affordable Care Act, wanting to defund Planned Parenthood, coming back to trickle down economics.\u000a\u000aYou know, it's really quite a disturbing spectacle that we have going on. So whether or not they are together when they debate and reinforce these positions, which I think would be so harmful to our country, is something that, you know, they have to decide among themselves.But I'm going to continue to point out the stakes in this election, because ultimately, it will come down to one Democratic nominee and one Republican, who are fighting for the future of America. And I strongly disagree with the direction that the Republicans intend to take our country. And that's why I'm fighting so hard to be that Democratic nominee, to be able to make the case that we want to build on the progress we've made and we sure don't want the Republicans ripping it all apart."\u000a\u000aClinton on female voter turnout in the election: "Well, look, I am thrilled to have so much support from leading women in our country, from elected women, from women activists, from organizations like Planned Parenthood fighting for women's rights. I'm running to be president because I think I have the best combination of experience, qualifications, plans and ability to get the job done.\u000a\u000aBut I do think it's an asset to be running to be the first woman president. And I want everyone, women and men, in all parts of our country, to join me in making sure we build on the progress we've made and not let the Republicans rip away the White House and set us back."\u000a\u000aClinton responds to the idea of appointing President Obama to the Supreme Court: "Well, I have no idea that he'd ever be interested, but it was a fascinating idea. And if I'm so fortune enough to be president and get the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, which I hope I do, then I would certainly talk to him about it. I think he has other plans for his future, but hey, it would be worth the effort. We know he's a brilliant writer. He taught constitutional law. So I think it's worth a try."\u000a\u000aFULL POST

aV(CNN) One of the most eloquent opponents of Texas' proposed gender bathroom law began identifying as a girl four years ago, when she was 3.\u000a\u000aIt was at that age that Frank and Rachel Gonzales started to realize their child, Libby, wasn't living the life she was born to live.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't always clear to them how best to support their first born. While on a family trip to California, Rachel took Libby -- then still called by her birth name -- to the toy store. It was there that things "came to a boil."\u000a\u000a"I said, 'You can pick out anything from the gift store,' " Rachel recalled. Libby pointed at a fairy costume with a pink skirt and wings. "This is what I want."\u000a\u000aLong before that moment, the Gonzaleses say, they saw the "early signs" their child was not her "authentic self." There were times when they thought maybe their child was gay. It wasn't until around the age of 4 or 5, when their child began to verbalize more to them who she really was, that they accepted it, too. Their child was transgender.\u000a\u000aLibby, flashing the peace sign, with her mom, Rachel, and little sister Ceci.\u000a\u000aIn the months and weeks that followed, Libby began to transition. She asked to grow out her hair; she gravitated to more stereotypically girl toys and said she felt more comfortable wearing girl clothing.\u000a\u000aIt was around January 2016 when she asked her mom whether Santa could turn her into a girl next Christmas.\u000a\u000a"At that point, I said, 'You don't have to wait until next Christmas, it's January. Let's go shopping,' " Rachel recounted. That was the weekend her son became her daughter.\u000a\u000aNow, at age 7, Libby is living the life she has always wanted to, as a girl.\u000a\u000a"The weekend that she finally expressed to us that she could not go on living another day with anyone thinking that she's a boy, we cried a lot," said Frank. "We weren't upset to have a trans kid; we just knew what was ahead of us and what was ahead for her. It's really scary as a parent."\u000a\u000aThey soon began to educate themselves about what being trans meant. They spoke to doctors and professionals both inside and outside the trans community, hoping to better understand their daughter.\u000a\u000a"It's not something that we immediately jumped on board with," Frank said of his daughter's transition. "We were very cautious; we were very hesitant, maybe too hesitant in hindsight, to accept her in her authentic self. In her authentic life."\u000a\u000aLibby with her mom and sister.\u000a\u000a"It's really hard as a parent to go through a transition with your child," Rachel said. "When you have a transgender child, it's not just the child that transitions, it's the family and the community."\u000a\u000aIn the months since Libby transitioned, the parents said, even their more conservative neighbors have been accepting of their daughter.\u000a\u000aIt's the Texas state government they worry about the most.\u000a\u000aThis year, the Legislature proposed "privacy" legislation that would restrict public restroom use for transgender people. Under the proposed law, more commonly known as the Texas "bathroom bill," trans men, women and children like Libby would be required to use the restroom based on the gender that's on their birth certificate, not how they identify.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Transgender identity, in their words Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Transgender identity, in their words 02:44\u000a\u000aDuring the regular session, the bill hit a dead end after a contentious debate. Vowing to get a bill on his desk, Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session in June with an agenda that included another effort by conservative lawmakers to pass a modified version of the bill.\u000a\u000a"Another way to avoid a patchwork quilt of conflicting regulations is for Texas to establish a single statewide rule protecting the privacy of women and children," Abbott said before the session began.\u000a\u000a"People want to do business and raise their families in a state that has safe communities, and this law helps achieve that," the governor's press secretary John Wittman said in a statement to CNN.\u000a\u000aThe bill has faced economic pressure from major corporations who have threatened to re-evaluate their business relationship with Texas if the bill is passed.\u000a\u000aAbbott, along with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, has been among the most vocal supporters of the bill. They have sided with proponents who say parents need reassurances that their children are protected in all circumstances while at public school and in intimate spaces.\u000a\u000aThe Gonzaleses believe the law would make their daughter less safe.\u000a\u000a"The current legislation, which is cloaked in saying that it's a women's privacy bill, where the governor himself is calling it a transgender bathroom bill ... would put my daughter in direct harm," Frank said. "It would force her -- and her school to force her -- into a hostile environment to publicly out her every time she needed to use the restroom."\u000a\u000aRachel and Frank Gonzales with their three children, Ceci, right, Libby, front, and Henry, back.\u000a\u000a"The probability of my daughter being victimized in a restroom is exponentially higher than anyone else," Rachel added. "It's such a shame that people are so closed-minded that they want to persecute my daughter for living a life that she was born to live simply because they don't have an understanding of who she is."\u000a\u000aLibby's parents believe the bill is not about who should go to the bathroom where. "I think this is mainly a response to legalizing gay marriage," Frank said. "This is the next battle that conservatives have decided to dig in on."\u000a\u000aDuring the special summer session, the state Senate passed a version of the bill, and now the House is considering its own version.\u000a\u000aLibby's parents say her transition has been in appearance, clothing and behavior only. There has been no medical intervention in her life so far. And though she is only 7, Libby says she knows who she really is and always has known.\u000a\u000aBarefoot on the floor of her Dallas home, Libby giggled as she pet her dog Luna. Libby's hair is long past her shoulders, and she wore a white dress with a big matching white bow pinned into her hair. Tiny earrings shine beneath her curly locks.\u000a\u000aLibby, back, with her mom and sister.\u000a\u000a"What it feels like to be transgender is to be yourself in your very own way," she read from her own testimony at the Texas state capitol earlier this year. "I love my school and my friends, and they love me, too. I don't want to be scared to go to the restroom or anywhere in public. And I never want to use the boy's restroom. It would be so weird."\u000a\u000aHer soft voice got louder as she read the last sentence from a worn piece of crumpled paper. "Please keep me safe," she says. "Thank you."\u000a\u000aAll her parents want is what any parent wants for their child: the best. They balk at those who call them bad parents and who ask, "How can Libby know at 7 that she's a girl?" They hope other parents acknowledge that they're doing the best they can.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"My daughter is a girl. She was born a girl. She is a girl," Rachel said defiantly. "She lives the life of a girl, and there is no reason that she should be going into the boy's restroom, ever. How does your child know who they are? I can't explain that. I can't explain how I know I'm a girl. I can't explain how my daughter knows she's a girl, but I can support her in that life that she was obviously born to live. And I don't have to understand it to know that she needs my love and support to keep her safe."

aV(CNN) There is really just one salient question when it comes to today's decision by the Drug Enforcement Administration to expand the number of growers of research-grade marijuana, while still not changing the scheduling of marijuana: Will this decision make it significantly easier for scientists to study the medical benefits of marijuana?\u000a\u000aThe answer sadly is: unlikely. And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.\u000a\u000aUp until today, the University of Mississippi has been the only federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana in the United States. In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same. The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.\u000a\u000aWhile this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.\u000a\u000aImagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door. In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.\u000a\u000aMarijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.\u000a\u000aThat is the predicament of medical marijuana.\u000a\u000aBecause marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.\u000a\u000aPotential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research. Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance , institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive. There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place. Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press. This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.\u000a\u000aSisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.\u000a\u000aThen, after years of those bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock. Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself. Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.\u000a\u000aThe problem, however, is that last word in NIDA's name: "abuse."\u000a\u000aAccording to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary "Weed," the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine. Abrams makes an important point. Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.\u000a\u000aConsider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years. That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits. The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis," "Cannabis induced pancreatitits" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer." That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture of the harm-benefit ratio.\u000a\u000aContradictory policy\u000a\u000aThe road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.\u000a\u000aWhile the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.\u000a\u000aThe DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.\u000a\u000aThis is one of many quotes from his 1988 petition (PDF) to unschedule marijuana.\u000a\u000a"In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care."\u000a\u000aAgain, that was from a judge with the DEA itself. And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWhether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives. Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.\u000a\u000aWith regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts. The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi , whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.\u000a\u000aThat a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.

aVMark Galeotti is a senior researcher at UMV, the Institute of International Relations Prague, and coordinator of its Centre for European Security. He is a specialist on Russian security affairs, intelligence and organized crime, and is also principal director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, which specializes in Russia research. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Vladimir Putin's counter to new US sanctions on Russia was curiously out of date.\u000a\u000aWhile hyped as a sign that the Kremlin had both lost patience with President Trump and was still willing to show its teeth, it probably better demonstrates Moscow's diminishing range of options than anything else.\u000a\u000aThe US sanctions are directed toward hitting Russia's energy infrastructure in response to its alleged interference in the 2016 US elections. By contrast, the Kremlin is demanding that the Americans cut their diplomatic missions staff in Russia by 755, bringing them down to the same numbers as Moscow's people in Washington.\u000a\u000aThere is a strange asymmetry, given that in the past sanctions and responses have tended to mirror each other, not least for symbolic impact.\u000a\u000aTherefore, it is likely that these were moves originally drawn up in reply to Barack Obama's decision back in December to kick out 35 diplomats and seal off two Russian compounds in response to meddling in the elections.\u000a\u000aBack then, Moscow decided not to respond, making a grand public play of its forbearance. After all, Trump was heading for the White House, and there were still hopes in Putin's team that his fulsome praise of Russia might be translated into some practical gains.\u000a\u000aSince then, though, the Russians have learned the painful lesson that Trump promises more than he can deliver and have watched as a suspicious Congress, a hostile media and a rolling judicial investigation increasingly tie his hands when it comes to working with Moscow.\u000a\u000aWith this new round of sanctions, Putin clearly felt he could not afford not to respond. For a leader who has built so much of his personal legitimacy on his image as the defender of Russian interests, the risk was that he would look weak.\u000a\u000aBut the fact that the best they could do was, in effect, to pull some old counter-sanctions out of the deep freeze, underlines the sharp disparity between Moscow and Washington's positions.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Putin retaliates over looming US sanctions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Putin retaliates over looming US sanctions 02:01\u000a\u000aThis latest move will certainly inconvenience both the US State Department and also any Russian wanting a US visa or otherwise hoping to use the services of America's embassy and consulates there. It will be especially problematic for all those Russians employed by the US government who will find themselves unemployed.\u000a\u000aBut while Putin called these "biting" measures, that is something of an exaggeration. In the grand scheme of things, they will be pretty limited in their impact. Diplomatic contacts will continue, visas will be processed -- albeit more slowly. Exchanges will still take place.\u000a\u000aThe truth of the matter is that while Putin had rather more "biting" options at his disposal, they would hurt him more that they would hurt the Americans. NASA, for example, still depends on Russian rockets to loft its astronauts to the International Space Station, and Moscow could have refused to do this any more -- but that would have cost Russia's cash-strapped space program almost a billion dollars in 2017 and 2018 alone.\u000a\u000aLikewise, Russia exports nothing essential to America, and with a GDP smaller than that of New York state's, there is minimal scope for other economic moves.\u000a\u000aSo discount the instant "Putin gets tough" headlines.\u000a\u000aNot only are the Russians still desperate not to burn their bridges with Trump -- tellingly, the counter-sanctions were announced after the US measures were passed on the Hill, but before the presidential signature, so they can be sold as a response to "Congress's sanctions" -- these are eye-catching but essentially empty measures.\u000a\u000aAs ever, Putin is trying to look tough, while being in an extremely weak position.

aV(CNN) On Sunday, in the midst of a self-proclaimed working vacation, President Trump took to Twitter to insist his many accomplishments in his first 6 months in office were being overlooked by the media.\u000a\u000aLet's set aside for a moment the specious claim that the media has not reported on these issues. It has. (Here are but one post each on the Supreme Court , the economy and jobs border and military security and ISIS and MS-13 .)\u000a\u000aBut given his allegation, I thought it made sense to run through each of his claims of success -- providing context and some sense of how much (or little) he's actually accomplished. Below I break down each claim in the order Trump touted them.\u000a\u000aHere we go!\u000a\u000a* Supreme Court\u000a\u000aThis is an unmitigated success for Trump. His nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court was widely touted by conservatives. And, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had to change the Senate rules to get Gorsuch confirmed -- after Harry Reid had done the same thing for lower court justices a few years back -- Gorsuch is currently sitting on the Court. And at 49, he will likely be there for a long time. (Trump's success here also got an assist from McConnell for refusing to hold a hearing for Barack Obama's nominee to fill that seat.)\u000a\u000aRULING: Trump success.\u000a\u000a* "Surging economy & jobs"\u000a\u000aLet's take the second part first, since it's easier to quantify.\u000a\u000aIn July, the U.S. economy created 209,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Since January, the economy has created 1,290,000 jobs. (That includes all of January despite the fact Trump has only been president since Jan. 20.) By comparison, in the first 7 months of 2016, 1,372,000 jobs were created.\u000a\u000aIt's tougher to agree on objective measures as to whether the economy is "surging." Trump is likely referring here to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which crested 22,000 for the first time ever last week . There's no question that Trump's election -- and the sense among much of the corporate world that he will be better for them than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton -- has played a role in the stock mart surge. Check out this chart detailing the surge via the good folks at CNN Money:\u000a\u000aAside from the stock market, the other most-referenced sign of the strength of an economy is Gross Domestic Product -- essentially a measure of all of the value being created by a country. As of the end of last month, GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.6% in the second quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Commerce Departmen t. That was an increase on the 1.2% annual growth in the first quarter of the year.\u000a\u000aFor context, here's the annual GDP growth rate for the last 5 years, starting with 2016: 1.5%, 2.9%, 2.6%, 1.7%, 2.2%. The average GDP in the first two quarters of 2017 is 1.9%. If that's where it ends up, 2017 will be right in the middle of GDP growth rates over the past six years. (There is, of course, the possibility GDP growth will speed or slow considerably in the coming months.) Trump's more ambitious goal and promise is to get the country to 4% annual growth rate.\u000a\u000aSo, to claim the economy and jobs are "surging" is somewhat misleading, although there's no question the stock market is booming -- and has been since Trump took office.\u000a\u000aRULING: Partial Trump success\u000a\u000a* "Border & military security"\u000a\u000aThe most common way to measure border security is by how many "inadmissibles" -- people who are trying to enter the country but lack the legal status to do so -- are apprehended at the border. According to Customs and Border Protection stats , there have been 414,241 "enforcement actions" so far in 2017 as compared to 690,637 in 2016 and 592,459 in 2015. Obviously those are not apples to apples comparisons due to the fact that the 2017 numbers are only through June 3. But, extrapolating outward would suggest more " inadmissibles " will be turned around in 2017 than in the previous two years. Along the southwestern border, the US Border Patrol estimates that apprehensions have increased by 37% over 2016\u000a\u000aIt's much harder to know what Trump means when he says "military security." Does he mean the safety of military bases in the US and around the world? Does he mean security for military families in terms of benefits? Does he mean spending on defense initiatives to ensure our military have all the resources they need? He doesn't make it clear. So, I'm not going to try to read his mind; this part of Trump's claim gets a "not available" since we can't put data to a term we don't even really know. Trump did propose an increase in defense spending, but Congress proposed an even larger one . No agreement has been reached on defense spending for 2018.\u000a\u000aRULING: Trump success on border security; unclear on military\u000a\u000a* "ISIS & MS-13"\u000a\u000aThe battle against ISIS may be the hardest thing to measure of any of the successes Trump tweeted about. Why? Because there are all sorts of different organizations that use all sorts of different measures to assess the status of the fight against ISIS. On Friday, Brett McGurk, who heads up the anti-ISIS efforts within the State Department claimed that one-third of all the land reclaimed from ISIS since 2014 has been done since Trump took office . McGurk said that ISIS since its apex has lost 27,000 square miles -- 8,000 of which have been taken back during the Trump administration by ground forces primarily comprised of Iraqi, Kurdish and other local forces. Other sources suggest the gains have been less dramatic\u000a\u000aAirwars, a non-profit website that tabulates strikes against ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria , documents that strikes have increased since Trump came into office; in July there were 947 strikes in Syria and 223 in Iraq. Of course, more strikes doesn't necessarily equal more success.

He is also the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear adviser to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations. The views expressed here are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Last week we learned that Australian security services had managed to disrupt an alleged terrorist plot involving the planting of a bomb aboard a Middle Eastern airliner -- as well as the use of deadly hydrogen sulfide gas.\u000a\u000aThe plotters intended to place an improvised explosive device on board an Etihad Airways flight -- many of which can carry more than 500 people. They also planned to release deadly chemicals in a confined space, "potentially on public transport," authorities said.\u000a\u000aJust thinking about an attack like this taking place on a commercial aircraft is horrific enough -- the fact that the plotters were allegedly trying to use a chemical weapon as well suggests a significant escalation in the ambition of terrorists.\u000a\u000aHamish de Bretton-Gordon\u000a\u000aIt is heartening that British and Australian intelligence services, working together, picked up the traces of this potential attack just in time.

aVHong Kong (CNN) As Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate, lay dying in a heavily-guarded hospital last month, there was little mention of his fate in China.\u000a\u000aFor many younger Chinese, Liu is an unknown figure, the culmination of years of intense censorship of his life and works. The tiny minority who did attempt to express outrage online at Liu's treatment, or commemorate him after he succumbed to liver cancer on July 14 , saw their posts blocked and images deleted.\u000a\u000aOn Weibo, China's most popular Twitter-like platform, users were prevented from posting messages with the words "Nobel," "liver cancer," "RIP" or the candle emoji, according to researchers at Toronto's Citizen Lab and Hong Kong's Weiboscope\u000a\u000aCensorship was also widespread on messaging app WeChat, which was once less filtered than Weibo because of its more private nature. Citizen Lab found that even in one-on-one chats, mentions of Liu Xiaobo's name and photos of him were deleted when chatting with Chinese users.\u000a\u000aSina and Tencent, which own Weibo and WeChat respectively, did not respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000a"The party keeps tightening censorship to an absurd degree," said dissident artist Badiucao, who has launched a campaign to memorialize Liu worldwide.\u000a\u000aWhile Liu's case is an outlier in terms of the intense efforts to wipe out all mention of the deceased activist, it is in keeping with trends in Chinese online censorship that have been building since Xi assumed power in 2012.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED China steps up censorship on the internet Replay More Videos ...

The New York Times' Nick Kristof said in 2005 the Chinese authorities were "digging the Communist Party's grave, by giving the Chinese people broadband."\u000a\u000aBut the Chinese censors have defied their critics, building the world's most sophisticated system of internet filtering and surveillance -- the Great Firewall\u000a\u000aChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to faxed requests for comment.\u000a\u000aThis month saw new bricks added to the wall, as Beijing went after two means of bypassing its controls.\u000a\u000aUsers of encrypted messaging service WhatsApp found themselves unable to send images or videos this week , and analysts reported the app's speed was being filtered or disrupted, making it difficult to access from China.\u000a\u000aDisruption of virtual private networks (VPNs) -- which enable users to tunnel their web traffic through the Great Firewall, effectively browsing as if they're in another country -- has also been ramped up, with both Bloomberg and the Associated Press reporting that a blanket ban on VPN usage may be in the works.\u000a\u000aThat would be an extreme step, as VPNs are also used by many companies to enable secure networking and file sharing between offices.\u000a\u000aPreviously Beijing has tolerated commercial services offered to foreigners to allow them to access banned sites like Facebook and Twitter while they're in China --international hotels in major Chinese cities have also been known to offer this service.\u000a\u000aLokman Tsui, an expert on censorship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it was "possible that some of the newer developments we have seen are experimental in nature, e.g. let's try and float this to see how well it works ... and see what public reaction we get."\u000a\u000aEven if the VPN ban does not pan out, Tsui said, the direction things are going in is clear, and it's not positive.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Is China secretly censoring WeChat?

In Xi's view, sovereignty, not freedom or communication or sharing, was the most important factor in online policy.\u000a\u000a"Cyberspace is not a domain beyond the rule of law," Xi said. "Greater efforts should be made to strengthen ethical standards and promote civilized behavior."\u000a\u000aThe doctrine of internet sovereignty, which emerged in China in the early 2010s and is now driving Beijing's internet policy, seeks to establish a national, as opposed to global, internet.\u000a\u000aInstead of the world wide web as we know it, countries would each maintain their own national internet, by force if necessary, with the border controls and immigration standards they see fit.\u000a\u000aPeter Micek, general counsel for Access Now, which lobbies in favor of an open internet, said Chinese officials and technicians are increasingly working to water down protections for online freedoms at the United Nations and other bodies which oversee internet standards and governance.\u000a\u000a"More and more Chinese engineers and engineers from Chinese companies are proposing and developing and adopting standards," he added.\u000a\u000aTechnical bodies like the International Telecommunication Union, the World Wide Web Consortium and others have huge influence on how the global internet operates, but sometimes with little transparency and limited democratic input.\u000a\u000a"That's one place where quietly there is a more concerted effort (by China) to take control of what the internet actually is," Micek said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the New York Times , in late 2015 Beijing lobbied hard -- but ultimately unsuccessfully -- to remove phrases like "freedom of expression" and "democratic" from a major UN document on internet policy.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Time travel, cleavage banned from Chinese TV shows Replay More Videos ...

aVThis article was originally published by The Spaces , a digital publication exploring new ways to live and work.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It happens every few years: a seismic shift in the way we live our lives fuels a change in human behavior so significant, it blows the concept of the office as we know it out of the water.\u000a\u000aModern technology is no exception. Fast becoming the catalyst behind one of the biggest shake-ups the office has ever seen -- from design to location and from sustainability to well-being -- it is the shift of our generation. And hard though it may be to believe that robotic security guards and app-controlled meeting rooms are just the beginning, there is still a long way to go.\u000a\u000aSo what might the workplace of the future look like? We asked six office-space experts from around the world to hazard a guess as to where, and how, we will all be working in 10 years from now.\u000a\u000aThe architect\u000a\u000aNorman Foster\u000a\u000aLord Norman Foster is one of the best known architects in the world. Now 82, he is the designer behind some of the world's most iconic buildings including City Hall in London, the Reichstag Dome and, most recently, the $5-billion new Apple Campus 2 in California.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aNorman Foster: Greener -- in every sense. Young people will choose office buildings based on facilities and lifestyle but also on their sustainability credentials. Future generations will be much more demanding and much more questioning in terms of what a potential employer will be doing to tackle climate change. So I think we will see a shift where creating a good quality working environment which is more responsible in terms of sustainability becomes good for business as well as for the environment.\u000a\u000aA rendering of Apple Campus 2, designed by Foster & Partners.\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aNF: More nature and more sustainable features. And perhaps less real estate developer involvement. The overarching trend is very much the entrepreneurs pushing new ideas for design forward. Apple Park was initiated by Steve Jobs then carried on by (chief design officer) Jony Ive and his team with the support of (chief executive) Tim Cook. As a rule, developers now tend to just follow the market whereas the entrepreneurs lead it.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think will be the single biggest driver of change in the way we work over the next 10 years?\u000a\u000aNF: I think the social agenda will be the big driving force. And technology. But also trying to overcome our natural, human fear of change.\u000a\u000aHow will this affect the built environment of our cities?\u000a\u000aNF: Take 3D-printed buildings as an example. I think, if properly harnessed this would offer a lot of opportunities. The downside would be mindless repetition or intrinsically bad design practice. But I would ultimately take a more optimistic view and say it offers greater customization potential and greater room for creativity.\u000a\u000aOf course it raises some very big social issues. If you are able, through robots and AI, to do things very quickly and efficiently that are otherwise very labor intensive, then that's liberating in one sense. But there are issues over the future of the workforce -- but historically these sorts of changes have resulted in higher levels of education and a more productive redeployment of labor.\u000a\u000aThe workspace innovator\u000a\u000aTanya Wood\u000a\u000aTanya Wood is director of Soho Works , the workplace offshoot of hospitality group and members' club Soho House. She oversees the group's co-working spaces in London's Shoreditch as well as potential future expansion plans.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aTanya Wood: By then we expect the work place to have become even more comfortable -- a place where you choose to spend more time without the pressures and formality of the traditional office. With a call for more flexible working hours already, people are spending less physical time at their formal office. They want spaces that actually cater for, and enhance, their working lives. That could be access to everything from gyms or social space, bedrooms or a provision of studios and specialist equipment or facilities to support content creators.\u000a\u000aSoho Works, Shoreditch\u000a\u000aWhat do you think will be the single biggest driver of change in the way we work over the next 10 years?\u000a\u000aTW: Evolving socioeconomics. By this I mean that more international travel, better gender equality (and sharing of childcare) and new technologies will result in a society that wants and needs more choice, autonomy and independence in their working life.\u000a\u000aHow will this impact the built environment of our cities?\u000a\u000aTW: Traditional office space is under pressure so office landlords will need to adapt to stay relevant.\u000a\u000aHow will it affect the way we use our homes?\u000a\u000aIn the future we expect that the workplace will complement home life more and more. When an office caters for more aspects of your life, home can become a true sanctuary.\u000a\u000aSoho Works, Shoreditch\u000a\u000aHow do you think the concept of the office as a business club will develop over the years?\u000a\u000aTW: People love to belong and feel part of something. The idea of professional networking is not new and by bringing this under one roof you create a very fertile ground for collaboration, which empowers workers. With co-working operators expanding globally, suddenly the membership becomes about much more than just a building or a physical space to go and work in, it's also an international supportive community.\u000a\u000aThe connectivity guru\u000a\u000aTamara Brisk is managing director of Wiredscore France. Launched in New York in 2013 by Michael Bloomberg, the connectivity ratings system scores commercial buildings on everything from internet speed to mobile connections. It now has offices in the UK, France, Germany and Ireland and has certified more than 750 buildings across the globe\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aTamara Brisk: Offices in a decade will be designed to best foster our cognitive processes and working preferences. We already know that people are more creative at certain times of day and that environmental stimuli can amplify collaboration but we are at the very beginning of our understanding.\u000a\u000aIn a decade, knowledge workers will be more productive because they will be better able to tap their mental capacities. For example, individuals will know that our finest strategic brainstorming prowess happens in the middle of the day and even have mental warm-up exercises to foster their performance.\u000a\u000aOur work spaces in the future will provide different environments for different phases of work -- like protective insulated cocoons for periods of deep concentration. These will be in addition to today's stimuli-filled social co-working spaces that promote collaboration.\u000a\u000aDUO, a Wired certified building under construction in Paris, designed by Jean Nouvel.\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aTB: We will see more flexibility of space usage. For example, building cafeterias that were only used during breakfast and lunch hours in the past will serve as collaborative work spaces and meeting rooms. Open space offices will be divisible at the click of a button.\u000a\u000aWe will see fewer long-term leases. While businesses will still require and benefit from co-locating their employees, they will want more flexibility to add and subtract space as their needs evolve.\u000a\u000aThe #Cloud.Paris building is another Wired Certified development in the French capital.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think will be the single biggest driver of change in the way we work over the next 10 years?\u000a\u000aTB: Research about how to best unlock our mental capacity and manage the speed and ubiquity of information will make us more productive with no supplementary effort.\u000a\u000aHow far do you think connectivity will move on in offices over the next decade?\u000a\u000aTB: It will become as important as location and price in the choice of an office. Excellent, reliable connectivity will become standard.\u000a\u000aThe accidental co-working entrepreneur\u000a\u000aMikael Benfredj\u000a\u000aMikael Benfredj is founder of Patchwork , a furniture store turned co-working space in the heart of Paris. When people started to use the display furniture as make-shift workspaces, Mikael embraced the demand for a change of use and now has plans to expand.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aMikael Benfredj: I don't think companies will be separated the way they are today. There might not be one dedicated building for a single company. Or even dedicated floors. I hope large companies will want to expand their values and culture more profoundly around their partners and clients. Design will be sunnier -- meaning it should have more space available outside -- and smarter, meaning more automation.\u000a\u000aPatchwork Paris\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aMB: We will see more integrated services such as childcare facilities, laundries, hairdressers, banks and post offices, plus more regulation -- things like lighting, chair comfort and screen hours will all be monitored. And I think offices will be more disability-friendly too. And there will be less personalization of your specific spot or desk.\u000a\u000aHow will the changing office affect the way we use our homes?\u000a\u000aMB: Work will be more invasive. Even more than it is today, thanks to frictionless technology and the ability to work anywhere. I think workspace will become a meetingspace.\u000a\u000aPatchwork Paris\u000a\u000aHow has your experience of watching a furniture store evolve into a co-working space shaped your view on the way people want to work?\u000a\u000aMB: Considering we didn't do it on purpose, it was very inspiring to watch the transformation of the usage of the space in a short period of time. I remember the days when one or two people would come into the store to work. It was very calm. Today it's like a factory. There are 40 to 50 people every day, coming in and out all day long to have meetings and work.\u000a\u000aThe office design consultant\u000a\u000aDespina Katsikakis advised Google when it was first developing its office concept -- possibly now one of the most copied on the planet. She is now advising on 22 Bishopsgate in London, set to become the UK's first WELL Certified building and acts as a consultant on the future of workplace design for Accenture, BBC, Deutsche Bank, Lend Lease, Nokia, and GlaxoSmithKline, Microsoft, and Morgan Stanley.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aDespina Katsikakis: We will see a much more diversified portfolio or flexible and on-demand work spaces. Both the nature of corporate portfolios and our own personal workspaces\u200b will become a series of locations to work, based on convenience, function and comfort. This will mean they are much simpler and used much more intensively and intermittently.\u000a\u000a22 Bishopsgate, London\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aDK: More choice of environments, amenities and services with a focus on people's performance. And I think we will see less offices with one-size-fits-all rows of desks with a focus on cost reduction and hard metrics.\u000a\u000a22 Bishopsgate will have London's first climbing wall.\u000a\u000aHow will this impact the built environment of our cities?\u000a\u000aDK: Existing building stock will be \u200breinvented as a blurring of functions becomes the norm as a result of technology that allows us to work, live, learn and play anywhere and anytime.\u000a\u000aThe Bay Area agent\u000a\u000aDan Harvey is vice chairman of the Bay Area Occupier Services group for the world's biggest commercial property agent, CBRE. He works closely with the biggest office occupiers in San Francisco and Silicon Valley and has up-to-date insight into current and future trends when it comes to office requirements of some of the most innovative companies in the world.\u000a\u000aWhat will the office look like in 10 years' time?\u000a\u000aDan Harvey: We're already starting to see a push-back on some of the tech and the elimination of privacy. So a departure from open-plan as a blanket design default and a move back to some private offices. Collaboration is great but there is an emerging feeling that without a choice, people are sometimes finding it challenging to get stuff done. So through that push for a productive workforce, future offices may become more private again.\u000a\u000aA sensory deprivation tank.\u000a\u000aWhat will we see more of -- and what will we see less of?\u000a\u000aDH: Going straight to the unusual stuff, we could see more sensory deprivation tanks and things that help staff reach this 'state of flow' that everyone is talking about here in the Bay Area. It sounds quite crazy but access to this sort of experience, the removal of neuro stimulation to allow employees to work at their creative best, is popular. And while we won't see less technology we might well see more controlled tech.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think will be the single biggest driver of change in the way we work over the next 10 years?\u000a\u000aDH: The growth of the 'office experience' -- the hospitality side.

It would be terrible for any of the ideas of limited government. I'm still not sure that Donald Trump is for limited government, for balanced budgets. One of the biggest things that he's been for in his last several years is using eminent domain for the government to take private property from one property - private property owner and give it to himself for his casinos and parking lots. That's not a conservative notion. And, really, most of Donald Trump is nothing more than sort of bits of populism, but no consistent conservative philosophy.\u201d\u000a\u000aPaul responds to Cruz\u2019s immigration stance: \u201cI think, on several things, he wants to have it both ways. On immigration, at the time, he supported an amendment that said, OK, we're not going to get citizenship, but we will allow illegal status. And he wanted the bill to pass. In fact, I was in the same category. I thought citizenship was too far, but the compromise would no citizenship, but give people a legal status. That's what Cruz was for. He was - he's been explicit about it. And now he says never and that he never did it. And so I think he should just admit that he changed his mind, that he used to be for legalization, but he's not anymore. But he's done the same thing\u2026 So, I think, on a number of issues, he wants to have it both ways, depending on which audience he's talking to.\u201d\u000a\u000aPaul reacts to criticism from Rubio: \u201cWell, you know, the difference between Marco Rubio and I is, I show up for work. He's missed about a third to a half of his votes this year. And we had the biggest vote of the whole year, voting on a trillion dollars worth of spending, and he didn't show up. So, yes, I think he ought to resign or give his pay back to the taxpayer.\u000a\u000aPaul on the status of his campaign: But, as far as I'm concerned, yes, I do need to do well in the early primaries. We're - we're in it to win it. We're not in it just to mess around. I'm not in it to place in the lower tier. If we're in the lower tier, obviously, we will reassess. But we don't plan to be. We have got a campaign that we think is going to shock people. And we're hoping that when we get done with this campaign and people see the votes happen, that we will begin discounting the pollsters, who, I think, have no clue as to what is going on in America.\u201d\u000a\u000aFULL POST

aVHong Kong (CNN) Terence Tam's dad fled to Hong Kong from China during the political chaos of the Cultural Revolution to make a better life for himself and his family.\u000a\u000aThen a British colony, the city became home to a huge number of refugees fleeing Communism in the 1960s and 1970s.\u000a\u000aNow 39, Tam says he's ready to make another escape, 20 years after the UK handed sovereignty over the city to China.\u000a\u000aWhile Hong Kong is one of the most affluent cities in the world, he says it's now in the throes of its own political upheaval.\u000a\u000a"I want to see if I can do the same for my family (as my father did for us)," he says. "I'm not satisfied with the situation in Hong Kong. The political situation, the government.

He's an assistant IT manager at one of Hong Kong's universities and owns an apartment -- no mean feat in a city that has the world's most unaffordable property prices.\u000a\u000aBut Tam objects to China's growing grip on the city.\u000a\u000aUnder the principle of "one country, two systems," Hong Kong was supposed to have preserved the rule of law, freedom of speech and the right to protest as enjoyed under the British -- at least until 2047 -- but Tam, and others, feel that China hasn't held up its part of the bargain.\u000a\u000a"Some people say that we are emigrating but I feel like we are refugees escaping from Hong Kong," he says.\u000a\u000aIn two years, once his newborn daughter is ready for kindergarten, Tam plans to uproot his family and move to Taiwan.\u000a\u000aTerence Tam and his wife on vacation in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.\u000a\u000aHis wife has already secured citizenship there through an investment visa scheme and Tam plans to cash out his Hong Kong pension pot and start a business selling Hong Kong snacks.\u000a\u000aTam is one of a growing number of people in the city looking for an exit. According to an opinion poll conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong last year, two in five Hong Kongers want to live overseas -- up from one in five in 2014 -- although only 10% of those who said they wanted to leave had put such a plan into action.\u000a\u000aWhat's changed?\u000a\u000aIt's not the first time that political upheaval has had Hong Kongers scouting for boltholes.\u000a\u000aFrom 1989, in the wake of the Tiananmen massacre, almost 60,000 people left the city every year, primarily for Canada, the United States and Australia, according to one academic study.\u000a\u000aHowever, many came back as the nightmare scenarios some had imagined didn't emerge and Beijing largely left the city alone during the first 15 years of Chinese rule.\u000a\u000aBut in 2014, Beijing denied Hong Kongers the universal suffrage promised to the city under its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, triggering massive streets protests that paralyzed much of the city for more than two months.\u000a\u000aPolice fire tear gas upon pro-democracy demonstrators near the Hong Kong government headquarters on September 28, 2014.\u000a\u000aSince then, fears have grown that Beijing neither cares about, nor pays heed, to the city's supposed autonomy.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, five men involved in publishing gossipy books on China's ruling elite -- two of whom had European passports -- disappeared only to reappear in Chinese custody weeks later.\u000a\u000aChina has also moved to bar pro-democracy lawmakers from taking office, using a rarely invoked power.\u000a\u000aThis erosion of the city's autonomy has led to calls for Hong Kong's independence from a small but persistently vocal group.\u000a\u000aMany fear that Hong Kong's new leader Carrie Lam , who was selected by a 1,200-strong committee and takes office July 1, will now enact a controversial security law, known as Article 23 , that would "prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against China."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Next Hong Kong leader on missing bookseller Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Next Hong Kong leader on missing bookseller 03:51\u000a\u000aLooking to Taiwan\u000a\u000aAndrew Lo, an immigration consultant at Amlex in Hong Kong, said his company has seen an upturn in business since the 2014 Occupy protests -- largely down to the deteriorating political situation, though he says the city's pressure cooker school system and cramped high-rise living conditions also play a role.\u000a\u000a"The main reasons why people leave Hong Kong is because of political instability -- the future is uncertain -- and poor education in Hong Kong," he says.\u000a\u000aSchooling starts young in Hong Kong and there's lots of pressure to make the grade.\u000a\u000aTaiwan, and southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Thailand, have emerged as popular destinations -- particularly for younger couples and retirees, says Lo. It's also now much harder to emigrate to places like Australia and Canada than it was in the 1990s.\u000a\u000aTam says he chose Taiwan because it's a place he fell in love with on vacation and it has the same cultural roots as Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aHe knows that life won't be easy. Tam's native language is Cantonese and says he speaks Mandarin, the language most Taiwanese use, haltingly. Jobs are also lower paid on average in Taiwan than in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000a"I love the culture in Taiwan. I've been to the UK to study for one year. When I landed there, the first step, I felt like I didn't belong. But when I went to Taiwan I felt different," Tam says.\u000a\u000aSupporters shout during Tsai Ing-wen's speech on her presidential election victory on January 16, 2016 in Taipei, Taiwan.\u000a\u000aIt's also the world's only Chinese-speaking democracy -- an important drawcard.\u000a\u000aAccording to official figures, the number of Taiwan permanent residents hailing from Hong Kong has more than doubled since 2014 -- though the absolute number is still very small at 1,086.\u000a\u000aTaiwan, however, is not without its own political issues and complexities . Despite Taiwan governing its own affairs for more than six decades, China views the island as part of its territory , to be taken by force if necessary.\u000a\u000aThe two -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China -- split in 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a civil war.\u000a\u000a"I have a stable job, income and property, but I find the environment here very uncomfortable," Tam says. "We were born before 1997. Our birth certificates, our passports were issued by the UK. After 1997 we didn't immediately see any changes but we do now."\u000a\u000aOn July 1, thousands are expected to brave the city's sultry summer humidity to mark the 20th anniversary of the handover by marching through Hong Kong's streets to demand greater democracy. The annual event has taken on extra significance this year with Chinese President Xi Jinping visiting the city for the very first time.\u000a\u000aTam has joined the protest in the past but won't this year -- he sees it as a futile act: "I have a choice, I can leave. It's time to get out."

But in China, it's become a disturbingly familiar situation.\u000a\u000aThe latest example is Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of a major insurance company that owns the Waldorf Astoria in New York and recently held talks with the Kushner family over a Manhattan office tower.\u000a\u000aHe is reported to have been detained by authorities on Friday as part of a government investigation. His company, Anbang Insurance Group, said in a short statement that Wu "cannot perform his duties due to personal reasons."\u000a\u000aHis abrupt absence follows a string of cases in recent years in which business leaders were unceremoniously yanked from their duties by authorities, leaving employees and shareholders in the dark.\u000a\u000aRelated: China reportedly detains chief of insurer that held talks with Kushner firm\u000a\u000aIn 2015, senior executives from dozens of Chinese companies disappeared.

aV(CNN) From 2005 to 2012, the rate of calls to poison control centers about dietary supplements increased by almost 50%, and most of the exposures were in children younger than 6 years old, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of Medical Toxicology .\u000a\u000aThe study defines dietary supplements as any product that supplements the diet, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, homeopathic agents and amino acids, and concentrates, metabolites, constituents and extracts of these ingredients.\u000a\u000aThe researchers used data from the National Poison Data System , to which poison control centers submit their call information. From 2000 to 2012, there were 274,998 dietary supplement exposures reported to poison control centers across the US: one call every 24 minutes, on average.\u000a\u000aThe symptoms most associated with supplement ingestion included tachycardia, or rapid heart rate; vomiting; nausea; irritability; drowsiness and dizziness.\u000a\u000aSeventy percent of the dietary supplement exposures were in children younger than age 6; 99% of those were unintentional. Overall, only 4.5% of all supplement exposures resulted in serious medical outcomes, mostly in children under age 6.\u000a\u000aHenry Spiller , study author and director of Central Ohio Poison Control, said parents still need to be extremely cautious about leaving these products within access of children.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes, parents don't think of keeping dietary supplements away from their kids, because they're not medicines prescribed by the doctor. People think of them as natural," Spiller said. "But they need to be treated as if they were a medicine. Don't leave them out on the counter. Keep them out of reach."\u000a\u000aSpiller said the two most common ways for children to ingest a supplement are while they're exploring the house or when a parent mistakes it for another kind of medication.\u000a\u000aJeannette Trella , managing director of the Poison Control Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, added that many dietary supplements do not have child-resistant packaging. Because of this, she says, parents should really consider whether they want to store supplements in their homes.\u000a\u000a"Parents should look at this as a risk-benefit analysis," said Trella, who is also a pharmacist and was not involved in the new study. "It should be considered whether the potential benefit of taking the supplement really outweighs the risk of your child accidentally ingesting something they shouldn't and becoming sick."\u000a\u000aBut children under age 6 were not the only group adversely affected by dietary supplements; many older kids and adults were, too. Among those who called poison control centers about dietary supplements, 21% reported adverse effects, according to the study.\u000a\u000aFrom 1999 to 2012, the number of adults who reported using dietary supplements has remained steady in the range of 49% to 54%.\u000a\u000aThe study named the most dangerous supplements as ma huang, yohimbe, homeopathic agents and energy drinks.\u000a\u000aMa huang is a stimulant containing ephedra that was outlawed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHowever, yohimbe -- often promoted as enhancing male sexual performance -- and energy drinks containing caffeine or other stimulant ingredients, as well as homeopathic agents that are supposed to help with migraines, asthma and other conditions, are still on the market.\u000a\u000aDuring the study's 13-year period, 34 people died of exposure to dietary supplements. Six deaths were associated with ma huang, three with homeopathic agents and one with yohimbe, the researchers said. These types of dietary supplements were also closely associated with serious medical outcomes.\u000a\u000a"More than 170 million Americans take dietary supplements each year, and the responsible industry is invested in bringing safe and quality products to meet this demand," the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the leading trade association for the dietary supplement and functional food industry, said in a statement. "We recommend that consumers store dietary supplement products in safe places, out of a child's reach. In addition, we recommend that consumers talk with their doctor or pediatrician about their family's supplement use."\u000a\u000aThe group added that homeopathic agents, which were included in the study, are not dietary supplements and are regulated differently. The FDA said they are regulated as unapproved drugs\u000a\u000aAccording to the FDA's website, the agency "regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering 'conventional' foods and drug products. Unless the products are intended to treat or prevent a disease, this means the FDA does not require companies to conduct clinical trials of dietary supplements."\u000a\u000aThe FDA said it does not comment on specific studies, but it is reviewing these findings. Additionally, the agency suggests certain safety guidelines for consumers and parents who might use dietary supplements, including storing them out of sight of children and informing your health care practitioner if you are taking them.\u000a\u000aThe FDA encourages consumers to report adverse events related to dietary supplements on its safety reporting portal\u000a\u000aFor Trella, minimal FDA regulation is the most troubling aspect.\u000a\u000a"Because dietary supplements are not regulated by the FDA, there are not robust studies done to ensure that they are efficacious or have a reliable safety profile," she said. "We're often going down a path of unknowns, and for possibly no benefit at all."\u000a\u000a"We really don't know if there's a benefit to taking any of these supplements, because of the lack of studies," she said. "People need to be aware of that."\u000a\u000aSpiller also said people should reconsider how they think about dietary supplements.\u000a\u000a"Just because it's a natural supplement doesn't mean it's safe," he said. "I often use the example, technically, that cocaine is also natural. But that doesn't mean it's safe."

It's a very young but very vibrant Silicon Valley. And I'd say that they're, you know, for a while, people thought about China as like, well, they would copy what you do and they're always behind. What's happening is the copying is catching up. But when it catches up, there's nothing left to copy. And so what we're starting to see is innovation. It's starting to percolate up in China. And I think that's really exciting.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn innovation: \u201cThe way I look at innovation is it's really about creative problem-solving. It is - it's about, on one end, being very creative and almost being an idea person and seeing ideas and interesting ways of doing things everywhere. But on the other side, it's about being very, very analytical and very, very dedicated to details. I like to say god is in the details. So if you're analytical and logical, almost like a machine, I'm a computer engineering - well, I went to school as a computer engineer, but bringing a creative idea and ideation piece to that, put them together, you're now a creative problem-solver. And that's where I think innovation comes from. And here at the company, you know, I try to - we look for creative problem-solvers and we try to push people to solve things creatively, because that's where innovation is.\u201d\u000a\u000aFull transcript available after the jump.

aVNew York (CNN) Kayla Mueller, Peter Kassig, Alan Henning, David Haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by ISIS in the past year.\u000a\u000aThe exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive. What we do know is ISIS holds at least one female aid worker, and possibly more. The International Federation of the Red Cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in October 2013 remain missing, but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them.\u000a\u000aAbductions and killings of aid workers are, unfortunately, nothing new, but the numbers are. According to Aidworkersecurity.org, at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013, a 121% increase on 70 recorded killings the year before.\u000a\u000aNot all were victims of ISIS, a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled Syria. In fact, according to the same report, it is the Taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers, in large part in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aHere's the difference: ISIS is changing the game. The Taliban may have many reasons for abductions (flexing their muscles, negotiating prisoner releases), but they also have a record of frequent hostage release. The need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters, or mattered.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The ISIS terror threat Photos: The ISIS terror threat Wounded passengers are treated following a suicide bombing at the Brussels Airport on March 22, 2016.

Abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income (ISIS demanded at least $6 million for Kayla Mueller, and reportedly $200 million for two Japanese hostages) or, failing that, their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness. So far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by ISIS is extremely low, save for those whose ransoms were paid. The freeing of 19 kidnapped Assyrian Christians shocked many, because release is not a common part of ISIS' playbook.\u000a\u000aThese tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide, who may look to emulate ISIS' model of abduction and violence. One example is West African extremist group Boko Haram, which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies, an approach disturbingly similar to ISIS'.\u000a\u000a"Humanitarian work has always been risky, but it's never been more dangerous than it is now," says Caryl Stern, president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF . "There used to be a time when an organization's flag provided a great deal of protection. That's no longer the case."\u000a\u000aThe response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of Syria and its environs altogether, but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers. Still, outside workers like Mueller, Kassig, Henning and Haines were inside Syria when they were taken, and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations. Not only that, but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency, local staffers become bait. Indeed, the majority of victims have been working in their own countries.\u000a\u000aISIS doesn't just target aid workers. Journalists, soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list. But in the Wild West that is Syria and its borders, few of these remain, save for aid workers. In a space devoid of government, refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities, the new front line in the war on terror, a sometimes unwelcome association. And as ISIS spreads beyond Syria's borders, the risks grow further afield.\u000a\u000aYet despite these risks, thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million. While some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection, many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit. Their security and locations for the most part are under constant review.\u000a\u000aWhen CNN approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences, and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level, many declined, in large part due to security concerns. For this reason, some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous.\u000a\u000aSenior relief director for NGO working in the Syria region\u000a\u000aIf I think back, I've been doing this work for about 20 years, and I remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection, some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much, much more difficult; we're asking people to put themselves in harm's way in some circumstances.

Hide Caption 85 of 85\u000a\u000aMy family is not thrilled at all because what they see on the news is Westerners being kidnapped and beheaded ... when they worry, I worry about them and that doesn't help me be in a good state of mind to do my work. I'm very selective about where I say I go. I need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that's here, not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people I'm responsible for in this region.\u000a\u000aI don't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one, two, three times -- who don't see a future for their children... Someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security, and I mean that in the personal sense of a mother who, when she goes to sleep at night with her children, she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day.\u000a\u000aMark Ohanian, International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) director of programs\u000a\u000aFear is always there in the back of everyone's mind. We just need to continue what we're doing, stopping is not an option, halting our operations is not an option, and we are taking great risks, our staff are taking great risks.\u000a\u000aIt is a difficult thing to tell family, to tell colleagues. Oftentimes I just don't mention all the details of where I go because they just don't need to know. But it needs to be done, we also can't run an operation remotely. ... I'm not going to the front lines, I'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we're not adrenaline driven people. We want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks, but it's about calculated risks. We don't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger.\u000a\u000aIf we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security, morale, pressure from here, pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place. There's not going to be another organization that's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that IOCC may create, that's not going to happen. So that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization; we feel that responsibility that we've got to deliver on this thing.\u000a\u000aDima (last name withheld), aid worker, IOCC\u000a\u000aThere's an internal motivation that keeps you going. You feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance, and know it's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service. So yes, you need be of course strong, motivated, passionate, and of course feel the need to assist and deliver.\u000a\u000aMichael Bowers, senior director for strategic response and emergencies, Mercy Corps\u000a\u000aIt's an unprecedented time, and what we're calling the new normal ... as we've seen in the last year, the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups, who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we're not the U.S. Army, we don't have a physical ability to repel.\u000a\u000aThere may be in people's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance: like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car, you'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community. I think that golden age is more myth than reality, but regarding today's reality it's extremely dangerous it's so true. And your flag, your neutrality, your white car, all the good intention you have, that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies.\u000a\u000aThere's a phrase that the U.N. uses and a lot of NGOs use which is "stay and deliver," so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there, but we always have to be in a risk management role; we have to critically look at: do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get?\u000a\u000aThe fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends, and that has more of a toll, I think, with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly, sometimes I don't tell them till I'm already on my way so I don't have to have those calls before I even get on an airplane. It's hard; there are some areas where the family and friends don't understand why you're going there, and you re-articulate, "If not you, then who?" and you ask, "Would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened?"

For more visit Definitive Design.\u000a\u000aNew York (CNN) A one-stop inspiration shop for design lovers and neophytes alike, the website Sight Unseen (and its highly addictive Instagram profile) has a devoted, international following of the aesthetically inclined.\u000a\u000aSince its launch in 2009, the magazine has become a popular destination for discovering independent design talent. Meanwhile, its founders Monica Khesurov and Jill Singer have established themselves as trusted tastemakers credited with helping to reposition New York on the design circuit.\u000a\u000aThis is in no small part thanks to "Sight Unseen Offsite ," the website's annual design expo during NYCxDesign , which has become a coveted platform for both emerging and more established designers.\u000a\u000aNow in its fourth edition, this year's Offsite will showcase a slimmed-down selection of 25 designers (compared to 70 last year), in addition to a group exhibition of 21 international names. "We decided to mindfully shrink the show this year," says Singer, "We wanted to go back to something a bit more pure and focused."\u000a\u000aKhemsurov notes that while the duo has in recent years gained a reputation for having a "young, fun aesthetic, which mingled a bit with this Memphis design resurgence, shapes, squiggles, and bright colors," they never intended to be exclusively associated with one type of look.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVStory highlights Marc Randazza: A Google employee's opinion that diversity initiatives should focus less on race and gender prompted outrage\u000a\u000aBy trying to punish or silence him, we are destroying the marketplace of ideas in which open debate allows us to advance, he writes\u000a\u000aMarc J. Randazza is a First Amendment attorney and managing partner of the Randazza Legal Group. Follow him on Twitter: @marcorandazza, and read his academic publications here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Over the weekend, a Google employee wrote what has been described as a 10-page "manifesto against diversity." Boiling down 10 pages into a short column, and then commenting on it, is impossible.\u000a\u000aBut, the long and the short of his opinion seems to be that women are underrepresented in tech because of psychological differences between women and men, not because of bias, and women are underrepresented in the top tiers of leadership because of their own preferences, not discrimination. Ultimately, he believes that "diversity" initiatives should focus more on ideological diversity, and less on immutable characteristics like race and gender.\u000a\u000aCue the outrage and applause machines -- depending on which political tribe you belong to. Of course, the outrage machine is calling for him to be tracked down and fired. I take the opposite view, but not because I agree with him. In fact, I mostly disagree with him, though I think he makes some good arguments -- but that is beside the point. I categorically oppose the notion that if you have an opinion that deviates too far from that which is considered to be "politically correct," then the appropriate punishment is that you should lose your job -- and preferably not be hired anywhere else, either.\u000a\u000aMarc Randazza\u000a\u000aSome are tempted to call this a "First Amendment" issue. Let me be clear, it is not. The government is not involved, and thus this is not a violation of anyone's constitutional rights. But, one of the pillars that holds up our First Amendment is the "marketplace of ideas" theory -- that ideas should compete in the free market, and that through wide-open and robust debate, we will advance.\u000a\u000aIn ideology-driven authoritarian regimes, locking someone out of the labor market because you don't like their ideas is a common approach. Behind the Iron Curtain, for instance, if you weren't sufficiently Marxist, it didn't necessarily mean a trip to the gulag. You would just find that you were out of a job. Of course, the blowback against this Google employee is not top-down authoritarianism or orthodoxy enforced by the state. No, in America when you violate the PC code of conduct, a small cadre of people will dust off the outrage machine -- and millions of people will fuel it.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVJust minutes from the city, faint tire tracks blow away in the wind, and the vast expanse of sand quickly becomes disorienting.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling desert north of Agadez, in the west African nation of Niger, is the size of France -- and the search is on for a single stranded truck.\u000a\u000aWe're lucky; our military convoy is armed and equipped with GPS, along with rough coordinates of which way to head. But as night falls and we begin to burn through our petrol reserves revving through the deep sand, uncertainty spreads.\u000a\u000aSomewhere out there is a group of terrified migrants, lost in the desert for days, fearing that their hopes for a better future far away from here will end amid the dark and shifting sands that surround them.\u000a\u000aBest (CNN is withholding her last name for her protection) knows only too well what the migrants we are looking for are going through. She was one of the few to make it out of a similar truck alive, surviving for 24 days in the desert.\u000a\u000aAround her, the other passengers died, one by one, as they waited weeks for rescuers to arrive.\u000a\u000a"The first day, two guys died because of the hot sun. The third day was when people were giving up," says Best.\u000a\u000aThe group had only one jerry can of water between them, and had to ration supplies\u000a\u000a"We were economizing ourselves," she explains. "We put a little water, just to taste it on the tongue, not to get dried up," she says.\u000a\u000aOf the 27 people who boarded the truck, just three survived.\u000a\u000aPromises of a better life\u000a\u000aBest had been lured away from her home in Nigeria by the promise of a better life in Germany. The smugglers told her they had found her a job as a hairdresser; she just had to cross the desert into Libya, where she could get on a boat to Europe.\u000a\u000a"They said it was just a one week journey. I spent more than one month and I didn't get to Libya," she says.\u000a\u000aWhen she arrived in Niger, she began to understand the scale of the smugglers' deceit.\u000a\u000a"I was crying on the phone, she never told me that I was going there to prostitute," she says. When Best resisted, she says the trafficker threatened her and stopped her from using the phone.\u000a\u000a"I just thank God that I did not get to Libya, because if I got to Libya I don't know how my life would have been," says Best.\u000a\u000aLibya is now a "black hole," says Guiseppe Loprete, the Niger Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\u000a\u000aThe country's lawlessness, once an advantage to migrants, has become a threat as increasingly sophisticated criminal organizations and armed groups profit from the smuggling trade.\u000a\u000aBest is now at an IOM transit center in Agadez, waiting to return to the uncertain life she left behind in Nigeria. She's one of the lucky ones.\u000a\u000aNo one knows just how many migrants are perishing in the desert, but Col. Aboubacar Oumarou, commander of Niger's Armed Forces in Agadez, says rescues by his men are becoming more and more routine.\u000a\u000aAccording to the IOM, 600 lives have been saved since April in newly-launched joint operations between it and the military.\u000a\u000a"The more pressure we put around the migrant routes used by smugglers, the more they divert from the usual roads and more to ones that are riskier with a lot of risk of breakdowns, accidents, and getting lost in the desert," says Oumarou.\u000a\u000aHub for smugglers\u000a\u000aFor centuries, the ancient city of Agadez -- a World Heritage site whose historic buildings are constructed from red earth -- has profited from its role as a transit hub at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.\u000a\u000aBut far from being an idyllic oasis, its endless dusty alleyways are lined by high mud brick walls, each compound closed off by corrugated iron gates.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, Agadez's main cargo has been human: hundreds of thousands of migrants from West Africa, loaded into the back of pickup trucks for the arduous journey on towards Libya -- and Europe.\u000a\u000aBut late last year, the government of Niger began cracking down on the trade, giving in to pressure from the European Union, in exchange for a hefty package of aid money.\u000a\u000aThe EU's aim was clear: to stem the flow of migrants before it could reach Europe's shores.\u000a\u000aWith few other ways to get by, the clampdown has left smugglers like Abalde Aboubakar desperate to make ends meet.\u000a\u000aAboubakar apologizes for the swarm of flies, brushing off a rug and offering up a place to sit in his cramped lean-to, as goats graze among the discarded plastic bags and trash on the public dumping ground next door.\u000a\u000aHe says he's no criminal, just a businessman -- a travel agent of sorts -- providing a service to the five young men who temporarily call this place home.\u000a\u000a"All the people that come here, they want to go to Italy," he says.\u000a\u000aThe migrants entrust their hopes and dreams -- and their families' life savings -- to him, and for a fee, he arranges their travel onward.\u000a\u000aBut his once thriving business is now struggling. "Today we have no food, because we have no money," he says.\u000a\u000aAboubakar says that with few other alternatives open to them, he and other smugglers have taken their business underground -- and they are angry at the added costs of hiding their trade.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Agadez, in the west African nation of Niger, has profited from its role as a trading point and transit hub at the edge of the Sahara Desert for centuries.

"With the fall (of ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, where are these people going to go?"\u000a\u000a"It's all around us," says Zara Ibrahim, a women's leader and a mother. "What's happening in Mali, what's happening in Libya, next to us in Nigeria." She worries that, without jobs, Agadez's young people will look outward.\u000a\u000aThe potential for trouble is there, says the US Ambassador to Niger, Eunice Reddick: "Young people can fall into the hands of ... jihadist violent extremist organizations, because they don't have other alternatives to earn a living."\u000a\u000aNiger sits in the middle of what the US military refers to as a ring of insecurity.\u000a\u000a"This is a nexus area, kind of a focus area, for multiple threats to the US. Libya to the north, AQIM to the west or Boko Haram to the south," says US Air Force Col. John Meiter, US commander of Air Base 101 in Niger's capital, Niamey.\u000a\u000aUS drone base plans\u000a\u000aNow the US military is moving its drone operation from Niger's capital, Niamey, to Agadez. From 2018, at the behest of Niger's government, US Africa Command (AFRICOM) will launch its MQ9 Reapers -- "hunter/killer" drones with advanced intelligence gathering capabilities -- from Air Base 201, just outside the city.\u000a\u000a"The move to Agadez is significant because it's going to increase capability to surveil a larger and more significant area," says Meiter. "It puts us in a more strategic location."\u000a\u000aFor now, the new base is very much a work in progress. Massive construction equipment does battle with the desert landscape 24 hours a day, every day, building a runway capable of handling military aircraft. A few hundred support staff oversee the construction work from tents nearby.\u000a\u000aThe $100 million project is a massive undertaking -- the RED HORSE Engineering Squadron, in charge of the heavy lifting at Agadez, says it is the largest US Air Force-led construction project of all time.\u000a\u000aAnd while the instability around Niger will be the focus of operations, it will be the security situation in Agadez that ultimately determines the success of Air Base 201.\u000a\u000a"The stability is absolutely fragile," explains Col. Mark Cheadle of AFRICOM. "With the youth bulge that we have here -- the median age being less than 15 for more than half of the population -- literacy estimated to be at 15% and humanitarian conditions very poor, it is going to affect how we conduct business."\u000a\u000aA US Army civil affairs team is already trying to reach out to the local population. At one school, two officers teach dental hygiene to a local women's group. It is a small gesture -- an excuse to engage with the people here.\u000a\u000a"(The) closer we build a relationship with a local community wherever we are, it helps maintain our safety, it helps to maintain our security," says Captain Kyle Staron. "It's always helpful to have friends in case we have to rely on those partnerships in the future."\u000a\u000aMigrants stranded in desert\u000a\u000aBack in the dark nothingness of the desert, ten hours after we left Agadez, the convoy continues to struggle, tires sinking into the soft sand.\u000a\u000aOut here, with no sense of what lies before us in any direction, it's clear why Niger's government values the US aerial presence so highly.\u000a\u000aIt's also all too apparent just how terrifying the journey must be for migrants.\u000a\u000aIn the distance, up ahead, lights flicker. The group from the lost truck -- about 30 people in all, most from Nigeria, and around half of them women, wearing the local Islamic headdress to help them blend in -- are huddled around an abandoned well.\u000a\u000aStranded out here for three days, abandoned by their smuggler after his truck broke down, they say they had no idea how dangerous these desert tracks could be.\u000a\u000aThey were sold a dream on Facebook, they explain. Like Best before them, they've fallen for a scam which aims to get them to Europe and force them into prostitution.\u000a\u000aThe migrants plead with the soldiers to take them onwards to Libya and not back where they came from.\u000a\u000a"What is out there for us that is better? To harness our talent?" asks one young man who requested not to be named. "If we have the chance to get out of Nigeria, in any part of Europe we know that our star is going to shine brighter than in Nigeria."\u000a\u000aAgadez remains a transit point for people's hopes, dreams and, increasingly, of their despair.

aVThe mayor of New York wants to tax the city's wealthiest people to help fix its ailing subways.\u000a\u000aMayor Bill de Blasio on Monday proposed raising the city income tax on people who earn more than $500,000 per year and couples who make more than $1 million. That would cover about 32,000 people, roughly 1% of city tax filers.\u000a\u000aDe Blasio said the increase could raise $700 million next year and more than $820 million per year by 2022.

aV(CNN) Sometimes, you don't know the exact moment when your life has changed.\u000a\u000aFor Monica Schulman, 38, one of the first signs that her health -- her life -- had changed was so slight that it only began to bother her because it kept happening.\u000a\u000a"I was standing in the bathroom, and I kept noticing while I was brushing my teeth that my left side toes kept kind of curling under, and they were getting tense all of a sudden. And I really didn't think anything of it for months, but I kept doing this," said Schulman, of Atlanta, a part-time teacher and a mother of four. "And I was thinking: This is so weird. I don't know why I keep curling my toes under."\u000a\u000aThough it was unusual enough to make her pause, she did not go see a doctor. Schulman took that important step only after noticing another symptom.\u000a\u000aMonica Schulman, a mother of four, was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease when she was 37.\u000a\u000a"I was visiting my sister in New York, who at the time was going through chemo because she got diagnosed with breast cancer, and we would be walking a little bit through Manhattan," Schulman said. "And I kept telling her, 'My left arm is just not swaying!' "\u000a\u000aShe'd never thought about arm movements, but once she experienced it, she knew that something was off: "My arm was just kind of tight, and it was just laying there."\u000a\u000aShe also felt the barest shiver of a tremor that was unnoticeable to other people. She'd gone to the doctor some time ago about a tingling sensation, and he had run some tests -- "I think he was trying to see if I had (multiple sclerosis)" -- but he'd found nothing wrong. "You're fine, you're fine," he told her.\u000a\u000aAfter her trip to New York, she turned to Google before consulting a physician.\u000a\u000a"I pretty much diagnosed myself," Schulman said. "I typed my symptoms in, and everything that popped up that I read was Parkinson's-related."\u000a\u000aA neurological disorder, Parkinson's disease can bring tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, trouble balancing, problems walking and difficulty coordinating movement. These are the obvious symptoms and the reason why Parkinson's is sometimes referred to as a "movement disorder." Yet other symptoms are also common: Patients can experience depression, sleep problems, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\u000a\u000aAfter her Google search, Schulman turned to her family: "And everybody was like, 'You do not have Parkinson's. You're too young.' "\u000a\u000aMost Parkinson's patients are diagnosed around age 58.\u000a\u000a"They're like, 'You're crazy,' " said Schulman. "And I was like, 'I really think I do.' "\u000a\u000aAfter more research, she asked her husband, Jeremy, to help her get in to see In the face of disbelief, Schulman knew that she needed to find the best doctor to validate her self-diagnosis.After more research, she asked her husband, Jeremy, to help her get in to see Dr. Stewart Factor , a neurologist and director of the Movement Disorders Program at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. He is an expert in the field, and his appointment calendar is booked many months in advance.\u000a\u000aHer husband told office staff members, "she's really young; she's freaking out," and eventually they took pity and found a time for Schulman to see the doctor sooner rather than later.\u000a\u000aIn a waiting room filled with elderly people, Schulman gloomily observed the same symptoms she was experiencing: the rigidity, the tremors. Her name was called.\u000a\u000a"The first time Dr. Factor saw me, he was like, 'Wow, you're young,' " she said. Immediately, he explained that there's no "100% test" to tell somebody they have Parkinson's disease.\u000a\u000aStill, the news was grim. After a symptom check and neurological evaluation, he said he believed that Schulman had Parkinson's.\u000a\u000a"I was OK, but pretty hysterical," Schulman said.\u000a\u000aThe cause of Parkinson's\u000a\u000aPeople under the age of 40 make up about 15% of all Parkinson's cases, according to Factor.\u000a\u000a"We call that young-onset Parkinson's, while under the age of 20 is juvenile-onset of Parkinson's disease," Factor said. "That's much less common. The youngest person I've personally seen with Parkinson's had onset at age 18."\u000a\u000aWhy some patients develop Parkinson's at a very early age is not completely clear, explains Dr. Rebecca Gilbert, an associate professor of neurology at NYU Langone Medical Center. "But it does seem that patients who get it early tend to have a more prominent genetic component," added Gilbert, who is also a movement disorder specialist.\u000a\u000aMonica Schulman with her husband, Jeremy, recently enjoying a night out together.\u000a\u000aSchulman's genetic tests revealed a mutated LRRK2, one of the most prominent and researched Parkinson's disease genes.\u000a\u000aAccording to Factor, between 1% and 3% of all people with Parkinson's disease in the United States have this mutation. It's more common among some ethnicities, such as Ashkenazi Jews and North African Berbers.\u000a\u000aYet LRRK2 has only about a 30% "penetrance," Gilbert said: "If you inherit the abnormal gene, you have a 30% chance of developing Parkinson's."\u000a\u000aGilbert acknowledges that the genetics are "very complicated and getting more complicated every day." Oftentimes, she says, patients who develop the disorder at an older age have some genetic component.\u000a\u000aIn fact, a whole variety of genes either cause or are associated with or contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson's disease.\u000a\u000a"There are well over 20 genes that impact Parkinson's," Factor said. "There are five of them that are what we call causative -- in other words, the mutation causes the disease -- whereas the other genes just impact risk."\u000a\u000aAs he explains, the risk genes are teaching scientists about what systems (and symptoms) might be involved in Parkinson's. For instance, one risk gene regulates immune response, and it is well-known that inflammation in the brain is a symptom of the condition.\u000a\u000a"Some have thought that the progressive nature of the disease may be because of this ongoing inflammatory change in the brain," Factor said.\u000a\u000aHead Trauma\u000a\u000aSchulman, who has spent a good deal of time researching her illness, knows that a possible contributing factor -- or in some cases a cause -- is head trauma. (Sports legend Muhammad Ali's doctors believe that boxing-related brain injuries led to his Parkinson's diagnosis.)\u000a\u000a"There are some studies that have shown having a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness at some early time in your life can be associated with the development of Parkinson's later, but the impact it has on your risk is small," Factor said. "Muhammad Ali was a complex case."\u000a\u000aAli had young-onset Parkinson's diagnosed in his late 30s, Factor explains. Early in the course of his disease, some doctors said Ali looked like he had typical Parkinson's disease, with a tremor in one hand, but over time, his symptoms became compounded by effects from the trauma of his career.\u000a\u000a"People who were boxers that get pugilistic Parkinson's often don't respond to medications, and they have a different look," Factor said.\u000a\u000a"When I was 18 years old, I was in a really bad car accident in 1996 where I flipped my car seven times," Schulman said. "I broke high vertebra in my neck and had to wear a halo." She also began suffering from from anxiety and depression.\u000a\u000aToday, she wonders "if that impact is why what's happening now is happening."\u000a\u000aDopamine in the brain\u000a\u000aAt their first meeting, Factor recommended that Schulman get a DaTscan, a nuclear imaging test that looks at brain chemistry, specifically the integrity of dopamine cells.\u000a\u000aIf you have normal integrity of dopamine cells, you don't have Parkinson's, Factor explains, but if the test results are abnormal, "then you can have any one of these series of diseases that results in the death of dopamine cells, Parkinson's being the most common."\u000a\u000aThe scan showed "that I already had some dopamine loss on one side of the brain, on the right side, so that affects the left, and that's where my symptoms are," Schulman said.\u000a\u000aDespite the results, Schulman says, she "wasn't really convinced" and asked for recommendations for second opinions. Two other doctors reached the same diagnosis after they learned her symptoms and saw the DaTscan results.\u000a\u000a"So why do you have a lack of dopamine in your brain? You have a lack of dopamine in your brain because a certain cell that produces dopamine dies. There's degeneration of a specific type of neurons," Gilbert said.\u000a\u000aThough it's "more complicated than that" because the dopamine deficiency mainly accounts for motor symptoms of the disease, Parkinson's "affects a lot of different areas of functioning," including autonomic functions (such as blood pressure and breathing), cognition and urination.\u000a\u000aTreating Parkinson's, then, is a matter of producing dopamine in the brain.\u000a\u000aMedication\u000a\u000aA key of Parkinson's treatment is the drug levodopa , which is converted into dopamine in the brain and is "the cornerstone" of Parkinson's therapy, says Factor. Accordingly, he has prescribed it for Schulman along with a second drug, rotigotine.\u000a\u000aParkinson's patients experience "ons and offs," said Factor: motor fluctuations in response to the drug. These fluctuations appear as involuntary movements, known as dyskinesia. Actor and Parkinson's patient Michael J. Fox has this symptom and writes in his autobiography about overmedicating with levodopa early in his diagnosis to "cover" his symptoms and keep working.\u000a\u000aSome researchers believe dyskinesia is caused by medication flowing in waves or pulses in the brain. Some believe that taking too much levodopa causes dyskinesia.\u000a\u000aOne of the big discussions in the field is whether and when to start treatment with levodopa, Factor explained, since the drug contributes to dyskinesia. But it is not the only cause.\u000a\u000a"I personally believe that the progressive nature of each individual's disease predestines them to get it at some point," Factor said. "So if you delay the levodopa to try and prevent it, you're not going to prevent it, and you're going to lose a period of time when patients can have a really good response."\u000a\u000aHe tends to use it early, to give young patients the best opportunity to continue working. To limit the dose and delay fluctuations, he adds a second drug to the regimen.\u000a\u000aAnother reason for giving levodopa to young-onset patients is that they can undergo deep brain stimulation surgery once the fluctuations become troublesome.\u000a\u000a"Young people are the best candidates, because they are healthy and will have long-term benefits from the surgery," Factor said.\u000a\u000aAs Gilbert explains, delivery of medication is one of the most important areas of Parkinson's research right now. The goal is finding a way to deliver medication that stimulates the production of dopamine within the brain in a more continuous, sustained way. Among the new delivery systems, pharmaceutical researchers have developed infusion systems to pump medication directly into the small intestines.\u000a\u000aOne new class of drugs under development is chemically similar to caffeine, says Factor, because caffeine appears to lower the risk of getting Parkinson's disease in people with certain genes. Surprisingly, nicotine and other environmental toxicants may have a similar effect, lowering the risk for people with a certain genetic profile.\u000a\u000a"We very rarely see Parkinson's disease in active smokers," Factor said.\u000a\u000aFrom Schulman's perspective, all the research focused on medication is somewhat disappointing.\u000a\u000a"It's all symptom management," she said, adding that she doesn't expect a cure in her lifetime. Despite recent advances in neuroscience, a cure for this complex disease is not on the horizon.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, even though she knows "there's no reason to suffer and it's not necessarily going to get worse if you begin to take levodopa right now," she still has some worry about taking too much levodopa.\u000a\u000a"The tremor is annoying when I'm out at a restaurant with friends and my meds are wearing off," Schulman said. "I can feel myself moving, so I try to sit on my hand.\u000a\u000a"It's also hard taking all these meds regularly. It's like three times a day," she said. "But I'm dealing with it and functioning."\u000a\u000aPrognosis\u000a\u000a"Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick," Susan Sontag wrote in her book " Illness as Metaphor ," adding that sooner or later, each of us will count ourselves among the citizens in the country of sickness.\u000a\u000aBut not everyone in the kingdom of the sick believes the stamp on her passport.\u000a\u000a"There's still part of me that doesn't believe that I have Parkinson's," Schulman admitted. "I just have that percentage that still thinks they all got it wrong and maybe it's something else.\u000a\u000a"I'm trying to get over this denial phase, because I think I've been in it a little too long."\u000a\u000aIn January, she will leave her job as a preschool teacher and start focusing on "going to the gym every day and getting a trainer and start moving more and taking it a little more seriously."\u000a\u000aExercise is the best thing Parkinson's patients can do for themselves, according to Gilbert, who says, "lots and lots of things are improved when patients exercise." Many studies have showed that exercise improves symptoms of depression, helps with cognition and slows the progression of motor symptoms.\u000a\u000aAlthough Factor refers to her symptoms as mild, Schulman says, "to me, it's pretty not mild, because I feel them." She noticed that her tremor has worsened since her diagnosis in early 2015 and asked Factor if that meant she is progressing quickly.\u000a\u000a"It's slow and slower, that's what he said: People progress slow or slower," Schulman said. "They don't know how much I'll progress. They don't know if I'll stay this way and never get worse. They know to a point you do get worse, but everybody's different. Two years from now, I could be a lot worse or be where I'm at right now."\u000a\u000a"The hardest part for me is not even so much that I have Parkinson's disease, it's my kids," said Schulman, who has an 11-year-old son, a 10-year-old son, a 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son. Each knows in some way about their mother's disease.\u000a\u000a"My oldest is aware. I sat with him once, and I talked to him about it, and he started crying actually, and he asked me if I was gonna die, and I said 'no, I'm not gonna die,' " she said. "The other ones know, but they don't really know so much about it.\u000a\u000a"I cried a lot thinking now my kids are going to have a mom who is sick, someone who is not going to be able to do things they want me to do," she said. "I feel so bad for my husband. We've been married for 15 years, and now he has a wife with Parkinson's."\u000a\u000aMost people die with Parkinson's disease, not because of it, says Factor. Still, people with very long-term Parkinson's can develop dementia or lose their ability to walk and then may get complications of immobility, such as pneumonia or other infections.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"They say you don't die from Parkinson's, but ..." Schulman said with a laugh. "I sort of disagree."\u000a\u000aEverywhere on the groups she's joined -- a Facebook group and other chat rooms -- family members say their loved ones died from complications of the disease.\u000a\u000a"I just hope that I progress slowly enough that there will be better medicine to help," she said.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, she still finds it embarrassing to say she has Parkinson's, because "people envision an old person shaking and looking a little funny."\u000a\u000a"I want to be one of those personalities, those people who are like a fighter and gung ho and raising money and supporting the foundation and out there about it."\u000a\u000a"I want to be that way," Schulman said. "I'm just not there yet."

That\u2019s the lowest percentage since World War II, as you might have heard an Occupy Wall Street protester point out. (Not coincidentally, one in five young adults now lives below the poverty line.) Almost a quarter more people ages 25 to 34in other words, people who should be a few years into their independent livesare living with their parents than at the beginning of the recession.\u000a\u000aBeing young is supposed to mean you have the luxury of time. But in hard times, a few fallow years can become a lifetime drag on what you earn, sort of the opposite of compound interest. Because the average person grabs 70 percent of their total pay bumps during their first ten years in the workforce, according to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, having stagnant or nonexistent ­wages during that period means you hit that springboard at a crawl. Economist Lisa Kahn explained to The Atlantic in 2010 that those who graduate into a recession are still earning an average of 10 percent less nearly two decades into their careers. In hard, paycheck-shrinking numbers, the salary lost over that stretch totals around $100,000. That works out to $490 or so less a month, money that could go, say, toward repaying student loans, which for the class of 2009 average $24,000. Those student loans (the responsible borrowing option!) have reportedly passed credit cards as the nation\u2019s largest source of debt. This is not just a rotten moment to be young. It\u2019s a putrid, stinking, several-months-old-stringy-goat-meat moment to be young.\u000a\u000aEarlier generations have weathered recessions, of course; this stall we\u2019re in has the look of something nastier. Social Security and Medicare are going to be diminished, at best. Hours worked are up even as hiring staggers along: Blood from a stone looks to be the normal order of things going forward, to borrow the business-speak. Economists are warning that even when the economy recuperates, full employment will be lower and growth will be slowera sad little rhyme that adds up to something decidedly ­unpoetic. A majority of Americans say, for the first time ever, that this generation will not be better off than its parents.

aVStory highlights On Sunday, a Walmart employee discovered a tractor-trailer with dozens of people -- several dead, many injured\u000a\u000aRaul Reyes: Rather than politicize the incident, we need to treat the victims with the human decency they deserve\u000a\u000aRaul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Early Sunday morning, a horrific scene unfolded in the parking lot of a San Antonio Walmart. A call from a Walmart employee led to the discovery of dozens of alleged undocumented immigrants packed inside an 18-wheeler.\u000a\u000aAuthorities said at least nine people died, and more than a dozen were assessed as having life-threatening injuries. The air conditioning in the truck was not working on a day when temperatures in San Antonio ranged from 90 to 100 degrees.\u000a\u000aPerhaps nearly as shocking as this report were the harsh early reactions on conservative news and social media. Some Americans are unwilling to accord undocumented immigrants sympathy even when they are in distress or near death. This should not come as a surprise given that we have a president who has never missed an opportunity to demonize the undocumented.\u000a\u000aBut instead of reacting to this tragedy with anger and outrage, we should view these migrants with empathy. They are the human toll of our broken immigration system.\u000a\u000aThere is little doubt that the dead and injured inside the truck were seeking to enter the United States in violation of the law. As we learn more about this incident, shouldn't we ask why they were doing so? If the victims fit recent patterns of illegal immigration, many were likely from Central America -- not Mexico. These people, while they may be coming to the United States in hopes of working, are fleeing gangs and violence at home.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Jody Neal-Post has been reading about the health care law debate with worry these days.\u000a\u000aShe's worried about how the new health care law won't carry protections for all people with pre-existing conditions. She is relatively healthy, but before Obamacare, she had a hard time getting insurance because of what some companies considered a pre-existing condition: She is a domestic violence survivor.\u000a\u000aBefore Obamacare, some insurance companies used to consider medical treatment related to domestic violence and rape a pre-existing condition that would preclude survivors from getting insurance. Some states have banned that practice, but not all. Neal-Post worries that changes in the way insurance companies handle people with pre-existing conditions could hurt her fellow survivors.\u000a\u000a"I had really good counseling," Neal-Post said. "So the story of the abuse has now become a fact story for me, rather than an emotional one, but reading about this insurance debate prompted this memory of fighting for insurance that hadn't come to the forefront for me in a long while."\u000a\u000aIn 2002, Neal-Post's husband beat and tried to choke her. Her medical records at the time showed that he grabbed her so hard, there were fingerprints on her neck. The story of the abuse made the newspapers at the time. In 2006, when the Albuquerque lawyer tried to switch insurance plans, she ran into problems.\u000a\u000aThe insurance application asked for her medical history. She disclosed that she was the victim of a crime, had a severe concussion then and "was strangled momentarily to unconsciousness." She included that she got private counseling through a police department program for abuse survivors and, as part of treatment, was given a six-month prescription for Valium to help her sleep.\u000a\u000a"I would see his eyes when I was falling asleep, and I would see him choking me as if I was trying to get away from him again," Neal-Post said. "I couldn't sleep."\u000a\u000aThe insurance company rejected her application. By law, it didn't have say why, but she says she was otherwise healthy.\u000a\u000aShe did eventually get insurance, but under Obamacare, it would never have been a problem; currently, insurance companies cannot deny policies or charge people more based on any pre-existing conditions.\u000a\u000aNow, the bill under consideration in the House weakens the protections for those with pre-existing conditions. States would be allowed to get a waiver from the US Department of Health and Human Services to let insurance companies set premiums based on a person's medical background under certain circumstances. If the bill becomes law in its current form, that could mean survivors could face higher insurance bills.\u000a\u000aAt the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing to confirm Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania , asked Price about this issue. Would Price "commit to maintaining the protections that ensure victims of domestic violence will not be discriminated against when purchasing health insurance?"\u000a\u000aPrice responded said it's "absolutely vital" that such "victims" not be "priced out of the market."\u000a\u000a"I should have been more aggressive pinning him down on that," Casey said, in retrospect. "The nature of this is such that it would be a disaster for this administration to allow that policy to change," and if this "lapses into a 'Well, the states will take care of it,' that is wrong and wrong morally."\u000a\u000aInsurance industry changes\u000a\u000aThere has been movement in the insurance industry to prevent companies from making policy decisions based on someone's status as a survivor of abuse.\u000a\u000aThe NAIC Network Adequacy Model Act (PDF), revised and adopted in 2015, included a resolution passed by the professional association for state insurance regulators, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that prohibits "unfair discrimination by health carriers and insurance professionals on the basis of abuse status." This isn't a law like Obamacare, but it serves as guidance for states when they make insurance-related laws. Not all states, however, have adopted this policy.\u000a\u000aAmerican's Health Insurance Plans , the association that represents health insurance providers, said in an email that "of course survivors of domestic abuse and rape should be covered."\u000a\u000aSenior Vice President of Communications Kristine Grow pointed out that health plans follow the laws implemented by the ACA and the guidance set forth by the NAIC Model Act. And just because there isn't a law doesn't mean that's how insurance companies in those states operate.\u000a\u000aBut if the ACA is rolled back and states haven't adopted the NAIC Model Act, some survivors could be newly vulnerable again.\u000a\u000aShe said it's unknown how many survivors had been denied policies prior to Obamacare, because insurance companies didn't have to disclose why they turn someone down for a policy.\u000a\u000aIn 1994 , the House Judiciary Committee did an informal survey of 16 of the nation's largest insurers, representing about 50% of the market at the time. Eight of the 16 companies admitted using domestic violence as a factor to set premiums and to determine who should get a policy.\u000a\u000aMore questions for survivors\u000a\u000aThere are many other survivors' stories.\u000a\u000aWhen the National Women's Law Center launched a campaign to support its study called "Being a Woman is not a Pre-Existing Condition" in 2009, Borchelt said, it came across a story about Chris Turner.\u000a\u000aTurner was a health insurance agent who asked insurance underwriters she worked with whether rape survivors would get coverage. She said the underwriters told her no. Medical treatment associated with rape made the person too high a risk.\u000a\u000aThe question Turner asked was posed as a hypothetical, but it wasn't.\u000a\u000aTurner was a rape survivor. She'd been drugged and raped while on a business trip. Doctors put her on medication to prevent HIV as a precaution. When she had that general conversation with an underwriter, Turner had needed to switch insurance policies, but she now knew how difficult that would be.\u000a\u000aThe Affordable Care Act changed that. And it ensured that tests for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, plus domestic and interpersonal violence screening and counseling, would be completely covered by insurance companies.\u000a\u000aThat may not be the case in the future. Under the current bill, states could seek waivers that would let insurers sell plans that don't include all the essential health benefits mandated by the ACA.\u000a\u000a"We are really concerned that getting rid of the ACA will send us back to the day when insurance companies discriminated against women," said Borchelt, whose group opposes the repeal of Obamacare.\u000a\u000aNeal-Post also remains concerned, although she was eventually able to get health insurance, even before the Affordable Care Act. Her state, New Mexico, had a law that prohibited insurance companies from using domestic abuse as a criterion for denying someone health insurance.\u000a\u000a"Eventually, with the intervention of the (attorney general's) office and the consumer insurance division, I got insurance," she said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aShe knew, though, that she had a personal advantage in getting health insurance coverage, because she is a lawyer.\u000a\u000a"I had awareness and a skill set to push back to get myself covered, and I know a lot of women don't have that access," Neal-Post said. The recent Obamacare repeal efforts bother her.\u000a\u000a"For years, I had been freed from this angst" due to these legal protections. "Reading the votes in Congress made me think about this issue again, and I was immediately concerned for other women."

MAIA Luxury Resort & Spa\u000a\u000aThis private peninsula resort, based on the secluded and picturesque Anse Louis, is as exclusive as it gets on the mainland of Mahé.\u000a\u000aOnly guests of the all-inclusive 30-villa retreat have access to its lush grounds, which includes a beach-level restaurant, swimming pool and bar as well as a stunning open-air Balinese spa.\u000a\u000aMost clientele spend most of their stay in spacious thatched beach or hillside villas -- each with its own ocean-facing infinity pool, outdoor sunken tub and 24-hour butler/in-room dining service -- to make most use of MAIA's space for ultimate privacy and comfort.\u000a\u000aMAIA Luxury Resort & Spa , 5th June Ave, Anse Boileau, Seychelles; +248 4 390 000\u000a\u000a2. North Island\u000a\u000aNorth Island features three unspoilt beaches.\u000a\u000aFor ultra-luxury there's North Island, the Seychelles' preeminent private island where one night's stay can set you back more than $5,000.\u000a\u000aThe 11-villa butler-serviced island has hosted many an A-lister -- including the Clooneys, the Beckhams and most famously the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- plus other wealthy travelers who seek complete privacy in a "barefoot luxury" setting.\u000a\u000aNorth Island features an intimate cliffside spa, three unspoilt beaches and a chef who cooks whatever you wish (In the mood for lobster? Octopus curry for lunch? No problem). Beyond the exclusive beaches and massive beachfront villas, the eco-conscious resort runs a lauded nature conservancy program, which has led Hawksbill and green turtles to nest once again on its pristine shores.\u000a\u000aNorth Island , Seychelles; +248 4293 110\u000a\u000a3. Six Senses Zil Pasyon\u000a\u000aThe Six Senses brand makes its splashy African debut with Zil Pasyon ("Passion Island" in Creole) in 2016, becoming the country's "it" resort of the moment. It's a private island sanctuary of 30 modern villas, each with a generous personal infinity pool and in-villa wine cellar.\u000a\u000a"Butlers" are not a thing here; instead, designated Guest Experience Makers cater to guests' needs 24 hours a day. There are six restaurants and bars, including The Chef's Kitchen, an exclusive gourmet treat for up to six guests for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\u000a\u000aActivities include daily yoga, beachside cinema nights and outdoor spa treatments between two enormous boulders, and should guests have a bit of "private island fever," the more populous La Digue and Praslin islands are just a short boat ride away.\u000a\u000aSix Senses Zil Pasyon , Felicite Island, Seychelles; +248 467 1000\u000a\u000a4.

Serious spa-goers will feel at home here, as quality treatments such as the Hilltop Fusion Massage -- blending Malaysian, Indian and European techniques -- are carried out in private pavilions among the resort's highest altitudes.\u000a\u000aThe resort's westward profile makes for brilliant sunset views, best enjoyed either on a villa's ocean-facing deck lounger or on the spa's breathtakingly placed rooftop, overlooking all of Petite Anse and onto the horizon.\u000a\u000aFour Seasons Seychelles , Petite Anse, Mahe Island, Seychelles; +248 4 393 000\u000a\u000a5.

Though this beach and Petite Anse Kerlan hug the resort's main area, it's worth the shuttle ride or 15-minute hike to visit Anse Georgette, one of the world's highest-rated beaches.\u000a\u000aDining options include modern international restaurant Diva, sleek buffet restaurant The Legend (with premium themed dinners), and The Nest's deck "on the rocks": a coveted, private dining space for two amongst boulders and stellar beach views.\u000a\u000aConstance Lemuria , Anse Kerlan, Praslin, Seychelles; +248 4 281 281\u000a\u000a6.

Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa\u000a\u000aHilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa isn't based on a private island, but it might as well be. There are only 200 inhabitants on the island on which it is based, Silhouette, which happens to be the Seychelles' third largest.\u000a\u000aVilla options in this tropical getaway accommodate a wider scope of budgets than most others, ranging from the affordable King Garden Villas to the nearly 12,000 square feet Silhouette Estate, said to have the largest private pool in the Seychelles.\u000a\u000aIt remains a popular choice for families with a state-of-the-art Kids' Club and babysitting services, and it also offers plenty for the active traveler, including a PADI diving center and varied guided hike excursions around the island's lush, virgin rainforests.

aVDonald Trump lashed out Wednesday at a female lawyer whom he had called "disgusting" several years ago for requesting a break to pump breast milk in the middle of a deposition, calling her a "vicious, horrible person."\u000a\u000aIn an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, the Republican presidential candidate claimed that the attorney, Elizabeth Beck, had wanted to pump breast milk in other people's presence. Trump alleged that Beck was now retaliating against him because she was unhappy about having lost that legal battle, and that she had fabricated a story about Trump losing his cool and storming out of the deposition room.\u000a\u000a"She wanted to breast pump in front of me and I may have said that's disgusting, I may have said something else. I thought it was terrible," Trump said. "She's a vicious, horrible person."\u000a\u000aElizabeth Beck described the 2011 encounter - first reported by the New York Times late Tuesday - as Trump having "an absolute meltdown" in an interview with CNN's "New Day" Wednesday morning.\u000a\u000a"He got up, his face got red, he shook his finger at me and he screamed, 'You're disgusting, you're disgusting,' and he ran out of there," Beck said.\u000a\u000aTrump strongly refuted this characterization in Wednesday's interview, saying Beck had distorted the events.\u000a\u000a"She made it up. She made it up," he said. "She's saying, 'Oh, he was so violent and he was so, so wild and she was afraid.' She was afraid of nobody. She's a tough killer in Miami everyone knows she's a killer. They all hate her."\u000a\u000aWell-known for his colorful language and imagery, Trump went on to compare Beck's interview with CNN earlier in the day to the way people who had never met Michael Jackson discussed the iconic pop star after his death.\u000a\u000a"So many people are on television that don't know me and they're like experts on me," Trump said. "You know when Michael Jackson died - I knew him very well - and everybody was talking about Michael Jackson. They didn't know him, they knew nothing. Some of them never even met him."\u000a\u000aPressed on how the 2011 incident reflects on how Trump would behave as president - and how he would react if challenged by a world leader like Russian President Vladmir Putin - Trump answered: "Believe me, I'd do very well with him. I get along with people."

aVPhotos: Basketball's big bucks Although Stephen Curry (R) and LeBron James battled in the last two NBA Finals, their team contracts are on different playing fields. Two-time reigning MVP Curry is criminally shortchanged -- by NBA standards -- at $12.1 million this season, while LeBron lords over the list of top earners in the world's highest paying league. While James' position is expected, there are some eye-popping inclusions on this list. (Source: basketball-reference.com) Hide Caption 1 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 20: Harrison Barnes, $22.12 million \u2013 Barnes became excess luggage at Golden State once Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors. The free agent -- who endured a poor NBA Finals and was essentially the 12th man on the Team USA roster in Rio -- signed a four-year $94.4 million deal with Dallas. The Mavericks are depending on the 6-foot 8-inch 24-year-old to take the scoring load off veteran Dirk Nowitzki. (Note: No's 20 -15 will all earn $22.12 million this season, the maximum under the current salary cap for players with up to six years of experience). Hide Caption 2 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 19: Andre Drummond, $22.12 million \u2013 Drummond led the NBA in both offensive and defensive rebounds last year, averaging a total of 14.8 per game. He also made the All-NBA Third Team, confirming his status as a top-15 player in the league. The 6-foot 11-inch center was rewarded with a five-year max deal from the Pistons, worth over $127 million. Hide Caption 3 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 18: Chandler Parsons, $22.12 million \u2013 Parsons, a small forward coming off a season at Dallas where he averaged 13.7 points and 4.7 rebounds, signed a staggering four-year $94 million deal with Memphis in July. Parsons has yet to make an All-Star team, or average more than 16.6 points in a season; maybe that's why 38-year-old Grizzlies owner Robert Pera tweeted a GIF of a child throwing money out a window the night of the deal. Hide Caption 4 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No.17: Hassan Whiteside, $22.12 million \u2013 Whiteside (#21) is the ultimate American redemption story. The seven-footer was drafted out of lowly Marshall University, and was cut by the Sacramento Kings, Memphis Grizzlies and even Al Mouttahed Tripoli of the Lebanese league before catching on with Miami in 2014. In a league run by "small ball," Whiteside excels as a throwback center, averaging 3.68 blocks per game in 2016 -- the highest mark since 2000. He also recorded three triple-doubles -- tying LeBron James and James Harden -- earning him a four-year $98 million deal with the Heat in July. Hide Caption 5 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 16: Anthony Davis, $22.12 million \u2013 Last season was supposed to be Davis' breakout campaign, but he sat out the last 14 games with knee and shoulder injuries as the Pelicans missed out on the playoffs. Davis has yet to endure a full NBA season and said he has been troubled by left shoulder pain since his rookie campaign. When healthy, however, he is the most dominant big man in the game, which is why New Orleans signed a five-year, $127 million extension to his deal in 2015. Hide Caption 6 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 15: Bradley Beal, $22.12 million \u2013 Beal averaged 17.4 points per game on 39% three-point shooting with Washington last season, playing second fiddle to John Wall. Although Beal suffered a variety of niggling injuries which kept him on the bench for large chunks of the season, Washington rewarded him with a head-scratching five-year $127 million deal. Hide Caption 7 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 14 Chris Paul, $22.89 million \u2013 Paul is arguably the greatest Clipper of all time. Ever since the diminutive point guard took over LA's forgotten team five seasons ago, the Clippers have become a perennial playoff power -- a stark contrast to the four post-season appearances in the franchises' previous 27 years in the city. Thirty-one-year-old Paul has the option to terminate next season's salary of $24.3 million and test free agency, but has sustained two major injuries in the last three seasons. Hide Caption 8 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 13 Dwight Howard, $23.18 million \u2013 Once a franchise player, Howard endured three lackluster years in Houston feeding off of James Harden's scraps. Though he will be entering his 13th NBA season, Howard is still only 30 and will look to rejuvenate his career in Atlanta. Plagued by injuries, the 6-foot 11-inch center's scoring sunk to 13.7 points per game last season, though he is still a rebounding force at 11.8 per game. Hide Caption 9 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 12: Dwayne Wade; $23.2 million \u2013 Entering his 14th year, the 34-year-old Wade is following a campaign where he notched 74 regular season games for the first time since 2011. But he also recorded a career-low in minutes (30.5 per game) and three-point shooting (a dismal 16%). Seeking star power, the Chicago Bulls signed the three-time champion to a two-year $47 million deal. Hide Caption 10 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 11: Chris Bosh, $23.74 million \u2013 Although Bosh's status as an NBA player is in doubt because of reoccurring blot clots in his lungs, he is on a guaranteed three-year deal with the Miami Heat for $75.8 million. Bosh and the Heat have severed ties, though the team will not release him before February 9 (a year after his last game) to claim salary cap relief. If Bosh plays another 25 games in the league -- and he is determined to make a comeback -- the Heat will be on the hook again. Hide Caption 11 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 10: Damian Lillard, $24.33 million \u2013 Two-time NBA All-Star Lillard is set to be a perennial fixture in the event -- no small feat coming out of the point-guard heavy Western Conference. Lillard's scoring jumped to 25.1 points per game during the regular season, but he really shined during the Blazers' 11 playoff games, averaging 26.5 points, 6.1 assists, 4.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 91% free throw shooting. If he keeps improving, the 26-year-old will be up for MVP consideration -- which is why Portland committed $120 million of guaranteed money to keep him around until 2021. Hide Caption 12 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 9: Carmelo Anthony, $24.6 million \u2013 Since joining the Knicks in 2011 -- and signing two deals guaranteeing $138 million -- 'Melo has won just one playoff series. Anthony, however, is coming off a third consecutive Olympic gold medal performance and will work around a re-tooled team featuring Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah and last year's rookie sensation Kristaps Porzingis. Hide Caption 13 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 8: Dirk Nowitski, $25 million \u2013 Thirty-eight-year-old Dirk Nowitzki is entering his 19th season as a Dallas Maverick and is surely the team's greatest player of all time. The future first-ballot Hall-Of-Famer and former league MVP already racked up $220 million in career earnings before signing a two-year deal last summer for $50 million. Call it a goodbye gift from Mavs owner Mark Cuban. Hide Caption 14 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 7: Al Horford, $26.54 million \u2013 After nine solid seasons in Atlanta, Horford decided he needed a change of scenery and moved north for greener pastures -- both in uniform and compensation. Horford signed a four-year, $113 million deal with Boston, which will take his total career earnings to more than $190 million by the time he hangs up his high-tops -- not bad for a 30-year-old with career highs of 18.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game.\u000a\u000a(Note: No's 2 -- seven will all earn $26,540,100 this season, the maximum under the current salary cap for players with seven to nine years of experience). Hide Caption 15 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 6 Kevin Durant, $26.54 million \u2013 Only days after the Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals, the team was injected with a huge dose of goodwill. Durant opted to bolt Oklahoma City -- who happened to be the Warrior's biggest Western Conference threat -- for the Bay Area. The 6-foot 9-inch sharp shooter signed a two-year $54.3 million deal, but can leave Golden State in the off-season if things go awry. Hide Caption 16 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 5: James Harden, $26.54 million \u2013 Harden -- who signed a four-year $118 million deal with the Houston Rockets in the off-season -- is the best one-on-one scorer in the NBA not named Steph Curry. The bearded gunner, who averaged a career-high 29-points-per-game last season, has been accused of selfish play and lackadaisical defense as his number have risen. But that didn't deter team owner Leslie Alexander. "I don't think people appreciate how great he is, but we certainly do," he said at the signing. Hide Caption 17 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 4: Mike Conley, $26.54 million \u2013 Memphis Grizzlies point guard Conley signed the most lucrative deal in NBA history during the off-season at five years and $153 million. Conley is a serviceable point guard, but hasn't made an All-Star team in nine NBA seasons. The deal is more a function of timing, as the NBA salary cap is about to lift off in the 2017-2018 season, when a new collective bargaining agreement is set to kick in. Hide Caption 18 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No. 3: Russell Westbrook; $26.54 million \u2013 One could argue that Westbrook finally got what he wanted this summer: Full reign over a young, athletic team where every possession will start and end with his decision-making. The Thunder feared the worst when Kevin Durant skipped town, but Westbrook showed character by opting to stay in small market Oklahoma City -- not that the reported three-year, $85.7 million hurt. Westbrook has been a triple-double machine without Durant in the lineup, and -- barring injury -- he'll be in top MVP consideration this season. Hide Caption 19 of 21\u000a\u000aPhotos: Basketball's big bucks No 2: DeMar DeRozan, $26.54 million \u2013 DeRozan (#10) is a spectacular scorer for Toronto, but featured only a bit role on Team USA's gold medal team this summer. No matter, the Raptors, who have a history of losing draft talent to free agency -- from Chris Bosh to Tracy McGrady to Vince Carter -- locked up the 27-year-old shooting guard to a five-year $137.5 million deal, the second-highest in NBA history.

aVJoe Minihane, CNN \u2022 Updated 1st August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 London's status as a world aviation hub extends far beyond Heathrow. The UK's capital is served by six airports in total, some stretching the geographical definition of London to the limit.\u000a\u000aWhether you're arriving on a budget flight into Luton or taking a long-haul trip out of Gatwick, our airport guide for London will tell you how to get in and out of town and what to expect when you're in the terminal.\u000a\u000aPrices are provided for rough guidance, but are likely to change from the ones listed here, which were accurate as of 2017.\u000a\u000a1. Heathrow (LHR)\u000a\u000aHeathrow Airport , London's main hub, is also one of the world's busiest airports, with 75.7 million passengers passing through in 2016.\u000a\u000aSpread across five terminals and just 14 miles west of central London, it's the easiest airport for getting into town.\u000a\u000aThe Piccadilly Line on the Underground metro system serves three tube stations (Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 3; Terminal 4; and Terminal 5 -- all in fare zone 6), with trains running every two to three minutes during the day, with a journey time of around 45 minutes from zone 1.\u000a\u000aFares cost £5.10 at peak times (6.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m., 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., Monday to Friday) and £3.10 at off-peak when using an Oyster card or contactless payment card. This rises to £6 for a paper ticket at all times.\u000a\u000aHeathrow is London's busiest and biggest airport.\u000a\u000aAlternatively, there's a train direct connecting to Paddington station in west London. The Heathrow Express takes 15 minutes to Terminals 1, 2 and 3, with the on-the-spot fares starting at £22 for a single ticket and £37 return.\u000a\u000aLong dubbed the UK's most expensive train journey, heavy criticism has led to the introduction of cheaper advance tickets, starting as low as £5.50 when bought 90 days ahead of a weekend trip and £12.10 for a weekday.\u000a\u000aThirty-day advance tickets cost £8.80 for weekends and £14.30 for weekdays, while 14-day advance tickets cost £12.10 at weekends and £16.50 on weekdays.\u000a\u000aNational Railcard holders can also get a 34% discount on advance tickets.\u000a\u000aHeathrow can feel like a shopping mall with an airport attached -- but it's still a great airport.\u000a\u000aBusiness Class tickets, offering more legroom, cost £32 one-way and £55 return.\u000a\u000aThe Heathrow Connect service , which stops at intermediate stations between Paddington and Heathrow, costs £10.30 for a single ticket and £20.70 for a return. National Railcards are also accepted on this service.\u000a\u000aNational Express operates 51 coach services per day from Victoria coach station, a five-minute walk south from Victoria train station. Turn-up-and-board tickets cost £10 single, with £5 advance tickets available.\u000a\u000aAn open return costs £26, while fixed returns can be secured for as low as £14. Journey times are optimistically advertised as 35 minutes, although London's notorious traffic often means it can take twice as long.\u000a\u000aA traditional black cab can take you to and from Heathrow meaning you don't have to deal with public transport. But depending on traffic, journey times can be anywhere between 30 minutes and one hour, with prices set between £46 and £87.\u000a\u000aTaxis can take five passengers, with some larger vehicles able to accommodate six, plus wheelchairs and buggies.\u000a\u000aRide-share services and minicabs -- as pre-booked cabs are known in the UK -- can be booked for private trips and will cost less. However, the likes of Uber are not allowed to send their drivers into the terminal to greet you, meaning more traditional methods are more stress-free.\u000a\u000aWhile Heathrow can at times feel like a shopping mall with an airport attached, it's unquestionably the best-served airport in London.\u000a\u000aEvery major airline flies here and the facilities are largely excellent. The fact it runs at 99% capacity, though, means it's often extremely busy. Non-European Union arrivals should prepare for long queues at immigration.\u000a\u000a2. Gatwick (LGW)\u000a\u000aAt around 25 miles from the city center, Gatwick is more mockney than cockney. Spread over two terminals (North and South), which have been mercifully refurbished in recent years, Gatwick handled a massive 43.1 million passengers in 2016.\u000a\u000aThat hefty distance from the city center means it can be both costly and time-consuming to get to and from Gatwick if you don't book transport in advance.\u000a\u000aThanks to the UK's somewhat opaque rail ticketing system, it's all too easy for first-time visitors to wind up with the wrong ticket and on the wrong train.\u000a\u000aGatwick's train station is served by Gatwick Express Southern and Thameslink trains. Gatwick Express trains run non-stop to London Victoria every 15 minutes and take half an hour, while Southern services run to Victoria, with journey times between 35 and 50 minutes. Thameslink serves London Bridge, as well as London Blackfriars and London St Pancras, with trains taking up to 60 minutes.\u000a\u000aGatwick's the most convenient airport if you're traveling to south coast destinations such as Brighton.\u000a\u000aGatwick Express charges £17.80 single from Victoria if you book online. An open return costs £31.80 when booked online. Alternatively, you can also use your contactless payment card or Oyster card to get to the airport without buying a paper ticket. This costs £19.80.\u000a\u000aA paper ticket single bought at Victoria or Gatwick will cost you £19.90. Gatwick Express also offers £25.50 off for two people traveling together using its Web Duo tickets, available online only. This works out at £45.50 for both passengers.\u000a\u000aGatwick Express also offers first class tickets, costing £29.70 at the station or £26.50 online for a one-way fare. Returns cost £57.50 regardless of where you buy, but if you get one online you'll also get free airport lounge access. First class offers a cordoned-off area on the train, but seats are identical to standard and there's no on-board catering.\u000a\u000aGatwick handled a massive 43.1 million passengers in 2016.\u000a\u000aSouthern trains offer singles for £15.70 from Victoria, a return costing £31.40. These fares can be as low as £12 one way if booked in advance. Thameslink tickets are much cheaper, with singles from London Blackfriars and London Bridge starting at £10.40 single and £19.80 return.\u000a\u000aNational Railcard holders can get discounts on all three services.\u000a\u000aBe aware that boarding a Gatwick Express train with a Southern or Thameslink ticket can leave you liable to a penalty fare. Gatwick Express trains are red, while Southern or Thameslink trains are either green and white or purple.\u000a\u000aThis train line is also regularly hit by disruption, thanks to aging tracks and signals, industrial action and a generally poor service. Southern is statistically the UK's worst train operator.\u000a\u000aGatwick Airport train station is cramped and queues can get very long, so buy online and print tickets at home if you can.\u000a\u000aGatwick Airport train station is cramped and queues can get very long, so buy online and print tickets at home if you can.\u000a\u000aIf all that seems stressful (and even for Londoners, it truly is), Gatwick offers its own taxi service to central London, with prices starting at £22.50 based on four people sharing. A black cab will cost up to £125 depending on traffic, with journey times taking up to 90 minutes.\u000a\u000aCoaches run from Victoria coach station to Gatwick and are much more affordable than the train. easyBus offers advance tickets from as little as £2 and also drops off at London Waterloo, while National Express tickets start from £5. The latter has kiosks in both the North and South terminals.\u000a\u000aFor the brave (or just the foolhardy), Gatwick has impressive cycle access. It's on National Cycle Route 21 , which runs from Greenwich in south London, and has bike parking as well as bike lifts for getting in and out of the South terminal. Ideal if you're off on a two-wheeled trip.\u000a\u000aGatwick's security is much swifter than Heathrow's and immigration lines tend to move fast thanks to automatic gates. Its restaurants have also improved markedly in recent years. However, the overabundance of shops, much like Heathrow, means spaces to sit and relax before take-off are at a premium.\u000a\u000a3. Stansted (STN)\u000a\u000aWith more scheduled flights to Europe than any other UK airport, Stansted is hugely popular with those taking budget flights to and from the continent.\u000a\u000aOriginally a World War II airfield, it has a two-mile long runway designed to accommodate US Air Force Flying Fortresses, although today's planes are a lot smaller and far less menacing (molten in-flight Ryanair toasted sandwiches notwithstanding).\u000a\u000aThirty miles equidistant between Cambridge and London and set in leafy Essex countryside, Stansted is easiest to reach from the east of the city.\u000a\u000aStansted is one of London's best spots for budget flights.\u000a\u000aThe Stansted Express train service runs every quarter of an hour and takes 45 minutes to and from Liverpool Street in London's financial district. It also stops at Tottenham Hale for connections to the London Underground Victoria Line and the center of town.\u000a\u000aSingle journeys cost £16.60 from Liverpool Street, with return fares costing £28. From Tottenham Hale, tickets cost £26 return and £15.70 single.\u000a\u000aAdvance fares are available online, staring at £7 single from Liverpool Street and £6.50 from Tottenham Hale.\u000a\u000aNational Railcard discounts apply here also.\u000a\u000aThe Stansted Express also offers first-class tickets, which come with a fast-track pass allowing you to skip the line at security. Singles cost £27.10 from Liverpool Street and £42.10, £25.30 and £41.10 from Tottenham Hale. Advance first-class tickets are available from £24 online. First-class seats are wider than in standard, with more legroom. A catering trolley offers refreshments for all passengers.\u000a\u000aNational Express coaches run to Stansted Airport 24 hours a day on four different routes into town, dropping off at 18 different locations across London. Fares start from as little as £5 one-way when bought online, with returns costing £10. Journey times can be as fast as 50 minutes, but traffic in and out of the city can easily clog up, pushing trips closer to the two-hour mark.\u000a\u000aThe Stansted Express delivers passengers to Tottenham Hale and Liverpool Street stations.\u000a\u000aPre-booked cabs -- known as minicabs -- from the center of London to Stansted Airport can cost as little as £60. However, hailing a black cab to take you the full 30 miles will cost in excess of £100.\u000a\u000aStansted only has one terminal, an award-winning design by Norman Foster which opened in 1991.\u000a\u000aIts original spacious, bright concept has been critically undermined in recent years, however, due to the unbending British obsession of turning every free space in an airport into a shop. As such, the terminal can feel cramped.\u000a\u000a4. Luton (LTN)\u000a\u000aLike Gatwick and Stansted, London's fourth airport, at Luton , is nearly 30 miles from the city center. Yet despite being the same distance from town, it's the quickest of the three to reach by train (not including the shuttle bus to the terminal).\u000a\u000aEast Midlands trains run fast, hourly services from London St Pancras to Luton Airport Parkway, taking just 25 minutes. Thameslink runs a more regular service from St Pancras, at intervals of every 15 minutes at peak times, with journey times between 30 and 35 minutes. Tickets cost £27.50 return, with one-way fares at £15.70. First-class singles cost £25, with returns at £47.30. First class is rudimentary, however, and does not represent great value for money.\u000a\u000aThameslink trains also run to London Blackfriars, Farringdon and City Thameslink, with access to connecting trains and Tube services.\u000a\u000aNational Railcard discounts apply.\u000a\u000aLuton is 30 miles from the city center -- but easy to get to.\u000a\u000aVisitors should remember to buy a ticket to Luton Airport rather than Luton Airport Parkway. The latter is the nearest station to the airport, with all passengers required to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. This adds 10 to 15 minutes to all journey times. Failure to buy the correct ticket means having to pay a £2.10 bus fare.\u000a\u000aNational Express coaches pick up and drop off at 30 different locations in London from Luton Airport, with one-way tickets from £5 online.\u000a\u000aYou can pay a £5 add-on which allows you to get on any available coach 12 hours before or 12 hours after your planned departure time. Journey times from Victoria coach station can take as long as two hours during rush hour, although that falls to around an hour at peak times.\u000a\u000aLuton is a basic but functional airport.\u000a\u000aA pre-booked taxi costs from around £50, with a black cab costing around £100 depending on traffic. Luton Airport is next to the M1 motorway, so traffic can get heavy, especially during early mornings and evenings.\u000a\u000aThe airport itself is basic, with a lack of ample seating space after clearing security. The preponderance of budget airlines such as Easyjet means that a lot of flights leave very early, with crowds building from around 4 a.m.\u000a\u000aPassengers often have to queue in corridors to board rather than waiting in a dedicated seating area.\u000a\u000aThe airport is going through a huge redevelopment, due to be finished in 2026.\u000a\u000a5. City (LCY)\u000a\u000aArguably London's most convenient airport, City is nestled in the heart of the Docklands area, six miles from the City financial district and a stone's throw from Canary Wharf.\u000a\u000aFlights into and out of City tend to be short-haul hops to Europe for business travelers, although BA1 , British Airways' 32-seat business-class-only flight to New York gives it the edge among bankers and suits working down the road.\u000a\u000aLondon City airport is just a few miles from the city center.\u000a\u000aCity doesn't have a mainline train station, but can be accessed via the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). You can travel directly from Bank in the heart of the City of London in 20 minutes.\u000a\u000aAlternatively, you can take the Jubilee Line to Canning Town, from where it's just a seven-minute DLR ride to the airport. City Airport is in Zone 3, with a single fare costing £2.80 off peak or £3.30 at peak times, as long as you use an Oyster card or contactless payment card. A paper ticket costs £4.90.\u000a\u000aBlack cabs from the City take around 40 minutes and can cost more than £40 depending on traffic. A pre-booked taxi from central London costs from £27. Local bus services also drop off at the airport, although these understandably take circuitous routes through surrounding areas and are best avoided if you're in a rush.\u000a\u000aLondon City might be small, but you can fly to New York from here -- business class only.\u000a\u000aCity Airport is small, with a handful of restaurants and lounges. However, the relative lack of flights taking off and landing mean that it rarely feels crowded. Its dinky size also means that it's a short walk from the DLR station to arrivals and departures.\u000a\u000a6. Southend (SEN)\u000a\u000aHistory shows that city boundaries are fluid. But not so fluid to include an airport that sits a massive 42 miles from the center of London.\u000a\u000aSouthend is a town deep into Essex, where the Thames opens out into the North Sea. But its little airport has managed to become an important hub for visitors using budget airlines to fly to and from short-haul destinations across Europe, largely in France and Spain.\u000a\u000aGreater Anglia trains operate from London Liverpool Street direct to Southend Airport, with a journey time of 53 minutes. Tickets cost £16.20 for a "super off-peak" single (super off-peak runs from 12 noon until 4 p.m., and then from 7 p.m. until the end of service).\u000a\u000aAn Anytime single costs £17.10 and a first-class single costs £27.50. Return tickets cost £25.00 at off-peak times, £34.29 for an Anytime fare and £52.30 for first class. Cheaper advance tickets using specific services are available online. National Railcard discounts apply.\u000a\u000aLondon Southend is actually more than 40 miles from the center of London.\u000a\u000aSouthend's small size means it's not as easily reached by bus or coach. The X30 service runs between Southend Airport and Stansted Airport, which is handy for connections. A single ticket costs £16 and a return £23. A group return ticket costs £50. All are available to buy from the driver.\u000a\u000aPre-booked taxis cost around £70, while a black cab will cost as much as £150 when factoring in distance and the heavy traffic getting out of London.

aVHeath Fogg Davis is Associate Professor of Political Science at Temple University. He is the author of Beyond Trans: Does Gender Matter? (New York University Press). The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In the United Kingdom, the gender-neutral honorific "Mx" is increasingly being used on driver's licenses and bureaucratic forms such as banking statements . Americans, however, have been slower to use Mx in lieu of Mr. or Ms.\u000a\u000aThe honorific "Ms." was first introduced in 1901 , but it took several decades for it to be adopted by linguistic gatekeepers such as the New York Times, which only began using it in 1986 alongside "Mrs." and "Miss." How long will it take for Mx to take hold on our side of the pond?\u000a\u000aNew policies, language and forms of address recognizing nonbinary gender identities and classifications are prompting Americans to move beyond the assumption that everyone should assimilate into the categories of male or female. The times are changing, and so is our language.\u000a\u000aPopular culture is starting to reflect this shift. In the Showtime series "Billions," Asia Kate Dillon, the self-described nonbinary actor who identifies as neither male nor female and uses the pronouns "they," "them," and "theirs," plays a nonbinary character named Taylor Mason who interns at Axe Capital, a billion-dollar New York hedge fund.\u000a\u000aOnce Taylor's financial prowess warrants a face-to-face meeting with Bobby "Axe" Axelrod , the CEO, Taylor rushes to tell him, "My pronouns are they, them and theirs." To which Axe (played by Damien Lewis) replies, "Those are the pronouns you use? Great, let's get down to business. How can you make me money?" In a crass way, the scene shows that gender is often irrelevant to "getting down to business."\u000a\u000aEven the bureaucracy of gender is changing. Washington, DC and the state of Oregon now offer a nonbinary gender option on their driver's licenses , and New York has proposed similar legislation. Instead of M for male or F for female, these policies allow drivers to choose X for "unspecified." California lawmakers have proposed adding a third unspecified gender designation not only to driver's licenses but to birth certificates , too. If passed into law, parents in that state will be able to override the longstanding practice of letting medical professionals decide and record on birth certificates whether their children are male or female based upon the appearance of their genitals at birth.\u000a\u000aBut as anyone who has ever held a job knows, most workplaces are anything but gender-neutral. And one of the common objections to this type of public de-emphasizing of gender categories is that it will cause confusion about the "order of things." However, as more and more cities and state governments come to recognize nonbinary gender classification, other organizations, like businesses, universities and the media, will have to navigate unfamiliar terrain.\u000a\u000aWe could ditch honorifics altogether, and simply address each other by our last names if we want to maintain some semblance of formality. Or maybe it's time to let go of linguistic formality altogether. Millennials are doing away with much of that formality in their correspondence with customers by simply using first names in email and live chat customer service.\u000a\u000aAs the author of a book that offers pragmatic guidance on how to develop institutionally sound and trans-inclusive administrative policies, I offer three approaches for organizations to consider as they navigate this new terrain.\u000a\u000aLet nonbinary individuals educate\u000a\u000aLet individuals who identify as nonbinary educate other people on a case-by-case basis. In "Billions," we only see Taylor do this on two occasions: informing their internship supervisor, and then schooling Axe. In other scenes, Taylor interacts with fellow interns and co-workers without announcing their pronouns. We don't know, but it's reasonable to expect that news about Taylor's pronouns would reach co-workers via gossip -- especially since Taylor has been tapped as indispensable to the firm's success.\u000a\u000aEstablish a company norm\u000a\u000aHave everyone within the organization, not just nonbinary people, announce their pronouns -- verbally and in print. Increasingly, I'm at meetings that begin by going around the table and having each attendee state their name and the pronouns they use. For example, I would say, "My name is Heath, and I use he, him, and his." Another way to establish pronoun statements as an organizational norm is to ask each person in the organization to include their gender pronouns in their email signatures. These reforms have the benefit of taking some of the pressure off nonbinary people who are typically in the minority. They don't have to explain their pronouns because others are reminded of them in meetings and in emails. It also makes binary people aware their pronouns may not be obvious to others in every setting.\u000a\u000aAdopt a company-wide gender-neutral pronoun\u000a\u000aRequire that everyone adopt a gender-neutral pronoun such as "they, them, and theirs" when it comes to interacting and corresponding with others in the organization. Some object that this repurposing of the plural pronoun should be rejected because it's grammatically incorrect. But the meanings of words shift over time -- something that the writers of dictionaries know all too well. Indeed, Merriam-Webster notes that the use of "they, their, them and themselves as pronouns of indefinite gender is well established ... in speech and writing, even in literary and formal contexts."\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aDe-emphasizing gender in public isn't the same thing as saying that gender never matters. Whether someone appears to be male or female is typically the very first thing we notice about other people. But gender identity isn't always visually obvious.\u000a\u000aWhy put a restaurant server or customer service agent in the position of having to assess and ultimately guess someone's gender in transactions where gender is irrelevant? Out of respect for individual gender self-determination, we ought to minimize the opportunities for others to evaluate our gender and risk getting wrong something so important.

"When my members in the committee say, 'Well, we have no one here from the administration to weigh in on this,' I say, 'Be careful what you ask for. It's pretty nice the way things are.'"\u000a\u000aRepublican senators are even defying Trump in some obvious ways.

"It's an image I'll never get out of my mind."\u000a\u000aLakhani was staying in a hotel in Cambodia, and he realized that one solution to the problem was being thrown away: barely-used bars of soap.\u000a\u000aSo, he figured out a way to save this soap and give it a second life.\u000a\u000aWhile still attending the University of Pittsburgh, Lakhani started the Eco-Soap Bank. The nonprofit recycles discarded bars of soap from hotels in Cambodia and distributes it to people in need.\u000a\u000aWhile there are similar programs that recycle hotel soap, Lakhani's focus in Cambodia is unique.\u000a\u000aToday, the organization has four recycling centers across the country, providing jobs to 35 local women. The used bars are sanitized and remolded into new bars or melted down into liquid soap.\u000a\u000aSo far, more than 650,000 people have benefited from the group's soap and hygiene education.\u000a\u000a"What I love most is that we are killing three birds with one stone," Lakhani said. "We are keeping waste out of landfills, employing locals and spreading soap all over the country."\u000a\u000aCNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Lakhani about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: Why is it difficult for rural Cambodians to access soap?\u000a\u000aSamir Lakhani: First is affordability. If you're earning only $1.50 every single day, you're not going to spend $1 of your daily wage on an imported bar of luxury soap. They're going to prioritize feeding their families. And if they can afford soap, they will pick the least expensive option, which is usually detergent, which is so harmful and toxic on the skin.\u000a\u000aThe second reason is access. The demand is so low, shopkeepers and local markets have stopped stocking soap. The last reason is, very simply, because many Cambodians don't really understand where illness and disease come from, they don't really take the appropriate steps towards mitigating those effects. And that includes use of bar soap.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Heroes: From hotel soap to Eco-Soap Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Heroes: From hotel soap to Eco-Soap 01:48\u000a\u000aCNN: Eco-Soap Bank's work is based in Cambodia and largely run by Cambodians. What are the benefits of being in the same country you're serving?\u000a\u000aLakhani: (It) has a ton of benefits, the first one being able to very quickly respond to outbreaks, such a cholera and impetigo and other things like that. Almost immediately, we're able to use our stockpile of soap and critically address whatever crisis is present.\u000a\u000aAnother overlooked benefit is the opportunity to be able to hire local deserving employees who can immensely benefit from steady employment from our program.\u000a\u000aCNN: What's it like for the women you hire?\u000a\u000aLakhani: Our soap recyclers are all local women who were striving to find some source of reliable, predictable incomes. They face immense hardship. And unless someone is willing to invest in their future, it's hard to crawl out of that. The women that we employ currently have been able to provide for their entire families, pay down debt and resume education for their children.\u000a\u000aLakhani shares a light moment with staff at Eco-Soap Bank--which employs local women\u000a\u000aWe believe very firmly in the intellectual capabilities of our staff members. We provide them with free daily English classes and other business skills training.\u000a\u000aAnd the second type of employee can work from home or they can work from their own store. We give them a free supply of our soap to sell, generate incomes for them and their families, and also generally promote hygiene in the community.\u000a\u000aCNN: What does the future look like for Eco-Soap Bank?\u000a\u000aLakhani: Lack of hygiene is not something that's unique only to Cambodia. It's seen across the developing world. The developing world is also home to some of the busiest tourism centers in the world. We can assume that they're producing equally large amounts of used soap that should be redirected to the people who need it.\u000a\u000aWe're looking at seven countries to expand to. We've scratched the surface. Especially when you see it firsthand, you just realize you really have a lot to do.\u000a\u000aI did not expect to be so effective by such an early age, especially without the previous professional training (to run a nonprofit). If you have one part drive and maybe one part naivety or foolishness, you can do anything.\u000a\u000aWant to get involved?

aVBlantyre, Malawi (CNN) When the women come to him, they are desperate.\u000a\u000aThey meet the traditional healer in a sparsely furnished room, a half-hour's bumpy ride outside Blantyre, in southern Malawi.\u000a\u000a"I mix these secret herbs with hot water," he says, gesturing to a concoction in a plastic container. "They all want a shortcut to terminate their pregnancy."\u000a\u000a"Once a woman drinks the mixture, she starts bleeding in less than an hour," he says, adding that the whole process takes only a few hours.\u000a\u000aA traditional healer shows a mix of herbs that he uses to induce illegal abortions in Malawi.\u000a\u000aThe healer, who asked CNN not to be identified because abortion is illegal in Malawi, shows us where the women wait after he administers his mixture \u2014 a crumbling redbrick structure with a bamboo mat on a dirt floor.\u000a\u000aIn this wretched place, the herbs begin to work and the women start to bleed, often uncontrollably.\u000a\u000aHe dismisses the very real danger the women are in, saying that they wanted a shortcut and he can provide it.\u000a\u000a"I tell them if they start bleeding too heavily, they should go to the hospital to seek post-abortion care," he says.\u000a\u000aNew research suggests that there were as many as 141,000 abortions in Malawi in 2015 -- most of them in clandestine situations like this. The rate of maternal deaths in Malawi is among the highest globally and illegal abortions are a significant reason.\u000a\u000aNow public health officials, aid professionals and doctors in Malawi fear it could get even worse. The impoverished East African nation could be one of the hardest hit in Africa by proposed cuts to US foreign aid.\u000a\u000aFunding Cuts\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, US President Donald Trump made public a budget proposing zeroing out global family-planning assistance administered chiefly through USAID.\u000a\u000aThe proposal shocked many in the global health and foreign aid world.\u000a\u000a"There is a lot at stake. The US is the largest provider of family planning in the world and has been a real leader in providing support for many low- and middle-income countries," said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of global health and HIV/AIDS at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u000a\u000aThe White House said that the proposed cuts to family planning -- and foreign aid more broadly -- were a way to save money for other budget areas like defense and to help realize Trump's "America First Policy."\u000a\u000aAnd the family-planning cuts are just part of the story.\u000a\u000aLike previous Republican presidents, Trump has reintroduced and now expanded the reach of the so-called Mexico City policy, also known as the "global gag rule," which mandates US funding withdrawals from any international non-governmental group that gives advice or helps women access abortions.\u000a\u000aThe US has also pulled all funding from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) -- a UN agency that promotes family planning -- for allegedly supporting coercive abortion in China.\u000a\u000aThe UNFPA calls the allegation "erroneous."\u000a\u000aPolitics versus real people?\u000a\u000aIn low-income countries like Malawi, family-planning cuts could be devastating.\u000a\u000a"They are giving a death sentence to our women in this part of the world," says Chisale Mhango, an obstetrician at Blantyre's main referral hospital.\u000a\u000a"It is a matter of women's lives. And with women's lives, they don't know what the issues are in Washington."\u000a\u000aMhango, a staunch advocate of women's reproductive rights, treats between 10 and 15 post-abortion cases every day at the hospital.\u000a\u000aThough abortion is illegal -- except to save the mother's life -- it is up to the public system to treat women who suffer complications.\u000a\u000aHe says that family-planning assistance, significantly funded by USAID in the country, has helped Malawian couples and women make big strides in avoiding unplanned pregnancies -- adding that condom use is on the rise and fertility rates have dropped as a result of the educational programs.\u000a\u000a"There are a lot of associated economic and development indicators that go hand in hand with family planning. It has a direct impact on people's lives but also has a significant impact for the country's development," Kates, from the Kaiser Family Foundation says.\u000a\u000aBut Mhango puts it more bluntly.\u000a\u000a"If USAID says we can not provide this service, then it is almost like saying, 'Well, our women are going to die and we know they are going to die but we are not going to help you because our president says there is no more money for you'."\u000a\u000aA USAID official noted the agency is currently the largest overall global health donor.\u000a\u000a"While the United States will continue significant funding for global health programs, even while refocusing foreign assistance, other stakeholders must do more to contribute their fair share to global health initiatives," the official said.\u000a\u000aLiving through hell\u000a\u000aFlora, whose real name has been changed for her protection from possible prosecution, remembers the day she visited the traditional healer -- April 5, 2005.\u000a\u000a"I lived through hell. After I started taking the medicine I started bleeding heavily. Then things got worse. I couldn't work. They had to fetch me in an ox cart to take me to hospital and when I was in hospital they removed my uterus," she says.\u000a\u000aFlora says that family-planning programs that are now available in Malawi could have helped her avoid the unwanted pregnancy that led to her illegal abortion.\u000a\u000aFlora's unwanted pregnancy came before the current level of family-planning education and assistance was available in Malawi. She felt her only option was to get an illegal abortion.\u000a\u000a"I had an unexpected and unplanned pregnancy. I fell pregnant when I had a very little baby. And there was no way that I could have two little babies at the same time," she says. Flora says their meager earnings as subsistence farmers would make it impossible to care for two children in quick succession.\u000a\u000aFlora says that if the help now offered by USAID and others in Malawi were available to her in 2005, she would never have gotten pregnant again, sought out an illegal abortion or lost her uterus.\u000a\u000aIt's up to Congress\u000a\u000aAdvocates of foreign aid are still hoping to avoid the cuts because the White House doesn't set the budget -- Congress does.\u000a\u000aBut the House Appropriations Committee's latest proposal cuts 24% of family-planning aid, supports the expanded Mexico City policy, and continues to withhold all UNFPA funding.\u000a\u000aIt could come down to the US Senate to preserve funding for global family planning. Policy experts hope that the Senate will remain true to recent bipartisan calls for the importance of foreign aid.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Abortion laws around the globe Replay More Videos ...

This White House has taken a very different direction from previous ones. It is a direction that appears to withdraw American Leadership from the world," said Ian Koski of the One Campaign, an international non-partisan advocacy organization.\u000a\u000aThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the proposed bilateral House cuts could mean more than 591,000 more abortions globally per year -- and a spike in maternal deaths.\u000a\u000aIn Malawi, they are nervous that any cuts could reverse the progress they have made.\u000a\u000aFlora has a simple message.\u000a\u000a"Funding for family-planning services should continue so that Malawian women can benefit."\u000a\u000aOtherwise, she says, more women could live through the hell that she did.

aV(CNN) Since its first edition back in 2010, the EyeEm Photography Festival and Awards has been quietly establishing itself in the industry calendar, attracting tens of thousands of applicants every year and revolutionizing the concept of a photography competition in the process.\u000a\u000aEyeEm -- a photography app with over 10 million users around the world -- has become one of the most important players in the increasingly democratized world of digital photography.\u000a\u000aThe quality of work on show at the awards demonstrates not only the wealth of amateur talent out there, but also that, more than ever, an image is judged on its own merits rather than the photographer who took it.\u000a\u000aLast year's edition saw an estimated 270,000 photos submitted across five categories -- photojournalism, architecture, landscape, portraiture and street photography -- and the 2017 festival promises to be even bigger. For lead curator Madeline Dudley-Yates, it's an important way of uncovering photographers whose work might not have been seen before, and a highly democratic way of running a competition.\u000a\u000a"The aim of the awards is to discover new talents and help them get their work seen on a larger scale," she says.\u000a\u000aRead More

I respect di Grassi very much as a driver, not necessarily as a person," Buemi told CNN's Supercharged.\u000a\u000aDi Grassi responded to Buemi's criticisms suggesting that the Swiss may be feeling the pressure ahead of the Montreal race, posting a veiled message on social media: "When a dog is barking, he is either afraid or unsettled.. good."\u000a\u000aWhen a dog is barking, he is either afraid or unsettled.. good. \u2014 LUCAS DI GRASSI (@LucasdiGrassi) July 21, 2017\u000a\u000aWhen asked about the tweet on Thursday, di Grassi chose to make light of the remark.\u000a\u000a"Actually I have seven dogs in Brazil -- I have a family of schnauzers -- six white and one black -- and they were barking and that was what the tweet was about," di Grassi told CNN.\u000a\u000aBuemi 'didn't deserve 2016 title'\u000a\u000aThe Brazilian was soon back in mind-games mode though when he was quizzed about Buemi's talents behind the wheel.\u000a\u000a"He's a very good driver. He has a very good team, but he is doing the job," di Grassi said.\u000a\u000a"Last year he didn't deserve to win the title -- he did a lot of mistakes even with superior equipment but this year he has been on a different level.

The Swiss, who missed the New York ePrix weekend because of a calendar clash with the World Endurance Championship race, says he is feeling more relaxed going into Montreal.\u000a\u000a"To be honest, I had much more pressure before New York because I always had in my mind that I was going to miss two races so if I want to be fighting for the championship I need to score points," he said.\u000a\u000a"Now I feel less pressure because I know I'm going to get the same opportunities."\u000a\u000aBuemi also believes the Montreal track will boost his chances.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Supercharged's Tesla adventure: Part 2 Replay More Videos ...

She is an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and a former gender scholar at Stanford University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In Paris on Thursday, fashion designer Rick Owens gave audiences quite a show when he sent male models down the runway wearing clothes with peepholes that offered a glimpse of the guys' formerly private parts.\u000a\u000a"Nudity is the most simple and primal gesture -- it packs a punch," Owens said of his decision to have his models bare all. "It's powerful. ... Who else can really get away with this stuff?

aV(CNN) This summer in Italy, you can come face-to-face with Jesus.\u000a\u000aTowering above you, his sinewy arms will stretch out for crucifixion. His glowing body will convulse sporadically, shooting off showers of golden embers.\u000a\u000aBut this isn't the second coming -- it's a piece of virtual reality art by the German-Danish artist Christian Lemmerz.\u000a\u000aTitled "La Apparizione" (The Apparition), the artwork will be presented in an empty three-by-three-meter room. Viewers step inside, slip on a VR headset and are transported into outer space, where they can circle the levitating, golden Jesus.\u000a\u000aIt is one of two virtual reality works being exhibited by the Faurschou Foundation in Venice this summer. The gallery joins a growing list of institutions that have exhibited VR art, including New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\u000a\u000aAnd as the world's top curators embrace this new medium, collectors are starting to circle.\u000a\u000aDetermining value\u000a\u000aYou might not be able to hang "La Apparizione" on your wall like a painting, but it is most definitely for sale. Lemmerz has released five editions, each costing around $100,000.\u000a\u000aBut valuing virtual art poses a new a challenge for buyers and sellers alike. Galleries normally look to artists' previous work when setting prices, but with only a small number of VR artworks on the market, there are only a few precedents to refer to.\u000a\u000aComparisons with other types of art do not always prove useful. Lemmerz is primarily a sculptor, but can "La Apparizione" be compared to his 2013 bronze sculpture of Jesus?\u000a\u000aThe latter work is an object, the former an experience. And while artists have been making bronze sculptures for millennia, virtual reality is a brand new technology more familiar to gamers than art collectors.\u000a\u000aThe market is still adjusting, according to Sandra Nedvetskaia of Khora Contemporary, the production company that helped Lemmerz create his latest VR art.\u000a\u000a"At the moment, video art works are the only comparison," she said over the phone. "But (some collectors) have likened (virtual reality artworks) to sculptures because, of course, you find yourself in the middle of that particular artist's moving sculpture."\u000a\u000aHardware is another new consideration for galleries, and those selling VR art often include a headset in the price. Nedvetskaia said that all works produced by Khora Contemporary come with HTC Vive headsets -- and a lifetime service.\u000a\u000a"That includes updates," Nedvetskaia added, "so that this artwork doesn't become (like) a video tape that you can no longer experience."\u000a\u000aBut the speed at which VR technology is changing can be a problem for artists, according to Edward Winkleman, who co-founded of the video-oriented art fair, Moving Image, in 2011.\u000a\u000a"Whether they should wait for the hot, new head-mounted display is a constant question in their practice," Winkleman says. "If they wait, they can take advantage of the new upgrades. But they may (also) miss an opportunity to present their work."\u000a\u000aAn emerging market\u000a\u000aYoung artists are experimenting with virtual reality -- and not all of their works carry the six-figure price tag of "La Apparizione," according to Murat Orozobekov, the other co-founder of Moving Image.\u000a\u000a"Primal Tourism: Island" by Jakob Kudsk Steensen (2017)\u000a\u000aNotable VR works at this year's fair included a swirling, psychedelic piece by up-and-coming digital artist Brenna Murphy, and "Primal Tourism: Island," which took viewers inside Jakob Kudsk Steensen's dystopian vision of a Polynesian island.\u000a\u000a"Prices range from about $2,500 to $6,500 for an emerging artist's work," Orozobekov said over the phone.\u000a\u000aAt the other end of the market, a disturbing VR piece by American artist Paul McCarthy is currently available at two major European galleries -- Hauser & Wirth and Xavier Hufkens -- for approximately $300,000. Set in a lurid room, the work features a group of female characters who taunt each other, and, occasionally, the viewer.\u000a\u000a"La Apparizione" by Christian Lemmerz and "C.S.S.C. Coach Stage Stage Coach VR experiment Mary and Eve" by Paul McCarthy are both presented in three-meter by three-meter rooms.\u000a\u000aThe difference in asking prices is not simply a matter of reputation, according to Elizabeth Neilson, director of The Zabludowicz Collection in London.\u000a\u000a"(There's also) the development costs of the technology they have used. Someone like Rachel Rossin does a lot of the development herself, but someone like Jordan Wolfson does none of the technological work himself, and outsources to Hollywood professionals," Neilson said, referencing two up-and-coming artists who have been working in virtual reality. "As you can imagine, this is expensive."\u000a\u000aThreat of piracy\u000a\u000aThe price of virtual artworks can be kept high by limiting the number of copies made. McCarthy's VR piece was only released in an edition of three, and Lemmerz's in an edition of five.\u000a\u000aBy deliberately restricting supply, galleries create a market for virtual reality art that is based on scarcity -- as with paintings and sculptures. But unlike other art, virtual reality pieces are infinitely replicable. In their most basic form, they are simply digital files that can be experienced by anyone with a VR headset.\u000a\u000aA visitor experiences Jon Rafman's "Tokyo Red Eye (Massage Chair)" (2015) at the Zabludowicz Collection in 2015.\u000a\u000aWhile an artist can easily limit the editions of a sculpture, it is much harder to curb the spread of a digital file -- something that the music and movie industries discovered the hard way. But this presents opportunities as well as threats, according to Nedvetskaia.\u000a\u000a"In five years' time every single one of us might have a set of virtual reality goggles in addition to our iPhone," she said. "So don't rule out the possibility that editions of virtual reality artworks might be made at an affordable price so the public can view them. We're really on the cusp of this market being born right now -- the possibilities are limitless."\u000a\u000aThe art world establishment is yet to fully embrace digital art. Neither Christie's nor Sotheby's have sold a VR work. But both have expressed cautious interest in the medium.\u000a\u000aIn March this year, Sotheby's became the first major auction house to exhibit virtual reality art. Hosted at its New York headquarters, the technology-focused exhibition "Bunker" featured "La Apparizione" and a VR work by Sarah Rothberg called "Memory/Place: My House."\u000a\u000aChristie's chief marketing officer, Marc Sands, believes that it is only a matter of time before VR starts appearing at major auctions.\u000a\u000a"Response to (virtual reality art) from both consignors and buyers is largely positive but to date we have not discovered the 'killer' version of VR," Sands said. "However, as with many things digital, it will come sometime soon."

aVDaniel B. Shapiro is a distinguished visiting fellow at the I nstitute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, Israel. He was US ambassador to Israel and the senior director for the Middle East and North Africa at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) There is no such thing as a well-timed tragedy. But a violent incident at the Israeli Embassy in Amman, Jordan, this week created an opening to solve one problem by linking it to another.\u000a\u000aWhen Mohammed Al-Jawawda, a Jordanian worker, was called to a diplomatic residence to install furniture, he stabbed an Israeli security guard with a screwdriver, according to Jordan's public security directorate. The guard fired in self-defense, killing Jawawda and another Jordanian man.\u000a\u000aJawawda's family -- who reject the accusation he stabbed the guard -- and many Jordanian protesters called for the Israeli to be detained and tried, in violation of diplomatic protocols, which grant him immunity. The Israeli government understandably wanted to get its man home.\u000a\u000aThe background for the attack was the latest flare-up in tensions around the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem.\u000a\u000aNearly 10 days earlier, three Arab citizens of Israel killed two Israeli police officers with guns smuggled into the site. Israel responded by installing magnetometers to prevent a recurrence of such violence . Palestinians called the magnetometers a violation of the delicate status quo governing the site, setting off demonstrations (both peaceful and violent) and possibly inspiring a brutal killing of three family members at their Sabbath dinner in a West Bank settlement by a Palestinian.\u000a\u000aJordan, which governed Jerusalem's Old City before 1967, still maintains a custodial role at Muslim holy sites in the city, which is acknowledged in its peace treaty with Israel. It is an important source of legitimacy for the Jordanian monarchy.\u000a\u000aAs the Jerusalem imbroglio and the embassy attack merged, astute Israeli, Jordanian and American officials put together an apparent deal: Jordan returned the Israeli guard, and Israel agreed to remove the magnetometers . Both Jordan's King Abdullah II and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had the cover they needed to take an unpopular decision that short-circuited the crisis -- at least for now.\u000a\u000a-- the political leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas -- on Jordanian soil, King Hussein refused to release the captured Israeli agents until Israel delivered an antidote for Meshaal and released the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who was serving a life sentence in an Israeli prison. The deal, once cut, quickly defused tensions between the two neighbors. Many Israeli commentators noted this arrangement had echoes of an Israeli-Jordanian deal that solved a different crisis 20 years ago during Netanyahu's first term as Prime Minister. After Mossad -- Israel's intelligence agency -- tried to poison Khaled Meshaa -- the political leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas-- on Jordanian soil, King Hussein refused to release the captured Israeli agents until Israel delivered an antidote for Meshaal and released the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who was serving a life sentence in an Israeli prison. The deal, once cut, quickly defused tensions between the two neighbors.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Christian prays alongside Muslims in Jerusalem Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Christian prays alongside Muslims in Jerusalem 01:44\u000a\u000aThese episodes underscore the extraordinary sensitivity of Jordan's position in matters that are ostensibly battles between Israel and the Palestinians.\u000a\u000aOn the one hand, since 1994 Israel and Jordan have maintained peaceful relations. They have grown increasingly close as Israel has quietly provided Jordan with extensive assistance to deal with the threats it faces from ISIS and other extremist groups in Syria.\u000a\u000aIsraeli security officials describe Jordan as providing Israel with hundreds of kilometers of strategic depth from threats farther to the east, and they consider the stability of the Jordanian kingdom among Israel's highest national security priorities. Their partnership also serves the interests of the United States, an ally to both.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, while Jordan's King is increasingly open about these ties, which also bring Jordan economic benefits and access to critical water resources, he must proceed cautiously. Israel remains deeply unpopular with Jordan's majority Palestinian-origin population. Together with domestic Islamist groups, the Jordanians are easily inflamed by any disturbances between Israel and Palestinians. Nothing is more dangerous in this regard than disputes around the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, and the King cannot tolerate the instability such events create for long.\u000a\u000aWhen matters reach a boiling point, diplomatic efforts, including those by the United States, tend to try to find a middle ground. In October 2015, I was part of Secretary of State John Kerry's successful effort to defuse a similar episode with an Israeli-Jordanian agreement to install surveillance cameras at the site (although the agreement was never implemented).\u000a\u000aIn last week's case, Israel's decision to deploy magnetometers, which are used widely at public venues around the world -- including religious sites -- was a logical security response to the attack that killed the two police officers. But politically, any unilateral move at the site is so sensitive it is virtually untenable, absent any sign of Jordanian and Palestinian consent.\u000a\u000aThat was so, even when Israel's case was strong that the move did not represent a change in the status quo and was a legitimate measure to prevent additional attacks. So there was a need for Israel to be seen as making a concession to Jordan, even as the Palestinians bore much of the responsibility for the violence that followed and did not deserve to have their tactics rewarded.\u000a\u000aBut awareness of Jordan's sensitivities should not let Jordan off the hook for its own responsibilities to prevent violence at the Jerusalem holy sites.\u000a\u000aThe Muslim religious authorities who oversee the site, the Waqf, are appointed by Jordan. Living in East Jerusalem, they are naturally highly susceptible to the mood on the Palestinian street, which suspects Israel of trying to assert more control gradually over the site.\u000a\u000aThese suspicions are stoked by the campaign of some religious Jews in Israel, including some parliamentarians and ministers (although not supported by Netanyahu) to change the rules to permit Jewish prayer at the site, which would be a major change in the status quo.\u000a\u000aBut the Waqf has the ability -- and crucially the religious legitimacy -- to establish clear rules against Muslims smuggling weapons or conducting violence at the site. By enforcing those rules, and expelling violators, they will in turn make it easier for Israel to maintain security with a lighter hand, and push back on those on the Israeli side who are challenging the status quo.\u000a\u000aTo help manage these crises, which inevitably recur, the Trump administration will need to know not only how to cut elegant deals, like this week's, but also to keep the pressure on allies such as Jordan to do all within their power to prevent and dampen the next round.

aV(CNN) Every 66 seconds this year, an American will develop Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association annual report , released Tuesday.\u000a\u000aBy the year 2050, that number is expected to double to one every 33 seconds.\u000a\u000aThose startling statistics are mirrored worldwide. In 2016, the World Alzheimer's Report estimated that 47 million people around the globe had dementia. To put that in perspective, it's a bit more than the current population of Spain.\u000a\u000aAnd because nine of 10 people with dementia in low- and middle-income countries and half of those in high-income countries are not diagnosed, the global number of people diagnosed is expected to triple by 2050.\u000a\u000a"What is driving these numbers is that there is no disease modifying treatment, no prevention and no cure," said Ruth Drew, director of family and information services for the Alzheimer's Association . "And while U.S. deaths from Alzheimer's have doubled in the last 15 years, an increase of 89%, deaths from other major diseases have been declining."\u000a\u000aFor example, said Drew, deaths from heart disease, the No. 1 killer of Americans, have declined by 14% over the same period while HIV deaths have dropped by 54%, stroke deaths by 21% and prostate cancer deaths by 9%.\u000a\u000a"Other diseases have declined because of significant investments in research that produce treatments and techniques to reduce risk, sometimes even a cure," Drew said.\u000a\u000a"The issue is mainly funding," agreed Rudy Tanzi , a Harvard professor of neurology who also heads up MassGeneral's Genetics and Aging Research Unit. "We are a knowledge-rich yet budget-constrained field. We have many clues about how to stop Alzheimer's, especially from recent genetic studies, but insufficient funds to explore how."\u000a\u000aThe cost to society\u000a\u000aExperts point out that without additional funding and a breakthrough, Alzheimer's could be the disease that breaks the nation's health care bank. In 2017, for the first time, total costs for caring for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias hit $259 billion -- over a quarter of a trillion dollars.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Toll of Alzheimer's Caregiving: Sandy's Story Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toll of Alzheimer's Caregiving: Sandy's Story 03:20\u000a\u000a"Already, Alzheimer's consumes one in every five Medicare/Medicaid dollars," Tanzi said. "With 71 million baby boomers headed toward risk age, this will go to one in three, perhaps in the next decade, at which point Alzheimer's will single-handedly collapse Medicare/Medicaid."\u000a\u000a"It will also impact the work force and our economy," Drew added. "Because every family affected will be making caregiving choices they will have at home. They will be absent more for doctor visits ... and other caregiving duties."\u000a\u000aThere's more. The association's report adds another startling statistic, the hidden cost of caregiving: In 2016, those who took care of loved ones with dementia provided an "estimated 18.2 billion hours of unpaid assistance, a contribution to the nation valued at $230.1 billion."\u000a\u000aAnd that's just the monetary impact of caregiving. Experts say no one can put a number on the emotional and health impact of caring for a loved one with dementia.\u000a\u000a"Alzheimer's is like a leaky boat in a hurricane," said Huntington Potter, director of the Rocky Mountain Alzheimer's Disease Center . "We have to both bail like mad and fix the leaks. Researchers are working hard to fix the leaks, but it will take time; for now, the main load is carried by the bailing caregivers. They are on the front lines in this war against Alzheimer's."\u000a\u000aToll of caregiving\u000a\u000aKristen Beatty is one of those fighting on the front lines. She and her brother, Doug Rider, are caring for their 78-year-old father, Ray, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about 10 years ago.\u000a\u000aRay and Susan Marie Rider at daughter Kristen's wedding in 2004.\u000a\u000a"My father was a lifer in the Air Force, a colonel, a fighter pilot and a Vietnam veteran," Beatty said. "My mom, Sue, was a proper military wife, and between them, they had a 'don't ask, don't tell' attitude about informing us kids about his illness."\u000a\u000aIt wasn't until they took over their dad's care that they learned just what their mother had been going through.\u000a\u000a"He developed a sense of paranoia and thought people were stealing from him and believed everyone was out to get him," Beatty said. "He would go to bed early but then get up and was up all night long, arguing with mom.\u000a\u000a"They would have conversations and arguments over and over again. She wasn't getting any sleep. She was exhausted with the constant care and pressure. But she never once complained. She didn't want us to be scared."\u000a\u000aBut in 2012, after five years of caregiving, Sue Rider dropped dead of a heart attack.\u000a\u000a"We say that she died of a broken heart," Beatty said. "Died from the stress of caring for him. She was eating super healthy, walking every day, taking very good care of herself. So I truly believe it was the stress.\u000a\u000a"It's awful, just awful," she said with a catch in her voice. "My brother and I feel so guilty, because we could have supported her, but she would not ask for help; she would not consider moving him into a facility; she would not go to support groups."\u000a\u000aDoug Rider with dad Ray, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 10 years ago.\u000a\u000aToday, Beatty works with the Alzheimer's Association to call attention to the burden of caregiving. She points people to the resources available to them online and stresses that no one should feel as if they are alone.\u000a\u000a"My mom was the glue of the family, a genuine sweet and amazing soul. It's painful, really painful. What I do today is all powered by supporting her, so that it wasn't in vain," Beatty said. "We collectively as a nation need to step up, because Alzheimer's is an epidemic, and our health care system is not set up to support caregivers."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe cost of Alzheimer's, including caregiving, is a reality that will soon affect everyone, say experts.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people think that 'Alzheimer's doesn't affect me because I'm not old' or 'I don't have it in my family, so it's really not my problem,' " Drew said. "What we've come to understand is, if you have a brain, you're at risk for Alzheimer's disease."\u000a\u000a"If we all live to age 85 -- and who doesn't hope to live at least that long? -- almost half of us will have Alzheimer's disease," Potter said, "and the other half will be caregivers. No one is immune."

The 30-year-old's extraordinary achievements will be looked back upon with wonder by future generations.\u000a\u000aThey will watch replays of the young Bolt of Beijing, hushing the crowd on the starting blocks before bang... history -- his arms raised, thumping his chest, clocking a barely believable 9.69 seconds to shatter the 100m world record.\u000a\u000aThe 21-year-old's speed was jaw-dropping, the other eight men in a distinguished field left trailing in his wake.\u000a\u000aThey were in a different race and this 6ft 5in newcomer was from another planet.\u000a\u000aTwo more gold medals followed on the Chinese capital's lightning-quick track, his 2008 coronation as sprint king complete.\u000a\u000aHearts and imaginations were captured and he has been loved ever since.\u000a\u000aBolt wins the 100m Olympic gold in Beijing\u000a\u000aThe irreplaceable joker-in-chief\u000a\u000aThere have been so many glorious moments.\u000a\u000aBerlin in 2009, when the Jamaican reduced his 100m and 200m world records further; London 2012 when all three of his Olympic sprint titles were retained.\u000a\u000aBack to Beijing in 2015, older, ailing, but managing to fend off the challenge of twice-banned Justin Gatlin to retain his grip on 100m and 200m world titles.\u000a\u000aThen there was Rio last summer, his Olympic farewell ending in further triumph.\u000a\u000aThose who will live in a Bolt-less sporting age will wish they had been there, just as we all want to be inside London's Olympic Stadium on Saturday when the history-maker lines up in the 100m final for his last competitive individual race.\u000a\u000aThe 4x100m relay on August 12 is likely to be his grand encore. The final act of this gilded athletic tale.\u000a\u000aThere is little point asking who will take over once he is gone. No-one can clown around on the start line and execute excellence like track and field's joker-in-chief.\u000a\u000aAs the eight-time Olympic champion himself said this week, it will take more than one athlete to fill his vibrant void.\u000a\u000aSavor him now because Bolt is irreplaceable.\u000a\u000aBolt of Jamaica celebrates winning the Men's 4 x 100m relay at the Rio Olympics\u000a\u000a"It's a simple formula that doesn't actually work," says Michael Johnson, whose 200m world record was thought unbreakable until Bolt broke it ... twice.\u000a\u000aWe asked him how his sport will cope without its showman.\u000a\u000a"The idea that you have an athlete who's the best there's ever been in the sport, who just happens to have an electric personality as well," explains Johnson, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, "you're not going to replace that.\u000a\u000a"That's not going to come around again. It would be ridiculous to look for it and, I think, the sport has made a mistake by relying on that for the last eight years because he was never going to last forever."\u000a\u000aBecoming a legend\u000a\u000aHoping that the show would go on and on is perhaps forgivable. It is easy to forget that even the seemingly superhuman age, just like the rest of us, no matter how effortless and enjoyable they make winning seem.\u000a\u000aA showman supreme, a magnetic personality, he has been likened to Muhammad Ali, though he has stayed away from politics.\u000a\u000aHe has continued to compete because he knew only sustained success would see him ranked alongside the three-time heavyweight champion and Pele, regarded as the greatest footballer of all time.\u000a\u000aHe wanted to be "among the greatest," he said before going on to achieve an unprecedented "triple-triple" of Olympic sprint golds in Rio, though he has lost the 4x100m relay gold he won in Beijing as a result of team-mate Nesta Carter's positive doping test.\u000a\u000a"I am a legend," Bolt has said a number of times, after winning three golds in London, and again in Rio.\u000a\u000aIt would be braggadocio from anyone else but, as he himself has explained, he has proved himself to be the best for nearly a decade.\u000a\u000a"I feel that if you have done something, it is not bragging," he has said.\u000a\u000aBut even Ali, like most in life, had to comeback from lows. It added to his legend. Bolt, however, has excelled at major championships no matter what his form or fitness. His only failure was a false start in the 2011 World Championships 100m final.\u000a\u000aYes, he has slowed over the years and the frequency of injuries have increased. At times, the country boy who began racing to buy his mother a washing machine has also struggled for motivation after achieving more than he ever dreamed.\u000a\u000aBut even Bolt beyond his peak has always managed to be better than the rest.\u000a\u000aThe iconic image of Bolt while competing in the men's 100m in Rio\u000a\u000a"He's just a phenomenally talented athlete," says Johnson.\u000a\u000a"He's absolutely been tested. I don't think that you could discount anything that he's done over the years. Some of the fastest times in the 100m and 200m have come about during his career."\u000a\u000a'You have blessed us with Usain Bolt'\u000a\u000aBolt salutes the crowd after running his final race in Jamaica\u000a\u000aThe sprint freak from a remote Jamaican village has already said his goodbyes to his own; a five-hour farewell in the national stadium in Kingston, a celebration which started with prayers from an ordained minister.\u000a\u000a"We thank you God, for you have truly been good to Jamaica," it began. "You have blessed us with doctor, the honorable Usain St Leo Bolt, the embodiment of sportsmanship, who remind us of the gumption and indomitable spirit of the Jamaican people."\u000a\u000aThirty-five thousand people watched their most famous son run his 84th and last race on home soil. Bolt, so those on the inside say, would have preferred for that to have been his farewell.\u000a\u000aHe is most comfortable at home, living as ordinary a life as a millionaire superstar can. He trains in a public gym, dances in nightclubs. There is no need for private security.\u000a\u000aIt is when he steps onto foreign soil that people become agog by his presence, which means life on the road is mostly spent in hotels.\u000a\u000a"In Jamaica you take it for granted that you can see him every day," says Colin Reid, a photographer who has followed Bolt's career with the Jamaican Observer.\u000a\u000a"In the international fraternity, they're awestruck. But he's just like one of us. He lives in Kingston. He's approachable, he's amiable, I see him around a lot."\u000a\u000aWhat you see is what you get, says Reid, something Bolt has also repeated in numerous reports. He enjoys partying, he is still the boy a teacher once described as being full of "tricks and stories."\u000a\u000aBolt the thinker, the intellectual\u000a\u000aHidden behind the tomfoolery on the track, however, is a thoughtfulness, a keen athletics brain and an intense competitive streak.\u000a\u000aHe is a smiling assassin. His desire to be the best is such that he no longer plays Call of Duty as he cannot cope with not being as good as he used to be.\u000a\u000a"He's much different when he's in a much closer setting," says Johnson.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, I don't think the world has been able to see that he is very thoughtful, highly intellectual about athletics, about sprinting.\u000a\u000a"Most people think that he goes out there and that it's easy and he doesn't really care if he wins or loses, that he's just having fun."\u000a\u000aBolt has said he allowed a film crew to follow him in the year leading up to Rio for the movie "I Am Bolt" so people could see how hard he worked; vomit-inducing track sessions, suffering in the gym, early-morning wake-up calls.\u000a\u000aEd Moses, a two-time Olympic champion who dominated the 400m hurdles in a 122-race unbeaten decade, calls Bolt a mathematician, though when later asked his agent Ricky Simms admits he has never heard his client described as such.\u000a\u000a"He's an intellectual guy," says Moses.\u000a\u000a"He's thought a lot about what it's going to take to get him through the first 40m. He had the tools and resources to put it together and that's why he's great."\u000a\u000aUnlike many of history's great talents, Bolt has been appreciated in his own time. For nearly a decade he has radiated in a sport darkened by doping.\u000a\u000aNine of the 30 fastest 100m times, including the top four, are Bolt's. The other 21 marks on that list have been run by athletes who have, at some point, tested positive for doping.\u000a\u000aQuestions have been raised about Bolt, especially when he first emerged in Beijing. After all, athletes as tall as him are not supposed to run that fast, but the man himself is not bothered by such talk.\u000a\u000aHe is different, a speedster whose long levers allow him to cover the 100m in just 41 strides when others need a few steps more and a little more time.\u000a\u000aAnd so, in under 30 seconds, or 132 steps, Bolt's career will be over. He will be out of sight, as he has been to his competitors for most of his career.\u000a\u000aThere will be no fooling around, no celebratory "To Da World," no electrifying nights under the floodlights.\u000a\u000aIt will never be the same again.

aV(CNN) The list of football players with a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, continues to grow. But what exactly is CTE? Here are five things you need to know:\u000a\u000a1. CTE isn't just about concussions\u000a\u000a2. Harder helmets aren't the answer\u000a\u000aPeople like to point to safer helmets as a solution, but helmets can't do anything to protect your brain from sub-concussive hits. Imagine your brain like an egg; the shell is the helmet; the yolk is your brain. Just because you have a thicker shell, like an egg carton, doesn't protect the yolk from moving back and forth whenever the egg is shaken or moved around.\u000a\u000a3. Football players aren't the only ones who need to worry about CTE\u000a\u000aDespite all the talk about football players, they aren't the only ones concerned about CTE. The disease has been diagnosed in soccer and baseball players , and possibly even in military veterans . In fact, the first mention of CTE was a disease in boxers called "dementia pugilistica" or "punch-drunk" syndrome in a 1928 issue of the Journal of American Medical Association. The article said, "For some time, fans and promoters have recognized a peculiar condition occurring among prize fighters which, in ring parlance, they speak of as 'punch drunk.' Fighters in whom the early symptoms are well recognized are said by the fans to be 'cuckoo,' 'goofy,' 'cutting paper dolls,' or 'slug nutty.' "\u000a\u000aPhotos: Athletes and CTE had the most advanced stage of CTE when he died in March at the age of 46. Dr. Ann McKee of Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation said that Turner's CTE brought on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCTE stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated head trauma. Scientists believe repeated head trauma can cause CTE, a progressive degenerative disease of the brain. Symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation, but scientists can definitively diagnose it only after death. Former pro football player Kevin Turner, shown here during a 1998 NFL game,had the most advanced stage of CTE when he died in March at the age of 46.

Hide Caption 22 of 22\u000a\u000a4. No one knows how prevalent CTE is\u000a\u000aScientists can't say with certainty who will get CTE. They believe there maybe be genetic and environmental components at play. Researchers at Boston University have found 96% of ex-NFL players suffer from the disease. But that doesn't mean 96% of all football players are at risk of having the disease. Remember, the disease has been studied in brains that have been donated by family members who suspected their loved ones may have CTE. It's not completely random -- it's known as selective bias.\u000a\u000a5. There is no known cure for CTE\u000a\u000aThere's no way to diagnose it in living people. The only way to diagnose it is by autopsy. However, researchers hope that if they can identify it in living people, it will put them a step closer to understanding how the disease progresses and in turn lead them to a possible cure.

aV(CNN) For the past two months, I have been a changed man. It is hard to fully describe, except to say my mood is mostly sunny and more patient than usual.\u000a\u000aIn the past, my family and friends would've typically described me as pleasant but hurried. My baseline restlessness and edginess, however, have now nearly vanished.\u000a\u000aWithout difficulty, I have sustained attention when my young children spend time with me. Instead of constant surveillance of my phone, there is an ability to quickly hyper-focus on the task is at hand and a corresponding joy of living in a distraction-less world.\u000a\u000aThis change seems to have started the end of last year, after I spent a morning meditating with the Dalai Lama.\u000a\u000aFirst off: Yes, I do feel a little ridiculous writing a line like that, and I didn't feel worthy of his invitation at the time. Even though I meditate, I've never been sure whether I was using proper technique or whether there was an acceptable way to meditate in the presence of His Holiness.\u000a\u000aIf he was looking forward to a good meditation partner, I worried he was unlikely to find it in me. Even my posture is terrible when sitting cross-legged on the floor. My back starts to hurt, followed by my knees. Thus, my breathing, which is supposed to drive my focus, sounds raspy and uneven. All this makes my mind race instead of slowing down and calming.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Mindful meditation with the Dalai Lama Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mindful meditation with the Dalai Lama 00:50\u000a\u000aJust thinking about meditating with His Holiness was making me anxious.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, who says "no" to a chance to meditate with the Dalai Lama? I agreed to join him early the next morning at his private residence.\u000a\u000aA practice that begins at 3 a.m.\u000a\u000aAt 81 years, old, the Dalai Lama keeps a very active schedule. I met him in Mundgod, India, at the Drepung Monastery, where he was overseeing a symposium bridging Buddhism and science.\u000a\u000aThe monastery itself is a dazzling bejeweled structure built 600 years ago. Inside, there are enormous golden Buddhas standing next to ornate walls. The discussion hall itself is grand but warm, with doors and windows open to the hot South Indian sun.\u000a\u000aFor three days, his Holiness moderated sessions on weighty metaphysical topics such as the criteria for valid reasoning, the fundamental constituents of the universe, origins of life and the subjective experience of the mind.\u000a\u000aIt was fascinating and mind-bending -- but also mentally exhausting. It was difficult to stay awake, let alone keep up with the rapid-fire debate between the Buddhists and the scientists. Yet his Holiness was mentally engaged and inquisitive throughout, even more remarkable given more than half the comments were being translated for him.\u000a\u000aThe Dalai Lama typically wakes about 2:40 a.m. and starts his daily meditation routine at 3 a.m., even as most of his staff is still snoozing.\u000a\u000aThis was the backdrop when one of his senior staff members picked me up outside the monastery early one morning. We drove in a three-car convoy to the gates outside his private residence.\u000a\u000aFrom there, several more staff members escorted us to a small conference room where his security detail was slowly waking and drinking their morning tea. Finally, his chief of staff walked me just outside the personal quarters of the Dalai Lama.\u000a\u000aMeditating is hard for him, too\u000a\u000aThere were a few minor instructions before we entered. Eye contact is not a problem, and shaking hands is acceptable if you use two hands, not just one. Try not to turn your back to him when leaving the room, and instead walk backward, as much as possible facing him. When sitting cross-legged on the floor, don't point your feet at the Dalai Lama. And the correct address is "your holiness."\u000a\u000aShortly after, the doors opened, and I nervously walked into a very modest room where the Dalai Lama was sitting on a raised platform, already deep in meditation. I slipped off my shoes, sat cross-legged at a slight angle on the floor to avoid my toes being pointed in his direction, closed my eyes and started to focus on my breathing.\u000a\u000aAll my meditation insecurities immediately started to kick in. After a few minutes, I heard his deep, distinctive baritone voice: "Any questions?"\u000a\u000aI looked up and saw his smiling face, starting to break into his characteristic head-bobbing laugh.\u000a\u000a"This is hard for me," I said.\u000a\u000a"Me, too!" he exclaimed. "After doing daily for 60 years, it is still hard."\u000a\u000aIt was at once surprising and reassuring to hear him say this. The Dalai Lama, Buddhist monk and spiritual leader of Tibet, also has trouble meditating.\u000a\u000a"I think you will like analytical meditation," he told me. Instead of focusing on a chosen object, as in single-point meditation, he suggested I think about a problem I was trying to solve, a topic I may have read about recently or one of the philosophical areas from the earlier sessions.\u000a\u000aHe wanted me to separate the problem or issue from everything else by placing it in a large, clear bubble. With my eyes closed, I thought of something nagging at me -- something I couldn't quite solve. As I placed the physical embodiment of this problem into the bubble, several things started to happen very naturally.\u000a\u000aThe problem was now directly in front of me, floating weightlessly. In my mind, I could rotate it, spin it or flip it upside-down. It was an exercise to develop hyper-focus.\u000a\u000aLess intuitively, as the bubble was rising, it was also disentangling itself from any other attachments, such as subjective emotional considerations. I could visualize it, as the problem isolated itself, and came into a clear-eyed view.\u000a\u000aToo often, we allow unrelated emotional factors to blur the elegant and practical solutions right in front of us. It can be dispiriting and frustrating. Through analytical meditation, His Holiness told me, we can use logic and reason to more clearly identify the question at hand, separate it from irrelevant considerations, erase doubt and brightly illuminate the answers. It was simple and sensible. Most important, for me -- it worked.\u000a\u000aMeditation for skeptics\u000a\u000aAs a neuroscientist, I never expected that a Buddhist monk, even the Dalai Lama, would teach me how to better incorporate deduction and critical thinking to my life -- but that is what happened.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIt changed me. And I am better for it. I practice analytical meditation every day, usually early in the morning. The first two minutes are still the hardest, as I create my thought bubble and let it float above me. After that, I reach what can best be described as a "flow" state, in which 20 to 30 minutes pass easily.\u000a\u000aI am more convinced than ever that even the most ardent skeptics could find success with analytical meditation.\u000a\u000aOver the holidays, I spent as much time as possible relaying the Dalai Lama's teachings to my family and friends and teaching them basic principles of analytical meditation. This was the gift I most wanted to share with them. And now with you.

aVPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Beef \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnimal agriculture is\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aReducing beef consumption is an effective way of curbing global emissions. According to the NRDC, Americans now consume 19 percent less beef than just over a decade ago, in 2005. This is equivalent to a reduction of 185 million metric tons of emissions, or the annual tailpipe pollution of 39 million cars.\u000a\u000aBut why is beef so bad? "The feed is largely produced using lots of pesticide and fertilizer, which requires fossil fuels," explains Sujatha Bergen, one of the authors of the study. "Also, the digestive system of the cows produces methane, which is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. And the manure emits additional greenhouse gases." Beef is widely recognized as the most climate-damaging of all foods. A new study by the Natural Resources Defense Council on food consumption in the US calculates that each kilogram of beef produces 26.5 kilograms of CO2 emissions -- the highest among all the foods observed in the study, and five times more than chicken or turkey meat.Animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5 percent of the world's greenhouse emissions, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, making it a significant contributor to climate change. Of those emissions, 65 percent come from beef and dairy cattle.Reducing beef consumption is an effective way of curbing global emissions.

Hide Caption 1 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Lamb \u2013 Another ruminant, lamb, comes at number two -- confirming that red meat is particularly resource-intensive and, as such, damaging to the environment. For each kilo of lamb meat consumed, there are 22.9 kilos of emissions, the NRDC study estimates.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMeat production also requires large amounts of animal feed, mainly the resource-intensive corn and soy. The synthetic fertilizer and the manure used to grow these also releases nitrous oxide, a climate-warming pollutant 298 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Hide Caption 2 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Butter \u2013 The third most damaging food, by some distance, is butter: one kilo of butter equals nearly 12 kilos of CO2 -- about half as many as beef. It belongs to the same supply chain, making dairy and beef cattle an environmentalist's nightmare.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile Americans have greatly reduced their consumption of red meat in recent years, the NRDC reports that butter and other dairy products such as cheese and yogurt actually enjoyed a surge in the observed period, from 2005 to 2014.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aButter is the most climate damaging of all dairy products because there are several steps involved in producing it that are energy-intensive: "For example, butter production requires separating raw milk into low-fat milk and cream, pasteurizing the cream, cooling the cream, ripening and churning," Sujatha Bergen told CNN. Hide Caption 3 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Shelllfish \u2013 Shellfish costs the environment 11.7 kilos of CO2 for every kilo of food produced, just marginally less than butter. Along with milk, pork, and high-fructose corn syrup -- widely used as a sweetener in soft drinks -- shellfish is among the key foods that Americans are eating less of. Overall, changes in the American diet since 2005 have led to a 10 percent decrease in per-capita climate pollution related to food, according to the NRDC. Hide Caption 4 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Cheese \u2013 Another dairy product, cheese, comes in fifth place with 9.8 kg of emissions per kg produced. "Our list is a an average of several common cheeses," explains Sujatha Bergen, "Cheeses that require refrigerated transport or are flown in from abroad, however, tend to have higher climate impacts." Hide Caption 5 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Asparagus \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe problem is mostly in the The only vegetable on the list is also the most surprising entry. Asparagus creates 8.9 kilos of emissions per kilo produced, according to the NRDC. But how?The problem is mostly in the air miles . NRDC's Sujatha Bergen explains: "Much of the asparagus in the United States is flown in from Latin America, which results in greater climate emissions than foods that are transported by trucks. While it's not the only produce item that is flown into the country, a higher proportion of it is transported this way than most other common fruits and vegetables (many of which we import from Mexico). In general, if people are looking to minimize their climate impacts, they should avoid air freighted foods as much as possible." Hide Caption 6 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Pork \u2013 One kilo of pork creates 7.9 kilos of carbon emissions. The NRDC estimates that changes in the American diet\u000a\u000aavoided approximately 271 million tons of climate-warming\u000a\u000apollution between 2005 and 2014, roughly equivalent to the tailpipe\u000a\u000apollution of 57 million cars for one year. In the list of foods that contributed the most to this reduction, pork is third behind beef and orange juice. Hide Caption 7 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Veal \u2013 Another entry that belongs to the beef and dairy cattle supply chain, veal has a lower environmental impact than beef because the calves are slaughtered at a younger age, typically at around 20 weeks versus 18 months. Each kilo creates 7.8 kilos of carbon emission, according to the NRDC. Hide Caption 8 of 10\u000a\u000aPhotos: 10 common climate-damaging foods in the American diet Chicken \u2013 Eating less chicken meat is one of the contributing factors that have led to a reduction in per-capita emissions linked to food in the US, but poultry still ranks in the top 10, with just over 5 Kg of CO2 per kg of product.

aVThere is no Olympics and no US presidential election in 2017, so we\u2019ve added some new questions this year. Where will Donald Trump visit first as president? Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize? Check out the predictions for these questions and more:\u000a\u000aHow did they do? CNN legal analyst Paul Callan deserves a special shout out for being the only person to predict both a Donald Trump election victory and that the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series, although the strong performance of the Dow Jones Index in 2016 took all our contributors by surprise.\u000a\u000aAbout this time last year, we asked a group of CNN commentators for their predictions for some of the big political and cultural events of the year.\u000a\u000aPaul Callan CNN Legal Analyst @PaulCallan Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Trump will travel to the one country on Earth that will warmly welcome the new US President while Americans cheer as well: Israel. He is respected there for his pro-Israel and anti-Iranian foreign policy positions. Daughter Ivanka\u2019s conversion to the Jewish faith won\u2019t hurt, either. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Patriots will win again, this time using fully inflated footballs. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Martin Scorsese\u2019s 28-year \u201cpassion project\u201d Silence, a film about the Japanese Roman Catholic rebellion against the Tokugawa shogunate in 17th Century Japan will win the Oscar for Best Picture. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Great Britain\u2019s Andy Murray will once again win the men\u2019s final while Germany\u2019s Angelique Kerber will win the woman\u2019s title. Who will win the World Series? Chicago Cubs do it again with their strong, young team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for her humanitarian efforts regarding Europe\u2019s growing Muslim refugee crisis. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The Dow will hit 22,000 as lower taxes and fewer government regulations stimulate a growing and vibrant US economy. Sadly, air quality diminishes as fossil fuel use skyrockets with the acquiescence of the EPA. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? While Presidential approval ratings are generally high during the first \u201choneymoon year,\u201d constant controversies will prevent Trump from ever getting a traditional honeymoon. He will, nevertheless, achieve a high 55% approval rating as the US economy improves in 2017 because in the words of James Carville: It\u2019s \u201cthe economy, stupid.\u201d\u000a\u000aDanny Cevallos CNN Legal Analyst @CevallosLaw Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Traditionally, the first state visit is to Canada\u2026but how likely is Donald Trump to feel bound to tradition? He\u2019s already been to Mexico and met with President Enrique Peña Nieto -- a country everyone believed he\u2019d long ago alienated. So, although it sounds unbelievable, maybe\u2026the Philippines? Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots -- because America loves a dynasty. Doesn\u2019t it? America? Hello? Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? "Manchester by the Sea"! Everyone\u2019s already said it\u2019s going to win the Oscar and I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea what it is even about yet. The majority is clearly behind this film and the majority vote is always right, right? Hello? Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Wimbledon? Ummm. I\u2019ll say that guy Murray. And a Williams? A Williams will win the women\u2019s final. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Based on the buzz right now..."Manchester by the Sea". Who will win the World Series? As insufferable as all my Chicago friends have been, the Cubbies will win the Series again. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? My \u201clockzilla\u201d prediction is 19,500. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? I\u2019m going to say 35%, but then again, predicting the predictability of polls is\u2026unpredictable.\u000a\u000aLanhee Chen CNN Commentator @lanheechen Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Israel. It's our staunchest ally and friend in the Middle East, a region that Trump will likely place significant focus on as he begins his presidency. Which team will win the Super Bowl? Even with their starting quarterback injured, I'm going with the Oakland Raiders. It's my team and the closest they've been to the playoffs in a long time, so I'm sticking with them. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? "Moonlight." I don't follow these things closely but Google says it's an incredible film. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray and Madison Keys. Who will win the World Series? Los Angeles Dodgers. Here again, picking my team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis. He's overdue. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 22,100. Think it will be another strong year for markets, as the Fed acts predictably and investors look forward to Trump's pro-growth policies. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 50%. It remains a divided country, but a productive first 100 days should carry him to a decent showing at year-end.\u000a\u000aSE Cupp CNN Commentator @secupp Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? The layup is, of course, to say Russia, right? But I'm betting it's Israel or the UK. Which team will win the Super Bowl? I'm required to say the Green Bay Packers. But the Patriots will greedily win it again. Because it's been nearly a year. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Most early Oscar buzz is for movies that are just about to come out, so it's hard to say. But I will lose my ISH if it's a Star Wars product. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? My New York Metropolitans! Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? If there is any good left in the world, it should be the White Helmets, who have done more to stem the Syrian genocide than any other group or body, voluntarily and at great sacrifice. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 20,000, baby! What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 60%+\u000a\u000aFrida Ghitis CNN Opinion Contributor @FridaGhitis Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Donald Trump likes to make brazen, unpredictable moves. A visit to China would fit the bill. He has been needling Beijing, with provocative statements that undercut decades of US policy. In Beijing he could present his demands to the Chinese and discuss what he expects them to do about the growing threat from China\u2019s friend, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots. Still, don\u2019t bet on politics staying out of the game, or out of Lady Gaga\u2019s halftime show, a reminder that political tensions will be hard to escape in 2017. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? The winner will be \u201cLion,\u201d an astonishing story of survival, with elements that can provide a sense of pride and optimism to people of different ethnicities and economic conditions. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Serena Williams will win the women\u2019s final, and instead of debating whether she is the best female athlete of all time, the sports world will ask if she is the best athlete of all time. The men\u2019s title will go to Novak Djokovic. Who will win the World Series? The experts said Trump had as much of a chance of becoming president as the Chicago Cubs had of winning the World Series. They both won. I say the Cubs win again. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Syria\u2019s White Helmets. It will be a gesture from an international community rightly ashamed over its failure to stop the carnage. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The markets will climb during Trump\u2019s first year in office, as he launches a massive government spending infrastructure plan. The Dow Jones will close 21,800. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 34%. Backers will support him passionately, but most Americans will feel revulsion watching blatant conflicts of interest and mounting scandals plaguing the Trump administration, openly calling for the President\u2019s impeachment.\u000a\u000aRoxanne Jones CNN Opinion Contributor @iamroxannejones Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Israel. Trump will visit and stage photo ops with like-minded hardliners against a Palestinian state in effort to rally the right and legitimize his pick of far-right David Friedman as Israeli ambassador. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Pittsburgh Steelers. I\u2019m a Philly girl. My Eagles fell off, but I\u2019ll stick with the home state. I\u2019m rolling with Le'Veon Bell, the best running back in the game. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? \u201cFences.\u201d Only the mega talented Denzel Washington could take August Wilson\u2019s theater masterpiece and turn it into a big screen blockbuster. Washington, along with co-star Viola Davis, make this a winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Going with the two classics here, and the best man and woman to ever play the game of tennis: Roger Federer and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? The Cubs. It would be preposterous to predict Chicago will win another MLB-best 103 games again, but the 2017 team is as strong as last year\u2019s club. Cubs will repeat. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Angela Merkel. If the Nobel is more than a popularity contest, the German Chancellor wins. After Brexit, anyone who could simultaneously stop the European Union from collapse, seek humane immigration policies, and, keep Vladimir Putin\u2019s power at bay is worthy of the Nobel. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 20,001. Today, Wall Street loves Trump and is eagerly awaiting his pro-business, no regulation policies. The Dow will break the 20,000 mark before it starts to tumble. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 40%. Trump will see high approval ratings early in the year but by the end of 2017, his approval rating will begin to drop.\u000a\u000aPeniel Joseph CNN Opinion Contributor @PenielJoseph Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? President Trump\u2019s first visit abroad will be to Russia, where he will meet with Vladimir Putin, a leader he repeatedly expressed admiration for during the election, as the first step toward easing economic sanctions. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New York Giants go on another magical run, defeating the New England Patriots 27-24 \u2013 and beating them for the third time in nine years -- to win the big game. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? The Oscar will go to "Moonlight", a searing examination of a young gay black boy\u2019s coming of age under extraordinarily challenging circumstances in Florida. A film that humanizes experiences often reduced to stereotypes or flat out ignored. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? The New York Yankees shock the world with a talented young roster to win their 28th championship. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Institute, which has emerged as the conscience of America\u2019s broken criminal justice system. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The Dow will close above 20,000 on the last day of the year. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? President Trump\u2019s approval ratings will hover around 50% buoyed by Wall St. friendly policies, but hurt by rhetorical gaffes, lack of press access, and endless controversies.\u000a\u000aDean Obeidallah CNN Opinion Contributor @TheDeansreport Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Russia, to thank Vladimir Putin for his help winning the election. Which team will win the Super Bowl? Being a diehard New York Giants fan I\u2019m predicting the Giants win it all. But if they don\u2019t I will be rooting for any time playing against the dreaded New England Patriots. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Sure, it\u2019s a longshot but then again so was Trump. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m too busy rooting for the Giants and rooting against the New England Patriots to watch tennis. Who will win the World Series? New York Mets. That was easy. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Not sure, but I\u2019m pretty confident that the winner will not be named Donald Trump. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 21,220.12 or 21,220.13. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? What is the all-time lowest? Whatever that is I predict Trump will be below that. In fact by end of 2017 I predict the only ones approving of Trump\u2019s job as president will be named Trump.\u000a\u000aRaul Reyes CNN Opinion Contributor @RaulAReyes Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? The Philippines, to see the controversial Rodrigo Duterte. This would bolster American influence in the Pacific -- and the Philippines is home to Manila\u2019s Trump Tower. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Dallas Cowboys. Their defense is on an upswing, their offense is consistently great, and Dak Prescott is unstoppable. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Best Picture will go to La La Land: a romantic tribute to movie musicals, visually stunning, with a strong ending. Oscar voters love movies about the movies. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Novak Djokovic will make a comeback and win at Wimbledon in 2017. The Queen, Serena Williams, will too, with her amazing combination of physical and mental strength. Who will win the World Series? The Chicago Cubs will win the World Series. Yes, lightning will strike twice in our lifetime for this young, talented team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis will win the Nobel Peace Prize. Although no pope has won the honor, he deserves it for his peace efforts and work on behalf of refugees. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictability will keep growth in check despite his pro-business policies. Look for the Dow to stay static around 19,000. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? Trump\u2019s approval will be 40% by the end of 2017. Half of the country will be exhausted by his erratic behavior, and the other half will be angry at his broken promises.\u000a\u000aMel Robbins CNN Commentator @melrobbins Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Russia is likely the first stop, particularly with Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Which team will win the Super Bowl? New England Patriots. Deflategate is in the rearview mirror and Brady is in his prime. The only question is whether their defense can win it. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? La La Land. It\u2019s the classic insider plot movie that the Academy loves to make a winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the men's. It\u2019s time for an upset. And Serena Williams will win the women's. It's her time. Who will win the World Series? The Chicago Cubs. How epic would that be? I mean really. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis. I would have loved for the Syria White Helmets to win, but I am deeply afraid that with the current decimation of Aleppo, by the time the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded it will be last year's news. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 15,231. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 43%. Check out Trump's Twitter account and you\u2019ll see a guy who\u2019s primary focus is his ego -- not the 300 million people he\u2019s been elected to serve. Tweeting insults at people won\u2019t change lives in the Rust Belt -- or elsewhere in the country. SNL\u2019s satirical skits about Trump will remain a hit, but Trump\u2019s approval rating will be on the decline.\u000a\u000aTara Setmayer CNN Political Commentator @TaraSetmayer Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Mexico or Israel. Which team will win the Super Bowl? Kansas City Chiefs. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? La La Land. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? New York Yankees. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Not Donald Trump. LOL. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 15,000. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 35%.\u000a\u000aTimothy Stanley Historian @timothy_stanley Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Great Britain. Trump is half British, he has businesses in the UK and he loves Brexit. It\u2019s one country that wouldn\u2019t riot if he showed up. Which team will win the Super Bowl? No idea. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? La La Land. We need a feel-good winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray is still at the top of his game. Someone called Williams for the women\u2019s. Who will win the World Series? No idea. My knowledge of sport is limited to tennis and beer pong. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? I hope that it\u2019s won by a group responsible for bringing peace and transition to Syria. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? High. If Republicans proceed swiftly with their tax cut plan, we should see a surge in confidence. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 55%. He will defy critics and pleasantly surprise many in his first year.

aV(CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.\u000a\u000aBut as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.\u000a\u000aWhat began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.\u000a\u000aBut the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.\u000a\u000aGuatamala's past still haunts\u000a\u000aCifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual.\u000a\u000aMany women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.\u000a\u000aA 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.\u000a\u000aThere are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.\u000a\u000aSome 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.\u000a\u000aExplosion in violence\u000a\u000aMexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.\u000a\u000aPrevailing culture of machismo\u000a\u000aPerhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society.\u000a\u000aAccording to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, "80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed." This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.\u000a\u000aMake an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence\u000a\u000aU.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls\u000a\u000aThe political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.\u000a\u000a"Politicians don't think women are important," says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. "Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor."\u000a\u000aLack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.\u000a\u000aQuiroa says "They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade."\u000a\u000aSigns of progress\u000a\u000aAlthough the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.\u000a\u000aCifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.\u000a\u000aSince 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or "The Powerful," have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.\u000a\u000aFive Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or "The Powerful" share their stories and help other women get support.\u000a\u000aThe show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.\u000a\u000aThe taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or "Opening Opportunities". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.\u000a\u000aSenior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. "They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights."\u000a\u000aColom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.\u000a\u000aThe Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.\u000a\u000aPehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.\u000a\u000aAdelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence.\u000a\u000aBen Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, "We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women."\u000a\u000aBut the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.\u000a\u000aCifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.

aVWashington (CNN) Ri Jong Ho had simply had enough. He'd seen too many executions.\u000a\u000aRi, a high-profile North Korean defector, spent years working for what is essentially a slush fund for one of the most notorious regimes on the planet, Kim Jong Un and his compatriots.\u000a\u000aLife was good. Ri helped bring in somewhere between $50 million and $100 million for North Korean elites, and was handsomely rewarded with luxuries most North Koreans couldn't dream of in years past: a car, a color TV and some extra cash on the side, once rarities in the communist state but more commonplace now in the capital, Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aBut he watched the regime kill his peers and their families, even children.\u000a\u000a"It was not just high level officers, officials, but their families, their children (and) their followers," Ri told CNN in his first interview to a major US broadcast network. "It was not just once or twice a year -- it was ongoing throughout the year, thousands of people being executed or purged."\u000a\u000aRi said the final straw came in late 2013, when Kim Jong Un executed his own uncle, Jang Song Thaek, with an anti-aircraft gun.\u000a\u000a"It was a cruel and crude method of execution," he said. "After all these years living in the socialist system, I never witnessed anything like that."\u000a\u000aRi was living in China at the time, and in 2014 was able to safely defect with his family.\u000a\u000aAnd just like that, Kim lost one of his top money makers.\u000a\u000aOffice 39\u000a\u000aRi said he worked for decades in what's known as "Office 39."\u000a\u000aThe office is in charge of bringing in hard currency for the regime. Ri calls it a "slush fund for the leader and the leadership."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What is North Korea's mysterious Office 39? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is North Korea's mysterious Office 39? 02:18\u000a\u000aRi told CNN "Office 39" is not engaged in illicit activities, but the US Treasury Department says otherwise.\u000a\u000aThe US government accused the office of engaging in "illicit economic activities" to support the North Korean government. It has branches throughout the nation that raise and manage funds and is responsible for earning foreign currency for North Korea's Korean Workers' Party senior leadership through illicit activities such as narcotics trafficking.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has been accused of crimes like hacking banks, counterfeiting currency, dealing drugs and even trafficking endangered species.\u000a\u000aWorkers who help bring in cash for the regime are granted access to the outside world -- especially China -- in order to establish networks that are crucial to making money, analysts say. They often have diplomatic privileges that allow them to evade their host country's domestic laws, experts say.\u000a\u000aRi said he was not involved in illegal activities and that they were not under the purview of Office 39, but did not deny they occurred. He said much of North Korea's hard cash is earned through exporting labor -- the country sends workers across the globe and collects much of their pay, according to the UN -- and exporting natural resources like coal, which China used to buy but has since stopped.\u000a\u000aIllicit activities make a lot of money, though. The Congressional Research Service estimated in 2008 that North Korea could earn anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion from these types of illicit activities.\u000a\u000aThat money helps fund the lavish lifestyles of the North Korean elites while sanctions limit the country's ability to make money. That keeps North Korea's leadership happy and helps Kim prevent coup attempts, analysts say.\u000a\u000a"They (North Korean leaders) are focused on maintaining their ruling power, and they are working on making this dynasty-like system lasting for a long time," Ri said. "So instead of focusing on their economic development or better life, they are more focused on maintaining their system.\u000a\u000aSome of Office 39's profits also go to the country's nuclear and missile programs, which crossed an important threshold this month with the testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles, weapons that experts say likely put the United States homeland in North Korea's range.\u000a\u000aCNN reached out to the North Korean mission at the United Nations for a response to the interview with Ri. An official at the mission said Ri was lying to "make money and save his own life."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What can the US do about North Korea? Replay More Videos ...

North Korean leaders don't keep much money abroad, so the sanctions against them are pointless, according to Ri. Smugglers are difficult to catch.\u000a\u000a"Smuggling is conducted by any and every means you could imagine. Mostly larger items are done using ships, for example by filing a cargo list ... where what's written on the (list) is different from what is really being shipped," he said. "On the open sea, the Yellow Sea, there are hundreds of fishing boats -- both from China and North Korea -- and all the smuggling is done by these so-called fishing boats.\u000a\u000aGoing after China\u000a\u000aRi believes that secondary sanctions -- targeting those who do business with North Korea, like the United States did to China's Bank of Dandong in June -- is the way to go, especially in China.\u000a\u000aBeijing accounts for about 85% of North Korean imports in 2015, according to UN data, though Ri revealed that Pyongyang does import some oil from Russia.\u000a\u000aNorth Korean economist Ri Gi Song told CNN in February that China accounts for 70% of trade and that trade with Russia is increasing.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's 2015 imports Source: Observatory of Economic Complexity\u000a\u000a"Those companies who are paying North Korea, those are the ones that should be sanctioned by the US, not North Korean companies or North Korean leadership, for whom sanctions simply do not work. You should sanction the market, not the North Korean companies or the people in high positions," Ri said. "Expecting Chinese companies to abide by international laws, that will not bear any fruit."\u000a\u000aChina insists that none of its current trade with Pyongyang is in violation of international sanctions.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has tried to enlist China's help in dealing with North Korea to specifically clamp down on these companies.

He appeared more willing to talk about ranching or breaking horses or other ruggedly mundane activities.\u000a\u000aSuch wide-open-spaces avocations seemed to belie Shepard's ascension in the insurgent Off- and Off-Off-Broadway theater scene of the 1960s. It was there that he began making his name as a stage actor and a writer of plays that were edgy, surrealistic and poetically allusive in the manner of the progressive rock-and-roll music of that era.\u000a\u000aIn those days, Shepard took some of the European-inspired absurdist humor and insinuating menace of such playwrights as Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco and Harold Pinter and gave those motifs a distinctly American accent through such plays as "La Turista," "The Tooth of Crime" and "Geography of a Horse Dreamer."\u000a\u000aRead More

aVKatie Hunt, CNN \u2022 Updated 7th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 A skull pokes out of a coffin made out of roughly hewn planks of wood, its smooth white surface catching the reflection of the winter light flooding into the dark cave.\u000a\u000aIt's one of about 30 caskets anchored on a limestone rock about 30 meters (almost 100 feet) up the side of a cave in Guizhou province in southwestern China. It could date back hundreds of years. The coffins, inside and out, are littered with fragments of clothes, bones and ceramics.\u000a\u000aFor three decades, Wong How Man, a Hong Kong-based explorer, has been hellbent on chasing coffins like these in gravity-defying graveyards across China in an attempt to discover more about this unusual burial custom.\u000a\u000aWong, who began his career as a journalist with National Geographic, first came across a group of coffins perched 90 meters (300 feet) up a cliff face in southern Sichuan, to the north of Guizhou, in 1985 during an expedition to track the Yangtze River from mouth to source.\u000a\u000aA life-long obsession was born.\u000a\u000a"At first, it was simply how the hell did they get there and then I couldn't stop thinking about why," he says. "And there're so many theories."\u000a\u000a"Hanging coffins" rest in a cave in Guizhou, southwest China.\u000a\u000aCoffin-chasing\u000a\u000aHanging coffins, as they're known, are found across a swathe of central China -- mostly in remote valleys to the south of the mighty Yangtze River, which flows from the Himalayan foothills to China's eastern coast.\u000a\u000aThe coffins rest in a variety of formations, sometimes barely visible from the ground below. They're lined up in the crevices in the cliff face, balanced on wooden cantilevered stakes, placed in rectangular spaces hewn in the rock face or stacked high up in caves like those Wong saw on his latest coffin-chasing expedition to Guizhou.\u000a\u000aThe oldest are said to be in the eastern province of Fujian, dating back 3,000 years. There's no clear reason why this practice took place.\u000a\u000aAncient literature from the Tang Dynasty suggests that the higher the coffins were placed, the greater the show of filial piety to the deceased. Others say the reasoning was more practical: It prevented animals from poaching the bodies and kept land free to farm.\u000a\u000aNew sites are still being discovered. In 2015, the People's Daily newspaper reported that a total of 131 hanging coffins were discovered in the central province of Hubei, placed in man made caves in a cliff 50 meters wide and 100 meters high.\u000a\u000a"Experts haven't figured out how ancient people managed to transport the coffin, body and funeral objects -- together weighing hundreds of kilograms -- to the cliff caves," the report said.\u000a\u000aMany questions, few answers\u000a\u000aIntent on discovering more about this extraordinary practice, Wong began to amass a library of what little scholarly research had been carried out on the practice. He published his first paper in 1991 in a US archeology journal.\u000a\u000aHowever, it wasn't until 2000, once Wong had founded the non-profit China Exploration and Research Society (CERS), that he was able to get up close and excavate one of these high-rise cemeteries -- at a site named Washi in northern Yunnan not far from the first site Wong laid eyes on.\u000a\u000aThe site in Washi, Yunnan where Wong's organization conducted an archeological excavation.\u000a\u000aHe and his team rapelled down the cliff face to assess the coffins, which rested on rotting stakes of wood. They then built bamboo scaffolding to secure the most vulnerable coffins, which also allowed them to examine and document the contents.\u000a\u000aWhat he found raised more questions than it answered. The oldest coffins dated back to the Tang dynasty but many contained bones from multiple bodies. Wong believes the bodies would have been buried first and the bones put in the hanging coffins once the bodies had decomposed.\u000a\u000aThe coffins, which were dug out of a solid piece of wood, were then packed with sand -- making them enormously heavy. "They must have known they would eventually fall down," says Wong.\u000a\u000aRapelling down a cliff to get a look at the coffins.\u000a\u000aWong's research has tied the burial custom to the Bo people -- a rebellious minority tribe that once inhabited the border between today's southern Sichuan and northwestern Yunnan provinces.\u000a\u000aIt's thought they disappeared in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), persecuted by military expeditions led by China's Imperial Armies. But Wong believes some remnants of the tribe assimilated into other local minority groups and may have survived secretly until today. His research formed the basis of a 2003 Discovery Channel documentary on the hanging coffins, where they attempted to recreate how the caskets would have been transported up the cliff face.\u000a\u000aSome believe they were lowered down from above while others believe they were raised up via scaffolding.\u000a\u000aIt's not just the mind-blowing effort it must have taken to erect the coffins that makes the cliff and cave burials so fascinating. The custom seems so at odds with underground burial and cremation -- the way most modern societies, including China's, handle death.\u000a\u000aBut the open-air burials do have something in common with other funerary practices in China's borderlands. Tibetans and Mongolians practice sky burials -- where bodies are chopped up and offered to vultures or other animals.\u000a\u000aIn more recent years, Wong's obsession has taken him to Sagada, Luzon, in the Philippines, where cliff burials were practiced as recently as 2007.\u000a\u000aCliff burial site in Sagada, Luzon in the Philippines.\u000a\u000aNo protection?\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, I inadvertently rekindled Wang's interest in China's hanging coffins when I shared some photos of the caskets in a cave in Guizhou I came across unexpectedly during a trip to the province in 2016.\u000a\u000aNever having heard of hanging coffins in this area, Wong set out from his China field office in Kunming in the neighboring province of Yunnan with a small team to find out more. The cave where the coffins are located is only accessible by river, which emerges from the spectacular limestone cave where the coffins are stacked.\u000a\u000a"I like when information comes to me like this in a personal way," says Wong. "The Internet, there's so much information available. It takes away the joy and the reward for big effort. I like the footnotes."\u000a\u000aThe Guizhou cave with the coffins is only accessible by river, where bamboo rafts are the traditional form of transport.\u000a\u000aLi Fei, a researcher at the Guizhou Provincial Institute of Archaeology, says that there were up to 100 cave coffin sites in the province and the burial practice was followed by Yao and Miao minorities in the region. Most of the coffins date back to the Ming or Qing (1644-1912) dynasties, he adds, though some date back to the Tang dynasty.\u000a\u000aThe Guizhou site Wong and I visited, like others, wasn't well-protected. Reluctant to scramble up the rocky sides of the caves I didn't get close, but Wong said that while some of the 30 or so coffins were intact, most were falling apart -- bones and disintegrating clothing visible.\u000a\u000aWong was told that there used to be more than 300 coffins in an elevated part of the cave but a fire destroyed them.\u000a\u000aBanknotes have also been left by more recent visitors to the site, a superstitious offering for the dead, though not all visitors are respectful -- one skull had a cigarette jutting out of its jaw. In a steep gorge down river, local tourist authorities have erected fake hanging coffins -- perhaps an effort to satiate tourist curiosity and preserve the existing site.\u000a\u000aThe stunning karst scenary near the Guizhou cave.\u000a\u000aLooting\u000a\u000aIn 1999, at one of the most famous hanging coffin sites in Matangba, Sichuan, which Wong had first visited in the 1980s, he discovered that many of the coffins had been looted -- despite being some 90 meters above the ground and being protected as "national cultural relics." The swag allegedly included ancient swords and other valuables, says Wong.\u000a\u000a"Going back 20, 30 years, yes China had different priorities and limited funding, but today China has such influence and (protecting these sites) would be small change. It's about the integrity of the their culture and cultural identity. "\u000a\u000aAn event held by the Chongqing Cultural Heritage Research Institute.\u000a\u000aXu Jin, a researcher at Chongqing Cultural Heritage Research Institute, studies a hanging coffin site at Longhe, near Chongqing, where coffins are grouped by families. He's held educational events to teach people about the coffins.\u000a\u000aHe says in a karst region where caves and cliffs are plentiful, burying the dead at a height might have seemed a better option than in land that erodes easily and is prone to sinkholes.\u000a\u000aLittle studied\u000a\u000aArcheology in China is a well-funded and well-regarded field but the study of the suspended coffins appears to have been neglected.\u000a\u000aAnke Hein, an archeologist at Oxford University, who has studied burial customs in western China, says the phenomenon straddles different time periods, geographical regions and even disciplines -- falling between archeology and anthropology.\u000a\u000a"I'm sure if someone really wanted to do this they could," says Hein. "But you would need the cooperation of difference provinces and local governments, which is difficult, and requires a lot of energy."\u000a\u000aBamboo scaffolding erected to allow a CERS team to excavate the coffins in Yunnan.\u000a\u000aMost expertise seems to be regional, confined to provincial bureaus that focus on individual sites rather than the practice as a whole.\u000a\u000aThe earliest mention of them in Wong's library is an account by a US missionary in the 1930s. The most comprehensive study in Chinese is by a scholar named Chen Mingfang, who was colorfully profiled by the Los Angeles Times in 2001 . Now likely in her seventies, CNN was unable to track her down.\u000a\u000aWong's spent much of his career exploring, documenting and trying to protect traditions like these in China's borderlands but he doesn't think the mystery of exactly how or why people chose to bury their dead in this way will ever be known.

aV(CNN) Editor's Note: Generation whining has become nearly a national pastime. Millennials say they have it the worst. Generation X feels neglected. Baby boomers are tired of being called narcissistic. In articles and cartoons everywhere -- from CNN to The New York Times to Gizmodo and beyond -- critics call out this generation's sense of entitlement, that generation's self-absorption . We invited writers, activists and CNN contributors from different generations to hash it out.\u000a\u000aJeff Yang: Generation X is bitter\u000a\u000aI belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We're the cohort everyone skips over \u2014 the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.\u000a\u000aYet, despite our generation's small size and overlooked status, we've nevertheless been handed the job of being America's cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we're raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution. In return, the world called us slackers. Is there any wonder we're bitter?\u000a\u000aJeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including PRI's "The Takeaway" and WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show." He is the co-author of "I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action."\u000a\u000aPaul Begala: Boomers, worst generation ever\u000a\u000aSixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire , "The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history."\u000a\u000aNearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I'd like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever\u000a\u000aPaul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.\u000a\u000aIn the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds -- in blood and treasure -- has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)\u000a\u000aI'm at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 60 iconic moments from the 1960s 60 iconic moments from the 1960s \u2013 Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll defined the 1960s.

We've seemingly made " changing the world " with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world -- we're upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).\u000a\u000aDasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000aBut in dismantling old models, we're also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It's harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won't necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.\u000a\u000aThis is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.\u000a\u000aOf course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.\u000a\u000aWe're faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.\u000a\u000aSo, take some pity on us when you're judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it's that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn't sit right.\u000a\u000aWe're the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.\u000a\u000aDasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global, a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.\u000a\u000aPepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation\u000a\u000aFor me, it's a tale of two cities.\u000a\u000aOne city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women's liberation.\u000a\u000aPepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.\u000a\u000aMost of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights -- we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.\u000a\u000aBut there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a "cocktail," general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.\u000a\u000aOur generation was mixed. But I've been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 70 historic moments from the 1970s Pop culture and politics collided on December 21, 1970, when the King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley, visited President Richard Nixon in the White House Oval Office.

I've been told I don't text back fast enough to be a millennial -- but I also don't have Kurt Cobain's death circled (in black) on my calendar, so maybe I'm not so gen X.

Which is to say that we're not boomers -- or anything the boomers say about us. They're so en-TITLED, so NEEDY, so stuck in their little gadgets or whatever. You've heard that junk for years. It's almost trite to repeat. But since boomers run the media and the job market, there seems to be no shortage of "trend piece" drivel about the vapid millennials and our shoddy work ethic. If the boomers took 10 minutes to listen, they'd notice that young people today have it worse. The job market's better but still rough; part-timing's the norm. This is the age of inequality, climate change and anti-immigrant sentiment.

Candidly, it's a wonder they don't suffer from an identity crisis. On top of bearing names as sterile as a supercomputer lab, they have to hear how they're all "me, me, me," and (further) will be the first generations to do worse in America than their parents. All I can say is that I will take the blame for the world that generations X through Z inherited from us. But, please do remember, we have not only lived through the traumas of our times, but yours as well.\u000a\u000aFor all our faults, any generation that produced Dolly Parton, Elvis, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen -- not to mention Steve Jobs and Bill Gates \u2014 has to be considered the best.

Cable news and the Internet didn't exist. Most music came from static ridden AM radios.\u000a\u000aIn school sports, not everybody made the team. Parents didn't "helicopter" their kids. College students traveled between home and school by hitchhiking to save money. We didn't believe in haircuts or the Vietnam War. Everyone was afraid the Russians were going to nuke us. People under 25 feared getting drafted into the military if they didn't volunteer. A lot of my friends did and many got killed.\u000a\u000aPaul Callan, from his Boston College Law School ID in 1975, when he was 25 years old.\u000a\u000aIn 1975, the starting salary for district attorneys in New York was $11,500 per year. When I began my legal career at the Brooklyn DA's Office, I didn't get a paycheck for six months because of New York City's financial crisis. The crime rate was three times higher than it is now and was handled by one-third the number of assistant district attorneys. We often worked nights and weekends for no extra pay. Didn't matter since we weren't getting paid anyway.\u000a\u000aAt work, there were "typewriters," "carbon paper" for making copies and "white out" to correct errors. Spellcheck had not been invented.

Public telephone calls were made from "phone booths": the place where Clark Kent changes into his Superman costume.\u000a\u000aCigarette smoke hung in the air everywhere as smoking was permitted in offices, bars, restaurants, buses, movie theaters, airplanes and even in courtrooms and hospitals.\u000a\u000aPeople who owned cars put "No Radio" signs on them because thieves smashed car windows and stole radios all the time. Replacing the glass was more expensive than the radio.\u000a\u000aIn 1977, New York's power system failed for over 24 hours and the city descended into a night of terror and looting.

It's pretty clear, for instance, that every generation wishes it could claim Bob Dylan. Boomers win on that one. Debating which generation had it tougher, however, depends.\u000a\u000aMatthew Segal providing testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in 2009.\u000a\u000aTo a certain extent, there have always been throngs of poor youngsters who work for minimum wage, toil as unpaid interns, or slog through as chronically underemployed baristas. What's alarming these days is the acute degree of income inequality Americans face: the highest since 1928. The house you are born into is much more likely to dictate your socioeconomic status than just about anything else.\u000a\u000aThe cost of college also matters -- a lot. Since 1978, university tuition has ballooned over 1000%. The notion of higher education has shifted. Ben Franklin, for example, saw it as a public good. Now it's seen more as a private commodity, financed largely through student loans. These loans are holding America back: A $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis means houses, cars and goods are less affordable for young Americans, and that in turn drags down our entire economy.\u000a\u000aMaybe we should compare ourselves to other countries where college is virtually free, or our friendly neighbors up north where upward mobility is on the rise, rather than previous or future generations in America.\u000a\u000aMatthew Segal is the co-founder of Attn.com and OurTime.org , advocacy organizations for young Americans.\u000a\u000aSarah Burris: Well, we all dislike Congress\u000a\u000aThe real reality that bites is that every generation was screwed by the economic dip, but every generation has an opportunity to try to fix it.\u000a\u000aMillennials are lucky in that we have nothing like the Great Depression or the World Wars.\u000a\u000aSarah Burris, third from left, in Chinatown with her friends.\u000a\u000aWe are the most diverse generation in American history.

aVSister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of " Dead Man Walking ." The views expressed are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.\u000a\u000aAs I was writing "The Death of Innocents," I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was "taking him on" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, "And I'll be right back at ya!"\u000a\u000aIn "Innocents," I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams , whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the "machinery of death."\u000a\u000aScalia's experience of the "meaning" of capital punishment, as he described it in one of his dissenting opinions, couldn't have been more different from my own. In the marble confines of the court, he argued interpretation of Constitutional texts, while I, in state killing chambers, accompanied real human beings -- six of them -- to their deaths, which were a direct result of Scalia's interpretations.\u000a\u000aIn grasping the "meaning" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.\u000a\u000aOne thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his "originalist" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.\u000a\u000aAfter all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal "experts," every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?\u000a\u000aPhotos: Death row's nun Sister Helen Prejean has been on a mission to end the death penalty for three decades.

Hide Caption 13 of 13\u000a\u000aI have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.\u000a\u000aAs for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.\u000a\u000aGiven what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.\u000a\u000aIn 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.\u000a\u000aI say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in"The Death of Innocents," taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.\u000a\u000aThree years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented . In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on "cruel and unusual punishments."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes 02:04\u000a\u000aIn his dissent , Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of "idiot" as "such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is." According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's "idiot" test.\u000a\u000aMy second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.\u000a\u000aThese stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by "modern trends," as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Women of death row Kelly Renee Gissendaner was executed by lethal injection on Tuesday, September 29.

Statements such as these:\u000a\u000a-- "It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States."\u000a\u000a-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, "The powers that be are ordained of God," to mean: "Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy."\u000a\u000aDemocracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.\u000a\u000aWhere was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking "an eye for an eye," to pray for and forgive our enemies?\u000a\u000aIn Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.\u000a\u000aIn this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem "enemy."\u000a\u000aIt seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.\u000a\u000aI also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom "equal justice under law" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.

aV(CNN) Sperm counts of men in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand are plunging, according to a new analysis published Tuesday.\u000a\u000aAmong these men there has been a 52% decline in sperm concentration and a 59% decline in total sperm count over a nearly 40-year period ending in 2011, the analysis, published in the journal Human Reproduction Update, said.\u000a\u000aScientists determine sperm count by looking at a sample of ejaculate under a microscope. For sperm concentration, they measure how many millions of sperm there are in each milliliter of fluid. Sperm count, then, is sperm concentration multiplied by the total volume of an ejaculate.\u000a\u000aResearchers led by Dr. Hagai Levine of Hebrew University of Jerusalem examined thousands of studies and then conducted a meta-analysis of 185 studies. These included 42,935 male participants who provided semen samples between 1973 and 2011. The chosen studies were well distributed over the nearly 40 years of the study period and among 50 different countries. The analysis included information on fertility status, age, ejaculation abstinence time, semen collection method, sperm count method and geographic location at the level of continent.\u000a\u000aBased on their analysis, the international team of researchers from Brazil, Denmark, Israel, Spain and the United States reported a decline in sperm concentration of 1.4% per year with an overall drop of 52.4% during the entire study period for men living in industrialized, Western countries. Meanwhile, total sperm count among the same group plunged 1.6% per year and 59.3% overall. By comparison, the researchers found no significant declines in the sperm counts and sperm concentrations of men living in South America, Asia and Africa.\u000a\u000a"The extent of the decline is a heartache," said Levine. "It's hard to believe -- it's hard to believe for me."\u000a\u000aThe high proportion of men in Western countries with sperm concentrations below 40 million/ml is "particularly concerning," wrote Levine and his co-researchers, because evidence indicates that a sperm concentration below this threshold is associated with a "decreased monthly probability of conception."\u000a\u000aPast studies on sperm quality\u000a\u000aLevine noted that his study follows in the footsteps "a seminal paper published in 1992" known as the Carlsen study. In that meta-analysis of 61 studies worldwide, researchers led by Elisabeth Carlsen, a Danish reproductive biologist, found a trend toward decreasing sperm count and volume of seminal fluid over a 50-year period ending in 1991.\u000a\u000aMany people did not accept the results of the study, said Levine, "it was quite controversial whether or not there is a decline." However, Levine noted, "there were serious limitations to the [Carlsen] study." For example, a common criticism of the Carlsen group is that it included one overly large study -- it contributed 30% of the total participants, thus heavily influenced the results. By comparison, the largest of the studies examined by Levine's group included only 5% of all participants.\u000a\u000aSince 1992, other researchers conducted analyses to understand whether sperm counts have declined, yet the results were mixed\u000a\u000a"Now we have a pretty solid answer," said Levine, who said his own study performed a meta-regression, "a more conservative, sophisticated analysis," one that accounts for factors that might influence the results.\u000a\u000aThough Levine emphasized that his analysis did not study the cause of declines, he speculated the reason may be "we are exposed to many chemicals we've never been exposed to before."\u000a\u000aPrevious studies, including his own, show that exposure in utero to endocrine disrupting chemicals can harm male reproductive system development and fertility potential. Commonly used chemicals, including pesticides, lead and fire retardants, can increase or decrease production of certain hormones within our bodies and so are said to disrupt our endocrine, or hormone-making, system.\u000a\u000aSonya Lunder, a senior analyst at the nonprofit advocacy group Environmental Working Group, noted that sperm is manufactured daily by men's bodies. Recent exposures to environmental chemicals would have an effect on sperm, which serves as a good indicator of contamination, while also serving as a good biomarker of men's health.\u000a\u000aLunder cites the work of Russ Hauser, a professor of reproductive physiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who suggests that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be associated with poorer sperm quality among men and worse reproductive outcomes among women.\u000a\u000aStill, Lunder noted, "there's not one route to reduction in sperm quality and sperm count for men. By all accounts, people assume there are multiple factors at work."\u000a\u000aMore explanations: obesity, climate change\u000a\u000aMichael Dourson, a professor in the Risk Science Center at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, said in an email that "the overall work appears to be solid with numerous safeguards for assuring systematic review and data analysis." Dourson, who was not involved in the research, added, "the observed trends appear to be real, and not based on chance findings."\u000a\u000aYet, Dourson noted that he wondered about the "functional significance of the findings." The authors wrote that "poor sperm count is associated with overall morbidity and mortality," yet Dourson noted that "longevity is increasing" in Western countries so "these two observations do not appear to match."\u000a\u000a"I suspect that obesity may have something to do with these trends, but measures of obesity, such as BMI (body mass-index) were not analyzed," said Dourson, who was recently nominated to head the US Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. "Overall, however, a request for funding for further exploration seems well founded."\u000a\u000aDr. Harry Fisch, a clinical professor of urology at Weill Cornell Medicine, said the results of this study are likely to be "real." Fisch, who has also researched this topic -- though he was not involved in the current analysis -- noted that one issue with all studies is the fact that sperm counting methodologies have not been standardized across the globe or even within most countries.\u000a\u000aAnother very important consideration is how geography influences sperm count. "Even within the US, different states have different counts," said Fisch, though all states fall within the range of normal. Fisch observed that the new analysis did not delve into differences among countries.\u000a\u000aThe only environmental factor that's "not controversial" and "known to influence sperm counts is temperature change," said Fisch, who noted that sperm counts are known to vary by season and by climate. "I think global warming, not phthalates, is responsible" for the declining rates seen here, he said. Phthalates , found in everything from flooring to personal care products, are one type of endocrine disrupting chemical.\u000a\u000aKathryn St. John, senior director of strategic communications for the American Chemistry Council, noted this meta-analysis, though a systematic review, is a study of other studies.\u000a\u000a"The original studies did not account for fundamental and important information about lifestyles and health status of participants, so such factors cannot be accounted for in the overall results," said St. John, who noted that sperm count is just one measure of male health. "As to the overall state of men's health, it should be noted that life expectancy for men in the US has increased by 25 years over the past 100," St. John said.\u000a\u000aBut each scientist and representative agreed: Questions around sperm quality warrant continued research.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"The impact of the modern environment on health of populations and individuals is clearly huge, but remains largely unknown," said Levine. "Sperm count has previously been plausibly associated with environmental and lifestyle influences, including prenatal chemical exposure, adult pesticide exposure, smoking, stress and obesity. Every man can reduce exposure to chemicals, avoid smoking, keep balanced diet and weight and reduce stress."

aVStory highlights Asha Rangappa: Trump "weighing in" on Don Jr.'s statement could help Mueller if he pursues obstruction of justice case\u000a\u000aIf the President really wants to stop Mueller, the best thing he can do is stop being a witness against himself, she writes\u000a\u000aAsha Rangappa is an associate dean at Yale Law School. She is a former special agent in the FBI, specializing in counterintelligence investigations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) President Trump is a defense lawyer's worst nightmare -- and a dream defendant for special counsel Robert Mueller. Revelations the President may have personally dictated a misleading statement given to The New York Times about his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer is the latest example why.\u000a\u000aDespite the President's vexation at Mueller's investigation into possible ties between his campaign and Russia -- as well as the possibility that Mueller could pursue obstruction of justice charges against him personally -- Trump has not learned that the best way to slow Mueller down is to stop making the case for him.\u000a\u000aThe basis for any investigation into a potential obstruction of justice case, as it stands now, lies primarily with the President's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. However, that in and of itself is not a crime. What Mueller would need to prove if he ends up bringing a charge of obstruction is that the President acted with "corrupt" intent. That is, Mueller would have to find evidence the defendant "acted, at least in part ... with the purpose of accomplishing ... an unlawful end result."\u000a\u000aIn other words, Mueller would have to find that the reasons behind Trump's efforts to end the Russia investigation were ones he knew were wrong. Finding evidence of a defendant's state of mind is usually difficult, since the contents of thoughts are not ordinarily on display, and even federal prosecutors aren't mind readers.\u000a\u000aThis is where Trump's involvement in drafting Don Jr.'s statement comes into play. You see, a big problem for Mueller if he tries to prove obstruction of justice is that, well, Trump is the President. As such, he in theory has several constitutionally permissible reasons for firing Comey.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Emergency rooms saw an estimated 30,000 injuries linked to amusement parks in 2016, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. But experts warn that data about amusement park safety is limited, and regulations are inconsistent.\u000a\u000aThis week, one person was killed and seven more were injured after a ride malfunctioned at the Ohio State Fair in Columbus. On Wednesday, the opening day of the fair, a piece of the Fire Ball ride broke apart mid-air. All seven people injured were taken to area hospitals for treatment.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, a 10-year-old boy was killed on a water slide in Kansas. Three girls were also injured in 2016 at a fair in Tennessee after falling from a Ferris wheel.\u000a\u000aLack of data on park injuries and deaths\u000a\u000aIn a statement sent to CNN, the International Association for Amusement Parks said that while approximately 335 million people visit amusement parks in the United States each year, the likelihood of sustaining a serious injury at an amusement park that would lead to an overnight stay at a hospital is one in 16 million.\u000a\u000aThe amusement park association conducts an annual safety survey , the most recent of which was published in 2016. Of the parks from which the association collected data, it estimated that in 2015 there were 1,508 ride-related injuries among park attendees who went on rides. That's an increase of 32% since 2014, when there were 1,146 ride-related injuries. No data on fatalities were reported.\u000a\u000aHowever, the International Association for Amusement Parks only collects safety data on fixed-site amusement parks -- locations where the rides are permanent fixtures -- and not on amusement parks that move from location to location. Those mobile amusement parks include carnival and state fairs, such as the one in Ohio.\u000a\u000aThe Consumer Product Safety Commission told CNN it estimates that in 2016, emergency room departments saw 30,900 injuries associated with amusement attractions, including rides, for both mobile and fixed-site parks. This number is an estimate extrapolated from emergency room data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System and is not an exact count.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Tragic accidents in US amusement parks Photos: Tragic accidents in US amusement parks Ten-year-old Caleb Thomas Schwab died from a neck injury while riding the world's tallest water slide at Schlitterbahn Kansas City Water Park in August.

"We need a national injury reporting system for all mobile and fixed-site rides that will allow for better surveillance and consistent enforcement of standards."\u000a\u000a"There's no mechanism for the parks themselves or the ride manufacturers to report injuries or mechanical failures to any organization," she said.\u000a\u000aInconsistent regulation of amusement parks\u000a\u000aThe Consumer Product Safety Commission oversees the regulation of mobile amusement parks. But, it's up to the individual state or locality to decide who is responsible for inspections of the mobile parks. For fixed-site amusement parks, there is not one body nationally that oversees regulation -- instead that is left to state and local governments. Several states do not regulate amusement parks at all.\u000a\u000a"Back in the early '80s, our authority to oversee fixed-site rides was taken away from us," said Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission told CNN previously . "We do deal with mobile rides, like those at local carnivals, but we are a small agency, and it's tough to oversee every fair that sets up for a short period of time."\u000a\u000aAn Ohio state inspection official said the Fire Ball ride at the Ohio State Fair was inspected multiple times before riders boarded it on Wednesday and no red flags were found.\u000a\u000a"It's been looked at about three or four times over the course of two days," said Michael Vartorella, chief ride inspector for Ohio's Division of Amusement Ride Safety. He said that on Wednesday, "it was inspected at a couple of different stages and it was signed off."\u000a\u000aWalter Reiss, an independent amusement ride safety inspector, told HLN's Michaela Pereira on Friday that once mobile rides are assembled at their location, they usually have only a visual inspection. He also said that rides may be assessed for damages using non-destructive testing, but the frequency and the parts inspected are usually dictated by the manufacturer.\u000a\u000a"Generally, when you're inspecting on-site when it's been re-erected after just being moved, you're doing mainly a visual inspection," said Reiss. "You can require the non-destructive testing if you see something that's suspect. But generally, the non-destructive testing through using the X-ray, the mag-particle, the ultrasound, that's gonna be something you're going to do only when it's disassembled in a shop somewhere."\u000a\u000aInvestigators from the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Consumer Product Safety Commission are currently looking into why the Fire Ball malfunctioned.\u000a\u000aIn a statement from Amusements of America , the Fire Ball ride's operator, the organization said it is cooperating with the investigation: "Our family-owned company is committed to working with state and local experts in trying to determine the cause of this tragic accident."\u000a\u000aBest practices for amusement park safety\u000a\u000aIf people choose to ride amusement park rides, there are several guidelines to keep in mind for safety, especially for children.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Always follow all posted height, age, weight and health restrictions.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Make sure to follow any special seating order and/or loading instructions.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Always use safety equipment such as seat belts and safety bars.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Make sure children keep hands and feet inside the ride at all times.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Know your child.

aV(CNN) If you are one of those people that stands on the scale every day or you obsessively plug your numbers into a BMI calculator, researchers want you to know you may be missing something.\u000a\u000aBMI, which stands for body mass index, is determined based on a person's height and weight. You're considered overweight if your BMI is between 25 to 29.9 and you're obese if your BMI is 30 or above.\u000a\u000aChances are, even if you are not "fat," by definition of these traditional measurements, you may still be "overfat." And that's going to have some seriously negative consequences for your overall health.\u000a\u000aA newstudy publishedin the journalFrontiers in Public Health suggests the number of people who meet the criteria foroverfat in the top 30 industrialized countries are more than all ofthe obese and overweight people in the world. In fact, they estimate that 90% of the men and 50% of the children in the US, New Zealand, Greece and Iceland are overfat. In the top overfat countries, researchers found 80% of the women were overfat, too.\u000a\u000aThis adds to previousresearch published in January that first suggested "the term more accurately encapsulates the problem itself."\u000a\u000aAnd if doctors rely only on the definitions we use to consider someone "obese," or "overweight," they may not be helping all the patients they should.\u000a\u000aWhat is overfat?\u000a\u000aOverfat is a term created to describe if you have a body fat level that can actually hurt your health. Even people who are considered "normal weight" or "non-obese" by traditional standards can fall into this category.\u000a\u000aargue that BMI misses about 50% of the people who still have dangerous amounts of fat.

Those are typically people who have the proverbial beer belly , but are otherwise in decent shape.\u000a\u000aYour scale or that BMI calculator don't know that you could be an athlete and have a lot of muscle mass, or a growing teen. Or, you could have gone on a fad diet and lost 3 pounds, but that doesn't necessarily make you healthier -- that 3 pounds could merely have been water weight, he said. "What we should really be worried about is the fat part and where your fat is concentrated." "We shouldn't be as much worried about weight," said author Paul Laursen , an adjunct professor and performance physiologist at the Sports Performance Research Institute in New Zealand.Your scale or that BMI calculator don't know that you could be an athlete and have a lot of muscle mass, or a growing teen. Or, you could have gone on a fad diet and lost 3 pounds, but that doesn't necessarily make you healthier -- that 3 pounds could merely have been water weight, he said. "What we should really be worried about is the fat part and where your fat is concentrated."\u000a\u000aWhy's belly fat so bad\u000a\u000aAbdominal fat is one of the most dangerous kinds of fat you can have. The reason it's so bad is that unlike your love handles -- which are the pinchable fat right beneath your skin -- the fat that is in your stomach area grows deep inside your body and it wraps around your vital organs. Your liver borrows this fat and turns it into cholesterol that can sneak into your arteries and start collecting there. When it collects, your arteries start to harden, and when they get hard, this can lead you to having a heart attack or stroke.\u000a\u000aThis deep layer of belly fat is also what makes your body insulin-resistant, which can lead you to having type 2 diabetes. It can also cause inflammation, which scientists are finding at the root of many chronic diseases and even cancer and Alzheimer's. Excess belly fat can also raise your glucose levels and decrease your muscle mass. You need good muscle mass to help keep good heart health.\u000a\u000aIt's no wonder earlier studies have shown that excess belly fat, even if you are skinny elsewhere, may be even more deadly than being obese or overweight. And that's saying a lot, since good old fashioned obesity is related to all sorts of diseases and potentially life threatening problems like cancer, heart attacks, stroke, asthma, sleep apnea, high blood pressure and a handful of other problems.\u000a\u000aIf a doctor is relying on BMI to assess your potential danger from your fat, they miss the risk. Earlier studies have also shown that doctors that rely solely on BMI may miss other warning signs for people of different ethnicities put them at greater risk for heart problems and other health issues.\u000a\u000aA better measure\u000a\u000aWhat may be a better way to assess if you are overfat is for your doctor to look more like a tailor and take a tape measure to your waist, the authors argue. If you want to try this at home, measure your circumference at your belly button. If your waist circumference is half your height or less, you are at a healthy fat level. If you are over that number, your fat could put you at risk for ill health.\u000a\u000aIt's not as perfect a measure as if your doctor were to calculate your fat using an X-ray, but it's a good indicator, suggests Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez , a cardiologist and obesity expert at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.\u000a\u000aLopez-Jimenez, who is not connected to this study, finds overfat an interesting concept and thinks the author's suggestion of measuring waist circumference is a good one. He said you could even do something simpler and look at your hip to waist ratio -- something a doctor could eyeball quickly. "If the waist is bigger than the hips, it tells me that the risk carried with that weight is much higher for that person for premature death," Lopez-Jimenez said.\u000a\u000aBut he's not convinced we need the term "overfat," as he thinks it over-complicates matters.\u000a\u000a"It basically adds a little more complexity to an already complicated subject," he said. He suggests scientists may want to broaden the term "obesity" to include people with normal weight BMIs that carry too much fat around the middle.\u000a\u000aLaursen thinks adding "overfat" to the lexicon will give doctors one more important tool.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We are so conditioned to walking up to the doctor's office to get a pill for every issue, but that is not working. When it comes to excess fat, the onus is really on the individual to figure out what works for themselves," said Laursen, who added he gets upset that the overfat epidemic has become such a large problem for so many. By giving doctors another term it helps them have an honest conversation with their patients.\u000a\u000a"Dealing with excess fat needs to be a priority," he said, "as it truly can put someone's life in jeopardy."

aV(CNN) In the far north of India, a cold mountain desert is the stunning backdrop to an unprecedented icy structure.\u000a\u000aThis is a land of extremes, where rainfall is scarce and temperatures range wildly from torrid to far below freezing.\u000a\u000aIt's the Ladakh region -- meaning "land of high passes" -- sandwiched between two of the world's tallest mountain ranges, the Himalayas and the Kunlun.\u000a\u000aRainfall is rare here. Water, essential for irrigating the farmlands that are the lifeblood of the local population, mostly comes from melting snow and ice.\u000a\u000aBut climate change is making this land even drier , leaving farmers without water in the crucial planting months of April and May, right before the glaciers start to melt in the summer sun.\u000a\u000aOne man's solution to the problem? Make more glaciers.\u000a\u000aThe "Ice Stupa"\u000a\u000aIn 2014 a local mechanical engineer, Sonam Wangchuk, set out to solve the water crisis of the Ladakh.\u000a\u000aThe natural glaciers are shrinking due to rising global temperatures. For that reason, they provide far less water in early spring but then release a lot in the summer heat, shrinking even more.\u000a\u000aWangchuk had a simple idea: he wanted to balance this natural deficit by collecting water from melting snow and ice in the cold months, which would normally go to waste, and store it until spring, just when farmers need it the most.\u000a\u000a"I once saw ice under a bridge in May and understood that it's the sun that makes the ice melt, not ambient temperature," he told CNN.\u000a\u000a"I realized that ice can last a long time, even at low altitudes."\u000a\u000aHe then built a two-story prototype of an "ice stupa", a cone of ice that he named after the traditional mound-like sacred monuments that are found throughout Asia.\u000a\u000aSonam Wangchuk in Ladakh, northern India.\u000a\u000asiWhy a cone?\u000a\u000aThe ice stupa is created using no power or pumps, only physics: "the ingredients are a downstream, an upstream and a gradient," says Wangchuk.\u000a\u000aFirst, a pipe is laid underground, connecting a stream of water and the location where the ice stupa is required, usually next to a village. The water must come from a higher altitude, usually around 60 meters or more.\u000a\u000aBecause a fluid in a system always wants to maintain its level, water from 60 meters upstream will spray 60 meters into the air out of the downstream pipe, creating a fountain.\u000a\u000aThe freezing air temperature does the rest, immediately crystallizing the water droplets into ice that falls right below, forming a cone.\u000a\u000a"A cone is very easy to make with ice, because any dripping naturally forms a cone underneath -- icicles are inverted cones," says Wangchuk.\u000a\u000aBut a cone has more desirable properties: "It has minimal exposed surface area for the volume of water it contains."\u000a\u000aThat means it melts very slowly: the prototype, 20 feet tall and containing 150,000 liters of water, lasted from winter until mid-May, just when water is needed for irrigation, while all the surrounding ice on the ground had gone by the end of March.\u000a\u000aThe first ice stupa prototype.\u000a\u000aLast ice standing\u000a\u000aThe revolutionary aspect of the ice stupa is that it works even at low altitude and in very warm temperatures.\u000a\u000aIt's not the first type of artificial glacier in the area, but previous endeavors were only attempted above 13,000 feet (or 4,000 meters) by freezing waters in large canals which required shade and a lot of maintenance, and were located too far away from the fields to be practical.\u000a\u000aInstead, the conical shape of the ice stupa can withstand even direct sunlight and it can sit right where the water is required.\u000a\u000aHowever, they are not maintenance-free: "Currently they need a lot of manual intervention: the fountains can freeze when the pipes ice up, things like that," says Wangchuk.\u000a\u000aHe hopes that soon, by refining the technology, the stupas will become more reliable. That's why he's going to start testing in Peru this summer, taking advantage of an extra winter in the southern hemisphere.\u000a\u000a"We are at a stage similar to motor cars in the 1950s, when drivers had to often open the bonnet and fix things. Nowadays the driver doesn't even know what's inside the bonnet, we are moving towards that," he says.\u000a\u000a"In the meantime, we can grow trees where trees would never grow because the land was too dry."\u000a\u000aA tree plantation receiving water from ice stupas. The trees are grown for timber, but they also add to the richness of nature of the valley.\u000a\u000aA crowdfunding effort\u000a\u000aHow much does it cost to build an ice stupa?\u000a\u000aBecause of the piping infrastructure required, the initial investment can be steep. Wangchuck estimated he would need around $125,000 to build his first full-scale version, which could reach 80 feet in height and provide irrigation to about 10 hectares of land: "It was too radical for any government to support, but I knew the people of the world would back it," he says.\u000a\u000aHe decided to crowdfund the project, asking people for contributions through Indiegogo, a popular crowdfunding platform. The campaign was successful and piqued the interest of the local institutions: "Now that the idea has been proven, the Ladhaki government is incorporating it its development plans."\u000a\u000aThe ice stupa also netted Wangchuk a Rolex Award for Enterprise in 2016 , which carried a 100,000 Swiss Franc prize (around $105,000).\u000a\u000aBut Wangchuk also dreams of turning the stupas into tourist attractions, by building ice bars and ice hotels inside them: "It will be an exclusive experience for people who are willing to pay for it, and the money will support the water for the farmers eliminating the shortage in the spring, which is what every farmer fears," he says.\u000a\u000aThis might sound a bit like mixing the sacred and the profane, but Wangchuk thinks the ice stupa itself is a bridge between different cultures.\u000a\u000a"We wanted to integrate traditional practices and beliefs with innovative technology, because climate change cannot be handled by engineering alone," he says.\u000a\u000a"We have to join forces."

aV(CNN) There was to be no triumphant end to Usain Bolt's final individual race.\u000a\u000aThe great Jamaican will retire after the IAAF World Championships in London, bringing the curtain down on an incomparable career.\u000a\u000aBut in the 100m final on Saturday he had to settle for bronze as the controversial American Justin Gatlin secured a surprise victory in a season's best 9.92 seconds.\u000a\u000aFellow American Christian Coleman (9.94) took silver, with eight-time Olympic champion Bolt, still the reigning 100m and 200m world record holder, in bronze, clocking 9.95 seconds.\u000a\u000aGatlin entered London's Olympic Stadium with the crowd's boos ringing in his ears. The 35-year-old is regarded by many as the sport's villain after twice being banned for doping offenses. He was also jeered in the heats and semifinals.\u000a\u000aBut the 2004 Olympic champion said he "tuned out" the supporters' din to claim a victory which wrecked Bolt's farewell.\u000a\u000aA glorious career\u000a\u000aGatlin genuflected to the Jamaican after his victory. Despite failing to claim a 12th world title, the night still belonged to the fastest man in history.\u000a\u000aIt was Bolt who was the last athlete to leave the track as he treated the 50,000-strong capacity crowd, and a throng of photographers, to his celebratory "To Da World" pose.\u000a\u000aThe crowd had come expecting Bolt to secure a 20th Olympic and world gold medal, but with his 31st birthday fast approaching this was a season too far.\u000a\u000aHe had only dipped under 10 seconds once this season prior to these championships and -- though earlier in the week he declared himself ready to defend his world crown -- he did not seem like the Bolt of old.\u000a\u000aThere was a little fooling around on the start line, but not with the same gusto as in the past.\u000a\u000aThroughout his career the sprinter has made winning look effortless, but on a floodlit evening in the English capital he had to work for his medal.\u000a\u000aAfter a disappointing start the Jamaican, for the first time in his career at a major championship, was grimacing as he dipped for the line, straining for a glorious end to his individual career.\u000a\u000aAn athlete like no other\u000a\u000aBolt is expected to compete in the 4x100m relay on August 12 and should he and his teammates retain their title, his tally of World Championships golds will rise to 12, two more than long-distance runner Mo Farah, who is second on the all-time list.\u000a\u000aAfter that there will be no more and his sport will never be the same.\u000a\u000aNo sprinter has ever run as quickly or won as many gold medals, and done so with such easy charm.\u000a\u000aFor nearly a decade he has been the undoubted superstar of track and field, his electric personality and incredible feats illuminating a sport darkened by doping.\u000a\u000aBolt told CNN earlier this week that it will take more than one athlete to fill the vibrant void he will leave behind and the sport now faces a period of transition without its main man.\u000a\u000aA legend like Ali\u000a\u000aHe has been likened to three-time heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali but, in some ways, the Jamaican's career has surpassed that of the legendary American boxer, even though his last solo race ended with a bronze.\u000a\u000aOnly twice has Bolt failed to triumph on the grandest stage -- a third place in London and a false start in the 2011 100m World Championships final.\u000a\u000aThe 30-year-old's longevity has been as remarkable as the times he produced in his early twenties.\u000a\u000aAt last summer's Rio Olympics, Bolt became the first man to win three 100m Olympic titles, securing his status as one of sport's greats.\u000a\u000aHe achieved an unprecedented Olympic "triple-triple" in the sprint events (winning the 100m, 200m and sprint relay) but the 4x100m gold won in Beijing 2008 was taken away from him following teammate Nesta Carter's retrospective positive doping test earlier this year.\u000a\u000aAll four of the fastest 100m times in history belong to Bolt and his sensational 100m world record of 9.58 seconds, achieved in Berlin in 2009, will live long in the memory.\u000a\u000aThe age of Bolt is now over, yet the baton has been passed not to a new generation but an American five years the Jamaican's senior.\u000a\u000aHowever, 21-year-old silver medalist Coleman -- still the fastest man in the world this year with a 9.82 run in Eugene in June -- could be Bolt's long-term successor in the blue riband event.

Mark Hertling is a national security, intelligence and terrorism analyst for CNN. He served for 37 years in the Army, including three years in combat, and retired as commanding general of US Army Europe and the 7th Army. He is the author of "Growing Physician Leaders." The opinions expressed here are those of the authors.\u000a\u000a(CNN) There is a lot to dislike about President Donald Trump's decision this morning to reinstate the ban on transgender service.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, it's an affront to the very ideals of the all-volunteer force, the force we both joined and served in for a combined 68 years. The central tenet of that force is that young men and women from across the spectrum of American society can choose to wear the cloth of the country in service to the nation.\u000a\u000aAs long as they swear the oath to defend our ideas, meet the professional standards, complete the training and thereafter serve with honor, they have the privilege of defending our country. It's led to a highly professional, well-led and motivated force that continues to be the world's example of professionalism in military service. Right now, only about 1% of the nation make that choice, and transgender troops are a part of all that.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, there have been times when 'all-volunteer' didn't mean every volunteer. Policies throughout the years have altered the physical and mental aptitude requirements, have restricted -- and still restrict, to a lesser degree now -- the service of women, have banned the service of gays and lesbians, and have even made racial equality and equal opportunity a challenge. There is still much work to be done on these fronts.\u000a\u000aWednesday's decision doesn't make that work easier. Indeed, it sets us back.\u000a\u000aIt also violates the covenant, as well the very contract, between recruits and the Defense Department. If we are to believe the President's statement this morning -- which barred transgender troops from serving in "any capacity" -- then it follows that every transgender soldier currently in uniform is in a state of limbo right now, uncertain whether or not they can continue their military careers.\u000a\u000aSen. John McCain, along with many other lawmakers, objected to Trump's tweet. "The Department of Defense has already decided to allow currently-serving transgender individuals to stay in the military, and many are serving honorably today," McCain wrote in an official statement.\u000a\u000aTransgender soldier: 'I felt like I had just gotten fired via tweet'\u000a\u000aAs Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King told CNN today, "The great thing about being in the military is when we take our oath we take it to our country. I felt like I had just gotten fired via tweet."\u000a\u000aThey deserve better than this.\u000a\u000aThere's another problem: this new policy could actually hurt readiness. A study by the RAND Corporation -- commissioned by the Defense Department -- found that somewhere between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender troops currently serve on active duty. If you consider the upper end of that estimate, you're talking about the same number of people who fill out an Army Brigade Combat Team, a little more than two Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) or an aircraft carrier with its embarked air wing. And this RAND estimate doesn't include many thousands more transgenders who likely serve in the Guard and Reserve.\u000a\u000aThat's a lot of talent ... a lot of people with unique and necessary skills. These are not individuals attempting to make a statement, these are citizens wishing to serve their nation. They serve in the infantry. They repair and maintain tanks, planes and ships. They fly, navigate, sail and drive all manner of machinery, vehicles and aircraft. They send missiles downrange. They keep supplies coming. They are interpreters and military analysts. They hunt down and kill terrorists.\u000a\u000aWe -- the American people -- have trained them. We've invested time and dollars in their education, in their development as leaders, and in their contribution to teams. We put them out there on the front lines, and now -- apparently -- our Commander-in-Chief wants to call them back in.\u000a\u000aAt a time when the Secretary of Defense and all the Service Chiefs are rightly concerned about readiness levels, when each of the military forces needs the continued funding and support of Congress to reset a force that has operated -- and continues to operate -- at a high tempo, it makes little practical sense to deprive the ranks of these professionals.\u000a\u000aWe should be better than this.\u000a\u000aMany proponents of this new ban will say that it actually saves money ... that the costs of providing specialized medical care to transgender troops deprives the services of funds that could be applied to weapons systems, training and operations.\u000a\u000a"Should we be spending any tax dollars to do gender reassignment surgeries when we have soldiers who don't have body armor or bullets?" asked Republican Congresswoman Vicki Hartzler, a supporter of Trump's decision. "We need to be investing every dollar that we have to meet the threats that we're facing as a nation," she added.\u000a\u000aCiting an internal study conducted by her office, Hartzler claimed that gender reassignment surgeries alone would cost the Defense Department $1.35 billion over the next 10 years.\u000a\u000aBut the RAND report (to remind, commissioned by DoD) disputes that, calling the costs of transition-related treatments "relatively low" with an increase by between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually, roughly a 0.04- to 0.13-percent increase in "active-component health care expenditures." The study also concluded that only a small percentage, estimated in the study to be between 29 and 129 service members, would even seek "transition-related care that could disrupt their ability to deploy."\u000a\u000aSo, yes, while there would be a financial cost to keeping the policy in place -- and the concomitant time away for post-operative rest and recuperation -- it's beyond a stretch to assert that it would debilitate the military.\u000a\u000aFinally, there is the actual process ... how this whole thing came about today. In a tweet. Without, apparently, much coordination with the Pentagon. Without any heads-up to Congressional leadership. Without a statement to our troops as to what this means for them and how it was going to be implemented.\u000a\u000aPolitico posted an excellent piece this afternoon, citing sources that claim the President made this decision to ensure passage of a spending bill that would fund, among other things, his cherished border wall. If true, that represents the worst kind of political gerrymandering on an issue that should have been thoughtfully considered and weighed -- just like Trump's defense secretary had wanted to do in the first place.\u000a\u000aOnly three weeks ago, Defense Secretary James Mattis informed the Hill that he needed another six months to review transgender recruiting, saying he would use the "additional time to evaluate more carefully the impact of such accessions on readiness and lethality," and would have those results in December of 2017.\u000a\u000aThat reflection, additional analysis and further evaluation is now moot. There will be no thoughtful deliberation about consequences or impact, no careful planning about how to move forward one way or the other. Just a knee-jerk political decision with no input from those who must execute it. No consideration over the lives and careers it affects.\u000a\u000aWe went from studying the impact of transgender recruiting to banning their service altogether at light speed, or should we say tweet-speed. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, that's just not the way to set personnel policies in the greatest military on earth.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThis was an ill-considered, unplanned, and poorly executed decision. It is as unfair to Pentagon leaders as it is cruel to the thousands of serving troops it directly affects. It violates the very ideals behind our all-volunteer force, deprives us of much-needed talent, and flies in the face of the President's own promise to take care of our troops.\u000a\u000aWe must be better than this.

aV(CNN) I'm often asked when couples should consider therapy. It's common for one partner to be unhappy, feel disconnected or feel that their needs for intimacy aren't being met.\u000a\u000aBut rather than communicate about it, that partner may open up a metaphorical window with someone else and begin an affair. By the time the couple comes to therapy, the affair itself becomes the main topic, and its underlying causes are often ignored.\u000a\u000aThe same scenario rings true for other sources of contention, from financial disagreements to sexual concerns. It's clear that couples shouldn't wait until they're in crisis mode to come to therapy, but what should they do?\u000a\u000aWhen is the right time to see a therapist?\u000a\u000aCouples should seek therapy long before they think they "need" to. Most experts believe that therapy can be an important part of your relationship. "Most issues within a couple start small and then grow in size when they don't get resolved. This is where therapy can help, by giving tools and techniques to improve conflict resolution," explained Kristie Overstreet, a licensed mental health counselor. "The majority of couples that I work with say that they should have started therapy years earlier."\u000a\u000a"There are three sides to every story: his side, her side and the truth," psychotherapist Kimberly Resnick Anderson agreed. "An objective third party can be just the ticket when couples feel they can no longer communicate effectively."\u000a\u000aRather than viewing therapy as the solution to a crisis, look at it as an integral aspect of a healthy life, suggested Ashley N. Grinonneau-Denton, marriage and family therapist.\u000a\u000a"Every couple should take preventive measures to maintain health in their relationship, just like going to the gym," she said. "If couples don't work their relational and emotional 'muscles,' they become un-toned, weak and create more of a chance of damage being done to their relationship."\u000a\u000aWhat happens during couples therapy?\u000a\u000aAlthough every therapist is different, there are some commonalities. The first session typically involves the therapist getting to know you, discussing the areas of the relationship they hope to improve and setting goals.\u000a\u000aSome, but not all, therapists will assign homework for the couples to work on before the next session. "Ideally, most of the work gets done, in my experience, outside of my office," psychotherapist Samantha Manewitz said.\u000a\u000aWhat problems can benefit from therapy?\u000a\u000aCouples come to therapy for any number of reasons, but in my experience, in addition to infidelity, the greatest issues include sex, communication, money and major life changes such as getting married or starting a family. Couples therapy is also a good idea if one of you is coping with an issue that might be affecting your relationship (such as depression) or simply if you're feeling stuck and stagnant in your relationship.\u000a\u000aTherapy can provide a safe space to talk about sensitive topics such as sex. "Just like folks can get caught in a negative relational cycle, couples can often also get stuck in a negative sexual cycle," said Michael Moran, a certified sex therapist. "I tell couples that when the sex they're having is worth having, they'll have more of it. And so we need to explore what blocks exist to creating that place between them."\u000a\u000aCommunication is also a big concern for couples. But simply talking with each other more isn't the answer. "There is communication, and then there's effective communication," explained Sara Nasserzadeh, a psychologist. "Both parties need to feel heard, soothed, respected and cared for first. We analyze old communication patterns and then replace them with feasible and more effective ones. These are all worked out collaboratively with the couple and within the context of their everyday life."\u000a\u000aYou might also consider couples therapy to help support you at times of major life change and transition. "Getting married, becoming parents for the first time, moving, changing jobs, losing jobs, becoming empty-nesters, coping after extramarital affairs, recovering from addiction, caring for aging parents -- all of these transitions can destabilize a couple's equilibrium," Anderson said. "Therapy affords couples an opportunity to negotiate these transitions with as little disruption as possible and to explore and honor what a particular transition means to each partner."\u000a\u000aAnd don't discount the value of couples therapy in helping you and your partner dig yourselves out of a rut.\u000a\u000a"Therapy allows couples to talk through their feelings and articulate how their relationship may not be meeting their expectations," said James C. Wadley, a licensed counselor. "More often than not, there is some common ground that may have enabled them to be in the relationship. 'Feeling stuck' can shift if both parties are willing to compromise in a way so that individual needs are met."\u000a\u000aWhat if one partner refuses to go?\u000a\u000aThis is a fairly common scenario in couples therapy. How you approach it can make a difference. "Talk with your partner extensively about why you're feeling you'd like to get into couples therapy," Moran said. "Don't just spring it on them and insist they go."\u000a\u000aIf they're still hesitant, remember that you can attend therapy on your own. This alone may have a beneficial effect.\u000a\u000a"Instead of waiting for the other person who doesn't want to go to therapy to change, therapy can help strengthen your own self-improvement and personal growth," said Marissa Nelson, a marriage and family therapist. The hesitant partner may become impressed by these positive changes and decide to pursue therapy after all.\u000a\u000aIf you think your own experiences with therapy have piqued your partner's curiosity, let them know that can see the therapist individually as well. "Often, by letting them know a safety zone will be created, where their voice is heard and fault or blame isn't the goal, the hesitant partner might feel safe to come in," psychotherapist Constance DelGiudice explained.\u000a\u000aHow do you know if your therapist is a good fit?\u000a\u000aIt helps to do your research before choosing a couples therapist, but the truth is that you won't really know whether they're the right for you and your partner until you get together.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I often arrange a phone call first with clients to make sure we are potentially a good fit," Nasserzadeh said. "Once you meet, pay attention to the therapist's communication style, the rational behind their questions and their general approach. "Any homework they assign should be explained clearly and makes sense to you and your line of logic."\u000a\u000aHow long should therapy last?\u000a\u000aThere's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It really depends on the couple and the issues they're working through. For some couples, a few sessions may be all they need to jump-start their relationship, while others may remain in therapy for years.\u000a\u000aIn general, it's a good idea to see a therapist together until you've met your goals and feel confident that you've gained the skills necessary to navigate the ups and downs of your relationship.

aV(CNN) Brace yourself for this story: Ten years after her orthodontic braces were removed, a piece of dental wire was found stuck inside an Australian woman's small intestine.\u000a\u000aDr. Talia Shepherd, one of the treating physicians, said the 30-year-old woman showed up at the emergency department of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Western Australia complaining of cramping and severe abdominal pain. The situation was reported in a study published Monday in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports.\u000a\u000aInitially, doctors thought the woman's pain was related to her gallbladder, and she was released once the pain alleviated. Two days later, she returned to the emergency department, again complaining of extreme pain.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't until Shepherd and the other doctors did a CT scan that they discovered an object had punctured several places in the woman's small intestine. The small intestine , between the stomach and large intestine, is responsible for absorbing nutrients and allowing non-absorbed food to pass to the large intestine.\u000a\u000a"After looking at the CT scan, at first we thought it was a fish bone, because that's a pretty common thing to find in the stomach," Shepherd said. "But when we went to ask the patient if she remembered swallowing anything, she had no recollection."\u000a\u000aBecause the intestine had been pierced in multiple spots, it had twisted around on itself, causing a condition known as volvulus . This, along with the extreme pain the woman was experiencing, led doctors to determine that emergency surgery was needed.\u000a\u000aThe woman had not worn orthodontic braces for 10 years, but after the surgery, the doctors found that what had perforated her bowel was actually a 7-centimeter piece of wire, presumably from her braces.\u000a\u000aShepherd said the case is so unusual because of the 10 years the wire went unnoticed.\u000a\u000a"I think it was probably just sitting there in her stomach the whole time, and then when the small bowel was punctured, that's when the pain started," she said.\u000a\u000aHowever, Shepherd also said those who have braces shouldn't be alarmed.\u000a\u000a"The chances of swallowing a wire from your braces is very low," she said. "There might be a higher chance if you're sedated and undergo a dental procedure. But this is a very unusual case."\u000a\u000aDr. Pat Raymond , a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical internal medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School, also thinks the case is unusual because the patient did not remember swallowing anything.\u000a\u000a"Usually, when people have an injury related to swallowing something, they remember accidentally swallowing it or intentionally swallowing it," said Raymond, who is also a spokeswoman for the American College of Gastroenterology . "But that she doesn't remember getting a relatively large piece of wire down there a decade before is strange."\u000a\u000aWhat other weird things have people swallowed?\u000a\u000aA dental wire isn't the only weird thing to be swallowed and recovered from people's bodies.\u000a\u000a"It's incredibly common in my profession to see people who have swallowed things," Raymond said. "The objects often vary based on whether things are swallowed intentionally or by mistake."\u000a\u000aCase studies published in recent years have reported unusual objects both purposely and accidentally swallowed, including a toothbrush , a fitness tracker , a lighter , an LED bulb and dentures\u000a\u000aOne report detailed the case of a woman who had an ink pen removed from her stomach 25 years after she accidentally swallowed it. The pen was still in working order.\u000a\u000aAnd last year a man purposely swallowed 110 cocaine packets in an attempt to smuggle the drugs across countries. Some of the drugs passed through his system, but another part had to be removed at the hospital.\u000a\u000aHowever, a recent study reported that the objects people swallow most often are chicken bones and fish bones. Raymond said accidental ingestions usually occur when people place things in their mouths to temporarily hold them, such as bobby pins or screws.\u000a\u000aShe's also seen unintentional swallowing of quarters after patients played the drinking game Quarters.\u000a\u000aAmerican Gastroenterological Association. Most often, doctors treat patients that have ingested foreign objects by allowing the swallowed object just to pass through the body, said Dr. J. Sumner Bell III , a gastroenterologist and member of theAmerican Gastroenterological Association.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"The general rule is that if it passes out of the esophagus, it's likely to pass through the rest of the intestine without incident," Bell said. "But if people swallow batteries, children swallow magnets, or sharp objects like razor blades or packages of cocaine, that's where we get involved to actively remove them."\u000a\u000aBell said doctors are concerned about these types of items because they can cause harm to the patient through perforation inside the body, just as in the dental wire case.\u000a\u000aIf the object cannot pass, doctors will usually use an endoscope to spot and remove the item from the esophagus or stomach. Surgery is usually needed only in cases with very sharp objects or when patients are in extreme pain.\u000a\u000aWhat about gum?\u000a\u000aSo if strange foreign objects can survive inside us for extended periods of time, what about the old wives' tale that gum lasts in our stomachs for seven years?\u000a\u000aRaymond said it's completely untrue.\u000a\u000a"Gum does not hang out for long in the stomach. Pretty much, the wad of gum is small enough to go from the stomach to the small intestine," Raymond said. "Then it travels downstream, and it comes out the bottom end.\u000a\u000a"The time range for gum is about the same as the time range for corn on the cob," she said. "I tell people if they want to know the average transit time for their GI tract, go eat some sweet corn. Then look for sweet corn. That's about how long gum will take to be digested, too."

That's the point at which some island nations are expected to be submerged , drought risks go up considerably and water availability goes down.\u000a\u000aI'd like your help in deciding which bad guys to target.\u000a\u000aBelow, you'll find a Facebook poll that lists four of my favorite climate villains, all of which came from your suggestions. Pick the one you find most interesting and I'll go out into the world to report on the winner. The poll closes at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, August 16.\u000a\u000aMEET THE CLIMATE CHANGE VILLAINS -- the people and industries whose actions researchers say are causing global warming.... Posted by CNN on Thursday, August 13, 2015\u000a\u000aBefore you vote, though, you should know some of the basics. In talking to people about climate change this year, I've found there is SO MUCH confusion about what's causing warming and why.\u000a\u000aI've met people -- smart people, reasonable people -- who think that climate change is caused by aerosols from hairspray (it isn't) or that it's just part of a natural warming cycle (it's not). Burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat, as well as chopping down rainforests, contributes to climate change.\u000a\u000aHere's a breakdown of global greenhouse gas emissions by sector, according to 2012 data synthesized by the World Resources Institute. This is kind of a "blame" chart.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, I asked people on Facebook to identify their preferred climate villains . Among the most interesting (and sometimes humorous) responses you submitted: dinosaurs ("they turned into the oil that we want to get at, right?"); millennials ("It is always millennials' fault for everything ..."); parents ("the process of procreation ... results in increases in demand of the earth's resources and is the driving force for most of our planet's woes"). I was mentioned by name ("John Sutter. I bet he's double secret super villain. No doubt."), as was Willis Carrier , the guy who commercialized the modern air conditioner, and James Watt, who invented an efficient steam engine\u000a\u000aYou also identified more nebulous bad guys, like apathy, greed, ignorance and consumerism. Geography found its way into the mix, too. China, America and the "3rd world" all made your list.\u000a\u000aSome countries are more to blame than others, sure. But it turns out that the most industrialized countries -- the United States, European countries and, increasingly, China and India -- are among the biggest contributors to climate change, because they burn the most fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aHere's a list of the top 10 countries in terms of their overall contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions. This list is measured from 1850, the start of the Industrial Revolution, to 2012, and it's based on data synthesized by the World Resources Institute\u000a\u000aUnited States China Russia Germany United Kingdom Japan India France Canada Ukraine\u000a\u000aThose are the countries most responsible for the warming we're already seeing, as well as for much of the warming that we will seen in coming years. According to the World Bank, the atmosphere already has warmed 0.8 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times , and about 1.5 degrees of warming is already "locked in" to the atmospheric system because of how much carbon we've burned.\u000a\u000aRemember, 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is the danger mark.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change 01:16\u000a\u000aFor context, here's a list of the top climate polluters today. They create about 70% of all current greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, according to the World Resources Institute\u000a\u000aChina United States European Union India Russia Indonesia Brazil Japan Canada Mexico\u000a\u000aAll of this data is a rough guide to help you vote. Each of the four topics you suggested for this poll is a worthy candidate. Our diets, our reliance on fossil fuel reserves, our willingness to turn precious forests into farms and our addiction to gas-burning cars and other dirty modes of transit -- all of these contribute to climate change. And each is worth exploring in depth.\u000a\u000aI don't want to play the blame game forever. I agree with those of you who said we need to move past finger-pointing and toward solutions. I do think, however, that by exploring who and what's causing climate change, we'll have a better sense of how to solve this urgent problem.\u000a\u000aSo, please vote. Tell your friends. And thank you for helping decide where I'll focus my energy.

The views expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) There was a frightening new guest at the party that marked Russia's Navy Day celebrations this past weekend -- perhaps representing the greatest single global challenge for President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aAll were fresh from the first stage of Joint Sea 2017 , a Russian-Chinese naval exercise that Chinese media boasted included live-firing of big guns in the Baltic Sea, which borders five of America's NATO allies, and was designed at least in part to showcase the cream of both nations' seaborne military might.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, China was staging its own military parade in Beijing as President Xi Jinping watched while dressed in the green camouflage uniform of the People's Liberation Army. Some 12,000 officers and men, accompanied by tanks, long-range missile launchers, jet fighters and other new, modern weaponry, moved past.\u000a\u000aAll this display of military muscle was just the latest and most visible -- though perhaps least appreciated -- headache for Trump in world trouble spots, from Syria to North Korea\u000a\u000aChina pivoting to Russia at this moment in time cannot be a good thing on any number of levels. The sudden alliance of these nations in the face of pressure from Trump suggests that those headaches are not going get any easier to solve anytime soon.\u000a\u000aThese joint efforts -- coinciding with the United States, Japan and South Korea staging their own maneuvers close to both China and North Korea -- suggest that both China and Russia had arrived at a newfound independence in the face of American challenges.\u000a\u000aMoreover, their allies in Syria and North Korea will now realize they have two potent counterweights to their efforts to chart their own potentially deadly courses.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has relied for decades on the assistance of China, particularly on an economic level, to prop up its failing and utterly despotic regime while counting as well on the neutrality of Russia, with which it shares a sliver of its northern frontier.\u000a\u000aIndeed, North Korean territory is barely 100 miles from the main Siberian port of Vladivostok, where Russia happened to stage the eastern tranche of its Naval Day exercises last weekend.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Russia shows military might during Navy Day Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH US detects odd sub activity from North Korea 01:29\u000a\u000aOn June 7, Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan met his Russian counterpart, Sergey Shoigu, during a summit in Kazakhstan of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a 20-year-old military and political grouping of China, Russia and other former Soviet Asian republics.\u000a\u000aShoigu proposed signing a comprehensive military cooperation agreement between Russia and China.\u000a\u000aAnd sure enough, three weeks later, Xi stopped by Moscow en route to the G20 summit in Germany, where he confirmed that such an agreement had been signed, along with $10 billion worth of other agreements, as both leaders grinned and shook hands.\u000a\u000aSo, with Russia now firmly in its corner, and the 2,615-mile frontier the two nations share thoroughly secure, how much further will China go in defying Trump? How long might Beijing stay quiet on further pressures against Kim Jong Un's headlong dash toward a nuclear arsenal and intercontinental ballistic missiles?\u000a\u000aAt present, North Korea poses no real threat to China. And it won't until its present government collapses and large numbers of North Koreans pour across the 880-mile border that the two nations share, or nuclear war breaks out, threatening to rain destruction on the millions of Chinese clustered in major cities within a 100-mile nuclear blast radius around Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.\u000a\u000aBoth of these unlikely scenarios will have at least slightly restrained China's actions in the past. But now, with a military ally in Russia, its independence may know even fewer bounds.\u000a\u000aThis must be taken into consideration before Trump or Congress considers how the United States tightens the screws on China -- or Russia for that matter.\u000a\u000aAfter the latest expulsions and sanctions engineered by Washington and Moscow, it's hardly likely that Trump will be able to use any goodwill from Putin to influence Chinese rhetoric or activities over North Korea.\u000a\u000aNow, Trump must reflect carefully how truly potent a combined Sino-Russian alliance may be as a counter to any moves he might consider going forward.

aV(CNN) The recent tragic discovery of dead, dying and injured undocumented immigrants , who had made the journey from Mexico to Texas crammed in the back of a sweltering metal tractor-trailer, raises many questions about heat stroke. Eight of these human trafficking victims were found dead and two died at the hospital. Twenty-eight others suffered various injuries, according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. The San Antonio fire chief warned that many of those who survived will have "irreversible brain damage."\u000a\u000aWhat is heat stroke?\u000a\u000aHeat stroke occurs when your core body temperature rises above 104°F (40°C) while you also experience profound changes in brain function -- "alterations in consciousness or mental status," said Dr. Corey Slovis, a professor and chair of Emergency Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\u000a\u000aThese two circumstances are also "usually associated with profound cardiovascular side effects of low blood pressure and elevated heart rate," said Slovis.\u000a\u000aUnder these conditions of heat stroke, "you are at risk for permanent brain, heart and kidney damage and you are at risk for death since heat stroke is potentially fatal," he said.\u000a\u000aHeat stroke may also be referred to as hyperthermia and heat illness.\u000a\u000aWhat happens when the human body endures extreme heat?\u000a\u000aWhen temperatures rise inside the body, your cells become deranged and chaotic, said Craig Crandall, a professor of Internal Medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Crandall is also a director of the thermal and vascular physiology laboratory at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. The resulting cascade of events, then, "greatly affect the central nervous system, the brain, and ultimately the organs."\u000a\u000a"As far as the brain is concerned, it starts to shut down," said Crandall. The brain swells, individual brain cells stop working and since it is their job to communicate throughout the system, "the organs stop receiving the appropriate information from the brain."\u000a\u000aIn addition, inflammation can begin affecting brain function and nerve function, said Crandall. Cytotoxins -- cytokines is the formal term -- are released throughout the body due to heat stress and these are detrimental to organ function.\u000a\u000a"One of the things that happens is your intestines, your gut, the permeability increases because of these cytokines released," said Crandall. "Some of the substances that are normally kept within the gut get suddenly released."\u000a\u000aThis occurs because the blood vessels are massively dilated and pressure is reduced. "A septic shock would be an analogous scenario. That can be a big problem," Crandall said.\u000a\u000a"When it gets too hot, the blood can clot or start to and that obviously will affect circulation and transportation of oxygen and nutrients," said Crandall. The oxygen and nutrients are necessary food for the body and its organs, including the brain.\u000a\u000a"So the person would pass out and likely be in a coma and can convulse and if it continues will lead to organ failure and ultimately death, which happened, tragically, in some of these individuals who were in that trailer," said Crandall. "It's just a bad scenario all around."\u000a\u000aWhat are the warning signs and symptoms of heat illness?\u000a\u000aThe warning signs of impending heat illness include high body temperature, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u000a\u000aHot, red, dry, or damp skin and a fast strong pulse are also warning signs, the CDC warns.\u000a\u000aSymptoms might include headache, feeling dizzy, nausea, feeling confused and losing consciousness (passing out).\u000a\u000a"You're really hyperventilating a lot and you're blowing off a lot of CO2 which can cause problems," said Crandall. "Of course, you're extremely dehydrated because you're releasing all this sweat and you're not taking in any fluid and that will exacerbate all these different [symptoms]."\u000a\u000aEach case, though, varies. Some people may reach the danger zone, experience only mild symptoms, such as a headache, and then that disappears once they rest and rehydrate. In other cases, though, a cascade of events may occur where the organs begin to shut down and the body is no longer able to regulate blood pressure and the blood does not coagulate. Death could follow.\u000a\u000aAre there different types of heat stroke?\u000a\u000aThere are two types of heat stroke. "One is called exertional heat stroke," said Slovis. This commonly affects athletes, such as football players or road racers in a tight pack, who exercise strenuously and their bodies can't dissipate the heat fast enough.\u000a\u000a"More commonly, and what was seen in this case is the classic heat stroke -- passive heat stroke -- where people become increasingly dehydrated," said Slovis.\u000a\u000a"We normally get rid of excess body heat by sweating and we evaporate and we lose heat via evaporation," said Slovis. With dehydration, though, we "lose the ability to sweat, the body loses the ability to get rid of heat, and so body temperature rapidly rises," he said.\u000a\u000aThe two things that increase the likelihood of heat related illness is inability to sweat and increasing humidity and heat.\u000a\u000a"If you're in a hot container, as body temp rises, as humidity rises inside there, you cannot dissipate heat," said Slovis.\u000a\u000aWhat is the treatment for heat stroke?\u000a\u000a"When we treat people for heat stroke, what I like to say is the two things we want to do is keep the person wet, and keep the person winded," said Slovis, adding that you want "to rapidly cool the patient, to rapidly rehydrate the patient, and to get the body temperature to as close to normal as quickly as possible."\u000a\u000a"People have used ice baths, they've used spraying people with tepid water and having fans blow on them," said Slovis. A combination of two is used in emergency rooms. "Ice packs are put under the groin, under the armpits, under the neck and the person is sprayed with water as fans run air current across them to maximize evaporation," he said.\u000a\u000aIn general, cooling the patient rapidly is most commonly used without any medication.\u000a\u000aWhat is the likelihood of a complete recovery following heat illness?\u000a\u000aAthletes who get heat stroke almost invariably do well, said Slovis. And it is "potentially totally curable" in healthier patients who receive treatment immediately. "Although many patients with heat stroke recover completely, they're at increased risk for heat stroke in the ensuing days, weeks and months," said Slovis.\u000a\u000aStill, no matter who you are, once your temperature rises above 104 and profound changes in brain function occur, "you are at risk for permanent brain, heart and kidney damage and you are at risk for death since heat stroke is potentially fatal," said Slovis. "The things we fear the most are renal damage, cardiac events, and something called rhabdomyolysis -- or muscle break down that may cause permanent kidney damage. Anything is possible due to heat stroke."\u000a\u000aThe damage begins immediately, yet the results depend on both time and the individual. Essentially, the longer the body is at high temperatures, the greater the risk to each organ system.\u000a\u000a"The sooner you're cooled, the healthier you are, the better you will do in a relatively unpredictable way," said Slovis. "I want to stress to you it is variable and each individual is different as far as how he or she is going to do. There's some point in each individual where the heat, the inflammation, the multi-organ system failure reaches a point where the patient can no longer be saved and that's different for each individual."\u000a\u000aWho is vulnerable?\u000a\u000aThe two groups most vulnerable are the very young and the very old, said Slovis, who noted that neither group can "control heat regulation as well as a mature individual."\u000a\u000a"And it's also based on the patient's underlying health, what medications they're on, whether they have heart, kidney, or liver disease, and just their underlying health and hydration prior to the heat stress," said Slovis.\u000a\u000aWhat can be done to protect against heat shock?\u000a\u000aHeat-shock proteins also factor into vulnerability, explained Crandall. Heat-shock proteins are stress proteins contained in each of our cells that protect the function of our cells, while also aiding immune response.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"The more that we're adjusted to heat, the more of these heat shock proteins we have," said Crandall. So people who work outside or exercise a lot are usually more acclimated to the heat and therefore are less likely to succumb to heat illness.\u000a\u000a"There's no question exercise will increase core temperature and prove to be beneficial and adaptive responses will occur," said Crandall.

The worms pass into the small intestine, where they lay eggs that develop into immature worms, which travel through the arteries and into the muscles. There, they curl up and return to the original cyst formation, and the life cycle continues. Symptoms can include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headaches, fevers, chills, cough, facial swelling, aching joints and muscle pain.

The anisakid nematodes can invade the stomach wall or intestines, causing symptoms of gastrointestinal pain, nausea and vomiting. Some people will develop complications, including digestive bleeding and peritonitis, inflammation of the inner wall of the abdomen. An allergic response to the worm can cause life-threatening anaphylaxis.

aV(CNN) When Christopher Michael Everett went to his first SoulCycle class, he gave it his all. He sat in the front of the class, cranked the resistance on his bike and started pedaling.\u000a\u000aWithin the first five to 10 minutes, his thighs began to hurt and feel abnormal. But he powered through the pain and stuck it out until the end of the class.\u000a\u000a"They say go big or go home. I probably should have went home," said Everett, a 33-year-old actor in Los Angeles.\u000a\u000aFor the rest of the day, he felt OK, but the following night was marred by excruciating thigh pain. Unable to sleep, he searched for "Spin class and sore legs" and came across a personal account written by a woman who needed to go to the hospital after a cycling class for a condition called rhabdomyolysis.\u000a\u000aRhabdomyolysis leads muscle tissue to break down and release a harmful protein into the bloodstream. Everett recognized the symptoms she mentioned, such as soreness, swollen thighs, nausea and an inability to bend the knees. He had all of them except dark brown urine , which he was not about to wait for, he said.\u000a\u000aEverett immediately went to the ER and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. He stayed in the hospital for a week.\u000a\u000aWhat is rhabdomyolysis?\u000a\u000aRhabdomyolysis quite literally means "breakdown of muscle," said Dr. Derek Fine, associate professor of medicine and interim chief of nephrology at Johns Hopkins Medicine. When the muscle breaks down, it releases myoglobin, a protein that can poison the kidneys, into the bloodstream.\u000a\u000aThe condition is caused by any type of trauma to the muscle. There are also toxins in some medications and illicit drugs that can cause it, he said. The first descriptions of the condition were among people who had been trapped under bombed buildings during World War II, Fine said.\u000a\u000aRecently, strenuous exercise has been popping up as another common culprit, seen in people who do activities like Spinning, P90X, CrossFit, weightlifting and running.\u000a\u000a"I've had patients come in who can't walk. They can't get out of bed. They call 911 because their muscles don't work," Fine said.\u000a\u000aIn rhabdomyolysis cases that are easier to treat, the patient is given fluids to rehydrate and released from the hospital after a few days of monitoring, Fine said.\u000a\u000aEverett said he was hooked up to an IV and pumped with fluids for seven days to flush out the toxins in his kidneys. He was not released until his levels of CPK -- creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme that leaks into the blood when muscle tissue is damaged -- were normal.\u000a\u000aWorst-case scenario\u000a\u000aIf the condition is really severe, the kidneys may shut down, and the patient could end up on dialysis. With kidney failure comes the risk of an overload of potassium in the body, which could lead to abnormal heart rhythms and death.\u000a\u000aIn April, the American Journal of Medicine released a study on three cases of rhabdomyolysis that were caused by Spinning classes. In one case, a 33-year-old kindergarten teacher was put on dialysis when she had kidney failure and experienced fluid overload from her hydration treatment.\u000a\u000a"It's tough to tell somebody who's 33 years old, 'I need to start you on dialysis.' And so you treat them with a lot of fluids, and you hopefully get them to the point where their kidneys open up and they start getting rid of the toxins and they don't have to go on dialysis," said Dr. Alan Coffino, a nephrologist and chairman of medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York and a co-author of the study. He treated the 33-year-old. "In her case, we had to pull the plug and put her on dialysis."\u000a\u000aAfter two weeks, her kidneys opened up, and she was released from the hospital.\u000a\u000aAnother potential symptom of rhabdomyolysis is compartment syndrome, Coffino said, which is when muscles swell and are unable to expand. In some cases, surgery is needed to release pressure from the muscle.\u000a\u000aEverett said the swelling of his thighs concerned the doctor. "He was like, 'if your thighs get any more swollen, we're going to have to cut those open,' " he said. But the swelling did not increase, and Everett was able to avoid surgery.\u000a\u000aHow to avoid rhabdomyolysis\u000a\u000aPeople who work out regularly can get rhabdomyolysis, Coffino said, as well as those who don't exercise often. Those who are fit typically get it if they push themselves too hard or if they try a new exercise that works a different muscle group. The study he co-authored points out that of the 46 people documented in medical literature who got rhabdomyolysis from a Spin class, 42 developed it after their first class.\u000a\u000aEverett worked out every two to three days and considers himself fit, but he had never taken a Spin class before.\u000a\u000a"I just wish SoulCycle would have said at the beginning of the class, 'if you work out too hard, this can happen to you,' " Everett said. Its been one month since he was hospitalized, and his legs are still sore.\u000a\u000aSoulCycle has not responded to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aAlthough any type of extreme exercise can lead to the condition, the popularity of Spinning is what concerns Dr. Maureen Brogan, associate professor of medicine at New York Medical College, nephrologist at Westchester Medical Center and the lead author of the study.\u000a\u000a"I mean, Spinning, you burn 600 calories in an hour, and you lose up to a liter an hour of sweat," Brogan said. "Six hundred calories is like running six miles. So if you're not conditioned, you wouldn't just run six miles."\u000a\u000aOne of her patients developed rhabdomyolysis after spending only 15 minutes on a bike.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aRhabdomyolysis can occur at any age and in both men and women. In Brogan's Spinning study, it was more common in females, but that's because more women tend to participate in the exercise, she said.\u000a\u000aTo avoid the condition, it is important to be slow and gradual when beginning a new type of workout, she said. When going to a class, you should tell the instructor if you are new, and make sure to hydrate before, during and after exercising.\u000a\u000aNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be damaging to the kidneys, so they shouldn't be taken after an intense workout, Brogan said. If someone does develop rhabdomyolysis, it could worsen their condition.\u000a\u000a"It's better just to err on the side of caution and take things slowly," Brogan said.

aV(CNN) "Sharknado" jumped the you-know-what three movies ago, once Syfy parent Comcast sought to turn this unexpected social-media sensation into a money-munching, synergistic promotional machine. The latest edition, "Sharknado 5: Global Swarming," hardly reverses that trend but does fleetingly feel a bit more energetic, raining down a relentless barrage of silliness.\u000a\u000aPart of that might stem from having a new writer, Scotty Mullen, joining director Anthony C. Ferrante; and a global approach that bounces the characters around the world, which at the very least reduces opportunities to plug sister NBCUniversal properties. Yes, the gang on the "Today" show again pops up, along with a gratuitous Xfinity banner, but so do morning-show hosts in the UK and Australia.\u000a\u000aAlas, it's hard to make a silk purse out of a shark's ear -- or rather, fins and entrails -- and "Sharknado 5" quickly runs out of steam. The very unlucky Sharknado survivors Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering), his bionic spouse April (Tara Reid) and Nova (Cassie Szerbo) are again trying to save the world, this time from a wave of sharknados -- whose origins are wrapped in a dense mythology -- that wends from one international monument to another.\u000a\u000aThe pop-culture references at first prove cleverer, from a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" spoof to Olivia Newton-John joining the onslaught of celebrity cameos, gamely taking part in a "Grease" gag and asking that the principals "don't get too physical."\u000a\u000a" allowfullscreen>\u000a\u000aThrow in a blimp named the Hindenburg (after its patron), and there's momentary hope that "Sharknado" might actually up its game. There's even a "Make America Great Again" joke, which takes on a different hue given the revelation that Donald Trump was sought to appear in an earlier movie.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVJerusalem (CNN) An Israeli military appeals court on Sunday upheld the guilty verdict of a soldier sentenced in February for fatally shooting an incapacitated Palestinian assailant. The high-profile manslaughter case sharply divided the country.\u000a\u000aA lower military court previously sentenced Elor Azaria to 18 months in military prison and demoted him from sergeant to private for killing Abdel Fattah al-Sharif. Sharif, 21, was one of two men accused of stabbing another Israeli soldier in the West Bank city of Hebron in March 2016.\u000a\u000aCharges were brought against Azaria after video emerged that shows him shooting Sharif in the head as he lay on the ground, injured and already subdued. The second suspect, 21-year-old Ramzi Qasrawi Tamimi, had already been shot dead.\u000a\u000aThe video, provided by B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, shows a small crowd of Israeli soldiers and medics standing around a Palestinian man lying on the ground.\u000a\u000a"An Israeli soldier can be seen shooting the injured al-Sharif," B'Tselem said in a statement released with the video in March 2016.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Nearly two years ago Abby Holmes and her husband Jeremiah left their home and jobs in Brooklyn for Columbus, Ohio.\u000a\u000aBetween 45% rent hikes and hyper-competitive hunts for a preschool for their son, the couple were ready to leave behind the big city life.\u000a\u000aIn Columbus they had extended family, affordable rent and, they hoped, the promise of an easier life. But a little over a year after moving, the couple has struggled to find full-time work. Last year, they made about $26,000, which was hardly enough to support the family of four.\u000a\u000aAbby Holmes, her husband Jeremiah and their two sons, Harry, 4 and Eli, 6 months. The Ohio family counted on Medicaid to make ends meet last year.\u000a\u000aThey've counted on government-funded Medicaid to cover doctor's visits, medications and the birth of their second child, Eli. Her family hasn't needed it yet, but Abby knows they could also turn to food assistance and other benefit programs.\u000a\u000aTheir situation isn't the only thing that's changed in the last year.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration and Congress have signaled sweeping plans to remake programs that affect the Holmes' and millions of other families. Medicaid, food stamps and rental assistance are among them. These families could find themselves losing the help they depend on to visit doctors, stay in their homes or put healthy food on the table.\u000a\u000a"We would have to regroup in an entire new way," Abby Holmes said of losing Medicaid. "I would be forced to look for full-time work. My kids would see me less ... and our take-home pay would not change because all of that new money would have to go for healthcare, so it is kind of a lose-lose. ... We're living paycheck to paycheck as it is."\u000a\u000aWhile Republican leaders failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in March, President Trump's administration has vowed to cut billions in federal poverty and health care programs and his secretary of Health and Human Services has promised to give states more control over social programs, which typically means budget cuts and diminished regulation.\u000a\u000aHow successful the Republican party will be in reshaping decades of social safety net programs is unclear as the party is deeply divided. President Trump promised during the campaign to "save" programs such as Medicaid "without cuts," but has since changed his position since the election.\u000a\u000aA Republican-led Congress and the White House now appear aligned and eager to make the most drastic changes in generations to federal entitlement programs that help those in need.\u000a\u000aWhere are safety net cuts most likely?\u000a\u000aThe programs most likely to face cuts are Medicaid and SNAP, a nutrition program that provides healthy food for families, housing vouchers and home energy assistance. Changing these programs from federal to state control could create a patchwork of programs that can be confusing and hard to access because of changing eligibility requirements.\u000a\u000aSome estimate the changes could eventually cut as much as 30% to 40% from the multi-billion-dollar budget for Medicaid, while changes to food stamp programs and the health insurance rules might make it harder for families to afford groceries or visits to the doctor.\u000a\u000aMedicaid covers 70 million low-income children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and people with disabilities, and SNAP helps 43 million people put food on the table.\u000a\u000aBut the GOP has signaled its intention to shift them from being open-ended entitlements to more-restricted block, or per capita, grants.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED In 2015, Trump promised not to cut Medicaid Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH In 2015, Trump promised not to cut Medicaid 01:13\u000a\u000aEntitlements are unlimited reimbursements to states that expand to cover anyone eligible for help during times of need, such as a recession or disaster. However, block grants function like an annual allowance: The federal government offers states a fixed amount for program funding and states decide how to use that money. If there's more demand for social services, states must make up the difference or cut benefits.\u000a\u000aCongressional Republicans proposed block grant plans in their budgets last year and Trump discussed them during the campaign. In a March letter to state governors (PDF), Tom Price, head of the Department of Health and Human Services, promised to give states "more freedom to design programs that meet the spectrum of diverse needs."\u000a\u000aBlock grant reforms "end the misguided one-size-fits-all approach that has tied the hands of so many state governments," said House Speaker Paul Ryan in a statement on his website . "States will no longer be shackled by federally determined program requirements and enrollment criteria."\u000a\u000aBeyond just state budgets, block grants can also change the way the programs work. Government leaders could, for example, institute requirements that Medicaid recipients have jobs, end federal rules that states pay for programs to help pregnant mothers quit smoking, or create a wait list for insurance.\u000a\u000a"We would go from a scenario where the government helps to guarantee access to certain levels of benefits to support kids and families, to a 'you're on your own, first-come-first-served' scenario," said Kelly Hardy, senior managing director for health policy at Children Now, a California advocacy group.\u000a\u000aPushing for change\u000a\u000aRepublican and conservative thinkers have pushed to turn entitlement programs into block grants for decades. Ryan, 47, famously said in March that he'd been "dreaming" of cutting Medicaid since he was " drinking out of a keg ."\u000a\u000aThey argue that the free-spending entitlement approach to poverty and social services hasn't succeeded. The nation's poverty rate hasn't changed dramatically since the 1970s, when programs like SNAP and Medicaid were first introduced and the percentage of children in poverty hasn't declined since 1970 , five years after Medicaid and other "War on Poverty" welfare programs were first signed into law.\u000a\u000a"We don't know what works best," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute. "But we know what we're doing isn't working. Experimentation seems like a good idea."\u000a\u000aThat flexibility of block grants could let states tailor social service programs to the needs of their residents, supporters argue.\u000a\u000aFor example, under block grants, states could combine nutritional benefit money with healthcare funds to offer people at risk of obesity intense nutritional counseling early in life, before they require expensive treatment for diabetes or heart disease, said Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank that has pushed block-grant programs.\u000a\u000a"We tend to put things in silos," Miller said of the social safety net. "If your focus is on improving people's health you would think about what could be rearranged. How do we best assist the person in front of us, if you could reshape it and bundle together what the government is offering? Maybe housing is the thing that is going to make them healthy, not another doctor visit."\u000a\u000aMiller pointed to a 2015 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that gave disabled people on Medicaid cash allowances to spend money on in-home health services they thought they needed instead of trying to file for benefit programs. The study found that issuing cash allowances cost the government slightly more, but only because people more easily accessed the help they were entitled to in the first place.\u000a\u000a"States are the 50 experiments, the labs of democracy," said Tanner of the Cato Institute. "Right now we treat everything as an identical cookie cutter, but maybe a state wants to focus on housing, or the universal basic income, or increasing work requirements."\u000a\u000aDoing more with less\u000a\u000aBut critics say the talk of innovation distracts from the fact that block grants reduce federal spending.\u000a\u000a"Having looked at these proposals, it seems easy to determine that the decision that will be left to the states will be how to deal with less federal money," said Matt Broaddus, a research analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think-tank that specializes in welfare policy.\u000a\u000astudy by the nonpartisfan Urban Institute found. In West Virginia, where 53% of children are covered by Medicaid, a shift to per capita or lump sum block grants could leave state leaders with a $4 to $7 billion shortfall in federal spending over 10 years, astudy by the nonpartisfan Urban Institute found.\u000a\u000a"If that happens, then we have to figure out where to cut," said Renate Pore, interim executive director of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care. "Are they going to cut services, like dental care? Are they going to reduce the number of people eligible? People will have coverage that is less affordable, especially children."\u000a\u000a"These are all bad choices," Pore added.b\u000a\u000aDr. Lynda Young, a primary care pediatrician in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that if Medicaid funding was reduced, fewer doctors might treat Medicaid patients and parents could find it harder and more expensive to bring their children to the doctor.\u000a\u000a"When the money is gone, what is going to happen to the kids?" she asked. "They don't come for routine care, so we're talking about their general development and health. We look at lead when they come in, we look at anemia, we look at making sure they have enough to eat."\u000a\u000aIn Ohio, parents like Abby Holmes might find themselves without coverage while their children have less Medicaid coverage than they did before. Under Republican plans, Ohio could lose $22 to $40 billion in federal health funding from 2019 to 2028, according to the Urban Institute\u000a\u000aAnd while block grants may promise states a reasonable amount of money when first implemented, studies have shown that over time other social safety net block grants for housing and health insurance don't grow to account for inflation, rising costs or population changes, leaving states with less spending power each year.\u000a\u000aThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities studied 13 federal block grants for programs like child care, substance abuse and maternal health and found that between 2000 and 2016, federal funding fell an average of 26%. Few states could make up the shortfalls and instead reduced benefits or cut people from the programs.\u000a\u000aIn California, where 42% of children are covered by the state's Medi-Cal program, families could be forced to spend months on waiting lists before they get coverage.\u000a\u000a"We've done this before," said Hardy of Children Now, referring to of earlier California budget cuts. "At one point we had 90,000 kids on a waitlist for a program that overall had a million kids in it."\u000a\u000aCutting additional programs\u000a\u000aWhile cuts to Medicaid would be the largest and most dramatic changes to federal entitlements under the new Republican plans, they would also potentially cut millions of dollars for the federal government's food stamp entitlement program, which covers 43 million low-income Americans, almost 70% of whom are families with children.\u000a\u000aThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, called SNAP, functions much the same way a Medicaid entitlement does: Anyone eligible for the benefit will be covered and the federal government will reimburse states. But the program could be shifted to block grants, providing a fixed amount of money to states for those who need help buying food.\u000a\u000a"Let's assume the block-grant funding" stays flat, said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "That means that SNAP can't expand to meet needs if a state or even a community experiences a downturn, say if a plant closes."\u000a\u000aLike Medicaid, cuts to SNAP could mean fewer people would be eligible for benefits or might have to wait longer to receive them.\u000a\u000a"It becomes a real tension when benefits are cut, because SNAP is part of the household budget" Dean said. "At some point you're going to give up your house rather than allow your kids to go hungry."\u000a\u000aAnother program that could be changed to a block grant is Social Security Income, which provides as much as $733 a month in cash assistance to 8.4 million poor and disabled people, including 1.3 million disabled or blind children. Many of the children who receive SSI live with a single parent and receive special education.\u000a\u000aUnder block grants, states could make it harder for parents with disabled children to receive benefits or could cut the monthly amount of money they receive.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump and Ryan have made clear they hope to reduce federal spending by reforming Medicaid and rolling back the expansion of other programs that support children, the cost savings now could lead to higher expenses a few decades from now, advocates said. Children who have grown up without healthy food or easy access to doctors struggle with chronic, expensive health problems for the rest of their lives.\u000a\u000a"As people grow up without adequate medical care, that really is a big problem," said Marcia Lowry, head of A Better Childhood, which advocates for abused and neglected children. "It is going to have a big impact on the population, especially the poor population, as they grow up."

aVJoan Cook is an associate professor at Yale University and president of the American Psychological Association's Division of Trauma Psychology. She is an Op-Ed Public Voices Fellow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Many fans are shocked and heartbroken over the loss this week of Chester Bennington , the fierce lead singer for the rock band Linkin Park. Police say they are treating his death as a possible suicide, which would make the pain even harder to bear.\u000a\u000aThere's a famous saying , "When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail." That may be true. But in this case, as a clinical psychologist and researcher who specializes in trauma, I don't think I'm overreaching in saying that his troubled past may have been a factor in his death. Chester Bennington had openly said he was a survivor of childhood sexual abuse that haunted him and, he said, contributed to his excessive use of drugs and alcohol.\u000a\u000aFor far too long, boys and men who have been sexually abused or assaulted have been overlooked, neglected, minimized or stigmatized by society and, at times, by the health care community. It's time for that disregard to stop.\u000a\u000aOne study in the United States estimated that one in six males are sexually abused at some point during their childhood. Let's stop and think about that for just a second. Picture all the boys and men you know, and then breathe that statistic in. That may include your father, your husband/lover, your boss, co-workers, coaches and friends.\u000a\u000aSurvivors of childhood sexual abuse are at an increased risk of developing a wide range of medical, psychological, behavioral and sexual disorders. Indeed, a meta-analysis of published research on the effects of child sexual abuse verified the extensive and subsequent negative short- and long-term effects.\u000a\u000aFor example, sexual trauma is related to psychiatric disorders , including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse and dependence, depression, anxiety and suicidal behavior. In addition, many male survivors of sexual abuse also have negative body image, revulsion to being touched or touching others, lack of confidence in their appeal and attractiveness, sexual dysfunction from low sexual desire to difficulties achieving and maintaining an erection and retarded ejaculation.\u000a\u000aSexual trauma is also linked to medical illnesses increased use of health care services and poor quality of life. Yet the majority of the research on sexual abuse, including the development and testing of psychosocial interventions, focuses on women. This is not OK and must change in order to help the many people like Chester Bennington.\u000a\u000aThere are numerous barriers to men reporting sexual assault and getting the help they need. Internalization of socially acceptable norms and expectations for being a man, as well as knowledge-related barriers about abuse and assault, exist for these men.\u000a\u000aA large part of my clinical practice over the past 20 years has involved male veterans -- those who served in the war zone and have combat-related PTSD; those who have been physically or sexually assaulted before, during or after military service and have assault-related PTSD; and sometimes all of the above. Many of the men I've worked with in this capacity subscribe to the male ethic of self-reliance.\u000a\u000aThey are taught to be tough, fearless and to deny their own vulnerability. They are told to never cry or experience sadness, and that they should always welcome sexual activity. They feel tarnished in terms of their maleness -- powerless, out of control and low in confidence.\u000a\u000aMany of these men fear being judged for provoking or "inviting" the abuse and blame themselves for not being able to prevent it. They fear that their sexual preference will be questioned. And, as a result, some of these men banish the sexual abuse from their psyche, deny it ever occurred, minimize its impact, normalize or justify what happened to them, or engage in dangerous behaviors like drugs or alcohol to drown it out.\u000a\u000aI, for one, don't want to be a part of this exploitation, betrayal and abandonment of boys and men. As such, my Yale colleagues and I partnered with a non-profit trauma survivor organization that provides resources to male abuse survivors and their loved ones worldwide.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aMaleSurvivor has been working to create an environment within which male survivors of trauma and abuse feel empowered to come forward seeking help, and to ensure that those who do come forward have access to trained and experienced support services. Their website currently sees hundreds of thousands of visits annually from people all over the world, and their social media platforms reach millions every month with news and messages of hope, healing and support.\u000a\u000aIf you meet a male survivor or come to learn that someone you love was sexually abused or assaulted in childhood, please communicate to them that the abuse was not their fault, they didn't ask for it to happen, and psychologically healthy adults or older children do not treat other people in that way. Tell them there is hope for their future.

Their 2017 Annual Letter, from which some points in this article are adapted, is available at www.gatesletter.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Warren Buffett is one of the best loved people in the world -- and it's easy to see why. He's jovial and friendly. He's funny and wise. He makes people feel good about themselves. But he has one quality that fuels all the others: Warren is the most upbeat, optimistic person we know.\u000a\u000aHe's optimistic about the country, about the future and about you. No matter where things are right now, he knows in the long run they're getting better. You doubt it? Don't bet against it; he's made billions investing in that belief. The great thing about Warren's optimism is you can't hear him share a story, tell a joke or say hello without picking up some of his optimism yourself.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Why Bill Gates is optimistic about the future Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why Bill Gates is optimistic about the future 00:58\u000a\u000aThat's why it feels so good to be around him.\u000a\u000aSome people might say, "I'd be optimistic, too, if I'd had his success." But we think that has it backward. Warren's success didn't create his optimism; his optimism led to his success. Because optimism isn't a belief that things will automatically get better; it's a conviction that we can make things better.

aVWaukesha, Wisconsin (CNN) - Once, Barack Obama spoke of what he wanted for his presidency in terms of healing a nation divided. "This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow, and our planet began to heal," he said.\u000a\u000aToday, Obama is talking about executive orders and executive actions - with a pen or phone - if a divided Congress won't or can't act on an agenda he laid out this week in his State of the Union address.\u000a\u000aBut in an exclusive interview airing Friday on CNN, the President insists he has not recalibrated his ambitions.\u000a\u000a"In no way are my expectations diminished or my ambitions diminished.

aV"As good as we can be as scientists, we are not the guys who are living in it 24 hours a day, who will have perceptions that go beyond the couple of hours or even the months or years you might attend to something as a scientist," says Rouja.\u000a\u000aCombining scientific research with local knowledge is the cornerstone of his strategy for conserving Bermuda's shipwrecks.\u000a\u000aHe admits that it's often too easy for scientists to get caught up in data, but "the wholeness of a story that includes a local perspective resonates across a much broader spectrum than a purely professional or a purely academic one."\u000a\u000aAs a prime example of this, Rouja pulls out a weathered scroll of paper from his office.\u000a\u000aIt's a map, hand-drawn by Teddy Tucker and annotated with notes on fish populations.\u000a\u000aMost notably, it highlights the stark changes in the marine environment over the last half-century.\u000a\u000a"Teddy's talking about fish that I know I've never seen, but he's also talking about sharks," laments Rouja.\u000a\u000a"I think these were things that were just a common feature of the marine environment around Bermuda, and, you know, they're just not here. You don't see sharks. You just don't see them, and so it's obvious that things have changed dramatically when something that's that ubiquitous to a reef area is just absent."\u000a\u000aThis type of local knowledge has informed Bermuda's efforts to revive numerous fish species and promote healthy reef ecology.\u000a\u000aBy protecting the shipwrecks and restricting fishing nearby, the government has simultaneously created ideal conditions for depleted fish populations to recover.\u000a\u000aOne such species is the Stoplight Parrotfish.\u000a\u000a"The shipwreck led us to focus on its spawning aggregation," says Rouja, referring to when a species of fish gathers together in greater densities than normal with the specific purpose of reproducing.\u000a\u000a"And the cool part is that the protection we afforded to the shipwreck included this aggregation, which essentially created the circumstances or helped support the circumstances for that aggregation to flourish."\u000a\u000aAs Rouja continues, it becomes even clearer that everything is connected.\u000a\u000a"Parrotfish are very important for grazing on the reef and the rocks and they graze down the algae. And algae, if it's not controlled, overtakes our reef," he says.\u000a\u000a"The loss of those algae controlling fish has been very significant. So suddenly I'm on a shipwreck where I can catalog the history, we can look at growth over time of reef on that shipwreck because that shipwreck sets a date and time that allows us to look at coral reef growth, and at the same time, it has accidentally protected the spawning aggregation of Parrotfish."\u000a\u000aIn this way, Bermuda stands on the forefront of an innovative new trend in environmental conservation by including shipwrecks in marine protected areas.\u000a\u000aWith its relatively small landmass, limited natural resources and a population accustomed to the luxuries of western society, Bermuda presents a microcosm of the environmental challenges faced by much of the world.\u000a\u000a"Whatever we import we have to dispose of," Rouja remarks. "It doesn't go to some other county a couple hundred miles away. You know if we discover a source of pollution we can't just sort of isolate it and push it to an area we don't have to deal with it. It's always here."\u000a\u000aBermuda's integration of cultural and environmental heritage preservation by embracing local knowledge is an example of one way governments can tackle conservation issues like these.\u000a\u000aAs Rouja puts it, "the more I can integrate shipwreck conservation with environmental conservation, the stronger the case will be for both."\u000a\u000aFor a place that cares so deeply for its culture and traditions, Bermuda's willingness to adopt new and creative solutions to maintain its identity in an ever-changing world sets it apart.\u000a\u000aThere is a sense of hope on the islands, a place where even castaways forced to pillage from a sunken ship can endure.

aVAustralia's biggest bank just became the first financial institution to be sued over how it deals with the risk of climate change to its business.\u000a\u000aTwo shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBAUF) filed a lawsuit in the country's federal court on Tuesday, alleging that the bank did not "adequately disclose" the risks climate change could pose to its financial stability.\u000a\u000aThe investors, Guy and Kim Abrahams, claim that the Commonwealth Bank's 2016 annual report "failed to give a true and fair view of its financial position and performance."\u000a\u000aThey want the bank to admit guilt and make a commitment to provide more detailed information about climate change risks in future.\u000a\u000a"The proceeding is the first legal action by shareholders against a bank anywhere in the world that will test how public companies should disclose information about climate change risks in their annual reports," Environmental Justice Australia, the Abrahams' law firm, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aCommonwealth Bank is one of Australia's "Big Four" banks, and the country's largest by market capitalization.\u000a\u000aIn a statement emailed to CNNMoney, the bank rejected the claim that it had not complied with reporting requirements.\u000a\u000a"Commonwealth Bank understands that climate change is a topic of public and shareholder interest and we are committed to playing our part in limiting climate change," the statement said.\u000a\u000aThe 2016 report outlines the bank's commitment to tackling climate change and helping to limit global warming. It also promises to "actively support businesses and technologies that... mitigate the effects of climate change."\u000a\u000aRelated: Australia's economic winning streak is epic, but it's not a record\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit singled out a particular project -- a controversial $12 billion coal mine by a large Indian conglomerate. The Adani Carmichael coal mine in Australia's Queensland region has faced widespread protests by environmental activists and politicians over climate change risks and the potential use of taxpayer money.\u000a\u000aThe investors want the Commonwealth Bank to say whether it plans to fund the Adani project, because to do so "continues to pose, material or major risks (including reputational risks) to its business."\u000a\u000aRelated: Indian billionaire to open huge new coal mine in Australia\u000a\u000aCalls for companies to disclose business risks from climate change have grown louder in recent years. New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg has been leading a global task force of top executives to address the issue.\u000a\u000a"Climate change is affecting companies through the direct impact of steadily rising global temperatures and the policies that governments around the world adopt in response," Graeme Pitkethly, chief financial officer at Unilever (UL) and the vice chair of the task force, wrote in an opinion piece for CNNMoney earlier this year.\u000a\u000a"Public companies are already obliged to disclose material risk," Pitkethly added.

aV(CNN) A landmark report detailing sexual harassment and assault at Australia's universities found that more than half of all students have been harassed.\u000a\u000aSome 51% said they were sexually harassed in 2015 or 2016 and about 7% of university students were sexually assaulted at least once in the same time frame, the report found.\u000a\u000aOf those who faced sexual harassment, one in five said it took place "at a university setting" in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe report made nine recommendations to Australia's universities, including evaluating the processes students use to report assault and harassment and efforts to change attitudes and behavior.\u000a\u000a"Sexual assault and harassment have no place in Australian universities, just as they have no place anywhere in Australia," said Simon Birmingham, Minister for Education.\u000a\u000aThe report's definition of sexual harassment included: staring or leering; insults of a sexual nature; displaying posters of a sexual nature; sending sexually explicit messages; and requests for sex or repeated unwanted requests to go out on dates, among other things.\u000a\u000a"We must and we will do better," said Professor Brian Schmidt, the vice-chancellor of the Australian National University.\u000a\u000a'Too prevalent'\u000a\u000aJenkins said the report contained three important findings: that sexual assault and harassment are "far too prevalent in university settings," that the problem is under reported and that universities need to do more to stymie it.\u000a\u000aOther countries have drawn similar conclusions when it comes to the issue of sexual assault and harassment on campus, though the numbers may differ per country.\u000a\u000aA groundbreaking 2015 study by the Association of American Universities (AAU) found that 23% of women said they experienced some form of unwanted sexual contact -- ranging from kissing to touching to rape, carried out by force or threat of force, or while they were incapacitated because of alcohol and drugs. Nearly 11% said the unwanted contact included penetration or oral sex.\u000a\u000aA 2016 report by the Universities UK said "on sexual violence explicitly, there is no comprehensive data available to indicate how many UK university students are affected by such incidents," but the British media have tried to uncover the scope of the issue. The Telegraph reported in 2015 that as many as one in three women may be abused or assaulted on campus.\u000a\u000aMy statement on the @AusHumanRights survey on sexual assault and harassment @uniaus #RespectNowAlways pic.twitter.com/6beKzYmHL2 \u2014 Simon Birmingham (@Birmo) August 1, 2017\u000a\u000aRape culture?\u000a\u000aOf the students who said they'd been assaulted, 1.6% were sexually assaulted in a university setting. Australia's legal code generally defines sexual assault as sexual intercourse or sexual penetration (including oral sex) without consent, according to the report.\u000a\u000aForty percent of students who were sexually assaulted at school setting did not report the most recent incident because they did not think it was serious enough to merit it. Another 40% said they didn't need help, the report said.\u000a\u000aStudent representatives said universities could have acted earlier to combat sexual harassment and violence.\u000a\u000a"Universities have helped rape culture flourish on and off campus. Vice Chancellors need to own up and apologize for not protecting us, for letting perpetrators off the hook while we are left to drop out of university," said Abby Stapleton of the Australian National Union of Students Women's Office and a student at Monash University.\u000a\u000a"This report release is monumental for students everywhere, universities can no longer get away with silencing us, our experiences are reflected in the data ...

aVSandakan, Sabah, Malaysia (CNN) With his wire-rimmed glasses and mild manner, Siew Te Wong could be described as a Malaysian Clark Kent.\u000a\u000aThis wildlife biologist is a Superman of sorts -- a tireless defender of the world's smallest bear species: the sun bear.\u000a\u000a"I often call the sun bear a forgotten species," Wong said. "When I first started, 20 years ago, no one has ever studied sun bears. Most people do not know that they even exist."\u000a\u000aAs he studied the animal and realized the threats it faced from deforestation and hunting/poaching, he knew the bears were in serious trouble.\u000a\u000a"The more I learn about them, the more I care. The more I care, the more I worry," he said. "I have to help them."\u000a\u000aToday, Wong's nonprofit, the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, is the only sun bear sanctuary in the world.\u000a\u000aWong -- known as "Papa Bear" -- and his team have rehabilitated and cared for 55 rescued sun bears since 2008. The group now also educates the public about these animals.\u000a\u000aSun bears are found in the rainforests of south Asia, and the small bears play a big role in keeping these woodlands healthy. Many plants and animals depend on them to spread seeds, create nesting sites and control the termite population -- functions that keep the ecosystems in balance. Healthy rainforests provide clean air and water to the entire world.\u000a\u000aBut the sun bear population has decreased by 30% during the last three decades. In 2007, the bear was officially classified as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u000a\u000aCurrently, 44 sun bears live at Wong's center -- all of them were orphaned by poachers or rescued from captivity. The center has also become one of the leading tourist destinations in the area, helping to raise awareness about the sun bear's plight.\u000a\u000aA sun bear explores the forest at the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre.\u000a\u000a"They can see how special the sun bear is and learn about how their survival (is) important to ours," Wong said, "so they can take some action when they go back to home."\u000a\u000aFor Wong, this work is simply his responsibility.\u000a\u000a"Sun bears became part of my family. When they're endangered, I care for them. When they are in trouble, I speak for them," he said. "I want to be the voice for the sun bear, to fight for the sun bear, to ensure the survival of the sun bear."\u000a\u000a"But my ultimate goal is to save the entire forest ecosystem ... that is so important to the survival of mankind."\u000a\u000aCNN spoke with Wong about his work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did you get involved with the sun bear?\u000a\u000aSiew Te Wong: I grew up keeping different pets and rescuing birds that fell from nests. I always wanted to be an animal expert or a veterinarian. After high school, I went to Taiwan to study veterinary science, and that's where I got involved with studying wildlife. In 1994, I came to the University of Montana to study wildlife biology and I met a professor, Christopher Servheen. He was looking for a Malaysian student to do a study on sun bears. I said, "I'm your man!"\u000a\u000aCNN: Tell me more about the threats these animals face.\u000a\u000aWong: Over the last 50 years, many of the tropical forests in this region have been cleared, and with deforestation, sun bears have lost their habitat. And even though sun bears are a protected species, they are hunted for their meat and their body parts, which are used in traditional Asian medicines. This is literally wiping out local populations.\u000a\u000aTheir babies are also kept as illegal pets. Their cubs are really cute, but people don't realize that this baby bear will turn into a destructive beast. In the end, they will either kill the bears or lock (them) in small cages. We are doing lots of educational awareness to make sure that people don't keep bears anymore.\u000a\u000aCNN: How do the animals spend their time at the center?\u000a\u000aWong: Every day after breakfast, we release the bears into the forest enclosure. This is where they learn to forage, climb trees, build nests and socialize. All of those activities help them get ready to be released and survive in the forest.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Siew Te Wong: Sun bears are not pets Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Siew Te Wong: Sun bears are not pets 02:43\u000a\u000aAt 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., we give the bears different fruits, and at 4pm, the bears come back and have dinner in the bear house. We keep them inside at night because this level of bear density in the forest is not natural. We also want to monitor their well-being. However, there are a few bears left out for the night, which is good. One day, they will live there all the time.\u000a\u000aCNN: How many bears have you been able to release?\u000a\u000aWong: We have released two bears so far, and this year we plan to release four more. There are many bears that we cannot release because they were in captivity for a long time. They lost their instinct to find food, they're habituated to people, and many that were rescued as adults cannot climb trees. There are also bears who (were) malnourished or who had their claws chopped off.

aVS.E. Cupp is the author of "Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity," co-author of "Why You're Wrong About the Right" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.\u000a\u000aBoston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.\u000a\u000aUntil I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.\u000a\u000aI'd always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn't decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I'd ever endured.\u000a\u000aThe pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally -- it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)\u000a\u000aThe pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It's why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It's why I didn't tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he'd spare my next effort.\u000a\u000aAs Marion Underwood and Robert Faris' excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.\u000a\u000a"Even before the dawn of social media," they write, "adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist."\u000a\u000aSo true. I can't imagine my 13-year-old self, naïve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today's unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.\u000a\u000aBut while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to "go viral") were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think 02:10\u000a\u000aNow that I'm a parent of a 10-month-old son, I'm clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents -- especially as parents were either bullies or bullied -- is what kind of kids do we want to raise?\u000a\u000aI could be honest and tell you I've had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a "socially-adept" child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn't the target of bullying. But we've had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.\u000a\u000aLooking back on my difficult year, I'm not sure I'd wish I could have been popular. I do wish I'd been a little more secure.\u000a\u000aI'm also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It's anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won't be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.\u000a\u000aI think I'm pretty tough. Mine wouldn't be the best job -- regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) -- if I had thin skin.\u000a\u000aThere's name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there's stuff you don't prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.\u000a\u000aWhen we talk about bullying, it's hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that's among the adults!).\u000a\u000aOf course, we're tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to "just ignore them" rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.\u000a\u000aAs difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it's also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.\u000a\u000aBeing 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn't necessarily be that it gets better -- adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It's that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you.

aVIs It Time to Try a Single-Tablet Regimen for HIV? By Mamta Jain, MD\u000a\u000aWas this helpful? ( 2 )\u000a\u000aTreatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the last few decades is heralded as one of the great medical advancements of our time. Once considered a virtual death sentence, HIV patients can now expect to live a near-normal lifespan of approximately 70 years--if they adhere to their HIV treatment regimen. This can be quite challenging, though, since patients may have to take multiple pills throughout the day. That\u2019s why the new single-tablet regimen--taking just one pill, once a day--is such an exciting advancement.\u000a\u000aTreating HIV: We\u2019ve Come a Long Way\u000a\u000aIn my career, I\u2019ve watched the landscape of the HIV epidemic change radically, and I\u2019ve seen the way we treat HIV patients change dramatically too. When I was in training, most people with HIV required multiple pills, called antiretroviral therapies, taken several times a day to keep the virus at bay. These drugs often had a lot of unpleasant side effects. For instance, we often had to add an antidiarrheal medication to the patient\u2019s list of medications because we knew the regimen would cause diarrhea. These medications worked, but they weren\u2019t easy to take because the regimens were so complicated.\u000a\u000a2017 Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. All rights reserved. May not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOver time, these combination therapies became even more effective and simpler to take with fewer side effects. However, adhering to treatment plans was still a major issue for patients because they were still on complicated regimens that required taking multiple pills at different times of day. Medical professionals have learned, like with any chronic or infectious disease, being able to take just one pill once a day increases the likelihood that a patient will stick to his or her treatment plan. And in the early 2000s, combining multiple medications into a single tablet revolutionized the way we treat HIV. In many cases, the single pill drugs were more effective and less toxic, and patients were relieved of the burden of taking multiple pills in a day.\u000a\u000aCompliance Is Crucial\u000a\u000aWhile medication compliance is important for treating any condition, it\u2019s absolutely crucial for treating HIV. The HIV virus replicates extremely quickly, can change form in the body, and can quickly become resistant to medications if they\u2019re not taken consistently. In fact, even missing one day of virus-suppressing medication can cause the virus to become resistant to that particular treatment. If you become resistant to one treatment, there may be other drugs that work, but your treatment options will be very limited.\u000a\u000aHowever, failed compliance isn\u2019t always caused by forgetfulness. In fact, I\u2019ve seen patients who are typically very good about following their multiple-pill treatment routine, but then their prescription refill lapses, so they take only two of the three pills needed to fight the virus. While this seems like the best course of action at the time--taking some instead of none--it\u2019s actually more harmful than not taking any of the pills until the prescription is filled.\u000a\u000aBecause it makes taking medication easier, the one tablet regimen significantly reduces the risk of developing drug resistance and puts less of a burden on the patient. I\u2019ve been amazed at the effectiveness of the new drugs developed to treat HIV and how easy it is to take them.\u000a\u000aSwitching to a Single Pill Drug Therapy: What to Know\u000a\u000aThere are several reasons you may want to switch to a single-tablet regimen. You may have been on a multiple pill treatment plan for your HIV for a long time and are doing just fine with your current routine. However, we\u2019ve learned some older regimens for HIV treatment can cause long-term toxicity to the body that can lead to chronic health issues. Mild toxicity might result in rashes and moderate-to-severe toxicity side effects could include pancreatitis, a disease in which the pancreas becomes inflamed, and drug-induced hepatitis, a disease that infects the liver. If you\u2019re concerned about these side effects, have a discussion with your physician to review other options.\u000a\u000aTHIS CONTENT DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.

aV(CNN) By the end of the century, two out of three people living in Europe will be affected by heat waves, coastal floods and other weather-related disasters, largely due to global warming and climate change, according to a study published Friday in the journal Lancet Planetary Health .\u000a\u000aThat's 350 million people in 31 countries subjected to an increased risk of death and health hazards.\u000a\u000aOverall, weather-related disasters are expected to cause 152,000 deaths a year in Europe between 2071 and 2100, jumping from 3,000 weather disaster-related deaths a year between 1981 and 2010.\u000a\u000aThe researchers estimate that 99% of future weather-related deaths will be due to heat waves. That could very well cause a spike in cardiovascular disease, stroke and respiratory diseases, the researchers suggested.\u000a\u000a"This should be considered in light of the devastating effects of the 2003 European and 2010 Russian heat waves, where thousands died. The thought of such events occurring more frequently is frightening," said Andrew Grundstein, a professor with the University of Georgia's Department of Geography who was not affiliated with the new study.\u000a\u000aSouthern Europe is likely to be hit the hardest, based on projections for heat waves and droughts. Almost everyone living in Italy, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia would be affected by weather-related disasters, causing 700 deaths per 1 million people annually.\u000a\u000aBy comparison, one out of three people will be affected every year in northern Europe: Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden.\u000a\u000aOther than heat-related deaths, annual coastal flooding-related deaths will rise from six to 233 by the end of the century. Droughts could also reduce the water needed for food production and basic needs for 138 million people, the researchers said.\u000a\u000aPrevious studies have pointed to population growth, urbanization and migration as drivers of disaster risk in the future.\u000a\u000a"Our results show that for the future, climate change will likely be the dominant driver of the projected trends, accounting for more than 90% of the rise in risk to population," said Giovanni Forzieri of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, lead author of the new study. "Population changes such as growth, migration and urbanization will account for the remaining 10%."\u000a\u000aEurope is expected to face major changes in the frequency of multiple climate extremes over the coming decades, Forzieri said.\u000a\u000aTo understand the future effects of extreme weather, the researchers combined projections on climate change and population growth with 2,300 records from 1981 to 2010 that identified disasters and death tolls across countries.\u000a\u000aThe disaster records also helped the researchers determine "human vulnerability" -- the relationship between weather exposure and how it affects humans -- to seven weather-related disasters: heat waves, cold waves, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal flooding and windstorms.\u000a\u000a"This study shows that, unless global warming is curbed as a matter of urgency and appropriate adaptation measures are taken, about 350 million Europeans could be exposed to harmful climate extremes on an annual basis by the end of this century, with a 50-times increase in fatalities compared with now," Forzieri said.\u000a\u000aThe study was funded by the European Commission and conducted by researchers with expertise in climate sciences and human geography from the Joint Research Centre. The Joint Research Centre provides scientific advice for the European Commission and "support to EU policy."\u000a\u000aWhile cold waves are expected to decrease due to the estimated rise in global temperature, that doesn't compensate for the increases in deaths due to heat waves, coastal and river flooding, wildfires, windstorms and droughts, according to the study. These disasters can also cause direct injuries.\u000a\u000a"It is critical to remember that the number of deaths from heat far outweigh the decrease in deaths due to lack of cold," said Sean Sublette, a meteorologist at the nonprofit Climate Central, who did not participate in the study. "By the end of the century, the number of deaths per year due to cold is estimated to be less than 10 per year, while the number of deaths per year from heat is estimated at 151,500."\u000a\u000aThe study estimates did not factor in reductions of greenhouse gas emissions or policy improvements. This "business as usual" emissions scenario is the closest to reality, Sublette said, but a lower emissions scenario should also be studied for comparison.\u000a\u000aThe results provide a baseline outcome that could be shifted by adaptations like more air conditioning or new hazard warning systems that may increase resilience, Grundstein said.\u000a\u000a"The study does not take into consideration advances in medical technology or the increasing installation of air conditioning, as air conditioning in Europe is currently far less prevalent than in the United States," Sublette said. "However, this also serves as a reminder that those of lower economic status will struggle the most with the heat tied to climate change, as air conditioning may not be accessible. Heat will also be worse in the urban areas."\u000a\u000aThe study also looked at weather hazards as independent from each other, rather than the possibility that they may be combined, according to a letter accompanying the study, written by Jae Young Lee and Ho Kim of Seoul National University.\u000a\u000aBut experts agree that the study's findings will be helpful for those involved in urban planning or policy-making in an effort to slow and mitigate climate change.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aForzieri and his colleagues believe that their study is relevant to priorities outlined in the Paris Agreement, the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the European Union Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change.\u000a\u000a"Land use and city planning can play an important role in achievement of a healthy, carbon-neutral and resilient society," Forzieri said. "They offer strategies to curtail energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, such as reduction of urban sprawl and automobile dependence, and are, in many instances, the most effective tools for reduction of the number of human beings exposed and their vulnerability to extreme weather events."

aVCNN\u2019s FAREED ZAKARIA GPS featured an exclusive interview with Secretary of State John Kerry discussing the U.S. participation in the upcoming COP21 Climate Change Conference in Paris. This interview was taped in the Benjamin Franklin Room at the State Department on Thursday, Nov. 12.\u000a\u000aMANDATORY CREDIT for reference and usage: \u201cCNN\u2019s FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\u201d\u000a\u000aHIGHLIGHT\u000a\u000aSecretary Kerry on advance target setting prior to the upcoming multinational summit on climate change in Paris\u000a\u000aNow that's why President Obama reached an agreement with President Xi - a ground-breaking, historic agreement - to join together to announce the intended emissions reductions that both countries would make as part of the Paris negotiations in hopes of inspiring other countries to do the same. Well, guess what? Now over 150 countries have announced their targets for emissions reductions, including India. Now, they're not enough yet and - for - by anybody - we've all got to move more\u2026.\u000a\u000aTRANSCRIPT\u000a\u000aTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\u000a\u000aFAREED ZAKARIA, HOST: Let me ask you about climate change, Mr. Secretary. You are embarking on a big push for the Paris summit. You gave a speech this week. In that speech, you were very eloquent in criticizing critics in the United States who are still skeptical about climate change.\u000a\u000aBut what do you say to those who say, look, that's all well and good, but the real skeptics, in a sense, are countries like India and Indonesia and, to an extent, even China, despite some changes, that still continue to use massive amounts of coal, emit huge amounts of carbon dioxide; and that whatever the United States or Western - or Europe may do, that's the real problem; and in those countries, they want to develop, they're not going to stop themselves from developing; the Paris treaty is not legally binding; so we will just cripple ourselves without doing much for climate change?\u000a\u000aJOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, Fareed, that's the challenge. And it doesn't make a lot of sense to develop and kill yourself as you do it. It - you know, we've learned lessons about the downsides of the way in which we have produced energy - electricity and power and transportation and so forth - over centuries now. And we have to move to a low-carbon economy, all of us.\u000a\u000aIf the United States, all by itself, tomorrow, were to drive, you know, carpool to work and bicycle to work and plant a bunch of trees and lower our emissions to zero, we can't solve the problem alone. India, China, every country in the world has to be part of it.\u000a\u000aNow that's why President Obama reached an agreement with President Xi - a ground-breaking, historic agreement - to join together to announce the intended emissions reductions that both countries would make as part of the Paris negotiations in hopes of inspiring other countries to do the same.\u000a\u000aWell, guess what? Now over 150 countries have announced their targets for emissions reductions, including India.\u000a\u000aNow, they're not enough yet and - for - by anybody - we've all got to move more. But if we come together in Paris - and I believe we can and hopefully will - to have an ambitious set of targets that we will all try to reach - not, you know - that we all agree to voluntarily try to reach - that will be an incredible signal to the marketplace, which already is seeing investment move into clean, alternative renewable different kinds of energy production. The solution to climate change is energy policy.\u000a\u000aSo it's a question of what choices we need to make in order to preserve our ability on this planet to produce food, to have water, to live where people live today without massive dislocations of human beings, without massive damage from intensified storms and wildfires and droughts, and all of the downsides that we're already beginning to measure.\u000a\u000aSo this is actually opportunity, not downside. And I think Paris will help define the full breadth of that opportunity. There\u2019s going to be trillions of dollars that will be invested in these new lower-carbon energy sources, and I think it's going - it can - has the chance of transforming everybody's economy for the better.\u000a\u000aZAKARIA: But Mr. Secretary, these countries are announcing these limits - none of it is legally binding, because the treaty is not legally binding.\u000a\u000aKERRY: Well, first of all, it's not a treaty, but it - there could be parts of it that are going to be legally binding. The targets themselves may not be. That, you know, is yet to be determined.\u000a\u000aI recently made a comment about this, and people said, well the whole thing is not going to be legally binding. That's not accurate. There could be parts of it - the transparency, the accountability, the further down the road - I mean, there are different things.\u000a\u000aAll of that has yet to be decided. That will be decided in Paris.\u000a\u000aZAKARIA: Mr. Secretary, pleasure to have you on, sir.\u000a\u000aKERRY: Thank you.\u000a\u000a### END ###

aVFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The calamity that has befallen the people of Syria has put the entire world to shame. The image of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi lying facedown on a beach, dead, after his family sought to escape the horrors of their country's civil war , has touched the world. But compassion without action is pointless.\u000a\u000aThousands of refugees are battling European governments. Today, it's Hungary . Last month, it was Macedonia . Desperate people are paying thousands of dollars to traffickers to take them to safety; scores have died of asphyxia after being locked in trucks that failed to reach their destination; thousands have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.\u000a\u000aWe are living in the worst refugee crisis since World War II , and yet the truth is that world leaders have failed to manage the crisis. They will, of course, answer to history. But in the meantime, the situation will only become worse without drastic action: More will die, more refugees will arrive unwanted, more countries will become destabilized and, if this goes on much longer, we will have a generation of Syrians who have grown up in the kind of conditions that perpetuate conflict.\u000a\u000aIt is too late to prevent the current crisis, but there is plenty we can try to do moving forward to try to ease it.\u000a\u000aWhat exactly?\u000a\u000aFor a start, world leaders should convene a top-level emergency gathering to focus on the key aspects of this crisis. The conference should be called by a group of countries, including Germany with strong backing from the United States, and should include the European Union, the United Nations and other world powers, Syria's neighbors, and also Russia and China. The objective should be threefold: to stop the killing, to help the refugees and to bring an end to the war.\u000a\u000aArab nations must play a major role in addressing the Syrian crisis. We are all responsible. But the people of Syria are their neighbors, their brethren. The conflict is in their midst, its impact close to home. To be sure, the neighborhood has not completely failed Syrian refugees. The overwhelming majority of those who have fled Syria -- millions of them -- are now living in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and Arab states have helped finance those costs. But more is needed.\u000a\u000aOnce convened, this international conference should work to develop a comprehensive international plan to help refugees, one that involves a much greater role for Arab and other Muslim states. Indeed, wealthy Gulf states should be encouraged to not just make an outsize financial contribution, but countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia should be pressed to welcome refugees.\u000a\u000aOf course, Europe and the United States should also receive more from among the millions of desperate Syrian refugees fleeing conflict. But so should thriving Muslim states such as Malaysia, Indonesia and of course Iran, whose support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad means it has additional moral responsibility for what is happening. (And speaking of Asia, this could be an opportunity for a country like Japan, with its demographic crisis, to boost its population, or at least do its part to share the burden of this major humanitarian emergency.)\u000a\u000aBut giving refuge to those who are fleeing the horrors of conflict is not enough -- the crisis also needs to be tackled at its source. So, to at least try to slow the killing, it is time to give serious consideration to the establishment of safe zones inside Syria, a proposal that is actually more complicated than it might sound.\u000a\u000aFor example, when Turkey proposed such an approach , some feared that it secretly planned to expel Syrian refugees from Turkish territory and send them back inside Syria to any safe zones. If the system is to work, these zones must come with an ironclad vow from countries hosting refugees not to force anyone to return to Syria before the war is over.\u000a\u000aSafe zones will, of course, require a military commitment to be effective, perhaps from the United States, NATO and other allies, to guarantee the "safe" in "safe zones." They will therefore need to become no-fly zones, with air patrols and anti-aircraft support on the ground. The betrayal of so-called safe areas in Bosnia's Srebrenica must never be allowed to happen again.\u000a\u000aAbove all, though, it is imperative to bring an end to the war, to defeat ISIS and -- just as crucially, although this point now often gets overlooked -- to bring an end to the regime of al-Assad, whose rejection of peaceful demands for democratic reform laid the groundwork for this epic human displacement and for the upsurge in extremism.\u000a\u000aAnd epic this displacement has truly been -- more than 320,000 people have been killed in the war, according to one monitoring group , and there is no end in sight. Before the war started in 2011, about 23 million people lived in Syria. Fully half of them have been displaced. Some 7.5 million are internally displaced . More than 4 million are registered with the United Nations, and many of those fleeing have not been. It is estimated that there are almost 2 million Syrian refugees in Turkey , at least 600,000 in Jordan and perhaps 1.1 million in Lebanon, where they now make up nearly a quarter of the total population.\u000a\u000aSuch an enormous movement of people is further destabilizing an already unsettled region, and bringing with it a level of disruption that could very well sow the seeds for another generation of conflict and extremism.\u000a\u000aThe West's initial approach, which effectively viewed the Syrian civil war as "their problem," has merely underscored how in reality there is no way to contain such conflicts within national boundaries -- this war has spawned ISIS, its videotaped beheadings and sanctioned sexual slavery , scattering its poisonous extremist ideology far and wide. And while an international gathering cannot undo the devastation that has been wrought, it can still be a positive first step toward winding down this conflict.\u000a\u000aThis is the moral and strategic challenge of our time. So far, the world has failed. But if its leaders can begin to publicly and materially empower those who stand for a pluralistic, tolerant and democratic Syria -- one that will eventually welcome back the millions of citizens who have fled -- then we might be able to turn the compassion we have seen in recent days into a more hopeful legacy for the country and its people.

aV(CNN) As a nurse practitioner, Wanda Liddell knew it was a medical emergency when she saw one of her patients struggling to breathe last month. But in her backcountry town of Cross City, Florida, the ambulance took 30 minutes to arrive. Even worse, it was another 45 miles to the nearest hospital.\u000a\u000aLiddell faces this situation often and always wonders, what if?\u000a\u000aShe is one of many medical providers working in towns 30 miles or more from a hospital, a distance that can make the difference between life or death.\u000a\u000aThe recent debates over the Affordable Health Care Act raised concerns that millions of Americans could lose access to health care. But already, there are many Americans who live in areas where critical-care services are lacking.\u000a\u000aA recent study estimates that nearly 30 million Americans don't live within an hour of trauma care. And a CNN analysis found that residents living in 16% of the mainland United States are 30 miles or more away from the nearest hospital.\u000a\u000aDr. Jeremy Brown, director of the National Institute of Health's Office of Emergency Care Research, said treatments for heart attacks and strokes are most effective when done quickly.\u000a\u000a"Every minute that you can get the patient into treatment sooner will represent some brain cells that are saved," he said.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the rate of accidental deaths -- adjusted for age -- was nearly 50% higher in rural versus urban areas from 1999 to 2015, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says distance to emergency rooms was a key factor\u000a\u000aThe problem has been exacerbated as rural hospitals struggle to stay open. Since 2010, 81 rural hospitals have closed in the United States, according to a rural health research program at the University of North Carolina. Another 673 rural hospitals are vulnerable to shutting down.\u000a\u000aAreas without hospitals are called "hospital deserts." The deserts are biggest in Western states. In Nevada, for instance, there are only 13 hospitals providing critical-care services to rural areas.\u000a\u000aThe 2,400 residents of Tonopah, Nevada, who live halfway between Las Vegas and Reno, must travel more than 100 miles to get to a hospital. It was one of the most extreme examples that CNN found outside of Alaska.\u000a\u000aJessica Thompson, a registered nurse there, has family roots in the community dating back more than a century.\u000a\u000a"I've been told multiple times that's what I get for (choosing) to live in rural Nevada and that really upsets me, because that isn't the choice I made. I was born in a hospital and I had a hospital my entire life up until two years ago," she said.\u000a\u000aJessica Thompson, registered nurse\u000a\u000aIn 2015, the town's only hospital, Nye Regional Medical Center, closed after years of financial problems . The nearest hospital, Mount Grant General Hospital in Hawthorne, is 104 miles northwest.\u000a\u000aThompson worked at the hospital before it closed. She said the loss of the hospital was devastating, evoking lots of emotion.\u000a\u000a"People angry, people sad, people scared," she said. "You know the fear of, 'Will I make it to another facility if something bad happens?' "\u000a\u000aIrene Carlyle said she and her husband moved from Los Angeles in 2005, hoping to stay in Tonopah. But now she doesn't know if that will happen.\u000a\u000a"We're both on Medicare," she said. "I said (to my husband), 'You know, at some point, we're going to have to move.' It's going to come. I mean at some point you get sick."\u000a\u000aLast year, the nonprofit Renown Medical Group began leasing space to provide primary care services, but for now, there are no immediate urgent care options.\u000a\u000aOther parts of the country are dealing with similar problems, including pockets of Florida, Texas and New York.\u000a\u000aThe closed Nye Regional Medical Center is seen on Friday, Nov. 18, 2016, in Tonopah, Nevada.\u000a\u000aA report last year by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation predicts that the problem will worsen as more rural hospitals are likely to shut down. This is in part because rural towns are losing population and becoming poorer.\u000a\u000aRepublican hopes to repeal and replace Obamacare could make the problem much worse, experts say, if millions of American lose their health insurance. That would put even more pressure on rural hospitals.\u000a\u000aSome in Congress have proposed efforts to try to save rural hospitals. A bipartisan group of senators led by Iowa Republican Charles Grassley introduced a bill that would change Medicare rules to allow rural hospitals to have an emergency room and outpatient care, without the need for hospital beds.\u000a\u000a"A car accident or a heart attack is dangerous under the best of circumstances, but it's a lot more dangerous for someone who's far away from an emergency room," Grassley said. "When a rural hospital closes, its emergency room closes with it."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThompson, the nurse in Tonopah, believes something needs to be done.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot of people out in the rural community who feel like they've been forgotten," she said.

aVRepublicans in Congress have long vowed that they can make health care more affordable and accessible. Americans will now see if they can keep that promise.\u000a\u000aLawmakers have spent hours upon hours debating the GOP's Obamacare repeal bill, deflecting Democrats' attempt to delay the plan's advancement. Two House committees approved the bill on Thursday after marathon hearings.\u000a\u000aWhile the bill will likely change a lot before it lands on President Trump's desk, it's already possible to identify some winners and losers in the individual market and Medicaid.\u000a\u000aRelated: Republicans unveil bill to repeal and replace Obamacare\u000a\u000aTitled the American Health Care Act, the legislation calls for providing refundable tax credits based on a person's age and income. It keeps the Obamacare protections for those with pre-existing conditions, but it allows insurers to levy a 30% surcharge for a year on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse. It lifts the taxes that Obamacare had imposed on the wealthy, insurers and prescription drug manufacturers. And it loosens one of the law's strict insurance reforms so that carriers can offer a wider array of policies that pick up less of the tab for getting care.\u000a\u000aThe bill also eliminates the enhanced federal match for Medicaid expansion starting in 2020 and revamps the funding for the entire Medicaid program.\u000a\u000aRepublican lawmakers have repeatedly skirted criticisms that the bill will likely leave millions uninsured, but reviews of preliminary drafts by the Congressional Budget Office confirmed the problem, sources said. Also, a recent S&P Global report estimated that up to 10 million people could lose their coverage.\u000a\u000a"With Medicaid reductions and smaller tax credits, this bill would clearly result in fewer people insured than under the ACA," said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "The House GOP proposal seeks to reduce what the federal government spends on health care, and that inevitably means more people uninsured."\u000a\u000aExperts remain divided over the impact on the individual market. Some say insurers would flee or jack up their rates if millions of people drop out. Others contend that the Republican bill would stabilize the market and premiums because the reforms would give insurers more flexibility and entice more younger enrollees to sign up for coverage.\u000a\u000a"If we let the ACA continue on its current trajectory, people really will lose coverage," said Doug Badger, senior fellow at the Galen Institute, a free-market, health-care think tank.\u000a\u000aHere's who would likely lose under the Republican plan:\u000a\u000aLower-income folks could be left uninsured\u000a\u000aObamacare contains many provisions to help poor and lower-income Americans. It expanded Medicaid to cover adults who earn up to $16,400 a year -- some 11 million people in 31 states and the District of Columbia are now insured as a result.\u000a\u000aAlso, those with incomes just under $30,000 receive generous subsidies to lower their premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs on the individual market.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would reverse much of this. It would end the enhanced federal Medicaid funding for new enrollees starting in 2020. Those already in the program could stay as long as they remain continuously insured. But since up to half have a break in coverage each year, it's likely participation would fall off quickly, said Jocelyn Guyer, managing director at Manatt Health, a consulting firm.\u000a\u000aBut the Republican bill would go beyond just eliminating Medicaid expansion. It would overhaul the whole program, which covers more than 70 million people, by sending states a fixed amount of money per enrollee, known as a per-capita cap. This would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. However, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments.\u000a\u000aRelated: Higher-income Americans win under Republican plan to repeal Obamacare\u000a\u000aAll this could hurt not only poor adults, but also low-income children, women, senior citizens and the disabled.\u000a\u000aThe legislation also would eliminate the subsidies that reduce deductibles and co-pays for moderate-income policyholders on the individual market. And the tax credits it would provide would not go as far Obamacare's subsidies.\u000a\u000aFolks making $20,000 a year take the biggest hit at any age under the GOP plan, a recent Kaiser study found. A 27-year-old would get only $2,000, instead of $3,225 under Obamacare, on average, while a 40-year-old would get $3,000 versus nearly $4,150.\u000a\u000aHowever, the biggest loser would be a 60-year-old, who would receive only $4,000, instead of nearly $9,900 under Obamacare.\u000a\u000aOlder Americans could have to pay more\u000a\u000aEnrollees in their 50s and early 60s benefited from Obamacare because insurers could only charge them three times more than younger policy holders. The bill would widen that band to five-to-one.\u000a\u000aThat would mean that adults ages 60 to 64 would see their annual premiums soar 22%, or nearly $3,200, to nearly $18,000, according to a study by the Milliman actuarial firm on behalf of the AARP Public Policy Institute. Those in their 50s would be hit with a 13% increase, or just over $1,500, and pay an annual premium of $12,800.\u000a\u000aAlso, the GOP bill doesn't provide them as generous tax credits as Obamacare. A 60-year-old making $40,000 would get only $4,000 from the Republican plan, instead of an average subsidy of $6,750 from the Affordable Care Act, according the Kaiser study.\u000a\u000aThe sick could get coverage, but it could be more limited\u000a\u000aThe GOP plan actually provides stronger protections for those with pre-existing conditions than some prior Republican proposals. Like Obamacare, it requires insurers cover these folks and prevents carriers from charging them more because of their health.\u000a\u000aBut the Republican plan would lift the requirement that insurers cover a certain share of the cost of getting care. This change would allow carriers to offer a wider selection of policies, including more with higher deductibles and co-pays. That could make it more difficult to find plans with low deductibles that the sick often want.\u000a\u000a(However, the bill does not lift the Obamacare provision that limits how much enrollees have to pay out of pocket each year. For this year, the maximum is $7,150.)\u000a\u000aHere's who would likely win:\u000a\u000aYounger Americans could get cheaper plans\u000a\u000aObamacare was designed so that younger policyholders would help subsidize older ones. That would change under the Republican bill because it would allow insurers to charge older folks more.\u000a\u000aThis means that younger Americans would likely see their annual premiums go down. Enrollees age 20 to 29 would save about $700 a year to $4,000, on average, according to the Milliman study for the AARP.\u000a\u000aRelated: Full text: GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare\u000a\u000aThose under age 30 would also get a refundable tax credit of up to $2,000 to offset the cost of their premiums, as long as their income doesn't exceed $215,000 for an individual. It's more likely that younger folks who are earlier in their careers would fall under this cap.\u000a\u000aThe GOP tax credits would also likely be more generous than Obamacare's subsidies for these folks. For example, a 27-year-old making $40,000 a year would receive $2,000 under the GOP plan, but only gets a $103 subsidy from Obamacare, on average, a Kaiser analysis found.\u000a\u000aAlso, the bill keeps the Obamacare provision that lets young adults up to age 26 stay on their parents' insurance plan.\u000a\u000aThe healthy could buy less expensive policies\u000a\u000aUnder Obamacare, only enrollees under age 30 and certain other people could buy catastrophic plans, which had lower monthly premiums but higher deductibles. In 2017, catastrophic plans came with $7,150 deductibles, but Obamacare enrollees couldn't use subsides to pay the premiums.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would open up such policies to everyone and allow enrollees to use tax credits.\u000a\u000aThis change, however, may not have as big an impact since insurers already offer plans with high deductibles that are eligible for Obamacare subsidies. Republicans dropped a provision from a prior draft that would have allowed carriers to sell policies that covered fewer benefits, such as maternity and prescription drugs. That would have made more of a difference for healthy consumers because they could opt for skimpier plans with lower premiums.\u000a\u000aHigher-income Americans could get tax breaks and perks\u000a\u000aThe legislation would eliminate two taxes that Obamacare levied on the wealthy to help pay for the law. Nearly everyone in the Top 1%, who earn more than $774,000 a year, would enjoy a hefty tax cut, averaging $33,000, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. Those in the Top 0.1% would get an average tax cut of about $197,000.\u000a\u000aAnd the bill would allow folks to contribute more to Health Savings Accounts, which are primarily used by better-off Americans who can afford to sock money away for health care expenses.\u000a\u000aAlso, the Republicans would enable people higher on the income scale to claim the tax credit to help pay their premiums. Under Obamacare, an enrollee who makes more than $47,500 is no longer eligible for a subsidy. The GOP plan would let a policyholder making up to $75,000 claim the full tax credit. The benefit would phase out slowly until the enrollee hits $215,000 in income.\u000a\u000aInsurance companies could get a big tax break\u000a\u000aObamacare allowed insurance companies to deduct only $500,000 of their executives' pay as a business expense. The GOP bill would repeal that limitation, starting in 2018.\u000a\u000aTop insurers pay their leaders millions in compensation every year so this provision could mean a nice tax savings for the companies.\u000a\u000aCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated that the bill would allow insurers to sell plans without Obamacare's required health benefits, such as maternity and prescription drugs.

aVWashington (CNN) President Donald Trump's turbulent few weeks at home -- the palace intrigue of White House rivalries, sudden departures and legislative defeats -- have been echoed by a brewing storm of challenges overseas.\u000a\u000aOne set of problems may be affecting the other, analysts say.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is launching missiles designed to reach the US; Moscow is forcing a drastic reduction in US diplomatic staff in Russia; Venezuela is wracked by violence as its democracy dies; and Iran has been expanding its reach in Syria and Iraq.\u000a\u000aThese situations have been festering as the President, in his first seven months, has gone through two chiefs of staff, two national security advisers, two communications directors, one FBI director, a deepening investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia and a struggle to advance his domestic agenda.\u000a\u000aRumors that Trump would also like to replace his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have gained enough traction that lawmakers are publicly warning him against it. They've already moved to curtail his ability to independently ease sanctions on Russia.\u000a\u000aSome analysts say the President's difficulties at home are seen by foreign leaders as a sign of weakness -- prompting tests from adversaries like North Korea and Iran, and end-runs from allies who are now spending more time and energy appealing to Congress or directly to states on issues like climate change or NAFTA renegotiation.\u000a\u000a"People abroad see the defeat on the Russia sanctions bill, they see the defeat on health care and they come to the conclusion that this guy is very weak," said Daniel Serwer, director of the Conflict Management Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Relations.\u000a\u000aSerwer said Trump is proving to be "a terrible negotiator" on the international stage, giving rivals like China and Russia concessions without getting returns.\u000a\u000aOthers say Trump is making concrete progress, comparing him favorably to President Barack Obama as the US-led coalition makes progress in the fight against ISIS and builds up its military presence along the border with Russia.\u000a\u000a"Things are moving in the right direction," said Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation. He added that many of the challenges facing the President, including getting China to apply greater pressure to North Korea, are deeply complex.\u000a\u000aThe White House didn't return calls for comment about Trump's foreign policy slate, but Trump himself offered assurances at his second full Cabinet meeting on Monday.\u000a\u000a"North Korea, Middle East, lots of problems that we inherited from previous administration, but we will take care of them," the President said. "We will take care of them very well. But overall I think we are doing incredibly well."\u000a\u000aOne frequent critic immediately made a link to Trump's domestic affairs. "Forgive us if we're not reassured," tweeted California Rep. Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in response to the President's claim about North Korea. "If @POTUS handles NK like everything else, we can only expect blame-shifting, resignations and profanity."\u000a\u000aNorth Korean threat\u000a\u000aIt's complicating foreign policy matters that the White House and State Department still aren't fully staffed with advisers -- and the Trump administration's plan to cut the State Department budget by 30% means that agency will be in flux for many months to come.\u000a\u000aThe list of foreign policy challenges starts with North Korea and wraps around the globe, from Afghanistan to the Mideast, Africa, Europe and South America. None perhaps is more urgent that the North Korean threat to target the US with a nuclear missile.\u000a\u000aIn early January, before his inauguration, Trump said that Pyongyang "had stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!"\u000a\u000aThis July, Pyongyang test fired two ICBMs, a missile capable of reaching the US, and has threatened a nuclear strike "in the heart of the US."\u000a\u000aPentagon officials said North Korea conducted another missile-related test Monday and the US detected "highly unusual and unprecedented levels of submarine activity."\u000a\u000aAt his Cabinet meeting that morning, Trump told reporters, "we will handle North Korea. We will be able to handle them. It will be handled. We handle everything." So far, the US has taken no visible steps against Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aGardiner points out that this won't be solved quickly, and that for decades the international community failed to find a way to stop North Korea's nuclear program.\u000a\u000a"It's not easy to generate quick results," he says. "Clearly more needs to be done in terms of pressuring China," which accounts for the bulk of North Korea's trade. But he adds that China and Russia, both permanent members of the UN Security Council, "are very, very difficult to deal with when it comes to North Korea."\u000a\u000aTrump initially tried to enlist China to pressure Pyongyang, giving President Xi Jinping the star treatment at his Mar-a-Lago estate and scaling back criticism of Beijing as a currency manipulator. For those concessions, "he's not gotten a much tougher line on North Korea," said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center.\u000a\u000aIndeed, on Saturday, Trump tweeted that he is "very disappointed in China." He went on to tweet that, "they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!"\u000a\u000aAdministration officials hint that sanctions may be coming on Chinese companies, banks and individuals that do business with North Korea.\u000a\u000aMiller, who sees some of Trump's policies as sensible, says that as with China, Trump has made concessions to Russia, but the US has little to show for it publicly. The US has essentially accepted Russia's plan that Assad should stay -- or at least not be removed immediately -- and has agreed to a central Russian demand that it stop funding moderate Syrian rebels.\u000a\u000aLethal arms\u000a\u000aBut Trump has followed through on an Obama administration initiative to increase the number of troops along the border with Russia in Eastern Europe and is considering sending lethal arms to both Georgia and Ukraine, a prospect that would deeply unsettle Moscow. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that he's "reviewing his options" for a response to Russia's expulsion of US diplomats. So far, the White House has been silent.\u000a\u000aIn Syria, the anti-ISIS coalition is making progress in pushing the terror group out of the territory, but it is going underground and the threat it poses is evolving. Miller notes that Trump's aversion to a large increase in troops or spending huge amounts on reconstruction is consistent with cautious Obama administration policies.\u000a\u000aTrump also faces decisions about how to approach Afghanistan and whether to increase troop levels there.\u000a\u000aAnd the administration is signalling it may walk away from the nuclear agreement with Iran, a deal Trump campaigned strenuously against. That would roil the EU, with which the Obama administration reached the deal, along with Russia and China.\u000a\u000aGardiner says the "agreement is a failure" and should be abandoned. Miller says he "can't even begin to comprehend" why Trump would walk away from it. "So far, our anti-Iranian rhetoric has exceeded our actions," said Miller. With active military challenges in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, "why would you want to open another front? What possible utility would that serve?" he asked.

Cubs President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein and President of Operations Crane Kenney were also present. Ricketts then showed Bartman around Wrigley a bit, so he could see what was new since he'd last been to the park. The Cubs released a single photo of Bartman's ring:\u000a\u000a"On behalf of the entire Chicago Cubs organization, we are honored to present a 2016 World Series Championship Ring to Mr. Steve Bartman," the Cubs told WGN in a statement. "We hope this provides closure on an unfortunate chapter of the story that has perpetuated throughout our quest to win a long-awaited World Series. While no gesture can fully lift the public burden he has endured for more than a decade, we felt it was important Steve knows he has been and continues to be fully embraced by this organization. After all he has sacrificed, we are proud to recognize Steve Bartman with this gift today."\u000a\u000aSteve Bartman issued the following statement\u000a\u000a\u201cAlthough I do not consider myself worthy of such an honor, I am deeply moved and sincerely grateful to receive an official Chicago Cubs 2016 World Series Championship ring. I am fully aware of the historical significance and appreciate the symbolism the ring represents on multiple levels. My family and I will cherish it for generations. Most meaningful is the genuine outreach from the Ricketts family, on behalf of the Cubs organization and fans, signifying to me that I am welcomed back into the Cubs family and have their support going forward. I am relieved and hopeful that the saga of the 2003 foul ball incident surrounding my family and me is finally over. I humbly receive the ring not only as a symbol of one of the most historic achievements in sports, but as an important reminder for how we should treat each other in today\u2019s society. My hope is that we all can learn from my experience to view sports as entertainment and prevent harsh scapegoating, and to challenge the media and opportunistic profiteers to conduct business ethically by respecting personal privacy rights and not exploit any individual to advance their own self-interest or economic gain. Moreover, I am hopeful this ring gesture will be the start of an important healing and reconciliation process for all involved. To that end, I request the media please respect my privacy, and the privacy of my family. I will not participate in interviews or further public statements at this time. Words alone cannot express my heartfelt thanks to the Ricketts family, Crane Kenney, Theo Epstein, and the entire\u000a\u000aCubs organization for this extraordinary gift, and for providing the City of Chicago and Cubs fans everywhere an\u000a\u000aunforgettable World Championship in 2016. I am happy to be reunited with the Cubs family and positively moving\u000a\u000aforward with my life."

aVKathmandu, Nepal (CNN) On the streets of Kathmandu, the sight of people begging for kidney treatment has become common.\u000a\u000aThe capital of Nepal is no different from many places in the world where aging populations, poor diets and no health insurance systems mean increased organ disease.\u000a\u000aThe organ in highest demand is the kidney and black market traffickers are meeting that demand. Up to 7,000 kidneys are obtained illegally every year, according to a report by Global Financial Integrity\u000a\u000aOrgan trafficking is an illegal, yet thriving trade around the globe.\u000a\u000aThat same report shows the illegal organ trade generates profits between $514 million to $1 billion a year.\u000a\u000aIn Kathmandu, we spotted a couple begging on the street for their son's kidney treatment.\u000a\u000aJeet Bahadur Magar and his wife spent their entire savings to treat their son's kidney disease.\u000a\u000aOut of money and options, they are now out on the street hoping to raise enough funds to cover the medical bills.\u000a\u000a"I pray to God that no one has to ever go through kidney failure problems," Jeet Bahadur said.\u000a\u000aBut many Nepalis do.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Watch the full documentary: Nepal's Organ Trail Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch the full documentary: Nepal's Organ Trail 21:21\u000a\u000aDuring our visit, Nepal Kidney Center in Kathmandu was packed with patients having dialysis -- a grueling four-hour process of purifying blood through a machine.\u000a\u000aA patient can avoid the kidney transplant by having dialysis at least three times a week.\u000a\u000aThose lucky enough to afford a transplant still face obstacles: the donor must match the blood group of the recipients and Nepali law requires the organ donor to be a family member.\u000a\u000aNepal's 'kidney bank'\u000a\u000aWe traveled to Kavre, a tiny district close to Kathmandu, and what activists and authorities say is a ground zero for the black market organ trade in Nepal.\u000a\u000aHere, kidney trafficking rackets -- well organized and well funded -- dupe the poor and uneducated into giving away a piece of themselves.\u000a\u000aThe district has developed an unfortunate reputation as the "kidney bank of Nepal."\u000a\u000aFor more than 20 years, activists say, people from villages in Kavre have been the primary source of kidneys for sick and desperate patients throughout Nepal. But now the numbers are being tracked.\u000a\u000aIn the last five years more than 300 people have been reported to be victims of kidney traffickers in this district alone, according to Forum for Protection of People's Rights , a Kathmandu-based non-profit human rights organization. Some activists say the number is much higher.\u000a\u000a"Social stigma and threats from traffickers keep many victims from coming forward," said Rajendra Ghimire, a human rights lawyer, and director of Forum for Protection of People's Rights.\u000a\u000a'The meat will grow back'\u000a\u000aNawaraj Pariyar is one of the many victims of kidney traffickers.\u000a\u000aLike many in Kavre, Pariyar makes a living from selling cattle milk and doing seasonal labor jobs on nearby farms.

He was on a site in 2000 when the foreman approached him with a dubious offer: if he let doctors cut out a "hunk of meat" from his body, he would be given 30 lakhs -- about $30,000.\u000a\u000aWhat he wasn't told: the piece of "meat" was actually his kidney.\u000a\u000a"The foreman told me that the meat will grow back," Pariyar said.\u000a\u000a"Then I thought, 'If the meat will regrow again, and I get about $30,000, why not?'"\u000a\u000a"What if I die?" Pariyar remembers asking the foreman.\u000a\u000aThe foreman assured Pariyar that nothing would happen. He was given good food and clothes, and was even taken to see a movie.\u000a\u000aThen he was escorted to a hospital in Chennai, a southern state of India.\u000a\u000aTraffickers assigned a fake name to Pariyar and told the hospital he was a relative of the recipient. The traffickers, Pariyar says, had all the fake documents ready to prove his false identity.\u000a\u000a"At the hospital, the doctor asked me if the recipient was my sister. I was told by the traffickers to say yes. So I did," Pariyar said.\u000a\u000a"I heard them repeatedly saying 'kidney'. But I had no idea what 'kidney' meant. I only knew Mirgaula (the Nepali term for kidney.)\u000a\u000a"Since I didn't know the local language, I couldn't understand any conversation between the trafficker and the hospital staff."\u000a\u000aPariyar was discharged and sent home with about 20,000 Nepali rupees -- less than one percent of the agreed amount -- and a promise he would have the rest shortly.\u000a\u000aHe never received any more money and never found the trafficker.\u000a\u000a"After I came back to Nepal, I had a doubt. So, I went to the doctor. That's when I found out I am missing a kidney," Pariyar said.\u000a\u000aPariyar is now sick and getting worse by the day.

I'm just counting my days," Pariyar said.\u000a\u000aPariyar's experience is one of many similar stories we heard in Kavre.\u000a\u000aUnderstanding the economic situation in this district is the key to understanding why so many people here easily fall prey to kidney traffickers.\u000a\u000aThere are hardly any other economic opportunities other than substantial farming and rearing livestock. One bad harvest or a big medical bill can easily ruin families.\u000a\u000a"The main reason is poverty and lack of awareness. It is very easy for the traffickers to brainwash the villagers. Also, the villages in Kavre are close to the capital and are easily accessible," Ghimire said.\u000a\u000aIndian links\u000a\u000aTraffickers use proxies at different stages of the process. First, someone will approach the victim, another will create the donor's fake documents and then another will escort the donor to the hospital.\u000a\u000aFew hospitals in Nepal perform kidney transplants. And even the doctors in Nepal know most well-heeled patients prefer to go across the border to India.\u000a\u000aTwo brothers who were duped by kidney traffickers show their scars\u000a\u000a"They want better services, they want Indian doctors. That's why they go to the hospitals in India," said Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle, Director of the National Kidney Center.\u000a\u000aBut activists have other explanations for the demand for Indian surgeries.\u000a\u000a"It is hard to cross-check Nepali records across the border, so traffickers prefer to take the donors to India," Ghimire said.\u000a\u000aWe noted, before any kidney operation can be carried out in India, the hospital requires a No Objection Certificate, a letter drafted by the Nepali embassy in New Delhi confirming the donor as the kidney recipient's relative.\u000a\u000aPhotographs of the recipient and the relative, who would be the legitimate donor, were not included in the letter until recently.\u000a\u000aSince Indian hospitals accept official Nepali documents, anyone could show up at the hospital, provide papers saying they were that person and have their kidney removed.\u000a\u000aActivists say this is the loophole traffickers used for many years.\u000a\u000aWith the easy availability of forged documents, traffickers can beat the system.\u000a\u000aWhile the Nepali government tries to tighten policies, Nepal's police officers are trying to crack down on the criminal rings.\u000a\u000aLast year authorities arrested 10 people accused of organ trafficking in Kavre. Their case is still in court.\u000a\u000aSub-inspector Dipendra Chand, who led the police investigation, says stopping the underground trade is difficult.\u000a\u000a"If we crackdown in one village, the traffickers simply move to another," Chand said.\u000a\u000aRajendra Ghimire says that the trafficking rings are now moving beyond Kavre.\u000a\u000a"We have reports that this problem is expanding into other surrounding districts as well," Ghimire said.\u000a\u000aThe attention to this problem is growing in Kavre. Kidney trafficking stories are making headlines on the local and national newspapers.\u000a\u000aBut for victims like Pariyar and others, the media attention is too late.

aVSarah Hassan, CNN \u2022 Updated 21st July 2017\u000a\u000aDubai, UAE (CNN) \u2014 Big and blingy is not always best in Dubai.\u000a\u000aWhile the glitz thrusts further skyward or deeper into the Arabian Gulf, one humble fish restaurant in the shadow of the luxury Burj Al Arab skyscraper hotel bucks the trend.\u000a\u000aBu Qtair peddles simple seafood and fresh fish cooked in its famous "secret recipe," attracting some of the city's highest rollers to its modest surroundings.\u000a\u000a"Some of the tourists who visit us stay in the Burj Al Arab," says owner Matar Al Tayer. "But they tell me they prefer the taste of the fish here over anywhere else in the city. It is the flavor that has remained the same for 30 years."\u000a\u000a'Lightbulb moment'\u000a\u000aBu Qtair's simple fare has been attracting expats, tourists and Dubai residents for 30 years.\u000a\u000aAl Tayer opened his first fish shack overlooking Jumeirah beach in the 1980s to cater for the growing expat population flooding in from South Asia and the Middle East when oil boom money was starting to transform the UAE.\u000a\u000aHis prominent Emirati family once made a tough living through fishing and pearl diving, living alongside fellow fishermen on the then-undeveloped stretch of coast. As the outsiders poured in, the local Bedouin and fishermen who've always been the masters of this arid land, found themselves sharing it with others.\u000a\u000aThat's when Al Tayer had his "lightbulb" entrepreneurial moment.\u000a\u000a"There was not a single café or restaurant dedicated to those fishermen, so I thought to fill that gap by opening a small shop in which I serve Indian chai karak and paratha," he says.\u000a\u000a'Sweet water'\u000a\u000aThe young Al Tayer opened a small kitchen serving special Indian tea and bread on an empty yard overlooking the beach near the fishermen's dormitory.\u000a\u000aHe named it "Bu Qtair," a local term Emirati pearl divers used to name the spots where sweet water gathered naturally along the coast, and where they used to wash themselves after a rigorous day of diving. Al Tayer's venture, however, proved to be an utter failure.\u000a\u000a"For four years, I did not attract any customers. Fishermen were used to preparing their food themselves," he says.\u000a\u000aIt all changed one day when he asked his part-time Indian cook Mousa to prepare food for his family's fishermen after a long day at work. Mousa, who worked in the kitchen of another local family, took some of their fresh catch and served it to the hungry fishermen.\u000a\u000aNeither of the men would have guessed that would be the start of Bu Qtair's journey to stardom, firstly among Indian expats, and later among all of Dubai's residents.\u000a\u000aUnpretentious location\u000a\u000aFish or prawns? It's that simple.\u000a\u000aDespite its growing reputation, the restaurant remained in its unpretentious location for more than three decades as the entire area around it was swallowed up by the desert megalopolis.\u000a\u000aThe fishermen's dormitory was rebuilt, the fishing boats started sharing their docks with luxurious yachts, and Jumeirah became home to luxurious landmarks, such as the opulent sail-shaped Burj Al Arab, the man-made island Palm Jumeirah, Dubai's only Four Seasons Resort, and myriad other exclusive hotels and boutique cafés and restaurants.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, Bu Qtair was able to keep and expand its fan base, becoming a tourist destination with dedicated pages on websites such as Zomato and TripAdvisor\u000a\u000aIn the area around the restaurant, it was not uncommon to see Range Rovers, Mercedes and other sparkly SUVs parked up while their owners sat on plastic chairs on the sandy lot out front to enjoy the same few menu items it's been serving since 1986.\u000a\u000aDiverse crowd\u000a\u000aA few years ago, Bu Qtair moved to a bigger premises, with a lit and air-conditioned indoor area.\u000a\u000aIt remains, however, close to the fishermen in Jumeirah, who are now only a fraction of the diverse crowd that goes there to enjoy the fried fish or prawns dish, with a side of paratha bread or rice and curry sauce. Its reputation has garnered extensive coverage by local and international media, including American TV chef Anthony Bourdain, who featured it in one of his gastronomic trips.\u000a\u000aThe only real change today is that the fish does not come straight off the boats.\u000a\u000a"Today we cannot buy fish straight from fishermen," says Haroun Rasheed, Mousa's 36-year-old nephew, who joined his uncle in the UAE in the early 2000s and has been managing the restaurant for the past 15 years.\u000a\u000a"The municipality requests from us buying it from the fish market in Deira (in old Dubai)."\u000a\u000aThe restaurant, however, remains true to its origins, unmoved by the city's transformation around it and still fiercely protective of the "secret recipe."

When you destroy economies, when you are able to impose censorship on the world and especially the United States of America it's more than vandalism. It's a new form of warfare that we're involved in and we need to react and react vigorously, including reimposing sanctions that were lifted under the Bush administration, including other actions and that will squeeze them more economically and - but most of all, we have to really work together with the president and the Congress to come up with counters and abilities to respond, but more importantly to prevent.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain on President Obama\u2019s comments regarding Vladimir Putin: \u201cI think that it's bizarre to think that any action on the part of the President of the United States has proved any deterrence to Vladimir Putin.

aV(CNN) Hours after two gun deaths interrupted a 72-hour grassroots "ceasefire" in Baltimore, one of the organizers had a message for those she said claimed the ceasefire had ended.\u000a\u000a"Stop panicking out loud, find a corner and watch us keep getting this work," Erricka Bridgeford said Sunday, speaking at one of Baltimore's churches. "Just please know that you and your misguided 'it-ain't-worked' perception does not ... speak for this movement."\u000a\u000aThe movement was the message on Sunday, a day after gunfire that has become a common sound echoing through some Baltimore streets claimed two more lives.\u000a\u000aSome 40 hours after the weekend ceasefire began, a 24-year-old man was fatally shot Saturday afternoon. Hours later, a 37-year-old shooting victim died at a hospital, pushing the city's homicide total for 2017 to 210 -- compared to 318 for all of last year, according to a tally by The Baltimore Sun\u000a\u000aSaturday's killings weren't the only gun violence incidents. Police said a person was wounded in a different shooting.\u000a\u000aBut Bridgeford and supporters viewed the grassroots effort at quelling the deadly violence as a success -- a start. She said the city showed the world the power of unity.\u000a\u000aSupporters also said the ceasefire sparked a conversation about ways to curb violence, and created momentum that they hope will spread in subsequent weeks..\u000a\u000a"There are a lot of conversations that are going on right now to keep this momentum going. That's what's most important," said police spokesman T.J. Smith, whose brother was fatally shot in July . "This situation didn't get to where it is overnight and we're not going to emerge from the situation ... overnight."\u000a\u000aHe added: "One thing for sure, the organizers of the ceasefire did something: They got a movement started."\u000a\u000a'I want you to see me standing with you'\u000a\u000aSeveral attempts by CNN to reach Bridgeford were unsuccessful.\u000a\u000aBut before the ceasefire, Bridgeford and other community leaders hit the streets of West Baltimore, urging drug dealers and gang members to put down their guns.\u000a\u000aScheduled weekend events included cookouts, prayer vigils, peace walks and neighborhood cleanups.\u000a\u000a"This is about a culture shift," Bridgeford told CNN then. "It's about helping people realize they have a choice in their decision-making. Not just about committing violence but about feeling hopeless that there's nothing we can do about the level of violence in our communities."\u000a\u000aKhalilah M. Harris, a resident of Baltimore for 23 years, said people who don't live in Baltimore may have misconceptions of the city, but residents know "if we don't want there to be 200-plus murders at this point next year, we all are going to have to put skin in the game."\u000a\u000aShe attended a peace walk Saturday organized by Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence and others. During the walk, an Episcopal priest and others stopped at the scene of homicides this year. Drivers honked their horns and slowed down.\u000a\u000a"While we were on the walk, people prayed with young men who came up and ... said, 'Thank you, I appreciate this. I'm trying to do my best,'" Harris said.\u000a\u000aShe said Baltimore residents want to reclaim their communities.\u000a\u000a"So, in an event devised by a black woman, in a black city, people of all races and colors and religions stood up together and said ... 'I see you and I want you to see me standing with you,'" Harris said.\u000a\u000aUse your Light #BaltimoreCeasefire #BaltimorePeaceChallenge A post shared by Baltimore Ceasefire (@baltimoreceasefire) on Aug 5, 2017 at 1:42pm PDT\u000a\u000aThe ceasefire effort was also personal for Bridgeford, 44, one of six organizers.\u000a\u000a"One of my brothers was shot in 2001 and survived," she told CNN earlier. "In 2007, I lost another brother to homicide. Two of my first cousins were murdered. Three of their brothers were murdered. One of my stepsons was murdered. Two weeks ago, somebody that I watched grow up was murdered. I go to three or four funerals a year."\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, there was a vigil near the scene of the 24-year-old man's killing.\u000a\u000aPolice spokesman Smith mentioned the homicide in a tweet and said "the work doesn't stop. Organizers called and are in the area to continue to spread love."\u000a\u000a"We didn't have an expectation that this was going to stop things, but it certainly got the conversation going," he said.\u000a\u000aHarris recalled hearing a police commander say he didn't remember a Friday night without a shooting in his 26 years with the department.\u000a\u000aApart from the rising homicide rate, the city is still reeling from the racially charged riots that followed the death of Freddie Gray , who died in police custody in 2015.\u000a\u000aIn April, a federal judge approved a consent decree after a Justice Department report found wide racial disparity in how the Baltimore police treated citizens. The federal oversight stemmed from a civil rights investigation that began after Gray's death.\u000a\u000aSix officers were indicted on a range of charges in connection with Gray's death. Three of the officers were acquitted, and in July 2016, prosecutors dropped charges against the remaining three.\u000a\u000aGray's death sparked an uprising and fueled on ongoing debate over racial bias in policing.\u000a\u000a"The last time the world saw Baltimore rise up this way it looked very different," Bridgeford told CNN earlier. "I loved that uprising. It was a blessing. It needed to happen. Pressure literally busts pipes. Now the world is able to see that Baltimore isn't just angry. Baltimore is strong and powerful and we're coming together."\u000a\u000a'You are this movement'\u000a\u000aThe Baltimore church where Bridgeford delivered an emotional address Sunday -- the Kingdom Life Church -- posted her remarks on Facebook.\u000a\u000aShe spoke directly to the problems of violence in Baltimore, and directly to those most affected by that violence.\u000a\u000a"We are in a dark place and we must be a light in those dark places," she said.\u000a\u000a"If you see Baltimore's beauty in every corner of the crack houses; if you cry for Baltimore, if you are out here getting justice for Baltimore; if you turned Baltimore's bloodstained streets into sacred spaces; if you're still going to do the work in Baltimore after the media is long gone -- you are this movement."\u000a\u000aThe ceasefire was intended to go from 12:01 a.m. Friday to 12:01 a.m. Monday.\u000a\u000aAt 1:08 a.m. Monday, police found a 37-year-old man with fatal wounds to the head and torso.

aV(CNN) Venezuela's controversial and newly elected legislative assembly had a fiery message as the body took office Friday: Supporters of leftist President Nicolás Maduro are in control, with a vengeance.\u000a\u000aMore than 530 members of the National Constituent Assembly, the new legislative panel with powers to rewrite the Venezuela Constitution after an election Sunday at Maduro's behest , took oaths of office Friday afternoon.\u000a\u000aIt was a moment that Maduro opponents hoped to derail -- they boycotted Sunday's election and demonstrated against it for weeks, saying the President orchestrated it to get around the existing National Assembly, which the opposition has controlled since 2015.\u000a\u000aBut the new assembly's leader, former Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez, warned the opposition that their reckoning is coming, blaming it for deaths that accompanied the protests and for waging "economic war" against the people.\u000a\u000a"For those who preach violence, to the fascists, to those who wage an economic war against people ... justice will come to them," Rodriguez told the new assembly inside the legislative palace in Caracas. "We shall start to act as of tomorrow. Do not be surprised."\u000a\u000aFormer Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez, center, was elected leader of the new National Consitutent Assembly on Friday.\u000a\u000aOne of Maduro's top officials has previously said the new body will establish a "truth commission" to prosecute those accused of having broken laws ahead of the election.\u000a\u000aVirtually all of the National Constituent Assembly members are Maduro supporters, and the new assembly could abolish the old one as well as other state institutions.\u000a\u000aRodriguez also took aim at countries like the United States, which issued sanctions over the election.\u000a\u000a"To the head of the empire, we said: Don't mess with Venezuela," she said to fierce applause. "We say, empire, savage barbarians, don't mess with Venezuela, because Venezuela will never surrender."\u000a\u000aCritics say the new assembly could erase any last traces of democracy in the South American country. It comes to power amid allegations that turnout figures in Sunday's election were inflated\u000a\u000aMembers of the Constituent Assembly rise their hands during the Assembly's installation Friday in the capital, Caracas.\u000a\u000aIts installation also follows months of sometimes deadly anti-regime protests and an economic crisis that led many to leave Venezuela in search of easier access to food and medicine.\u000a\u000aThere were some protests Friday in Caracas.

Inflation has soared, and unemployment could reach 25% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.\u000a\u000aFor months, Venezuela has struggled with the collapsing economy and a standoff between Maduro and the opposition. His opponents wanted to impeach him after they won a National Assembly majority in 2015, but he stacked the Supreme Court with his supporters, blocking any impeachment attempts.\u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court briefly attempted to dissolve the National Assembly in March, sparking a wave of nearly daily protests.

aVAndrew Hammond is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000aThe visit -- with a subtext focusing on the future of US-Russia relations under the Trump presidency -- will see stops in Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro from Sunday to Tuesday, comes in the wake of the US Senate and House of Representatives votes this week to impose new sanctions on Moscow.\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of the votes to impose further sanctions on Russia , some in Europe expressed concern that rather than forcing the Kremlin to fall in line, sanctions could create further tensions across the continent and especially in Eastern Europe.\u000a\u000aKey agenda items in Pence's trip include a visit to see US and Georgian troops participating in the Noble Partner NATO-related exercise which also features troops from the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Armenia and Slovenia. And the vice president will also participate, in Montenegro, with leaders across the western Balkans in the Adriatic Charter summit.\u000a\u000aThe immediate backdrop for Pence's visit is the continuing controversy over Russia and the Trump campaign team. After the sanctions bill votes, it now falls on Trump to decide whether he will sign it into law or, in what would be a remarkable move, veto it.\u000a\u000aThe legislation, which would impose restrictions on oil and gas projects in Russia and hit the country's economy, has been condemned by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who asserts it would plant a "dangerous mine" under bilateral relations that could explode in coming months.\u000a\u000aTrump's decision on this issue will be watched closely not only in Moscow, but also in Eastern Europe, which will add to the spice of Pence's various meetings in coming days.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Browder says Russian intel plotted out meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Browder says Russian intel plotted out meeting 00:37\u000a\u000aPart of the nervousness that key US allies have about the President's positioning on Russia is what it could mean for US commitments in the region and NATO.\u000a\u000aTrump has already flip-flopped on this issue, describing the military alliance last year as "obsolete" -- then claiming that since he criticized it, that money has been "pouring in" from other allies making it no longer obsolete. While his alteration in tone was welcomed, the fact his mind on such a fundamental issue could be so easily changed is not entirely comforting to those who feel the heat from Moscow's proximity.\u000a\u000aOn top of the reversal in defense spending cuts across the alliance, a new European Defence Action Plan was agreed earlier this year that will see greater continental military cooperation.\u000a\u000aFor Trump, the key strategic question now on Russia is whether recent developments have destroyed the opportunity that may have existed for a warming of relations between Washington and Moscow.\u000a\u000aThe President has previously given multiple indications that he believes Russia is not a serious threat to the US, hinting in January that he could even drop existing economic sanctions if the country "is helpful." Specifically, he appears to believe there were multiple common interests over issues such as preventing Iran secure nuclear weapons and combating international terrorism.\u000a\u000aBut his proposed repositioning of relations with Russia now looks for the time being to have been put on ice.\u000a\u000aShould Trump be forced to sign the sanctions legislation, Pence's visit should help calm America's allies and reassure them that the US still has an interest in defending their values.\u000a\u000aHowever, talk from Moscow of retaliation and reserving "the right for reciprocity and other measures that may affect the interests of the US" will concern some smaller nations in Russia's so-called "sphere of interest."\u000a\u000aAnd any breakdown in relations with Russia would, potentially, have significant implications for relations between Moscow and Washington in other areas of the globe, including the Syrian conflict.\u000a\u000aAs unpalatable as Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad having a role in the country's future governance might be for some Western countries, when the US and Russia are in open dispute over Syria, the prospects for reaching a lasting political settlement become bleaker, and the regime may even feel emboldened to commit further atrocities.\u000a\u000aAs Pence prepares for his trip to reassure America's allies, Trump now finds himself in a big bind over Russia. Despite his desire for warmer relations, the Senate and the House may have closed that window. Yet the legacy of his warm rhetoric toward Moscow has made his traditional allies in Eastern Europe understandably jumpy.\u000a\u000aIt's hard to know exactly how the President will move forward now, but nothing can be taken for granted. Trump already has the reputation for making unpredictable foreign and defense policy decisions when he has been backed into a corner at home. His political inexperience and ad hoc style of governing means this cannot be ruled out again now, as he faces multiple crises in DC.

aV(CNN) As the head of jewelry in Asia for British auction house Bonhams, Graeme Thompson is used to handling beautiful diamonds on a daily basis. Yet he's only ever held a red diamond once, about five years ago. "Red diamonds are the rarest of them all and whoever gets to hold one in his hand is very lucky indeed," he said.\u000a\u000aMining company Rio Tinto has been showcasing stones from its Argyle mine in Western Australia for the past 33 years -- and during that time, less than 20 carats of Fancy Red certified diamonds have been sold.\u000a\u000aFancy Red diamonds are on the pink diamond color spectrum and is a grading from the Gemological Institute of America\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday in New York, Rio Tinto unveiled its largest Fancy Red diamond yet to a select group of collectors, alongside other gemstones in its annual tender of pink diamonds. Known as the Argyle Everglow, the polished radiant cut diamond weighs 2.11 carats.\u000a\u000aIt represents "rarity within rarity, and will drive global demand from collectors and connoisseurs in search of the incomparable," said Argyle Pink Diamonds Manager Josephine Johnson.\u000a\u000aThe stone is "half the size of a one cent coin, but I expect it to sell for over $10 million," said Tobias Kormind, Managing Director of 77Diamonds.com , Europe's largest online diamond jeweler.\u000a\u000aThompson said he was not comfortable making a more definitive prediction on price without having seen the stone, but that the determining factors will be "the carat weight, the strength of the color, how red it is, and the clarity. The difference in value between a stone that is very clean and one that has inclusions is huge."\u000a\u000aFetching high prices\u000a\u000aThe largest red diamond in the world, the 5.11 carat Moussaieff Red, was discovered in Brazil in the 1990s and is currently owned by jeweler Moussaieff.\u000a\u000aSignificant red diamonds rarely appear at auctions. In 2013, a 1.92-carat Fancy Red rectangular-cut diamond, sold for CHF3.15 million at Christie's , while the auction house also sold a 2.09-carat heart-shaped Fancy Red diamond ring by Moussaieff for HKD39.32 million in 2014.\u000a\u000aThe 2.42 carat Fancy Purple-Pink Argyle Avaline and the 1.14 carat Fancy Red Argyle Isla.\u000a\u000a"The color red is essentially a highly, highly saturated vivid pink, where the body color goes beyond the pink color range -- and there can be modifying color to that red, like pinkish red, orangey red, brownish red -- and all of these contributing factors will then determine the value of the diamond," Thompson explained. "A Fancy Red is the rarest of all diamonds."\u000a\u000a"To hold a red diamond in your hand and look at it and say it's a truly a red stone without any modifying colors, very few people on this planet will ever be able to do that," Thompson added, noting such red diamond will appeal to Chinese buyers "as it is the most auspicious of colors in China."\u000a\u000aMine to close soon\u000a\u000aThe Argyle Diamond Mine produces 90% of the world's rare pink diamonds and is set to close by 2021, according to Robyn Ellison, communications manager for Rio Tinto.\u000a\u000a"It is unlikely that a diamond as rare as this will come out of the mine again," Ellison said.\u000a\u000aAt Rio Tinto's annual tender this year, buyers will have a choice of 58 diamonds weighing a total of 49.39 carats. They include five "hero" diamonds selected for their unique beauty and named to ensure there is a permanent record of their contribution to the history of the world's most important diamonds.\u000a\u000aThe collection will be showcased in Hong Kong and Perth with bids closing on October 11.

aV(CNN) There's just no stopping Briton Adam Peaty, who won the men's 50 meter breaststroke Wednesday to claim his second gold medal at the FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.\u000a\u000aAlready a winner over 100m earlier in the week, Peaty came home in 25.99 seconds -- 0.53sec ahead of his nearest rival -- and just 0.04sec short of the world record time he set in Tuesday's semifinals.\u000a\u000aBrazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver, while South Africa's Cameron van der Burgh claimed bronze.\u000a\u000a"I think I have to retire and give it a few years and come back when he's older," the 29-year-old Van der Burgh told reporters.\u000a\u000a"It's really impressive," added the South African swimmer. "It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between (butter)fly and breast."\u000a\u000aIt's a stroke that enabled the 22-year-old Briton on Tuesday to break the world record twice in a day, becoming the first person to go under 26 seconds as he clocked 25.95 secs to reach the final.\u000a\u000aPeaty celebrates winning the men's 50m breaststroke gold medal.\u000a\u000aOut on his own\u000a\u000aThe worry for Peaty's rivals is that the Briton just keeps getting better and better.\u000a\u000aHe made such waves at the Rio Olympics , that Michael Phelps -- the most decorated swimmer of all time -- was opened mouthed at his world record-breaking performance in the 100m breaststroke.\u000a\u000a"It's one of the grossest swims I've ever seen. I'm just glad I don't have to race him," said the American, the owner of 23 Olympic gold medals.\u000a\u000aPeaty has some way to go to match Phelps' achievements, but the Englishman has made no secret of his desire to be the Phelps of the breaststroke.\u000a\u000aIn the final of the 100 meters in Rio, Peaty won by 1.56 seconds in a race often decided by a fingertip. A mere second separated the remaining seven swimmers in the final.\u000a\u000aFive-time Olympian Mark Foster believes his fellow Briton is so good, he will remain a dominant force in the pool until he decides to hang up his swimming goggles.\u000a\u000a"As long as he stays fit and injury free, I can't see anyone touching him until he retires," Foster told CNN ahead of the FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. "He's that good.\u000a\u000aPeaty set a new world record in a heat of the men's 50m breaststroke Tuesday.\u000a\u000a'A bit of a freak'\u000a\u000aIt was during London 2012 that Peaty and his coach Mel Marshall, who by then had been teaching the swimmer for three years, devised a plan to ensure he would be the best in the world in four years' time.\u000a\u000aFor Foster, he argues the talent was always there but the hard work was the missing ingredient.\u000a\u000a"He's obviously physiologically gifted," adds the former world champion. "He's not a coordinated athlete necessarily, but breaststroke was just what he was born to do and he works incredibly hard at it."\u000a\u000aAt 1.91 meters and with a monstrous wing span, Peaty is the perfect shape for elite breaststroke.\u000a\u000aBut he stands out because of what he does underneath the surface.\u000a\u000aAt major championships, he has grown accustomed to rival coaches following his every stroke from pool side. His body becomes an almost inverted bend from shin and knee, which he calls "a hyperextension of sorts."\u000a\u000aHe jokingly describes himself as "a bit of a freak," but his performances are other worldly and no one has even got within 1.3 seconds of his best 100m time. No small feat in an event which lasts 57 seconds.\u000a\u000aPeaty celebrates winning gold and setting a new world record in the men's 100m breaststroke at Rio 2016.\u000a\u000a'Who works hardest wins'\u000a\u000aPeaty might not have broken his 100m breakstroke world record in Monday's final at the ongoing World Aquatics Championships, but he easily retained his title.\u000a\u000aIn comparing Peaty with Ed Moses -- the 400m hurdler who won 107 consecutive finals between 1987 and 1997 -- Foster prophetically told CNN before the championships: "He'll win and he'll be quick, and he'll continue to make this his event. It's a bit like Ed Moses, really."\u000a\u000aOLYMPIC CHAMPION pic.twitter.com/l4Kjyj0UbE \u2014 Adam Peaty (@adam_peaty) 8 August 2016\u000a\u000aPeaty does not lack confidence but it stops short of arrogance.\u000a\u000a"My coach wouldn't let me get arrogant nor my family -- Mel shoots me down every day," he explains.\u000a\u000aHe likes to downplay his achievements in the pool by saying "I'm no good at anything else," but Britain's first medalist of the Rio Games can also talk for Britain.\u000a\u000aIn the immediate aftermath of Rio -- Team GB's most successful ever Olympics with a total of 67 medals -- people would congregate outside Peaty's family home, hoping to get a glimpse of the world record holder. He has since moved out, having bought a home of his own.\u000a\u000a"The hardest thing was adjusting to what I'd done," he says of the post-Rio haze, in which he took two months off and embraced his penchant for eating burgers.\u000a\u000aBut despite having achieved the long-burning ambition of Olympic gold, he insists he is as motivated as ever.\u000a\u000a"It's who works the hardest that wins," he says, downplaying his natural talent and freakish leg kicks. "You see people fall off after a Games, but that won't be the case for me. I think I can do it again."

aV(CNN) Callan Kott's parents knew that something was wrong with their child when the 3-year-old looked pale and suddenly stopped singing karaoke at a Christmas party in December 2015. The New Orleans boy was usually the "life of the party" who loved to dance.\u000a\u000aConcerned that the pneumonia he had experienced around Thanksgiving had returned, they took him to the ER for a chest X-ray. Dr. James Hanley at Ochsner Medical Center in Jefferson, Louisiana, ordered some tests. A little while later, he sat down with Ross and Lisa Kott to break the news: Their son had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer.\u000a\u000a"We had no clue that he was as sick as he was, really no warning at all," Lisa Kott said. "It just came out of nowhere, just days before Christmas."\u000a\u000aCallan started chemotherapy treatment immediately. He responded well to it, and the staff at Ochsner worked to make sure the Kott family would be able to go home by Christmas.\u000a\u000aAlthough Callan handled those rough few days well, he was also too young to understand why the nurses had to keep poking him with needles and taking blood samples. He would cry and get upset.\u000a\u000aDesperate to keep him calm, his parents tried to distract him with videos. Before the nurses walked in with more needles, Ross Kott pulled up the trailer for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."\u000a\u000a"When Ross showed him that preview, he composed himself," Lisa Kott said. "It was the oddest thing. And I think we probably watched it a hundred times after that."\u000a\u000aAlthough Ross loved the "Star Wars" films as a kid, he had never shown them to his son or even mentioned the series. He was amazed to see Callan connect so strongly with a two-minute trailer. The boy's favorite characters became Kylo Ren and the rolling droid BB-8.\u000a\u000aCallan poses in a Chewbacca jacket with a poster of his favorite character, Kylo Ren.\u000a\u000aOver those four days in the hospital, his parents kept showing Callan the trailer every time needles were involved.\u000a\u000a"Then, his love of 'Star Wars' took on a life of its own," Ross said.\u000a\u000aCallan fell in love with "Star Wars" Legos and the "Clone Wars" animated series. "The Force Awakens" is the only film in the saga he has watched; his parents have tried to show him the others, but he lets them know when it gets too scary to continue.\u000a\u000aWanting to be sure the Kotts felt like they were in the right place, the staff at Ochsner played along, calling him "Star Wars Callan." At first, when he would show up for treatment, the Kotts would make sure that his room was full of "Star Wars" decorations. Then, the nurses surprised them with their own decorations.\u000a\u000aEvery time the boy had one of his 18 or so spinal taps, they brought him a "Star Wars" balloon.\u000a\u000aCallan's treatment was like a roller coaster: bouts of intense chemo followed by lighter weeks, inpatient one week and outpatient the next. The hardest part for the very social kid was not being able to be in school, play with his friends or be around other family members due to his depleted immune system.\u000a\u000aBut during the ups and downs, he would "train" with his light saber in the hallway, wear the masks of his favorite "Star Wars" characters, sing the "Imperial March" and hold out his hands to "use the Force" in fighting his cancer. He told other patients that they could use the Force to help their cancer, too.\u000a\u000aCallan practicing with his lightsaber.\u000a\u000aWhen Callan had to shave his head, Ross Kott did it too, telling him it was part of training to become a Jedi. Callan also shares his love of Star Wars with his 2-year-old brother Ari.

It's not going to be doom and gloom in our house."

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Published 30th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Off the coast of Xiamen, in southeast China, Kulangsu (also known as Gulangyu) is not exactly your average Chinese village.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the tiny island, with just 4,000 households, is completely free of cars and bikes, aside from the occasional tourist trolley.\u000a\u000aThen there's the 19th-century European mansions, leafy seaside promenades, white-sandy beaches and a legacy of classical music.\u000a\u000aAnd as of July, China's "Piano Island" -- so named for its piano music and musical prodigies -- is also a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site , chosen in the committee's 41st session.\u000a\u000aFrom the world's largest piano museum to peaceful colonial mansions, knobby banyan trees and cobbled alleyways, Kulangsu offers a unique journey through China's past.\u000a\u000aThe car-free Kulangsu is packed with leafy streets and 19th-century colonial buildings.\u000a\u000aAn international affair\u000a\u000aWhy the colonial architecture? Xiamen was, and still is, an important port for Sino-European trade.\u000a\u000a"During the Qing Dynasty, Amoy (now known as Xiamen) was one of the first great trading harbors of China. Along with Shanghai, it was one of the first points of contact between East and West," Robin Goldstein, tourism spokesperson for Kulangsu Island , tells CNN Travel.\u000a\u000a"Because of its natural beauty and positioning right in Amoy's protected main harbor, Kulangsu became the ideal destination in Amoy to live and set up trading business and became the location for customs."\u000a\u000aThroughout the early 19th century, this romantic settlement drew merchants, missionaries and diplomatic representatives from many European countries, including the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese.\u000a\u000aBy the mid-1800s the 0.75-square-mile island was dotted with consulate buildings, schools, community centers and music studios.\u000a\u000aPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the elite neighborhood, it was "the richest square mile on earth" by the 1920s.\u000a\u000aWhile Kulangsu lacks the glamor of its heyday, the island still holds vestiges of its international past, visible in the island's 13 foreign consulates and more than 600 heritage buildings.\u000a\u000aWith the world's largest piano museum and a popular organ museum (pictured here), it's no exaggeration to call Kulangsu China's music capital.\u000a\u000aMusic Island\u000a\u000aThe island might be small, but it's home to many a big-name musician -- not to mention the highest per capita ownership of pianos in China.\u000a\u000a"Western classical instruments, including pianos, barely existed in China before the end of the mid-1800s when this contact between East and West began," explains Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Kulangsu, as the home of many diplomats and former officials, became a place where Westerners lived and worked and thus they brought many elements of their culture from Europe."\u000a\u000a"As a result, Kulangsu became the first places in all of China where Western classical music could be played and heard."\u000a\u000aA haven for the arts and sciences, the little island practically bred prodigies, among them pianist Xu Feiping and violinist Jing Yang.\u000a\u000aAmbling around the winding tree-lined alleyways, travelers will discover the remnants of centuries-old music schools and a well-known piano museum.\u000a\u000aThe largest in the world -- and the only one in China -- the Gulangyu Piano Museum (45 Huang Yan Road, Kulangsu) is hard to miss, thanks to an eye-catching facade that resembles piano keys.\u000a\u000aInside, more than 100 gleaming pianos -- including a gold-plated number and an antique hand piano -- provide insight into the island's musical heritage.\u000a\u000aKulangsu is blessed with a scenic coastline dotted with white sandy beaches.\u000a\u000aSandy stretches\u000a\u000aXiamen stays relatively warm all year round, with a mild winter and 80-degree summers.\u000a\u000aThe beaches of Kulangsu might not quite rival the Philippines, but they're relatively clean -- with white sand and swaying palm trees.\u000a\u000aThanks to a walking trail that circles the island, you can easily reach the less frequented stretches on the northern coast, facing the Xiamen west port and a series of islets.\u000a\u000a"I love the secluded beach by Zhao He Shan Park in Nei Cuo Ao Village, on the northern edge of Kulangsu," says Goldstein. "Guanhai beach is another pretty spot on the southwest corner of the island next to a beautiful former ferry port, Guanhai Harbor."\u000a\u000a"Kulangsu is one of the most popular places in China for couples to take wedding pictures, and every day you'll see the island -- especially Guanhai beach -- full of brides and grooms in full romantic regalia for their photo shoots."\u000a\u000aThe best views\u000a\u000aThe hilly island seems to be all cobbled alleys and pretty gardens -- that is, until you climb up the 302-foot-tall Sunlight Rock.\u000a\u000aThe golden mound is the highest point on the island, offering views of the island's red rooftops and of Xiamen across the strait.\u000a\u000a"Climbing to its summit, past Sunlight Rock temple, is great in the evening because the crowds are thinner, and you can watch the sunset and skyline of Xiamen begin to twinkle," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Sunsets are also beautiful from beaches all over the island, but my favorite spot of all for sunsets is a quiet spot perched atop the northeast corner of Kulangsu, the site of the old Yanwei Hill Time Cannon -- now a newly landscaped public park that's well off the beaten tourist track."\u000a\u000aGreat views and thinner crowds: Evening is the best time to climb up Sunlight Rock.\u000a\u000aFresh seafood\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to local cuisine, the tropical seaside surrounds may give you a hint as to what's for dinner.\u000a\u000a"The island's signature foods all revolve around fresh seafood, fresh local produce, and fresh fruit," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Preparations are simple, healthy, and usually have a bit of a spicy kick. The island is famous for its oyster omelets, which are made with eggs, scallions, sweet potato flour and fresh local oysters, cooked on a flat cast-iron griddle into a perfect ring and served with bright red Xiamen hot sauce."\u000a\u000aGoldstein points to a personal favorite, Blessed Paradise (95 Quanzhou Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000a"It's run by a Kulangsu native who's also a wine expert and one of the island's most cosmopolitan restaurateurs," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"His kitchen turns out a terrific Kulangsu-style spicy mixed seafood grill of fresh whole fish, clams, squid, abalone, mushrooms, and local vegetables -- all of which come swimming in a deeply flavored chili sauce."\u000a\u000aElsewhere on the island, you can usually recognize the most authentic spots, thanks to a line out the door.\u000a\u000aAt Fu Lin Chun Canting (109 Longtou Rd, Kulangsu), for example, travelers will find a no-frills dining room and menus depicting an ocean of fresh seafood.\u000a\u000aHave it deep-fried, steamed with garlic and shallots, or grilled with a sprinkle of salt -- but if you don't speak Chinese we recommend coming prepared with some key phrases or pictures to which you can point.\u000a\u000aHeroic heights\u000a\u000aThe towering statue of Zheng Chenggong -- a 17th-century Ming general and cultural hero -- is impossible to miss.\u000a\u000aThis figure, part of a larger sculpture park, rests, like a beacon in a storm, atop of the island's southeastern point.\u000a\u000aElsewhere in the park, you'll find an ancient well, the grounds of the former emperor's palace, and a series of bronze, steel and stone statues.\u000a\u000aWith dramatic Chinese-style gardens and the piano museum, Shuzhuang Garden is worth a visit.\u000a\u000aA walk in the garden\u000a\u000aThe piano museum is one of several sights inside the larger Shuzhuang Garden.\u000a\u000aDating back to 1913, the green oasis was once a private estate. Now it's a seaside park, featuring dramatic Chinese-style pavilions, over-water walkways and colorful painted columns.\u000a\u000aA long walkway meanders toward the ocean, while on the hillside, Twelve Grotto Heaven provides an eccentric little maze of sandstone formations -- not to mention a few carved monkey sculptures.\u000a\u000aQuiet nights\u000a\u000aThe most peaceful time on Kulangsu is early morning and late evening, after the crowds have been ferried back to the mainland.\u000a\u000aYou can take advantage of the empty streets by staying overnight in a boutique hotel, such the Lee Inn & Coffee House (38-40 Zhangzhou Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000aBuilt in a 100-year-old colonial building, the quaint guesthouse offers 17 rooms and a pretty garden.\u000a\u000aFor a slightly larger address, Goldstein recommends the 26-room Yang Tao Hotel (13 Fuxing Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000aTucked inside Fuxing Castle, the hotel showcases arched doorways and quiet terraces, as well as a popular restaurant and two garden bars.\u000a\u000aGetting there\u000a\u000aRegular ferries ply the seven-minute route between Kulangsu and Xiamen 24 hours a day.\u000a\u000aIn an effort to curb crowds and protect the island's heritage, Kulangsu has recently capped the number of tourist ferries per day.

aV"I was only 36 years old, and I was single," she said. "I just couldn't process anything he was saying."\u000a\u000aShe worked full-time as a special-education teacher in New Jersey, but her most important job was raising her 8-year-old son, Michael.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin dreaded the thought of telling people she had cancer.\u000a\u000a"I remember I was laying on my stomach saying to myself, 'You're never going to have to tell anyone, because you're going to die tonight,' " she said of the night she got the news.\u000a\u000aFor someone who was always in control of her life, the diagnosis felt like a fatal blow for McLaughlin. She went through the motions of treatment and had a lumpectomy in her left breast, followed by radiation.\u000a\u000a"I hated radiation. It felt like I was in a 'Star Wars' movie. You're in this machine, and then there's a sound that makes you think you're going to be disintegrated," McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000aBattling cancer, striving for normalcy\u000a\u000aTo most people, McLaughlin's life appeared normal. She continued working full-time and caring for Michael, who was in third grade, as if nothing had changed. The principal at her school set up a room with a cot so she could take naps during her off periods. She did it out of necessity but also because she didn't want Michael to be affected by her diagnosis.\u000a\u000a"He didn't understand that I could die," she said. "That never entered his mind, because I didn't look like I was sick; I didn't act like I was sick; I didn't sit around and cry. I kept doing the things that I was always doing."\u000a\u000aAfter a few months, McLaughlin was cancer-free. She returned to her normal routine, replacing weekly chemo and radiation treatments with a mammogram every six months.\u000a\u000aBut on the same date in April three years later, McLaughlin's doctors found cancer cells in her left breast again. A mastectomy was her only option this time. She had immediate breast reconstruction and repeated the rigorous treatment schedule.\u000a\u000aAgain, she shielded Michael from as much as possible. He was in sixth grade, seemingly unaware; school-wide prayer calls were the extent of his exposure. "He'd come home from school and say, 'Oh, Mommy! Sister Laura got on the PA system today and had the whole school say a prayer for you!' " McLaughlin recalled.\u000a\u000aUnlike with her first diagnosis, McLaughlin knew what to expect. The countless biopsies that followed were the greatest challenge. Her doctors were extra cautious, taking tissue samples at the first sign of a lump or mass in her remaining right breast.\u000a\u000a"I told my doctor, 'My breast looks like a scenic railroad! Every which way, scars, scars, scars.' And he said to me, 'You can have 10 benign biopsies, but the 11th could be the cancer that kills you.' "\u000a\u000aAnother diagnosis\u000a\u000aSeven years later, McLaughlin felt a lump in her right breast. The mammogram didn't reveal any inconsistencies. Her new doctor suggested that she wait a couple of months, but she insisted on getting a biopsy.\u000a\u000aShe remembered lying on the operating table as her doctor read the results. "Usually, I'd be told it looks clean. This time, I saw his face, and he didn't tell me anything. I knew at that moment I had cancer again."\u000a\u000aIt was her third diagnosis in a 10-year period.\u000a\u000aMichael was a senior in high school, old enough to understand her condition for the first time. "I was honest with him about having cancer, but I'd never say 'I'm going to die.' I'd just say 'I saved my life,' " McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000aMichael struggled with fear about his mother's condition but was eager to help. He drove her to the hospital for her second mastectomy and breast reconstruction. Leaving little time to sulk, McLaughlin went back to work immediately and enrolled in graduate school to earn her master's in education.\u000a\u000aCancer-free once again, McLaughlin's life stabilized. Neither her body nor her behavior evidenced the decade-long struggle she endured. She loved her reconstructed breasts and felt in control again. Throughout all of her diagnoses, "I never cried. I never got emotional about it," she said.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin's moment of weakness came years later.\u000a\u000aQuesting for confidence\u000a\u000aEight years after her last treatment, an unexpected staph infection forced doctors to remove her implants. "That's when I cried," she said. "They were so beautiful and life-like that I couldn't believe it was happening to me." Doctors removed the infected skin, expanded the remaining flesh on her chest, and inserted smaller implants.\u000a\u000aBut after six weeks, she was rushed to emergency surgery for a second staph infection and lost the option of reconstruction entirely. Flattened, misshapen lumps of fatty tissue and scars from 28 surgeries were all that remained.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin struggled with her appearance after losing her breasts. She removed all the full-length mirrors from her home, preferring not to see herself in them, and pined over the lumps on her chest when she caught glimpses of her torso in the bathroom. "Every time I looked in the mirror, you think I'd be mad about the scars; I'd say, 'Oh God, I hate that fat.' I hate it, you know, and I was obsessed with it."\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin didn't find solace until years later when Michael, then in his 30s, gave her a tablet computer. With his help, McLaughlin opened a Twitter account. She became fast Twitter friends with Friday Jones , a celebrity tattoo artist and cast member on Oxygen's "Tattoos After Dark."\u000a\u000aThrough Jones, McLaughlin discovered a community of breast cancer survivors and mastectomy tattoo enthusiasts. Jones introduced McLaughlin to P.ink Day, a nationwide event in which volunteers connect breast cancer survivors with experienced artists, providing complimentary tattoos to cover their scars during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\u000a\u000aP.ink Day founder Noel Franus said "most breast cancer survivors are told they have two options after a mastectomy: reconstruction or no reconstruction. We believe they deserve a third option that most aren't familiar with: tattoos."\u000a\u000aP.ink Day, now in its fifth year, has provided tattoos for more than 175 survivors in 25 cities. When a last-minute slot opened up at P.ink Day in New York, Jones recommended McLaughlin. "She tweeted me and said, 'This one's for you, Bern,' " McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000a'Life still goes on'\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin's first tattoo was a breeze. Having lost almost all feeling in her chest due to nerve damage from radiation, she never felt the needle puncture her skin. Wispy black vines and flowers reminiscent of lace spread from her left shoulder down to the center of her chest.\u000a\u000a"I became so obsessed with that tattoo, I forgot I had the lumps." One year later, she was ready for another tattoo to cover her right side. This time, her son would join her.\u000a\u000aShe continued the vine across her chest, embellishing it with yellow roses, symbolic of life and rebirth to show that, "even in the coldest winters where everything is dead, out of the worst possible things that can happen to you, there's still life. Life still goes on."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aMichael got a matching yellow rose on his forearm. "This tattoo will always remind me of not just her, not just this day, but of everything she's done for me," he said, recalling the years his mother silently endured breast cancer in order to preserve his childhood.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin doesn't miss her breasts anymore. "People could look at (my chest) and say it's really ugly, and I looked at it that way too, until I got the tattoos."\u000a\u000aShe will celebrate 17 years cancer-free in April but still considers herself a patient. Three hard-fought battles taught her to never get too comfortable.\u000a\u000aTo women fighting similar battles, McLaughlin shares this life lesson: "You live with cancer, but you don't let cancer ruin your life."

Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSteps for Starting\u000a\u000aThe first step of any exercise program is to talk with your doctor. He or she can give you personalized advice on the types of exercises that are best for you.\u000a\u000aYour doctor may also write you a prescription for physical therapy. A physical therapist can assess your movements and design an exercise program that addresses your weaknesses and accommodates your limitations.\u000a\u000aA Program That Works\u000a\u000aMost people with psoriatic arthritis should do three types of exercises: stretching and other flexibility movements, strengthening exercises, and cardiovascular workouts. Finding an exercise partner will lead to more enjoyable workouts and make it easier to stay on track.\u000a\u000aFlexibility exercises reduce your risk of injuring your joints, help you warm up for other types of workouts, and release tension from your body. Work up to doing 15 minutes of flexibility exercises every day.\u000a\u000aStrengthening exercises build muscles that absorb shock and cushion your joints. You don't need to go to the gym and lift heavy weights. You can use light dumbbells or the weight of your own body to provide resistance. Do strengthening exercises every other day.\u000a\u000aAerobic or "cardio" workouts get your heart pumping and your large muscles working. Popular choices include swimming, cycling, or walking. You should include them in your routine three to four times a week. It's wise to start slowly and intensify workouts as you build endurance.\u000a\u000aThe Right Moves\u000a\u000aThough everyone's needs are different, some exercises tend to help many people with psoriatic arthritis and other types of arthritis. For instance, the gentle stretching of yoga and tai chi has been shown to relieve joint pain.\u000a\u000aAdding water to your workout can build strength and flexibility with little impact on your joints. Immersing yourself in a pool can improve circulation and support your joints as you move. Ask your doctor about swimming, water aerobics, and water walking.\u000a\u000aOften you can find special fitness classes targeted toward people with psoriatic arthritis. Check with your local hospital, YMCA, park district, gym, or community center.\u000a\u000aStrike the Best Balance\u000a\u000aWorking out with psoriatic arthritis can be a balancing act. There are times when you'll need to rest instead. During a flare\u2014when your joints are red and swollen\u2014take it easy to avoid joint damage. And stop any activity that causes you extreme pain.\u000a\u000aYour doctor and physical therapist can also advise whether you should avoid certain moves, at least for a while. For instance, if your psoriatic arthritis affects your feet and ankles, you may need to avoid weight-bearing exercises such as running.\u000a\u000aThe fatigue caused by psoriatic arthritis may mean you need to start slowly and take frequent breaks. But over time you should find that exercise gives you more energy.\u000a\u000aKey Takeaways\u000a\u000aExercise is an essential part of treating psoriatic arthritis. It can reduce joint pain and stiffness and improve quality of life.\u000a\u000aFor most people with psoriatic arthritis, three types of exercises are recommended: stretching and other flexibility movements, strengthening exercises, and cardiovascular workouts.\u000a\u000aYoga, tai chi, and swimming are also good options.\u000a\u000aTake time to rest when needed, especially if you're experiencing a flare.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWas this helpful?

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000aSix degrees Celsius of warming may not sound like much -- probably because "temperatures can swing by 6 degrees within an hour if a warm front passes, and it doesn't mean the end of the world," said Mark Lynas, author of a book called "Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet."\u000a\u000aBut if we raise global average surface temperatures by just 6 degrees above pre-industrial levels, Lynas told me, we'll create "a scenario which is so extreme it's almost unimaginable."\u000a\u000a"Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable," he said. "Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and sub-polar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. It's difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. There's a certain level above which plants just can't survive.\u000a\u000a"There's a certain level where humans biologically can't survive outside as well ... The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen-deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well -- which would then release gases and affect land. So it's pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts."\u000a\u000aI chatted with Lynas, a science writer in the UK, about how to avoid a 6-degree world, the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees -- and how to talk to kids about climate change.\u000a\u000aThe following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\u000a\u000aMark Lynas\u000a\u000aSutter: I've gotten a lot of questions from readers about what 2 degrees of warming means. What does it mean for sea levels? What does it mean for hurricanes? Extinctions? Those sorts of things. Could I run through a couple of those and get your take on it, as someone who's read through just mountains of this research?\u000a\u000aLynas: Sure, sure. I'll do my best.\u000a\u000aSutter: OK. Could we start with extinctions? What will we see around the 2-degree mark?\u000a\u000aIn the marine environment, I think the most threatened ecosystems are coral reefs. (They're) threatened both by coral bleaching, due to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, plus the general degradation of everyday, general human activity. It's very tough to imagine that the world's coral reefs will continue to exist in their present day form in a 2-degree warmer world.\u000a\u000aThe other most-threatened environments probably are the mountain ecosystems -- where species will be left marooned in shrinking islands of habitat. As temperature rises, you can imagine biomes rising up the sides of the mountains, and species which are dependent on a certain level of temperature and humidity will get left with nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aSutter: What about hurricanes and severe weather?\u000a\u000aThere's really a lot of uncertainty about this. It's possible to imagine hurricanes will become less frequent but more intense, and possibly (form) over new areas.\u000a\u000aSutter: What about droughts? I get a lot of California questions.\u000a\u000aLynas: The overall global picture is kind of, 'unto them that have with be given more and unto them have not shall be taken away' -- if you want to get biblical. That maps out as the subtropics, which are already the drier parts of the globe, will become more water-deficient. The deep tropics will actually get more rainfall, as well as some of the mid-latitudes. But the subtropics -- which is the southwest of the U.S. -- would expect to see less rainfall, which indeed seems to be what's happening. That does call into question, really, the development model that large areas of the southwestern U.S. have adopted -- expecting a large amount of freshwater to be available to urban areas and agriculture, which are already in a pretty arid location.\u000a\u000aSo I do think it's going to be hard to adapt to that change.\u000a\u000aSutter: I've also gotten questions about the low-lying Pacific Island nations. At 2 degrees, what is their fate?\u000a\u000aLynas: I used to be adviser to president of the Maldives, who is, by the way, now in jail due to there having been a coup. But his challenge, and his main agenda, when he was president, was to bring to attention the fate of the small island states -- especially those that are coral atolls. For the Maldives, the entire country exists at a meter or less above sea level, and little more. It's difficult to imagine the survival of coral atoll nations at 2 degrees, it has to be said. Although the extinction process depends on the rate of sea level rise. It might take decades, it might take centuries, it's not clear at the moment. But I don't think they have a very long term future.\u000a\u000aSutter: Moving up the degree ladder, you describe a 6-degree world as a "sixth circle of hell." What do you mean by that -- and can you describe some of what we know about that world?\u000a\u000aLynas: It's a scenario which is so extreme it's almost unimaginable. Not many studies have addressed this because it's so far off the scale of what can be envisaged. I found myself looking back at the really serious traumatic events in the Earth's geological history, which have led to mass extinctions, such as the one at the end of the Permian period, 250 million years ago, which wiped out nearly 90% of life on Earth. Actually, a lot of the mass extinctions seem to have been associated with very rapid global warming events. Humans are releasing carbon more rapidly even than took place during mass extinctions. We haven't gotten there in terms of the overall amount, but we're certainly moving in that direction. So it's not a planet that I think any of us would want to live in, and it doesn't have to happen. While I think it's important to try to visualize what a 6-degree world would look like, it's also important to remember that we don't have to go there.\u000a\u000aSutter: What else do we know about a 6-degree world?\u000a\u000aLynas: Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable. Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and subpolar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. It's difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. There's a certain level above which plants just can't survive. There's a certain level where humans biologically can't survive outside, as well. We get close enough already in the Arabian Peninsula and some other parts of the world. Remember, 6 degrees is a global average. It would be probably twice that over land and somewhat less than that over the oceans. The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well -- which would then release gases and affect land. So it's pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts.\u000a\u000aSutter: I'm wondering why you took this approach -- looking at climate change by degrees?\u000a\u000aLynas: A lot of people want to know what warming we get with what emissions path, or what warming we might get by what date. That's pretty fundamentally uncertain because they depend on different factors which aren't very well quantified. I felt that looking at it degree by degree was much more robust. If the temperature rises by X amount then what will be Y impacts? There are three major sources of information about that. One is the observational changes we're already seeing in terms of impacts in temperature rise. The second is computer models showing different ecosystem changes or whatever. And the third is paleoclimate sources -- so looking at how the climate was different in earlier hotter periods in geologic time. So piecing those together and mapping them onto a degree by degree picture seemed to me to be a way to try to convey this in a visual and intuitive -- but also highly scientifically appropriate -- way.\u000a\u000aSutter: What do you think about the world's focus on the 2-degree mark? One activist said to me that 2 degrees is the only thing the international community agrees upon for climate change.\u000a\u000aLynas: I think it's important to have a target -- because it focuses policy and it focuses people's efforts. And it makes sense also to have a target based on the temperature. But it's not something we can meet, by definition. We don't have a simple thermostat where we can decide exactly how much carbon to emit and have an exact temperature result dependent on that. So, there's uncertainty, really, about what level of emissions will lead to what temperature outcomes, by when. However, I think that 2 degrees is really the absolute upper limit of what's tolerable in terms of ecosystems and, probably, adaptive capacities of human societies. A 2-degree world is a world without coral reefs, and with much less snow and ice and with fairly dramatic heatwaves -- and other impacts. So, I would like to see a global warming future in which warming actually is lower than that, personally.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you think that's possible?\u000a\u000aLynas: I think it's possible. It's not very likely. If our current understanding of climate sensitivity is broadly correct then we're probably going to come in between 2 and 3 degrees, somewhere, by the end of the century. I guess the good news is the absolutely calamitous 5 and 6 degree outcomes are particularly unlikely, too, although still possible. And certainly, the risk of them happening is higher than the risk of an airplane crashing when we get onto it.\u000a\u000aSutter: Wait, so you're saying the risk of 5 or 6 degrees of warming -- a doomsday scenario -- is higher than an airplane crashing?\u000a\u000aLynas: Well, the likelihood of an airplane crashing is, I don't know, one in 1 million -- or something on that order of magnitude. Whereas the likelihood of coming within 5 or 6 degrees of warming is probably more than 1 in 100. It's the sort of risk that one would not tolerate at a personal level. But, perhaps because we can diffuse responsibility, we feel that it's tolerable for our species to take that gamble with the whole planet. Maybe it's because we just think there's nothing we can do about it. And we have an in-built optimism bias, myself included, where we like to think that things will just turn out all right, because they often tend to. And meantime we'll go on with our lives as normal. It's a big ask, I guess, to make society as a whole forgo the main energy source we all enjoy, which is fossil fuels, in order to forestall uncertain impacts decades into the future.\u000a\u000aSutter: One of the things that struck me from your book is that you were surprised people are depressed by climate change. Isn't this a pretty depressing subject?\u000a\u000aIt doesn't really matter whether you find it depressing or not, it's the scientific reality. We have to deal with it. A thing like climate change is known as a 'wicked problem.' It's seen differently by different people, according to their psychological, political and cultural biases. You can frame it as just a technology challenge: Let's get off of fossil fuels and let's get onto renewables and nuclear -- easy. Or you can frame it as a moral challenge: We're trespassing on the rights of future generations and how dare we do that. Or you can see it as a political challenge -- that somehow these big fossil fuel corporations are transgressing democracy and forcing us to stay hooked on oil and coal and gas. Different people, according to their politics, will see climate change fundamentally in this way. It's not a simple problem to understand.\u000a\u000aSutter: So how do you look at it? Do you ever find climate change overwhelming or depressing, personally?\u000a\u000aWell, I'm a pragmatist. I think it's a solvable problem. I don't think we need to abandon capitalism or change our entire political system in order to tackle this challenge. Other people do, and I disagree with them on that. And we have debates late into the night. But I think with next-generation nuclear technologies, and particularly with the way solar power is developing so rapidly, and how rapidly it's coming down in cost, and how quickly the technology is improving, there are zero-carbon options now becoming much more widely available, which will bring down our emissions much more rapidly than people think -- or than people thought just a few years ago. I don't think there's any point being pessimistic about that. Pessimistic people don't achieve anything. It's important to do what's possible -- and to do it quickly.\u000a\u000aSutter: What do you make of the way the world's responding?\u000a\u000aLynas: We are now inhabiting a human-dominated planet. We are in a new epoch known as the Anthropocene. The Holocene is now considered to be over. And I don't think there's really been another species that has had that effect on the planet before -- maybe the first bacteria that emitted oxygen, or photosynthesizing microorganisms. But we really are into terra incognita looking forward. That gives our species a serious level of responsibility for planetary management that people just don't really appreciate at any kind of fundamental physiological or political level. We are in charge. It's up to us. We actually do have an overall effect on the earth's temp. It's not up to Mother Nature anymore to run the show.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you have children?\u000a\u000aLynas: Yeah. The reason I was distracted just a minute ago was my kids just came back from school.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you talk to them about this? What do you say?\u000a\u000aLynas: I talk to them a bit. They know what I do. Younger generations have grown up with this specter. It's a bit like how those of us who are older grew up with the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation ... So they're not entirely in a different situation, I suppose, from previous generations. You could feel bad for future generations, but on the other hand I'm not sure their future is any worse than the future for somebody born in, say, 1900, who in all likelihood, in Europe, would have killed in one of the world wars. It's a manageable problem. We're beginning to get the grips of it. There are some positive signs already -- China and the U.S. agreeing to peak emissions, and things like that. So it's not a counsel of despair. And I think it's important to talk to kids at that level -- not to make them think that somehow they're fundamentally doomed.\u000a\u000aThat isn't the case and doesn't have to be the case.\u000a\u000aSutter: What needs to happen to ensure things do improve? What are the benchmarks you're looking to to say, 'OK, we're managing this problem. We're doing what's needed'?\u000a\u000aLynas: Well, I'm a Well, I'm a ecomodernist , which is a new label a lot of environmental thinkers are beginning to attach to themselves -- because it's a bit different from more traditional environmentalism, which thought we were somehow doomed or we were fundamentally a destructive species. We can turn this around -- this and other problems as well, if we have a more pragmatic approach to politics, economist -- and especially technology. We need to have a price on carbon, so that emitting carbon dioxide isn't cheaper than other energy sources. We need to invest heavily in research and development in zero-carbon sources, including next-generation nuclear renewable energies, especially solar. And we need to deploy them on an ever wider scale, with increased financing. We also need to have a political agreement -- so there's a sense the whole world is moving in the right direction. All of those things are not just possible, but I think they're fundamentally achievable, and likely. But we need to keep the pressure up on politicians and on everyone else.\u000a\u000aEmail questions to: climate [at] cnn.com.\u000a\u000aFollow the project on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram

And not just any speakeasy -- one dedicated to the life and work of director Quentin Tarantino, who worked at a store called The Video Archive before hitting it big.\u000a\u000aThe bar is the brainchild of Jacob Trevino, a longtime Tarantino fan. "The bar pays homage to not just his films but films that inspired his films," Trevino tells CNN Travel.\u000a\u000aWhile speakeasies are trendy now, The Video Archive manages to feel fun and exclusive without hitting the theme too hard, meaning that non-movie buffs will have just as good a time as hardcore Tarantino fanatics.\u000a\u000aWhat's on offer at The Video Archive.\u000a\u000aThe easiest place to spot the theme is on the drinks menu, which features cocktails such as the Jackie Brown (bourbon, elderflower liqueur, blackberry purée and salted honey) and the Bloody Mia (a Bloody Mary with lemon juice and celery salt on the rim).\u000a\u000aThere's also sake, wine, milkshakes and a healthy representation of beer from the Cincinnati area, including local favorite breweries MadTree and Rhinegeist.\u000a\u000aAnd, of course, the menu wouldn't be complete without food -- specifically, a Royale with Cheese.\u000a\u000aTarantino movies play on a loop behind the bar, and there's a jukebox surrounded by photos of people dressed as Mia Wallace, the Uma Thurman character in "Pulp Fiction" best recognized by her black bob and crisp white button-down.\u000a\u000aOn a wall opposite the bar, a wink at Tarantino's love of violent movie sequences takes the shape of a neon "Bang Bang" sign on a black background.\u000a\u000aWhile the bar has already become a must-visit spot for in-the-know locals and movie buffs, there's still one VIP who hasn't yet had the chance to pull a lucky VHS tape off the wall: the director himself.\u000a\u000a"Mr. Tarantino has an open invitation at the bar that we hope he takes us up on," says Trevino. "We'll have a shot of green chartreuse waiting because, as he famously said, "green chartreuse - a liquor so good they named a color after it."

aVThe mayor of New York wants to tax the city's wealthiest people to help fix its ailing subways.\u000a\u000aMayor Bill de Blasio on Monday proposed raising the city income tax on people who earn more than $500,000 per year and couples who make more than $1 million. That would cover about 32,000 people, roughly 1% of city tax filers.\u000a\u000aDe Blasio said the increase could raise $700 million next year and more than $820 million per year by 2022. The highest marginal income tax rate would rise about half a percentage point to 4.41%.\u000a\u000a"We're not begrudging anyone's success. But the success that many wealthy people have achieved has been because of government policies that favored them," de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a press conference in Brooklyn. "People should pay their fair share."\u000a\u000aThis has become known as the Summer of Hell in New York because of widespread repairs, delays and overcrowding on Amtrak, commuter rails and the New York subway, which is 113 years old and handles 6 million riders each weekday.\u000a\u000aA city survey in June found that almost half of subway riders said service was slightly or far worse than last year. A subway derailment in June injured 39 people and brought the system to a halt.\u000a\u000aRelated: New York's 'Summer of Hell' spreads to subways\u000a\u000aNew York City would not be the first to use a so-called millionaires tax. A handful of states, including California, adopted them after the Great Recession to close budget holes, according to the Tax Foundation, a policy research group.\u000a\u000aAbout $500 million per year from de Blasio's proposed tax increase would go toward signal improvements, new cars and track work. About $250 million would pay for half-priced transit cards for people who can't afford the full cost, about $121 per month.\u000a\u000aA state authority controls the subway, and the tax increase would have to pass the state legislature, where Republicans control the Senate. The majority leader's office did not respond to a request for comment from CNNMoney, but a spokesman for Senate Republicans batted down the idea to The New York Times.\u000a\u000aRelated: New York commuters' 'summer of hell'\u000a\u000aThe chairman of the state authority, Joseph Lhota, has called for the city and state to split the bill for an $800 million rescue package. He said in a statement Monday that the subways need money "right now, not years from now."\u000a\u000aGovernor Andrew Cuomo, a fellow Democrat who has feuded with the mayor, said the city should match the state's money so Lhota's plan can begin right away. "We cannot ask New Yorkers to wait one year to start repairs," he said.

aVGeneration X has a gripe with pulse takers, zeitgeist keepers and population counters. We keep squeezing them out of the frame.\u000a\u000aThis overlooked generation currently ranges in age from 34 to 49, which may be one reason they\u2019re so often missing from stories about demographic, social and political change. They\u2019re smack in the middle innings of life, which tend to be short on drama and scant of theme.\u000a\u000aBut there are other explanations that have nothing to do with their stage of the life cycle.\u000a\u000aGen Xers are bookended by two much larger generations \u2013 the Baby Boomers ahead and the Millennials behind \u2013 that are strikingly different from one another. And in most of the ways we take stock of generations \u2013 their racial and ethnic makeup; their political, social and religious values; their economic and educational circumstances; their technology usage \u2013 Gen Xers are a low-slung, straight-line bridge between two noisy behemoths.\u000a\u000aThe charts below tell the tale.\u000a\u000aTo be fair, there are a few metrics that don\u2019t fit this straightforward pattern of generational evolution. For example, over the course of their voting lives, older Gen Xers have tended to be more Republican than both older Boomers and younger Millennials. Also, Xers are more pessimistic than both of those larger generations that they\u2019ll have enough money for their retirement \u2013 though some of that negativity is doubtless tied to the economic stresses of middle age.\u000a\u000aGen Xers also stand out in another way. In 2010 when Pew Research asked adults of all ages if they thought their own generation was unique, about six-in-ten Boomers and Millennials said yes. But only about half of Gen Xers said the same. And even among those who did, there was very little consensus about why they are distinctive.\u000a\u000aOne reason Xers have trouble defining their own generational persona could be that they\u2019ve rarely been doted on by the media. By contrast, Baby Boomers have been a source of media fascination from the get-go (witness their name). And Millennials, the \u201ceverybody-gets-a-trophy\u201d generation, have been the subject of endless stories about their racial diversity, their political and social liberalism, their voracious technology use, and their grim economic circumstances.\u000a\u000aGen Xers have also gotten the short end of basic generational arithmetic. Due partly to their parents\u2019 relatively low fertility rates, there are fewer of them (65 million) than Boomers (77 million) or Millennials (an estimated 83 million assuming a roughly 20-year age span and including those who have yet to reach adulthood).\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s another reason that Xers are a small generation: They\u2019ve been deemed to span just 16 years, while most generations are credited with lasting for about 20 years. How come? No one really knows. Generational boundaries are fuzzy, arbitrary and culture-driven. Once fixed by the mysterious forces of the zeitgeist, they tend to firm up over time.\u000a\u000aOne final slight: Even their name is a retread. World War II photographer Robert Capa first coined the term Generation X in a photo essay about the young adults of the 1950s, but the label didn\u2019t stick the first time around. It was revived thirty years later by Canadian author Douglas Coupland, whose coming of age novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, was set in Southern California.\u000a\u000aFor Xers, there\u2019s one silver lining in all this. From everything we know about them, they\u2019re savvy, skeptical and self-reliant; they\u2019re not into preening or pampering, and they just might not give much of a hoot what others think of them. Or whether others think of them at all.\u000a\u000aPaul Taylor, executive vice president for special projects at the Pew Research Center, is the author of The Next America: Boomers, Millennials and the Looming Generational Showdown (Public Affairs, 2014). In other words, he\u2019s part of the problem.\u000a\u000aTopics: Demographics, Political Attitudes and Values, Generations and Age

aVStory highlights Xanda was Cecil the lion's eldest son\u000a\u000a6-year-old cub was identified by GPS collar\u000a\u000a(CNN) Cecil the lion's 6-year-old son was shot and killed by a big-game trophy hunter in western Zimbabwe earlier this month, according to a source familiar with the hunt.\u000a\u000aXanda had been tracked with a fitted GPS satellite collar since 2015, the same year his father was killed. His death on July 7 was first indicated by a lack of movement data from the collar.\u000a\u000aThe lion, which was in his prime, had roamed outside the bounds of Hwange National Park and into the Ngamo Forest Area -- land that offers little to no protection for the lions, as game hunters are legally able to shoot for sport there if they possess the right permits.\u000a\u000a"He was shot two kilometers from the park boundary in the Ngamo Forest," said Dr. Andrew Loveridge, a research fellow and project leader with Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit who had fitted Xanda's GPS collar. "As researchers, we are saddened at the death of a well-known study animal we have monitored since birth," he added.\u000a\u000aAccording to the source familiar with the hunt, the safari was led by a professional hunter whose client was a Spanish national. The source said the hunt was a legal expedition and that the outfitter had been properly registered.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood revealed in a new interview that he "had a fight with a touch of lung cancer" that started three months ago.\u000a\u000a"There was a week when everything hung in the balance and it could have been curtains -- time to say goodbye," he said. "You never know what is going to happen."\u000a\u000aWood, who at the age of 68 became a father to twin girls last year, said that after 50 years of smoking, he quit a week before his daughters were born.\u000a\u000a"I had this thought at the back of my mind after I gave up smoking a year ago: "How can I have got through 50 years of chain-smoking -- and all the rest of my bad habits -- without something going on in there," he said.\u000a\u000aIt was while he was getting a routine checkup before going on tour with the Stones that his doctor discovered "I had this supernova burning away on my left lung," Wood said.\u000a\u000aThe musician said there was a week of tests to determine if the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes. Wood decided to stay quiet about the health news and said his wife called it "the worst seven days of her life" as they awaited the test results.\u000a\u000a"I was prepared for bad news but I also had faith it would be OK," Wood said. "Apart from the doctors, we didn't tell anyone because we didn't want to put anyone else though the hell we were going through. But I made up my mind that if it had spread I wasn't going to go through chemo, I wasn't going to use that bayonet in my body."\u000a\u000aWood said he decided against chemo because he wasn't going to part with his famous mop of full hair.\u000a\u000a"A week later they came back with the news that it hadn't spread and I said, 'Let's get it out now,' he said. "Just before I closed my eyes for the operation I looked at the doctor and said, 'Let battle commence.'"\u000a\u000aThe rocker says he's now fine, and will be getting check ups every three months.

aVJohn McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Language changes with the times, and when it comes to our conceptions of gender, the times are most certainly changing.\u000a\u000aWe are opening up to the idea that binary conceptions of gender are unnecessarily rigid and don't correspond to the self-image of a great many people, and even that people's sense of their gender may not correspond to their biological sex. In this new world, a bland opposition between "he" and "she" seems increasingly antique, and even insulting, to many.\u000a\u000aHowever, doing something about that is going to be a challenge. We are dealing not with merely giving new names to new things or actions, which is easy, but with using new pronouns, which is very hard.\u000a\u000aThis is hard because human cognition makes some parts of language more resistant to change than others. Nouns, verbs and adjectives, for example, are like software. It feels natural to add them, subtract them, revise them.\u000a\u000aWe expect them to change from era to era -- of course we now have blogs and twerking when we didn't 20 years ago; of course young people now call "fierce" what their equivalents long ago called "keen," "neat," "wicked," "rad," and so on. They are what linguists call open class words.\u000a\u000aPronouns, however, are closed class words. As shorthand for any thing or concept, pronouns are used so often and so unconsciously that they are more like hardware. A new object or practice is one thing -- but a new "you" or a new "him" or "her"?\u000a\u000aIt's harder to wrap our minds around changing something so cognitively fundamental, just as one does not pop up with new prepositions: You might wish there were a little word to indicate "on as in upside down on a ceiling, rather than on a wall or floor." But if you made one up it wouldn't catch on -- nouns and verbs are lightbulbs; prepositions are the wiring inside the walls.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Getting real: Explicit language on TV in the seventies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Getting real: Explicit language on TV in the seventies 02:51\u000a\u000aSix-thousand years ago, in the ancestor of most of today's European languages on the Ukranian steppes, while most of the language would have seemed like Hittite to us (because it sort of was!), its speakers were using pronouns that sounded roughly like "me," "you," and "we" (not to mention the "tu" familiar from French and Spanish). That's how hardy pronouns are.\u000a\u000aThis is why previous attempts to fashion gender-neutral pronouns haven't caught on (believe it or not, there were once calls for the blend hesh!), and why as clever as today's "ze" is, its evolution from in-house tradition to society-wide acceptance will be slow at least, and possibly ill-fated. Bias alone will play its part, surely, but even without it, new pronouns require a mental effort analogous to conceiving dimensions beyond the third.\u000a\u000aIf anglophones are to accept new pronouns for new times, two things will be necessary. For example, the truth is that one thing that helps people change their pronoun usage is shame. For example, of all the "blackboard grammar" rules that English speakers are schooled in, such as that two negatives mean a positive or that one must say fewer books rather than less books, only one has truly caught on to the extent that it is part of the grammar actual people use comfortably. It is the rule stipulating that one must say "Billy and I went to the store" rather than "Billy and me," because me is "wrong" as a subject.\u000a\u000aThis is a rule no one imposed on English until a couple hundred years ago, and is unheard of in many other languages like French and Swedish. However, for better or for worse, it has been so successfully drilled into our heads as a mark of basic intelligence and propriety.\u000a\u000aNow, I would hope that pronouns like "ze" would not be imposed with the knuckle-rapping and contemptuous indignation with which the Billy and I rule has been promulgated. However, there is room for presenting "ze" as a matter not of fashion, but of basic civility -- people must think of new pronouns as the proper thing to do, not as a stunt.\u000a\u000aTo the extent that societies change their pronoun usage, it tends to involve recasting old pronouns, or even expressions, into new functions. European languages like French, for example, use the plural "vous" to address a single person with respect. Spanish's respectful "usted" began as "your mercy," "vuestra merced," not as a brand new little word imposed by fiat. In this light, our own "they" could be handy as a new way to address people gender-neutrally. Many have called for exactly this.\u000a\u000aAnd not just recently -- English speakers have been using "they" in the singular for eons. In starchy old "Vanity Fair," William Thackeray writes "A person can't help their birth." Today, we spontaneously use sentences such as "Tell each student they should hand in the paper on Tuesday." However, this is another of those things that we are told is a mark of ignorance because "they is plural." However, our new times may require that we get past that notion, which shouldn't be a problem because it has always been absurd.\u000a\u000aAfter all, in French, vous "is plural," yet no one seems to mind. Once upon a time, you "was plural" while thou was used in the singular. Today, you "is" singular as well and no one bats an eye. In the same way, in our "hardware," "they" is both singular and plural. Our new conceptions of gender are a good time to get past the conservatism about singular "they."\u000a\u000aThe naysayers complain about the prospect of sentences like "They is upstairs," but this is a distraction: gender-neutral they should be used, as it has been forever, with plural verb forms: "They are upstairs" will mean that one person is upstairs as well as two or more. "But won't that be confusing?" one may ask -- upon which the answer is another question: When have you been confused as to whether "You are my favorite" referred to yourself or yourself and some other people? Context pulls a great deal of weight in how we communicate.\u000a\u000aAssessing the prospects of new pronouns like ze and recast pronouns like they, my bet would be on they, in terms of the chances that, in 50 years, everybody is on board and on to the next controversy. What we do know, however, is that we are at a point where anglophones will need to accept some kind of change in how we use the language. Call it a teaching moment --language not only never stops changing, but could not.

aVFollow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter\u000a\u000aMIAMI (CBSMiami) \u2014 A passenger brought a loaded gun in a carry-on bag to a security checkpoint at Miami International Airport Friday, the Transportation Security Administration says.\u000a\u000aThe gun was discovered and it became the just the latest in a growing number of guns discovered by TSA screeners at airports across the country.\u000a\u000aTSA says that during the last week of July, screeners discovered 96 guns and lots of ammunition in carry-on bags across the United States. TSA said that is a new record. The agency\u2019s concern with all those guns \u2014 safety.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou see the way people fling their bags onto the x-ray belt in the checkpoints and if one of those guns is loaded and it discharges, there could be a fatal, tragic result,\u201d said TSA spokesperson Sari Koshetz.\u000a\u000aCaptain Rick Liddicott of the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office is the Commander at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport. He said this is an ongoing problem at FLL that is increasing.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are at 47 guns seized at the checkpoints to date,\u201d Liddicott said. \u201cWe had 56 last year, the entire calendar year.\u201d\u000a\u000aTSA says it\u2019s also a big problem nationally. In 2005, the agency discovered 660 guns in carry-on bags across the U.S. and in 2016. That number climbed to nearly 3,400 guns.\u000a\u000aAt FLL, TSA has found five guns in carry-on bags since July 24th including four that were loaded.\u000a\u000aAt MIA, TSA recovered two loaded guns in the past week, including one with a bullet in the chamber. In most of the cases where a traveler brings a gun to the security checkpoint, TSA and BSO said the passengers usually tell authorities they forgot the gun was in their bag.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere isn\u2019t a shred of evidence that any one of them tried to get that on the aircraft intentionally, were gonna do harm to anyone here or anywhere else. They just simply are irresponsible gun owners,\u201d Liddicott said.\u000a\u000aThe goal is to stop guns from reaching the airport security area.\u000a\u000a\u201cKnow where your firearm is at and check your bag before you come here,\u201d Liddicott said.\u000a\u000aIf you bring a gun to an airport security checkpoint, you could face serious consequences. You could be arrested and you will likely face a civil penalty from TSA of up to $12,000. You can travel with your gun but you must secure it and check it and let the airline know that it\u2019s part of your luggage.

"At first it's a wild visual to see, somebody Asian rapping that way, killing it in a video," said Miyashiro of the label's appeal.\u000a\u000aThe company, which is known for its slew of massive viral video hits and collaborations with established American artists such as Ghostface Killah and Skrillex, has reached a sort of cult status among fans, especially those in Asia.\u000a\u000a"Our artists and our brand is the most influential in Asia because we aren't coming from some manufactured pop machine. We are the tip of the sphere of a new face of music," said Miyashiro. "The reason for that is we are the first label that actually is making impact in the West and East."\u000a\u000aJapanese-Korean Brooklynite Sean Miyashiro\u000a\u000aStraight outta China\u000a\u000aBut 88 Rising acts are not the first Asian faces to make inroads in America.\u000a\u000aIn 2004, Chinese American rapper MC Jin made headlines after winning numerous freestyle battles, before later signing to the well-known hip-hop label Ruff Ryders.\u000a\u000a"It was good that Jin and people like that existed to trailblaze the way, but it's a completely different era now," said Miyashiro. "I think with social media, people are used to seeing Asian people in general ... and the world is more open."\u000a\u000aCompared with MC Jin's debut single "Learn Chinese," Higher Brothers' online hit "Made in China" offers more of a nuanced take on modern Asian identity. Both songs mix English and Chinese lyrics, but the Higher Brothers go deeper, poking fun at themselves. (Sample lyric: "My chains, new gold watch, made in China. We play ping-pong ball, made in China.") In the video, which has so far racked up more than 3 million hits on YouTube, they don China Olympics track suits and Chun Li-style buns, all the while rapping in a slow Dirty South-like drawl.\u000a\u000aUnlike themes common in US hip-hop, the Higher Brothers rap about their everyday lives, with songs about 7-11 convenience stores and the social media platform WeChat. Their lyrics alternate between the profane and the profound. One of their emcees, Melo, even got in trouble with China's notorious censors over a viral song about Uber that featured the lines, "I don't write political hip-hop. But if any politicians try to shut me up, I'll cut off their heads and lay them at their corpses' feet."\u000a\u000aWe're "straight outta China!" said band member MasiWei of the band's unique style and attitude, adding that "nothing" is off limits to the group.\u000a\u000aHigher Brothers, who have four singles off their latest album "Black Cab," attribute their new-found popularity with American audiences to 88 Rising.\u000a\u000a"It's so exciting. We're all Asian, but we have a different culture and style," said MasiWei, of working with the label.\u000a\u000aThe 24-year-old added that while language can sometimes be a barrier, their goals are "the same."\u000a\u000aChengdu rap crew HIgher Brothers\u000a\u000a"Generally, people are very supportive," said Rich Chigga, who is ethnically Chinese. "When I came to America [for his summer five-city tour] and I met with all these rappers I talked to online, they showed a lot of love ... There was probably just a few racist YouTube comments, but that was really it."\u000a\u000aBrian Imanuel, better known as "Rich Chigga," in Miami\u000a\u000aIn some ways, their paths seem to be easier than their Asian-American counterparts'.\u000a\u000a"We grow up in America, getting slotted into a lane and having to follow the American societal norms, political norms, etc., but these guys are free from all that," said Andrew Fung, half of Fung Bros ., a Chinese-American duo popular on YouTube, who collaborated with Higher Brothers. "They're Asian from Asian countries, so there's cultural space for them to be more fluid. They get to be who they want to be, say what they want to say and it's refreshing."\u000a\u000aUp next for 88 Rising are more tours and more artists, as well as maybe adding a female artist to the lineup. Rich Chigga just finished a summer tour and is going on a wider US tour in the fall. Higher Brothers is playing a China-wide tour, with a sold-out concert in Hong Kong in August and a November appearance at Clockenflap , Hong Kong's massive music festival, whose lineup includes Massive Attack, Feist and The Dandy Warhols.\u000a\u000aJoji, Keith Ape and Rich Chigga\u000a\u000a88 Rising is also bringing American artists to Asia.\u000a\u000a"People are coming to us to collaborate now. We're the tastemakers," said Miyashiro. "They want to be big in Asia and appreciate our freshness and unique point of view."

aV(CNN) With the June arrival of their twins , actor George Clooney, 55, and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, 39, reignited a conversation about what it means to be an older dad.\u000a\u000aDespite growing awareness of in-vitro fertilization and aging mothers -- such as Janet Jackson, who gave birth in January at 50 -- some of the science and social impacts of aging fathers are less clear. But that isn't deterring hopeful dads from growing their families.\u000a\u000a"It's very well-documented: Men are having children later into life," said Dr. Mary Samplaski , a male-fertility specialist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California. "It's become so much more mainstream."\u000a\u000aMen's fertility does not drop as sharply as women's as they age, said Samplaski; many can have biological children long after they're old and gray without the need for technology to intervene. But some of Samplaski's patients have questions about the risks of fathering later in life.\u000a\u000aIVF success and struggle\u000a\u000aOne risk for older would-be dads is the potential success of in vitro fertilization, a medical procedure where the woman's egg is fertilized by a man's sperm in a test tube and then introduced into her womb.\u000a\u000aAmong couples requiring IVF to conceive a baby, the likelihood of a live birth is reduced with a father's increasing age, according to a new study presented at a medical conference recently. This is the first study to show that the father's age is a factor in IVF success.\u000a\u000aHarvard researchers analyzed nearly 19,000 IVF cycles performed for 7,753 couples at a Boston area reproductive center between 2000 and 2014. After stratifying the female and male participants into age groups, they compared the ages to successful births.\u000a\u000aLive birth rates were lowest in couples where the female partner was between ages 40 and 42, the researchers discovered. In these circumstances, the male partner's age, whether old or young, did not impact the results. However, when the female was younger than 40, the likelihood of a live birth declined with the increasing age of the male partner.\u000a\u000aFor example, a woman under 30 partnered with a man between 40 and 42 years old suffered lower birth rates (46%) than same-aged women whose partners were between the ages of 30 and 35. Paired with a younger man, nearly three out of four of these young women successfully gave birth.\u000a\u000aThe same was true even among women in the next older age group, between 35 and 40. In these cases, women whose partners were under 30 experienced a nearly 30% improvement in their odds of a successful birth compared to women paired with men between age 30 and 35, the authors said.\u000a\u000aKnowing the risks\u000a\u000aSwedish study in 2014 added to the evidence that dads older than 45 are more likely to have children with schizophrenia, autism and other psychiatric disorders. Still, even for these fathers, the absolute risk was found to be very low -- well below 1% for certain conditions.\u000a\u000aFor one man who saw the study, the findings pushed him into action.\u000a\u000a"I reported on a big study that came out in 2014, and I thought a lot about it, and a few months later, I went and banked my own sperm," former CNN producer William Hudson said in August.\u000a\u000a"I banked my sperm because I wanted to have the option of using younger sperm later in life."\u000a\u000aTo explain the link between mental illness and paternal age, researchers have pointed to the mutations that accumulate in sperm DNA as men get older, which may be inherited by their sons and daughters.\u000a\u000aThere are no genetic tests for psychiatric illnesses such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, Samplaski said.\u000a\u000aHowever, last year, another study in Nature Genetics took an opposing view: Spontaneous mutations in sperm DNA were not largely to blame for the increased risk of psychiatric illness. The researchers found that genes might contribute to this risk, but only a small portion of it -- about 10% to 20%.\u000a\u000aA closer look at the data shows that mental illness isn't just linked to older fathers; there's a risk among younger fathers , too. Some researchers say the focus on mutations could be a red herring. According to the authors of the Nature Genetics study, fathers with a heritable mental illness may simply be more likely to have children at the extremes of age -- perhaps because they socialize or take risks differently.\u000a\u000aThough a similar trend has been found for IQ scores, other studies have refuted those results by taking into account paternal intelligence.\u000a\u000aA number of other conditions have been linked to late fatherhood. One of the most common is a type of dwarfism called achondroplasia, for which there is a genetic test. For men over 50, the risk of achondroplasia is only slightly more common than 1 in 2,000 births.\u000a\u000aHowever, no strong data exist to suggest that children of older parents actually live longer. Some doctors have proposed that aging sperm may come with a benefit: longer telomeres . Telomeres are the tips of chromosomes that protect DNA while it's being copied -- like the aglet at the end of a shoelace that prevents it from fraying. Many scientists believe that longer telomeres signify longevity.However, no strong data exist to suggest that children of older parents actually live longer.\u000a\u000aSamplaski said the risks that concern her patients are not always genetic. For many, it's a simple numbers game.\u000a\u000a"If you're 55 when you have this baby, you're going to be 65 when this kid is 10," she said, adding that people's numerical age may not always be the best predictor of their life expectancy.\u000a\u000a"Most of the couples that are having babies later in life are taking care of themselves."\u000a\u000aToo old for this?\u000a\u000a"I got tons of blowback about it," said freelance writer and television producer Philip Lerman, who has written about his decision to become a father at 46.\u000a\u000aAfter the Clooneys' news spread on social media, some on Twitter compared George Clooney to a grandfather. Lerman said the reactions he received mirrored that.\u000a\u000aIn one Humans of New York photo that drew more than 70,000 responses, a young woman with a 78-year-old father said that it's "hard to be this young and watch them go that way already."\u000a\u000aWhile some children of older parents commented about the difficulties caring for sick and aging parents, others spoke of the valuable lessons they had learned from parents with more life experience.\u000a\u000aAnother story that drew strong responses was a 2011 New York Magazine cover story featuring a white-haired model who was digitally altered to look pregnant placed next to the headline, "Is she just too old for this?" In response to the article, which addressed both men and women, some readers called out aging parents for being "selfish," lamented not having grandparents in the picture and expressed worry about older parents' mortality.\u000a\u000aLerman, now 61, has a 14-year-old son named Max, whom he and his wife conceived using a donor egg. People told Lerman he was "too old" to have a child for many of these reasons. Some suggested that he would have trouble keeping up with a kid and that he might put his future son at risk for genetic diseases.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I took a chance on having ... a child with problems," Lerman said, adding that it's important to think about the alternative.\u000a\u000a"What if I had listened to them?" he added. "What if ... Max didn't exist, and he didn't get to play Little League, and he didn't get to be the star in the school play last year?"\u000a\u000aLerman admits that he "can't do the things that a younger man can" but said children like Max benefit from parents who have taken time to become more emotionally and financially stable. Where some have criticized his age, Lerman believes that older parents are just one manifestation of the diverse American family.\u000a\u000a"Max has an older dad; his friend has two dads," Lerman said. "We've got adopted kids, multiracial kids. It's a beautiful, wonderful mix in our school."

aVNot many banks have a cult following. Monzo is a rare exception.\u000a\u000aMore than 100,000 Brits have signed up for the smartphone bank that claims it will revolutionize banking.\u000a\u000aSeveral mobile-only banks have been launched in the U.K., including Atom and Tandem, but Monzo has quickly become the most popular.\u000a\u000aMonzo was founded two years ago by Tom Blomfield, a former Oxford law student who had previously co-founded GoCardless, a direct debit provider.\u000a\u000aDeeply frustrated with traditional banks, he decided he could do better.\u000a\u000aBlomfield said his cards would be blocked when he made payments abroad -- even though he had told his bank he was going on holiday. Fees were charged for cash withdrawals overseas, or for overdrafts he knew nothing about. And when his bank was suffering problems with its systems, there was a lack of communication.\u000a\u000a"It's just amazing that there's literally so much control and power at our fingertips and banking hasn't really adopted any of that," he said.\u000a\u000aMonzo offers something rather different to main street banks and their digital offshoots. It sends you a notification every time you make a purchase, and won't charge you when you travel.\u000a\u000aExchanged £90 at the post office and got \u20ac90.\u000a\u000aPaid for a \u20ac93 @Deliveroo whilst in Berlin and @monzo charged £79.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYES, MONZO LAD \U0001f91c\U0001f3fc \u2014 Emma Ware (@EmmaCWare) February 13, 2017\u000a\u000aIt allows you to track purchases in real time, temporarily freeze your card if you've lost it and help you stick to a strict monthly budget.\u000a\u000aEverything Monzo does seems like a no-brainer. Blomfield says that's because he had no experience in traditional banking.\u000a\u000a"Having the baggage of experience sometimes is a hindrance because you have this fairly rigid view of the status quo. (Monzo) started from scratch, so there's almost a value in that naivity and not having any preconceptions," he said.\u000a\u000aFor now, Monzo's limited banking license (granted in August 2016) only allows it to support pre-paid Mastercards that you have to top up using Apple pay or a bank transfer.\u000a\u000aBut Blomfield expects the restrictions to be lifted "very shortly." This would allow Monzo to offer classic checking accounts, starting in the next few months.\u000a\u000aDespite the limited services, Monzo is generating an enthusiastic following on social media.\u000a\u000aRecently signed up with challenger bank @Monzo - loving the simplicity and UX already \u2014 Francesca Russell (@FranRussel1) February 24, 2017\u000a\u000aFirst month using @monzo and I'm far too excited to manage my banking #amianadultyet ?\U0001f4b3 \u2014 Alice Wells (@wellsalice) February 23, 2017\u000a\u000aBy being open about how it develops its product, Blomfield says Monzo has been able to create a product people actually enjoy using and find valuable enough to tell their friends about it.\u000a\u000a"It's a virtuous cycle of reinforcement," he said.\u000a\u000aTo avoid being overwhelmed, the startup makes new customers wait a week for their hot coral debit cards.\u000a\u000aMonzo has yet to make a profit. But Blomfield says he expects that will change when it's able to offer full bank accounts -- particularly from overdrafts.\u000a\u000a"Monzo will tell you up front even before you've overdrawn that you're running out of cash. It'll tell you: Here's how much it'll cost you if you borrow -- you'll never be charged more than X pounds. Do you want to take this, yes or no?"\u000a\u000a@ianjamescox The second @monzo current accounts become available I'm switching. App, customer support is light years ahead of current banks \u2014 Callum Strong (@csscallum) February 23, 2017\u000a\u000aBlomfield's plan doesn't end with checking accounts. Ultimately he wants Monzo to allow users to file expense reports to their employers, split bills with their partner or roommates, and even check whether they're getting the best deal on gas and electricity -- all within one app.

aVTehran's busy streets have five times as many taxis as New York, offering huge potential for a ride-hailing app.\u000a\u000aAnd with Uber locked out of the Iran for the foreseeable future due to U.S. sanctions, startup Snapp is seizing its chance to become the leading local player.\u000a\u000a"The Iranian Uber" launched in 2014. Its current CEO, Shahram Shahkar, joined early last year.\u000a\u000a"I felt that there was this underdeveloped market that I could potentially use the skills and experience that I've gained abroad to help develop further," Shahkar, who previously studied and worked in the U.K. and Canada, told CNN.\u000a\u000aSnapp is available on iOS and Android and also has an Apple Watch version. The app promises to find its users a ride in less than five minutes.\u000a\u000aRelated: Who stands to lose if U.S. hits Iran with sanctions again?\u000a\u000aShahkar said his company -- backed by South African mobile firm MTN -- has seen the number of rides grow by 70% a month on average during the past year. It has hired more than 400 people in that time and now has 120,000 active drivers.\u000a\u000aIt offers four services, including Snapp Rose, which provides female drivers for women and families.\u000a\u000aIn designing the app, Shahkar took account of other local market factors. To begin with, it bans the customary haggling that often takes place between Iranian vendors and their customers.\u000a\u000a"From day one, we have used pre-trip pricing to show the cost of the trip to both the passenger and the driver," Shahkar said.\u000a\u000aAnd he had to work around sanctions that left the country with few links to international banking and no credit card networks. People using Snapp either have to pay cash or use a debit card issued by an Iranian bank.\u000a\u000aSome sanctions were eased at the beginning of 2016 after Iran agreed to rein in its nuclear program. That has allowed Iran to pump more oil, giving a boost to the economy. The International Monetary Fund expects it to grow 3.3% this year and 4.3% in 2018.\u000a\u000aCompanies such as France's Total (TOT) and Germany's Volkswagen (VLKAF) have moved quickly to take advantage of Iran's potential. Airbus (EADSF) and Boeing (BA) have signed deals to sell hundreds of airplanes to Iranian carriers.\u000a\u000aRelated: Iran signs $2 billion gas deal with France's Total\u000a\u000aMost of Iran's 80 million people are under 30, and many of them, like Hossein Chardoli, are desperate for jobs. Unable to find work as a hardware engineer, he now drives for Snapp and makes about $900 a month, more than the average income in Iran.\u000a\u000aChardoli is hoping Snapp's rapid growth will continue so he can earn even more.\u000a\u000a"It would mean I can go from one city to another and make more even more money," he told CNN.\u000a\u000aHe may not have long to wait. Snapp is already available in four cities and will "soon be covering all the major cities of Iran," Shakhar said.\u000a\u000aSnapp claims to have 80% of the market but doesn't have Iran's streets entirely to itself. Other local apps such as Tap30 and Carpino are vying for a share.\u000a\u000aBut like Uber, big regional competitors are steering clear of Iran for the time being.\u000a\u000aCareem, which is based in Dubai and operates in more than 70 cities in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, said it has no plans to enter Iran.\u000a\u000a-- Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Shahram Shahkar as the founder of Snapp.

aVPrevention of these and other adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) should be society's primary goal. However, these experiences continue to be pervasive and are often left unresolved for adult survivors.\u000a\u000aThe time has come for all systems engaged with the care of children to tackle this problem head-on. By building children's resilience early in their lives, we can better prepare them to handle past and future trauma and grow into healthy adults.\u000a\u000aHealthy attachment starts early in life\u000a\u000aFor children, building resilience means learning skills that can increase their ability to manage and regulate their emotions and response to stress.\u000a\u000aOne key way to build resilience is to strengthen families. This can include teaching caregivers about child development, providing concrete help in times of need and bolstering their abilities to manage stress and develop positive social connections.\u000a\u000aThese are just some of the ways to provide a safe and supportive environment where children can develop a strong bond with their caregivers. Research shows that healthy, securely attached children are less likely to show separation anxiety. Meanwhile, insecurely attached children tend to be avoidant and struggle to express negative feelings.\u000a\u000aThe quality of caregiver-child attachment can be affected by everything from facial expressions to the type of touch caregivers provide.\u000a\u000aDeveloping healthy attachment early in life helps children learn to better self-regulate (PDF). These children will display an ability to express their feelings openly and exhibit less fear and avoidance of the parent. In addition, adults' attachment style with their own children is highly influenced by the quality of the relationship they once had with their caregivers.\u000a\u000aACEs disrupt the development of healthy caregiver-child attachment. For example, parents with depression or substance use problems may be unavailable to care for their children and provide the support they need. In fact, in a recent study, ACEs were found to be associated with unresolved attachment style in adulthood. These early life events can increase the risk of substance use, which is often used as a coping mechanism.\u000a\u000aHelping children cope\u000a\u000aThe home is not the only place where children can experience trauma. Trauma can be experienced in multiple ways and contexts -- from problems at school to natural disasters that hit the community.\u000a\u000aFor example, when teachers observe a child having behavioral difficulties, they must be prepared to respond in a calm and nonreactive manner. Adults must be aware of their own stresses and triggers in order to avoid potentially retraumatizing the children they care for. Children need to be reassured they are in a safe, supportive and caring environment.\u000a\u000aAdults can help children physiologically relax by providing sensory inputs that calm the stress response. For example, listening to sounds that are calming, breathing deeply and taking a walk can help individuals bring the nervous system back to a balanced state. Yoga, creative arts and journaling can also help children relax and process negative emotions.\u000a\u000aIncreasing awareness\u000a\u000aOnce a traumatic event occurs, it cannot be undone. But early intervention can help children recover quickly and more successfully. Therefore, the better informed we are about the signs and symptoms of trauma, the better we will be able to recognize them.\u000a\u000aTrauma-informed care (PDF) takes adverse experiences into account. This approach emphasizes safety and encourages empowerment throughout the recovery process. Ultimately, it's about changing the culture of how we work with children and adults.\u000a\u000aTo fully embrace trauma-informed care, we must first build awareness that childhood stress and trauma is widespread across the population. Second, anyone who works with child or adult survivors must learn to recognize the symptoms of trauma and stress. Some of these include (PDF) anxiety, depression, problems with emotional regulation, hyperactivity, substance abuse and eating disorders.\u000a\u000aCurrently, there is controversy in the public health and medical community over whether we should ever assess for ACEs in adults and children. Some worry that asking about childhood experiences may open Pandora's box. "What do we do when we find out about trauma?" This is a natural response for individuals working in systems that do not have knowledge, skills or experiences about evidence-based approaches to trauma healing and recovery.\u000a\u000aHowever, if we want to provide trauma-informed care, we need assessments (PDF) to have a better understanding of the population overall for treatment and recovery. Assessment should only be conducted if there are appropriate programs and treatments to refer individuals or families.\u000a\u000aWhile more institutions, such as schools, are now starting to assess childhood trauma, we must be cautious in reading too much into what that trauma means. Assessment is not a means to diagnose, judge or label individuals. It is a tool that informs us about who we are working with and helps us foster understanding and compassion.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIf organizations want to provide trauma-informed care, they will need commitment from leadership and staff to change their organization's culture. This means implementing policies that focus on safe, supportive and collaborative environments. It means accepting that our society has experienced historical, cultural and gender-related trauma. There must be recognition by everyone that we all come from different backgrounds and experiences, which make us who we are.\u000a\u000aAll of this may be difficult to embrace. But we must equip our children -- the future of society -- with the skills for their physiological and psychological resilience so that they can lead healthy, productive lives.

aVErrol Louis is the host of "Inside City Hall," a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The Trump administration has shifted its approach on health care repeal, tax reform, infrastructure and other major campaign promises.\u000a\u000aThat's not going to happen with immigration.\u000a\u000aWhy? Trump's avid support of newly proposed immigration legislation reflects a longstanding fear among some conservative Republicans that our current, family-based immigration system will result in millions of new African, Asian and Latin American newcomers -- people who will eventually acquire full citizenship and end up voting for Democrats.\u000a\u000aConservative pundit Ann Coulter laid out the problem succinctly in her 2015 book, "Adios, America." "There is simply no reason for Republicans to legalize 30 million people who will vote 8-2 against them," she wrote\u000a\u000aFrom a strategy perspective, she has a point. "The number of Hispanic immigrant eligible voters is projected to double, from 3.3 million in 2000 to a projected 6.6 million in 2016," reports the Pew Research Center\u000a\u000aBetween 2012 and 2016, a hefty 1.2 million Latino immigrants became eligible to vote , and according to sociologist Mindy Romero , "by 2040, the US Census Bureau projects that Latinos will be 28.6% of the total US population, up from the current 17%."\u000a\u000aThis growing group of Latinos is clustered in swing states like Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Nevada. And when they go to the polls, they tend to vote for Democrats\u000a\u000aAll of which has been noted by Republican strategists with alarm. Trump's victory depended on a surge among white voters and lower participation by blacks, but that pattern is not guaranteed to repeat in the future.\u000a\u000aThe solution, according to Coulter and other movement Conservatives, is to change the rules of the system, which, they say, encourages so-called "chain migration" by giving preference in the immigration system to family members of current immigrants.\u000a\u000aBy replacing family preference with extra points for speaking English, bringing money or holding an advanced degree -- as the new legislation, supported by the Trump administration, proposes -- conservatives hope to close the spigot on the flow of immigrants likely to vote Democratic.\u000a\u000aAs the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies has pointed out, "if legal immigration levels remain at the current levels of over one million a year, it will likely continue to undermine Republicans' political prospects moving forward. ... Conversely, lowering the level of legal immigration in the future would help stem the decline in the Republican vote."\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aFor many Republicans, changing the rule is a political life-or-death issue. As Coulter warns, "there's no sense in arguing about any other political issue. If we lose immigration, we lose everything."\u000a\u000aThat logic means Republicans will likely put up a ferocious battle to change the rules on immigration. This will engage not just the White House, but the broader party, which sees the fight as a matter of political survival.

aVMoscow (CNN) President Vladimir Putin has hit back at new American sanctions by ordering the US to cut staff at its diplomatic mission by 755, in Moscow's most aggressive move against Washington since the final years of the Cold War.\u000a\u000aPutin confirmed the move Sunday after the Foreign Ministry on Friday demanded the US cut staff numbers and announced a rash of other measures against Washington's missions.\u000a\u000aThe measures came after the US Congress passed a bill last week imposing fresh sanctions over Russia's meddling in the US' 2016 election. President Donald Trump has indicated he will sign the sanctions bill into law.\u000a\u000aThe response represents a sharp downturn in US-Russia relations after signs that Trump wanted to develop a new partnership with Moscow.\u000a\u000aIf Russian state media figures are correct, the forced reduction in staff numbers would gut the US mission. Putin was quoted as saying 755 out of "a thousand or so" employees would "have to stop their activities in the Russian Federation." That number would include diplomats and technical workers, he said.\u000a\u000aIt is not clear how many of those staff members are US citizens, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the US can decide which people to dismiss.\u000a\u000a"We waited a long time for things to perhaps change for the better," state media quoted Putin as saying. "We had such hope that the situation would change, but judging by the situation that will not be soon."\u000a\u000aHe added: "I thought it was time for us to show that we will not leave this without an answer. As for other possible measures, or whether it is a lot or not, this is quite sensible from the point of view of the work of the diplomatic department."\u000a\u000aPutin delayed retaliating to sanctions imposed at the end of Barack Obama's presidency in 2016, when the US expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the country and seized two compounds used by Russian missions. Those actions were in response to Russia's election meddling, as well as its continued military aggression in Ukraine.\u000a\u000aPutin is now seeking to reduce the number of US diplomats in Russia to 455, a figure equal to the number of Russian diplomats now in the United States, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Friday, giving a deadline of September 1 for the cuts.\u000a\u000aThe United States has not identified how many diplomatic employees are in Russia.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, a senior US State Department official responded to Russia's demand, saying, "This is a regrettable and uncalled for act. We are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it."\u000a\u000aThe Russian Foreign Ministry on Friday demanded that the US cut its diplomatic staff in Russia and said it would seize two US diplomatic properties, a Moscow storage facility and a country house outside the capital. Russia was set to take over the properties effective August 1.\u000a\u000aThreats made earlier\u000a\u000aEarlier Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov had threatened further retaliation would be coming.\u000a\u000a"If the US side decides to move further towards further deterioration, we will answer, we will respond in kind," Ryabkov said on ABC's "This Week."\u000a\u000a"We will mirror this. We will retaliate. ... But my whole point is, don't do this, it is to the detriment of the interests of the US."\u000a\u000aA request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.\u000a\u000aBill would block Trump from easing sanctions\u000a\u000aThe bill, which passed the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 98-2, would also give Congress new power to stop Trump from easing sanctions against Moscow.\u000a\u000aThis bill would set into law penalties the Obama administration imposed against Russia in December for meddling in the US election last year and for its aggression in Ukraine.\u000a\u000aCongress is investigating Russian hacking into the 2016 elections. US intelligence agencies say Russia intervened to tip the election toward Trump.

aV(CNN) There have been times even Roger Federer has thought of walking away from it all.\u000a\u000aA stage before his name was immortalized and the records fell; a period in his glittering career when defeat was more common than victory.\u000a\u000a"It was tough," Federer tells CNN Sport, reflecting on his early years on the ATP Tour.\u000a\u000a"When I traveled internationally I would get beat up very often in the first round 6-2, 6-3. You go home and realize: 'Okay, you're good in Basel but you're not very good in the world.'"\u000a\u000aFederer knew he had a bright future \u2014 a junior Wimbledon title at the age of 16 proved that \u2014 but it took him three years to win his first ATP final.\u000a\u000aAs a boy he would often cry if he lost a match, hiding behind the umpire's chair. As he entered his adolescence, that sensitivity occasionally took the form of petulance.\u000a\u000a"When I was 12 years old, I was just horrible," Federer admitted in a 2003 interview with the Telegraph.\u000a\u000aOnlooking parents were banished and told to "go and have a drink." Rackets, on more than one occasion, were smashed.\u000a\u000aFederer, urbane idol to millions around the world, even walked away from one professional tournament on the Swiss circuit having made a financial loss, after the referee deemed he had violated the "best effort" ruling.\u000a\u000aIt took time to master his emotions and reach the state of tranquility he emanates on court today. It also required sacrifice, with Federer having to decide between football and tennis as a teen.\u000a\u000aAsked by CNN Sport earlier this year what separates the great from the good, he takes a second to consider.\u000a\u000a"His aura, his longevity," Federer replies. "What did he bring to his sport? Did he change the sport forever? What was his impact?\u000a\u000a"Popularity, style ... Was he a good role model? I think all of these things matter."\u000a\u000aBoy to man\u000a\u000aHis talent has never been in doubt.\u000a\u000aAfter emerging victorious in both the singles and the doubles on the 1998 junior circuit at the All England Club, Federer reached the final of the junior US Open and won Florida's Orange Bowl Championship \u2014 joining a prestigious group of former champions including Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Björn Borg.\u000a\u000a"I went from boy to man a little bit," he says. "My body grew ... I realized I could serve big [and] all of a sudden hang with tour players.\u000a\u000a"I knew there was nobody better than the tour players; that's when the dream became a reality.\u000a\u000aA teenage Federer is pictured relaxing on a beach in Key Biscayne, Florida.\u000a\u000a"Who knows," the young man thought, "maybe I could become top 100 in the world at one point?"\u000a\u000aFittingly enough the Bernese Alps were the scene of his first ever ATP tournament, with Federer traveling to the clay-court Swiss Open in Gstaad.\u000a\u000aThe No. 702 bowed out in the first round in straight sets, but he wouldn't have to wait long before his first breakthrough.\u000a\u000aSeptember 30, 1998: The day the best male tennis player of all time secured the first of over 1,000 career match victories on the ATP tour, beating world No. 45 Guillame Raoux at the Toulouse Open.\u000a\u000aFederer went on to reach the quarterfinals in what was just his second ever ATP tournament, losing to the eventual winner, Jan Siemerink.\u000a\u000aIt moved him up over 400 places in the world rankings, and secured a wildcard spot at the upcoming Swiss Indoors \u2014 a tournament he'd been a ballboy at just four years before.\u000a\u000aThere he faced none other than eight-time grand slam winner Andre Agassi in the first round \u2014 a brush with the big boys that lasted less than an hour.\u000a\u000aThe Federer decade\u000a\u000aAt the turn of the millennium, Federer was the youngest man in the top 100 and the tennis world was sitting up and taking notice.\u000a\u000a"I was nervous," Federer says, admitting it was still a novelty trading shots with established stars.\u000a\u000a"I'd always wanted to be in that position ... playing against the guys you knew from TV, it was super cool."\u000a\u000aThe carpets of the Milan Indoors were the scene of Federer's first ever ATP trophy in February 2001, but the watershed moment of his early career occurred five months later at Wimbledon.\u000a\u000aThe king of Wimbledon, Pete Sampras, is dethroned.\u000a\u000aPete Sampras vs. Federer. The king vs. the young pretender. The first and only time the boy from Basel would ever play against his idol. A changing of the guard.\u000a\u000aComing into the fourth round clash, Sampras had more grand slam singles titles than any man in history, and hadn't lost a single match at the All England Club for five years -- only failing to win the prestigious tournament once between 1993 and 2000.\u000a\u000aHe left quietly, dethroned by a teenager.\u000a\u000a"There are a lot of young guys coming up," Sampras reflected , "but Roger is a bit extra special."\u000a\u000aFederer himself puts his success down to "drive" as much as transcendental talent.\u000a\u000aFor while the young Swiss was knocked out by home favorite Tim Henman in the 2001 quarterfinal, and stung by Croatian grand slam debutant Mario Ancic in the Wimbledon first round a year later, he's been returning to Centre Court ever since like he owned the place.\u000a\u000a"When you're young, it's very important to have that drive \u2014 even when you're defeated \u2014 to go back and hit up against a wall or a cupboard like I did," Federer says.\u000a\u000a"You do maybe take the hammer and the nail and put the racket up against a wall and say I'm going to walk away from it all ... but five minutes later you're going to pick it up again and you're going to play again. Hard work is key. Probably more than 50% of success at that point."\u000a\u000aAfter that shock defeat to Ancic, ranked No. 158 at the time, Federer didn't lose again on grass for six years.\u000a\u000aFrom July 2003 to September 2007, the game's undisputed star won 12 of the 18 Grand Slam titles on offer, sweeping aside all before him in Melbourne, London and New York.\u000a\u000aAn Olympic gold medal followed in Beijing, but one final frontier still eluded him: Roland Garros.\u000a\u000aThe career grand slam\u000a\u000aClay was the domain of another man, Rafa Nadal, and between 2006 and 2008 Federer had fallen to the Spaniard in three consecutive finals.\u000a\u000aJune 7, 2009: The day Federer finally lifted La Coupe des Mousquetaires, beating Sweden's Robin Soderling to equal Sampras's major record (14) and complete the coveted career grand slam.\u000a\u000aFederer called it his "greatest victory," breaking down in tears before a packed crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, telling them "now I can play in peace for the rest of my career."\u000a\u000aRoger Federer kisses the French Open trophy, having beaten Sweden's Robin Söderling (6-1, 7-6, 6-4) to complete the career grand slam.\u000a\u000aDetractors had questioned his desire, asking whether this elegant artisan was really up for the long slog on clay.\u000a\u000aBut Federer sat down with CNN Sport that day with the proof in his hands.\u000a\u000a"I always believed that I was good enough to get it," he said, "but actually holding this trophy after all that I've been through is an unbelievable feeling."\u000a\u000a"This victory comes at the right time because I've proved many people wrong."\u000a\u000aAsked what was left to motivate him after reaching the pinnacle of his sport, Federer alluded to his first ever Wimbledon victory.\u000a\u000a"It was all I ever wanted," he smiled. "But I kept coming back and won it again and again and again."\u000a\u000a"That's what champions want to do: they want to come back and prove themselves over and again.\u000a\u000a"I love the game too much to walk away from it; it's given me all I ever wanted."\u000a\u000aA rivalry revisited\u000a\u000aIf Martina Navratilova had echoed the prevailing sentiment in 2009 when she said the newly-crowned French Open champion could now "just go on and sip Margaritas for the rest of his life," Federer himself had no intention of letting up.\u000a\u000aHis 2017 Australian Open final win against Rafa Nadal was a triumph of longevity \u2014 his first major title for five years and one that and that made him the oldest male grand slam winner since Roy Emerson in 1967.\u000a\u000a"It's really strange to me," the 35-year-old told CNN Sport in January, having expected to reach "a fourth round or a quarterfinal" at best.\u000a\u000a"The first time I actually believed I could win the title was maybe Saturday or Sunday morning; I just started seeing flashes of me with the trophy."\u000a\u000aHad Federer not fought back from 3-1 down in the fifth set \u2014 beating his friend and long-time nemesis in a major final for the first time in ten years \u2014 Nadal could have closed the all-time gap between them to just two grand slams with his favored French Open to follow.\u000a\u000aNow though Federer's tally of 18 looks unlikely to be beaten.

aV(CNN) You've probably heard that expression "you are what you eat."\u000a\u000aThere's a lot more truth to it than you may think, due to the 100 trillion microbes that make up your microbiome: a combination of fungi, bacteria and viruses that resides in your gut, primarily in the large intestine.\u000a\u000aResearchers estimate the total surface area of the human gut at 3,000 square feet -- larger than a tennis court -- with the number of microbes in it outnumbering human cells 10 to one.\u000a\u000aThough words like "bacteria" and "fungi" might commonly be associated with infections or disease, the ones found in the microbiome are the peacekeepers of your body, helping digest food, fight disease and regulate the immune system.\u000a\u000aToday, researchers at the Center for Microbiome Innovation at the University of California, San Diego are trying to map and understand this crucial component of our health through the American Gut project -- a slight misnomer, as the project has collected over 10,000 samples from more than 43 countries.\u000a\u000a"There's more bacteria in your gut than there are stars in the universe, by a long shot," Rob Knight, the center's director, said as he stood next to a map of bacteria taken from people all over the globe.\u000a\u000aDeciphering the microbiome\u000a\u000aThe goal of his project is to identify what all of the bacteria do and how they impact your health.\u000a\u000a"We hope, ultimately, to develop a kind of microbial GPS that helps you drive your microbiome to optimize your health in terms of diet, exercise, drugs and other things that effect your microbiome," Knight said.\u000a\u000aIt is a citizen science project, meaning the data are donated by the public.\u000a\u000aFor $99, you can send your own oral, fecal and skin samples to Knight's lab and discover what makes up your microbiome.\u000a\u000aThe project has been running for four years and already garnered new insight into the importance of your gut.\u000a\u000a"We know a tremendous amount about the microbiome. Today, 97% to 99% of the sequences are identifiable," Knight said. But one major caveat remains: "We know very little about their functions."\u000a\u000aThe challenge is the diversity of human microbiomes and the fact that they change every day, Knight explained. We are constantly altering the makeup of our gut through what we eat, where we live and with whom we interact.\u000a\u000a"We're all 99.99% identical in terms of the human genome, whereas you might be 90% different from the person you're sitting next to in terms of your microbiome," Knight said.\u000a\u000aParticipants who send in samples also fill out detailed questionnaires to help the team identify what factors -- such as sleep, environment and exercise -- have the biggest impact on someone's microbiome. Out of these influences, Knight says, long-term diet has the most profound effect.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Foods that affect your gut When you eat, you're also supplying the bacterial community in your colon, made up of 100 trillion cells.

"That seems to have a much bigger impact than whether you also eat meat occasionally or even frequently."\u000a\u000aBut he adds that there is still so much experts don't know and only so much his team can hypothesize based on an observational study like the American Gut Project.\u000a\u000a"You really need to take it in to more well-defined experiments to find out what the connections are and whether the microbiome is driving the difference in lifestyle or whether the lifestyle is driving the microbiome. Sometimes, it can be a bit of both," Knight said.\u000a\u000aFor example, how much sleep you get affects the microbiome you have, but the microbiome you have can affect how much you want to sleep, Knight said.\u000a\u000aHe is collaborating with teams at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the US Office of Naval Research to figure out what those connections are and how much of it is sleep affecting microbiome or vice versa.\u000a\u000aBecause the data are open to anyone, numerous studies are being conducted with the American Gut project.\u000a\u000a"It is one of the most publicly accessible and diverse databases we have," said Jack Gilbert, co-founder of the project and faculty director of the Microbiome Center at the University of Chicago.\u000a\u000aHowever, there are limitations. All of the potential influences are self-reported, he noted, and people don't tend to be as accurate or honest when answering the questionnaires, meaning the associations and interpretations of certain bacteria's roles could be off.\u000a\u000aOne thing researchers do know is that modernization has drastically changed the state of our microbiome through antibiotics, chemicals and diets.\u000a\u000aA bacterial gold mine in the Amazon\u000a\u000aDeep inside the Amazon jungle in Venezuela exists a bacterial gold mine belonging to the Yanomami, a remote, indigenous seminomadic community undiscovered until 2008.\u000a\u000aThey are thought to have gone untouched by modern medicine or people outside their tribe, and as a result, they are believed to host the most diverse human microbiome ever recorded.\u000a\u000aDeep inside the Amazon exsists a bacteria gold mine belonging to a the Yanomami community.\u000a\u000a"They have about twice the diversity a Westernized population has," said microbial anthropologist Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, associate professor at New York University's Department of Medicine.\u000a\u000aThis knowledge led researchers to wonder what the Western microbiome has lost, how it has evolved and what impact this may have had.\u000a\u000aDominguez-Bello piloted a research project at NYU that tested oral, fecal and skin samples from 34 members of the Yanomami community to get a snapshot of a culture suspected to have been left alone for an estimated 11,000 years.\u000a\u000a"These are extremely healthy people. We want to understand what they have, how they function with their microbes, how their microbes provide health and compare their microbiota and functions with ours," she said.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, her team found that the bacteria residing in the guts of these hunter-gatherers harbored genes that made the people resistant to antibiotics -- despite them never having taken or been exposed to the drugs.\u000a\u000a"This shows that our microbes have been resisting antibiotics for a long time, which is an interesting societal statement," said Gilbert, who did not work on this research. There has been much concern over so-called superbugs due to the overuse of antibiotics, but this study identifies that we have always had antimicrobial resistance, he said.\u000a\u000aBut he highlighted the small size of the study and the fact there were comparisons made only within the one Yanomami group, limiting how far they can be extrapolated.\u000a\u000aGilbert, whose work focuses on the environmental impacts on the microbiome, also noted that there were no data gathered about their health characteristics or ethnography, so only assumptions can be made at this point.\u000a\u000a"We are trying to characterize what is different in their lifestyle in relation to ours," Dominguez-Bello said. "We want to understand what is it that is modulated by diet or may have disappeared with antibiotics or may not been acquired from birth because of a C-section."\u000a\u000aA researcher studies the gut bacteria of an indigenous community in the Venezuelan Amazon.\u000a\u000aThe first microbes a newborn receives come from the mother's vaginal fluids if delivered that way, whereas infants born via cesarean section do not get these bacteria.\u000a\u000a"Those are the pioneer microbes that arrive in our skin, mouth, nose. They establish there and start talking to our immune system," she said.\u000a\u000aSome scientists theorize that children born via C-section may miss out on important microbes that shape their immune systems and in turn their lifelong health. Chronic illnesses like allergies, asthma, Celiac disease and type 1 diabetes are thought to be a result of lost microbes.\u000a\u000aAntibiotics, rigorous hygiene practices and highly processed foods are also believed to have decreased the diversity of microbiomes in the developed world, Dominguez-Bello said, but she hypothesizes that C-sections and antibiotics have the largest impact.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Every time we take an antibiotic, and especially during a very early age, the assembly of these communities is disrupted by the antibiotics. It's a tremendous effect because, by definition, antibiotics kill bacteria," she said.\u000a\u000aHer team is hopeful that samples from the Yanomami might offer a clue into restoring the biodiversity that has been lost through modernization, but they fear that the window is closing as indigenous communities become more integrated with the West.\u000a\u000a"We cannot judge whether globalization is good or bad. It's both. It's happening. We can't stop," she said. "So what we feel is the urge to really understand better those microbes and save them from extinction, because eventually, the whole world will converge into a single lifestyle."\u000a\u000aShe believes by acting fast, her team can find out this microbial history. "But it's a big challenge."

aV(CBS4) \u2013 Attention beer lovers! The next beer you crack open could be one that is helping the environment.\u000a\u000aCosta-Rican based Imperial Cerveza has created what they call a \u201cwater positive\u201d\u201d beer, meaning every one made lacks a water footprint. The company is launching its new brand Imperial Silver and chose Colorado as the first state in the U.S. to serve it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt shares a lot of our values around the environment, biodiversity and social values,\u201d Imperial Ambassador Victor Rutstein said of Colorado.\u000a\u000aSo what is water positive? Rutstein said it is a four-step process involving measurement, reduction, compensation and creation of positive water value. Imperial first measured how much water it uses and made a decision to limit and conserve. Then the beer maker looked at ways to reduce their water usage.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat they did is they looked at all their brewing processes, all the processes of their suppliers and they reduced their water usage by 44 percent,\u201d Rutstein said of the Costa-Rican beer maker. \u201cThey did this while increasing the volume of their beer by 70 percent.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the compensation phase, Rutstein explained Imperial paid landowners not to cut down trees. He said that adds water to the water shed and the water then goes to the metro of Costa Rica.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat got us to be water neutral,\u201d Rutstein said. \u201cSo, to be water positive, we have to give back more water than we use. What we do is provide fresh water solutions to communities that need fresh water. That brings us to a place where we give back more water to the environment than we use.\u201d\u000a\u000aEssentially, Imperial is giving more water than uses by focusing on water recycling and investing in conservation groups. To spread their water positive mission, Imperial is collaborating with the Colorado Water Trust to help fund efforts to restore and sustain waterways in our state.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve invested to provide 62.8 million gallons of water to increase the flow of the Yampa River,\u201d Rutstein told CBS4. \u201cThat\u2019s 50 percent of the water needed there this summer.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf a country that sees upwards of 25 feet of rainfall a year cares about water conservation and production, Rutstein said it is important Imperial help a high-desert state like Colorado do the same.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are thrilled to be in Colorado,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTo learn more about Imperial Cerveza and their water positive mission, visit imperialbeer.com.

aVRebecca Wallwork, CNN \u2022 Updated 7th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Miami's sunshine and good times have drawn visitors back for years, but a new hotel concept hopes to bring back some of the glamour of a bygone era.\u000a\u000aThe city has gone through plenty of reincarnations in its time -- there was the neon-pink "Miami Vice" scene of the 1980s, the elite velvet-rope days of Madonna and Versace and the boutique hotels in the 1990s. Then came the Kardashians and the spring breakers and the glitzy Art Basel crowds.\u000a\u000aBut none of Miami's changing moods can match the more refined glamour of the city's Jazz Age in the 1920s and '30s.\u000a\u000aElaborate parties and boldfaced names were part of the scene back then, too, but it was also a time of elegance and sophistication -- two words you see scant evidence of along Ocean Drive or South Beach's Collins Avenue hotel strip today.\u000a\u000aWhich is why the recent arrival of Miami's newest hotel, the Four Seasons Hotel at The Surf Club in the Surfside enclave of North Beach, feels like just what the city needs.\u000a\u000aThe hotel is an antidote to the flaunt-it-all luxury of the Fontainebleau and Faena Hotels and the more genteel hospitality of the historic Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables.\u000a\u000aThe new Surf Club sits on 900 feet of pristine Atlantic beachfront in the Surfside enclave of North Beach.\u000a\u000aOld-school Miami glamour\u000a\u000aThe Surf Club, however, does have plenty of history.\u000a\u000aThe former social club where tire tycoon Harvey Firestone once threw epic galas and frequent visitor Winston Churchill used to paint in his cabana has been reimagined as a beachfront hotel (and residences) designed by US architect Richard Meier.\u000a\u000aThe footprint is large -- the property sits on 900 feet of pristine Atlantic beachfront -- but the overall feeling is intimate, with just 77 rooms and suites that cantilever over the original clubhouse, with chic, residential-style interiors by Paris-based designer Joseph Dirand.\u000a\u000aTwo of the three new towers by Meier are for private residences, with owners having full access to the Surf Club's amenities.\u000a\u000aThose perks are the real deal -- three pools, 40 day cabanas, a spa with six treatment rooms and two cabana suites, and a beautifully designed kids' club.\u000a\u000aThe hotel is a reimagination of the historic scene from Miami's glamorous heyday in the Jazz Age.\u000a\u000aPlus, there's Le Sirenuse restaurant and Champagne bar, a collaboration between Four Seasons and the owners of Le Sirenuse Hotel in Positano on Italy's Amalfi Coast. (A Thomas Keller restaurant is also set to open on site later this year.)\u000a\u000a"You're not in South Beach, trying to fight for a pool chair or spot on the beach," says the hotel's general manager Reed Kandalaft of the abundance of space at the Surf Club. "You're paying on average $1,000 a night, so you're going to have a serene, exclusive experience."\u000a\u000aThat may be a lot of zeros for one night, but Kandalaft claims that fans of Four Seasons' renowned service are happy to pay it.\u000a\u000a"We nail the basics," he says. "You can paint the walls gold if you want to, but if you don't serve hot coffee hot or have fresh orange juice, squeezed here at the hotel, if your silver isn't polished and the floors aren't clean, your guests aren't going to accept the place."\u000a\u000aItalian flavor: Le Sirenuse is a collaboration between Four Seasons and Le Sirenuse Hotel on the Amalfi Coast.\u000a\u000a'Floating in the air'\u000a\u000aSurf Club guests are treated to more than just the basics, of course. Guest rooms are bright and airy, reflecting Dirand's clean-lined modernist style.\u000a\u000a"The palette of the room reflects what you see outside your window," says the designer, best known for his work on flagship boutiques for designers such as Chloe, Balmain and Givenchy in Paris.\u000a\u000a"The beige color, which is the sand, the green of the palm trees, a little bit of greenish-blue that continues the colors of the water and the sky. You almost feel like the landscape is coming inside and you are floating in the air."\u000a\u000aMiami's brilliant natural light is used to great effect, while the furniture, such as the modular table that can be used for dining, lounging or as a desk, is functional and built for modern life.\u000a\u000aThe Le Sirenuse restaurant and Champagne bar were created from what remained of the original Surf Club building, so they feature many original details such as fireplaces, wooden ceilings and dramatic arches which frame views of palm trees and glimpses of the Atlantic.\u000a\u000aThe decor is designed to reflect the setting of sand and sea and bring the outside in.\u000a\u000aBest of the best\u000a\u000aThe sprawling bar area is a tropical wonderland, dotted with palms, couches and chairs in pale, natural shades, grouped into intimate pockets with flattering low lighting.\u000a\u000a"I wanted it to have some of the personality of Le Sirenuse [in Positano]," says Antonio Sersale, who worked with Dirand to translate his hotel's warmth into the new space.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to make sure that the plants were preponderant and that guests feel at ease."\u000a\u000aA stunning green bar -- made from lava stone shaped into waves -- anchors the room, while next door in the main dining room, guests sit down to a menu created by chef de cuisine Antonio Mermolia, with inspiration from Le Sirenuse Positano's La Sponda.\u000a\u000a"When you're here, you forget that you have 15 floors [of hotel rooms] cantilevered over you," says Sersale from a table in the dining room. "You feel like you've walked into this charming little place, with a fabulous terrace overlooking the sea."\u000a\u000aTo the hospitality veteran (whose father Franco opened Le Sirenuse in 1951), the feel of a restaurant is just as important as the food. "The atmosphere is everything," he says. "Glamour has to have depth, and to have depth it needs to draw people who are tastemakers. What really makes a place is the people."\u000a\u000aThe developers and owners of the Surf Club, Fort Partners, clearly agree, especially when it came to selecting their collaborators. "They chose the best of the best to build something unique," says Kandalaft.\u000a\u000a"Four Seasons. Le Sirenuse. Thomas Keller. Joseph Dirand. Richard Meier. Whenever they picked someone, they asked, 'Who is the best at what they do? Let's get them.'"\u000a\u000aThe Surf Club features three pools, a spa and a kids' club.\u000a\u000aMiami's DNA\u000a\u000aThe goal, says Kandalaft, was to create something timeless and understated -- "not too flashy, not too lavish. When you walk in, you feel comfortable."\u000a\u000aFor locals as well as the city's tourists, the new Surf Club is also a welcome interpretation of Miami's iconic glamour.\u000a\u000a"Miami is inspired by Europe, Latin America and Art Deco influences -- all translated into a specific language," says Dirand.

aV(CNN) Neymar says the decision to leave Barcelona was "one of the toughest" of his life after completing a world-record move to Paris Saint-Germain and has insisted his move was not motivated by money.\u000a\u000aThe forward completed his $263 million transfer to the French capital Thursday, just a week after Barcelona officials had said he was "200%" staying with the Catalan club.\u000a\u000aUnveiled to the media Friday, the Brazilian said the decision to join the French club came from his desire for a bigger challenge.\u000a\u000aNeymar told CNN Sport: "They're one of the biggest clubs in the world, I want to be part of the history.

His five-year contact is reportedly worth approximately $45 million a year before tax, making him the highest-paid player in the history of his sport, but the footballer said the sums associated with him did not make him feel uncomfortable.\u000a\u000a"I'm just happy and flattered that they believe in my football and they brought me to a club as big as Paris," he said.\u000a\u000a"I am not a guy who's motivated by money -- but by happiness and challenges."\u000a\u000aEarlier, he had told a news conference: "What I think about is my happiness and together with my family, I want them to be happy.\u000a\u000a"If I was following the money, I would be somewhere else, with other clubs in other countries.\u000a\u000a"I'm really sad that people still think that way and I'm glad that PSG believe in me\u000a\u000a"My heart told me to sign for PSG and I did it.\u000a\u000a"It was one of the toughest decisions I ever took. I was at a great club at Barcelona, I love Barcelona, have friends at the club, some fantastic players, and it wasn't easy at all.\u000a\u000a"I had to think, rethink about what I wanted to do and achieve in my life."\u000a\u000a'An idol for sports lovers'\u000a\u000aPhotos: Neymar: The world's most expensive footballer After telling Barcelona he wanted to leave the club, Brazilian football star Neymar is heading to Paris Saint-Germain.

aV(CNN) Todd Vance was serving in the US Army when the September 11 attacks occurred.\u000a\u000a"I decided to re-enlist for another three years," he said. "And I asked to be part of the first deployed unit to Iraq."\u000a\u000aVance served as a squad leader and ran more than 250 combat missions before returning to San Diego in 2005.\u000a\u000a"At first, it was all elation. I was just happy to be alive and happy to be out of the military," he said. "Slowly but surely, reality was setting in about what I had seen and what I had done."\u000a\u000aFacing his own battle\u000a\u000aAbout six months after returning home, Vance began encountering his own personal issues.\u000a\u000aTodd Vance joined the Army his junior year of high school and served as a squad leader in Iraq.\u000a\u000a"I turned into a recluse. I was drinking too much. Basically anything that would either produce an extreme adrenaline rush or numb my adrenaline rush and the hypervigilance and anxiety I was having," he said.\u000a\u000aVance went to the Veterans Affairs center for counseling. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and sent home with a shopping bag of medications, including mood enhancers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety meds.\u000a\u000aAlong with drinking, he started abusing the prescriptions he had been given.\u000a\u000a"I'm glad my family ended up telling me I needed to seek professional help," Vance said.\u000a\u000aHe went to therapy and decided to go back to school. But it wasn't until he got involved with mixed martial arts that his life began to change.\u000a\u000a"Martial arts 100% saved my life," he said.\u000a\u000aFighting for veterans at home\u000a\u000aVance, who had been a professional Muay Thai fighter in high school, started training at the local MMA gym.\u000a\u000a"It gave me the structure, the discipline, the camaraderie, the routine that I needed to have in my life that I was missing so much from the military," he said. "Before training, I had no reason not to drink until 3 in the morning. I was training six days a week, often two times a day, and eating clean."\u000a\u000aVance, bottom right, re-enlisted in the Army after the attacks on 9/11.\u000a\u000aVance finished community college and enrolled at Point Loma Nazarene University, where he earned a degree in social work.\u000a\u000a"I realized I had a passion for working with and for military veterans," he said.\u000a\u000aHe decided to pay it forward and start an organization that uses mixed martial arts to help veterans overcome PTSD and other challenges adapting back to civilian life.\u000a\u000a"If a veteran is happy and content with their daily life, they may or may not be drawn to a program like this. But somebody who is facing anxiety and post-traumatic stress and all those different issues, they'll probably be here," he said.\u000a\u000a'Focused on technique and fitness'\u000a\u000aThe program started off as a veteran competition team and became a nonprofit in 2012. Vance called it P.O.W. , short for Pugilistic Offensive Warrior Tactics.\u000a\u000a"It plays on (the term) prisoner of war because when you come home from combat, you're a prisoner of your own personal war," he said.\u000a\u000aIt may seem counterintuitive that a "violent" sport like MMA is helping people cope from the violence of war. Vance disagrees.\u000a\u000a"Martial arts is focused on technique and fitness. ... We have served more than 275 veterans, and all the success stories we have is a testament to the effectiveness of the program," he said. "We see people get right out of the military, they're young, they're a mess, they don't have any employment or social skills. Two or three years later, they are working on their master's degree."\u000a\u000aThe program offers free mixed martial arts classes for veterans three times a week at the Undisputed Downtown gym in San Diego. But it's also group therapy disguised as MMA.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We offer peer-to-peer coaching, support and counseling," he said. "We're doing a lot of exposure and vulnerability sharing to where they can start to feel normal around a group of people."\u000a\u000aMMA helps veterans stay calm, think critically in stressful situations and move on, Vance said.\u000a\u000a"It helps people that have anxiety and depression and who are dealing with trauma to be present in the moment," he said.\u000a\u000aAt the end of each class, he also incorporates yoga to help the veterans clear their mind and leave with a clean slate.\u000a\u000aVance recently conducted a study of 30 participants over a one-year period. The results showed a 90% improvement in physical health; 80% improvement in coping with stress and symptoms of PTSD; and a 100% improvement in reducing the feelings of isolation.\u000a\u000a'They want to help you do better'\u000a\u000aJoshua Tanida, who takes the martial arts classes, served as an engineer in the US Navy for four years. About six months before he was discharged, he began suffering from depression, low self-esteem and low self-worth.\u000a\u000a"I started losing a lot of drive to do anything," he said. "I just felt distant from everyone. Like nothing really mattered."\u000a\u000aTanida went to the VA for counseling in 2014 and joined the program a year later.\u000a\u000a"They help build you up as a person and build your self-esteem," he said. "They know how you feel firsthand, and they want to help you do better. ...

These are national issues, certainly. But Arizonans live and breathe them. So, I\u2019m thrilled that the Arizona Republican Party and CNN have reached agreement on a debate, and optimistic that when the candidates come to Arizona, they\u2019ll meet our voters and offer meaningful solutions to the problems facing our state and nation.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs previously announced, CNN and the Western Republican Leadership Conference will present a debate on Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2011 in Las Vegas, Nevada. These presidential debates are in addition to two separate Republican primary debates hosted by CNN earlier this year, with Hearst Television\u2019s WMUR and the New Hampshire Union Leader in June 2011 and the Tea Party Express in September 2011.\u000a\u000aCNN Worldwide, a division of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., a Time Warner Company, is the most trusted source for news and information.

aV(CNN) It could be one of the feel-good stories of Rio 2016 -- a tiny island nation triumphs on the world's biggest sporting stage to win its first Olympic medal.\u000a\u000aFiji is favorite to claim gold in the men's rugby sevens tournament, which starts Tuesday, having overcome financial problems and the loss of leading players to win back-to-back world titles.\u000a\u000aSuch a result would, according to Brett Gosper, the head of World Rugby, be "the fairytale result -- a story that transcends the sport."\u000a\u000aBut not everything is rosy with rugby in the Pacific Islands. Neither Samoa, a one-time powerhouse of the sevens format, nor Tonga have qualified teams for Rio.\u000a\u000aAnd the three rugby-proud nations are losing top talent to an increasing number of tier-one teams -- an age-old problem -- with many stories of players then being blocked from playing for their countries by their club employers.\u000a\u000aThe body representing the players has heard stories of players being left stranded without visas in their new countries, or else left with sizable tax bills, unaware of the contracts they had signed.\u000a\u000aThe great rugby rip-off?\u000a\u000aEnglish clubs sign many Samoan players such as Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu.\u000a\u000aEliota Fuimaono-Sapolu represented Samao on 23 occasions and had a lengthy professional career in England with Bath and Gloucester. Having returned to Samoa, he is increasingly concerned about the plight of Pacific Island players.\u000a\u000a"Everyone comes here to take players but they don't give back," he explains. "When they take players, they don't then get to play for their countries. It's take, take, take. Everyone is trying to rip everyone off.\u000a\u000a"You hear stories of dudes just stranded in France with no money to get home. It's hard because a lot of these boys have never left the island, so to grasp the concept of money and contracts is difficult. These are complex 30-page documents for guys that barely speak English, so people can rip them off and dump them."\u000a\u000aWorld Rugby rules stipulate the players at clubs across the globe must be released to play for their countries in the international window, but Fuimaono-Sapolu says he knows of a litany of instances where players have effectively been blocked from doing that by their clubs.\u000a\u000aPacific Island teams also suffer when players from countries such as Samoa or Fiji acquire dual citizenship and represent their adopted nations -- meaning they are no longer eligible for their homeland.\u000a\u000a"There are players that can't play for the country of their birth as they've played one minute for New Zealand Sevens," Fuimaono-Sapolu says.\u000a\u000a"These rules are contrary to simple UN human rights. I've seen contracts where locals only get a contract if they agree not to play for Samoa. We're just cannon fodder."\u000a\u000a'Regulation nine'\u000a\u000aWorld Rugby invested £26.8 million ($35 million) into the three unions in the four years leading up to the 2015 World Cup and held its first committee meeting of Bill Beaumont's current presidency in Fiji this year. In addition, the ruling body is looking at introducing a Fijian team in Australia's National Rugby Championship.\u000a\u000aWhile CEO Gosper admits there are "challenges," he is confident World Rugby is moving in the right direction in the region.\u000a\u000aSpeaking in Rio de Janeiro on the eve of sevens making its Olympic debut, he said: "You want to make sure you're optimizing that region as best you can, that your high-performance programs are as they should do, that you keep players in the country the best way you can and for as long as you can, and ensure that those players come back to play for their country.\u000a\u000a"We police that as strongly as you can, and some things happen that we can't control in ensuing that regulation nine (the rule that stipulates clubs must release players to represent their country) is respected. We're continuing to think about and invest in the region."\u000a\u000aMinimum wage\u000a\u000aSamoa won May's Paris Sevens title but lost in the final of the Olympic repechage qualifier.\u000a\u000aThe exodus of players has had a direct impact on Samoa's sevens program, in particular. Census figures show that nearly as many Samoans now live in New Zealand than on their home island.\u000a\u000aThe team's English coach Damian McGrath built up a squad of 16 players last season, but will be forced to start from scratch for the 2016-17 Sevens World Series.\u000a\u000a"We'll start the season with just three guys from last year's squad," he says, "and that's because the others have gone overseas and some not necessarily to play professional rugby.\u000a\u000a"Five of our players have moved to New Zealand just to work and play for local clubs. It's not about professional rugby for them, it's something that gives them a lifestyle."\u000a\u000aThe lure of moving abroad is obvious. In Fiji, the minimum wage is just FJD $2.32 ($1.12) per hour whereas in Australia and New Zealand the earning potential is infinitely higher.\u000a\u000a'Every man for himself'\u000a\u000aAkapusi Qera in action for Fiji at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\u000a\u000aThe club-versus-country row is arguably the biggest issue, though, facing the Pacific Islands.\u000a\u000aAkapusi Qera has twice turned down the opportunity to represent his country for the good of his club career -- the second time was at the expense of the Fijian captaincy.\u000a\u000a"I decided not to play for my country and that didn't go down well back at home," he says from his home in the south of France. "People talk crap about it but, at the end of the day, it's every man for himself.\u000a\u000a"You're so proud to play for your country and you have to take tough decisions along the way because of family. It's a very difficult decision, one of the most difficult decisions you will ever have to do."\u000a\u000aQera first withdrew from Fiji's northern hemisphere tour in November 2012 in order to focus on playing for Gloucester in what he described as "a series of important games coming up." He was captain for the 2015 World Cup but made himself unavailable for June's home internationals.\u000a\u000aPlayers will often have to pay their own way to fly back home to represent their countries, with no funds from the national unions. When coach Ben Ryan took over Fiji's sevens team in 2013, he was not paid for four months due to his employer's financial problems.\u000a\u000aRepresenting the players\u000a\u000aFormer NZ Sevens star Josh Blackie now works for the International Rugby Players' Association.\u000a\u000aQera's other gripe is that Pacific Island players get treated differently by clubs.\u000a\u000a"Take the England or France boys," he says. "When they come back from their Tests, they get days off but the island boys always go straight back in. There's never any time off. That's just bad for player welfare.\u000a\u000a"As professional rugby players, we deserve to be treated the same. These are the things World Rugby needs to hear. They need to know about the difficulties going on. I'm just grateful for Josh Blackie and his team for helping and now there are players' associations set up in the islands. That's a big plus moving forward. I hope this will change things."\u000a\u000aFormer NZ Sevens representative Blackie works for the International Rugby Players' Association (IRPA), which also incorporates the Pacific Islands Players' Association (PIPA).\u000a\u000aAccording to the IRPA calculations, 16% of all professional rugby players on the planet are of Pacific Island descent. His organization represents 350 players from the region, and in the past few months has put a player development officer in Fiji.\u000a\u000aFiji's sevens team trains during its Olympic selection camp.\u000a\u000a"It might be if a player hasn't sought independent advice or a club is exploiting a player for whatever reason, or they've been sold a good story," Blackie says. "For us, the key is to get the key messages across early on in terms of tax, budget, how to handle themselves publicly, on social media.\u000a\u000a"Sure, there are horror stories but we're working hard and taking a positive approach from the start rather than dealing with the train wreck at the end. And sometimes we're like an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff if players make an error or something else goes wrong.\u000a\u000a"We have examples of players going to a club and doing everything for it, sometimes to the detriment of playing for their national union. World Rugby have relations in place to protect the smaller islands and nations for player release.\u000a\u000a"There's certainly a lot of work to be done to ensure that the Pacific Islands have access to the players to use them when they need them. No one has a magic bullet at the moment, that's the reality and it's a challenge."\u000a\u000aFuture solutions?\u000a\u000aSeilala Mapusua was Samoa's vice-captain at the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\u000a\u000aMany Pacific Island players either in the twilight of their career or now retired have been working with Blackie and PIPA in a bid to help improve the game in the region and also relieve the plight of the players.\u000a\u000aThe visit of the world champion All Blacks to Samoa in 2015 gave the sport a massive boost, while New Zealand provincial teams the Chiefs and Crusaders contested a Super Rugby competition match in Fiji.\u000a\u000aFormer Samoa international Seilala Mapusua is one of those liaising with Blackie, looking for answers to the problem.\u000a\u000a"I've asked myself the same questions throughout my career -- how to solve it. What can be done to improve it?" he says.\u000a\u000a"I really don't know what the answers are, maybe some form of shared revenue when Samoa plays to a sell-out crowd at Twickenham, almost as an act of good faith. I know the home nation isn't obliged to. Getting the All Blacks to Samoa last year was absolutely huge. Hopefully that can encourage other top tier nations to come over.\u000a\u000aAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen was made an honorary High Chief Of Vaiala on the 2015 visit to Samoa.\u000a\u000a"It feels like things are slowly heading in the right direction. The buzz from the All Blacks was huge, likewise the Super Rugby game, and Samoa made the game competitive. It shows if given the chance we're not too far behind.\u000a\u000a"But there are still issues. You get boys withdraw from tours all the time and you never hear them say 'the club wanted me to stay' as clubs have to release them for international duty -- but everyone knows it's happening.\u000a\u000a"Players are caught between a rock and a hard place. Everyone wants to represent their country, that's the pinnacle for a professional rugby player."\u000a\u000aClub vs. country\u000a\u000aHale T-Pole (left) in action for Tonga against Namibia at the 2015 World Cup.\u000a\u000aThe recurring theme appears to be the difficulty in getting players released to play for their country and thereby give the Pacific Island nations the best chance possible to shine on the global stage.\u000a\u000aFormer Tonga international Hale T. Pole wants players to stand up more strongly on the issue.\u000a\u000a"I didn't care if the club were going to sack me to not," he says. "So I never had a problem on playing for my country as I stayed firm.\u000a\u000a"That's supposed to be law that they have to release you, but some clubs beat players down on that. It didn't happen to me but I've seen it firsthand, players not getting released from their clubs. The clubs would try to bend the rules without saying 'you have to stay.'"\u000a\u000aTonga has not played a home international since 2009, something that Pole describes as "unheard of" -- but he believes rugby authorities are addressing the issue.\u000a\u000a"I know Tongans are quick to judge World Rugby," he adds. "But World Rugby have done their best. We're all trying to do our best but, right now, I feel a bit lost."\u000a\u000aThe sense is that things are slowly changing. If Fiji wins gold in Rio on Thursday, the ripple effect could provide benefits for the wider region.

Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\u000a\u000a(CNN) What happens when you bring a group of sixth-graders together to meet -- for the first time -- someone who is transgender? You get an easy and honest conversation that speaks volumes about how we can talk to our kids about gender and how much we can learn from their openness.\u000a\u000a"What gender do you think I am?" Hennessy asked 11 sixth-graders in New York Citywho are members of SheKnows' unique Hatch program , which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation. The program is in its fourth year.\u000a\u000aThere is silence for a second, and then one girl says "male" and another says, "I heard earlier that you were transgender."\u000a\u000aHennessy, an actor in New York City and co-host of the podcast " Kill Me Now" with comedian Judy Gold, says they are both right.\u000a\u000a"I'm a transgender male," he says.\u000a\u000aAnd then the questions begin. "When did you first realize you were transgender?" a boy asks before the conversation turns to terms the kids may or may not have heard before: transgender, agender (when you don't identify as male or female), gender fluid (you feel more masculine one day, more feminine the next) and sexual orientation.\u000a\u000a'Don't treat it like a gross, icky ... thing'\u000a\u000aHennessy hopes the new video of the Hatch workshop, released Thursday, will be seen by children and parents across the country and lead to more understanding about people like himself who are born with reproductive organs that do not match their gender identity.\u000a\u000a"If you don't treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing, they don't treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing," Hennessy said in an interview. When kids as young as 4 or 5 years old use female pronouns when they meet him, he tells them, "Oh, no, I'm a boy," at which point they often ask, "What, you're a boy?"\u000a\u000aHe then explains to them what being transgender is. "And boom, they get it right away," he said.\u000a\u000aMaverick, 12, knew what transgender was before taking part in the Hatch workshop. His mom is a sexuality educator who has been talking to him about sexuality and gender since birth. But he had never met anyone who was transgender until Hennessy.\u000a\u000a"I thought it was a very powerful experience for me," Maverick said. "I'm not sure about other kids, but I think meeting a transgender male for the first time was a very impactful thing in my life."\u000a\u000aThe experience gives him a better understanding of how other people think, he said. "I think it just tells me more about others and how to act with them and respect them in different ways."\u000a\u000aReed, who's also 12 and participated in the workshop, said it's very helpful to meet and talk with someone who is transgender or watch them in a video.\u000a\u000a"It's not just like learning from maybe people who don't know that much about that," she said. "You're learning from people who have experienced it."\u000a\u000a'Just Google it'\u000a\u000aLogan Levkoff is a sexuality educator who has taught and designed many of the sex education programs used in private schools throughout New York City and the surrounding areas. She is also the mother of Maverick and an 8-year-old daughter. Gender is a constant conversation in their household.\u000a\u000a"We've always spent a lot of time talking about what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl and maybe more importantly, the fact that there is not one definition of boy and girl and anything in between," said Levkoff, author of "Got Teens? The Doctor Moms' Guide to Sexuality, Social Media and Other Adolescent Realities."\u000a\u000aShe has told her kids that every person has the right to experience life the way they see fit, in a way that best reflects who they are. "And sometimes that means not feeling like a boy or not feeling like a girl or feeling like something else entirely," she said.\u000a\u000aHer advice for parents, when it comes to how and when to start talking to kids about what it means to be transgender and gender in general, is to first figure out what exactly they want their kids to know and then recognize what their own limitations are and the gaps in their own knowledge.\u000a\u000a"The likelihood is that for a lot of parents, they may not have any personal experience, which means that you have to get some information and education and also be willing to tell your child, if they have a question for you, to say, 'You know what, I don't know what the answer is, but I'm going to find it out for you,' " said Levkoff.\u000a\u000aHennessy, who grew up in Maui, Hawaii, at a time when there was no dialogue about being transgender, said parents should absolutely take time to learn more about it.\u000a\u000a"Just Google it. Google transgender. Google transsexual. Google tranny, and it won't take that long," he said. "Just learn a little bit. All you've got to do is start. You don't have to learn everything all at once ... It's a lot simpler than people try to make it, so we have all these definitions and words to define things, but it's really super simple. ... We overthink it."\u000a\u000aHennessy didn't hear the term transgender until roughly five years ago. Before that, he always felt "off," he said. "I felt totally born wrong since day one." Ashamed about being in a woman's body, he had bound his breasts ever since he started developing. "I would wear two sports bras and one of my dad's extra-large shirts ... and any time the wind blew up against me, I would pull my shirt up off of my chest."\u000a\u000aHow parents can learn from their kids\u000a\u000aLike Levkoff, Hennessy can't emphasize enough how the more honest and open you are with your child about sexuality and gender, the better.\u000a\u000a"I say, as soon as they start asking you, answer the questions, no matter how old they are, as soon as they start asking you, because if you don't answer them, someone else will, and you can choose what they hear first," he said. "It takes the mysticism out of sex. It takes the pervertedness out of sex."\u000a\u000a"There are some young kids who are really capable of some really sophisticated thought about gender and sexuality, and there are some adults who are completely incapable of having a mature conversation, so age doesn't determine whether or not someone can handle this, but I think it's important for parents to remember that from the time our kids are born, how we dress them, how we allow them to express themselves, how we allow other people to talk to them or the assumptions they make about them, are all little doses of education about gender and expression," she said.\u000a\u000aWhat is clear, at least from the video featuring Hennessy and the Hatch participants, is that there's a lot parents can learn from kids, especially about topics such as gender.\u000a\u000a"I think parents should learn from kids, because kids are more exposed to all this stuff now ... and parents, their generation wasn't as exposed," said Reed, one of the young participants. "It shouldn't just be kids learning from parents. It should go all ways."\u000a\u000aLevkoff said she is "constantly amazed" at how "color- and gender-blind" today's kids are. "And by the way, not all of them, because they are a product of us," she said. "But their default setting isn't to be intolerant. Their default setting is to just be open, and that's really an incredible thing to watch."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHennessy said most parents teach their kids to love equally and to eschew racism. He hopes they will also find ways to teach them to be open and accepting of another person's gender.\u000a\u000a"When someone is coming to you with something that is different from your experience, just give them a chance to tell their side and believe them and don't try to change them, because by trying to change them, you're telling them that their existence isn't good enough," Hennessy said.
