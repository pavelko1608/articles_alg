aV(CNN) From high-end to high street, the worlds of fashion and interior design have never been so closely aligned.\u000a\u000aRecent years have seen countless collaborations between prominent fashion designers and established homeware brands, who have realized that consumers are hungry for a complete lifestyle experience.\u000a\u000aWith homeware and furniture companies providing the infrastructure and expertise, partnerships such as Diesel and Moroso , or Raf Simons and Kvadrat have proven to be mutually beneficial.\u000a\u000aA $27 billion market\u000a\u000aExpanding beyond clothes not only strengthens a business by increasing brand recognition, but also allows labels to grab a slice of the highly profitable luxury home and furniture pie, which, according to a report by Allied Market Research, is forecast to reach $27 billion by 2020.\u000a\u000aThe latest fashion label to step up to the plate and launch its own decor line is Gucci\u000a\u000aThe brand's debut offering of furniture and decorative homeware is designed by creative director Alessandro Michele and will feature the label's distinctive motifs, patterns and codes.\u000a\u000aPreviewed items include scented candles, embroidered cushions, porcelain mugs (produced by renowned Florentine company Richard Ginori), a metal folding table and a wooden Liguria-inspired chair.\u000a\u000aGucci\u000a\u000aWith a lacquered red finish and velvet upholstery, the chair is hand embroidered with an intricate cat head motif and clusters of flowers -- a process that takes approximately 10 hours to complete. This is haute couture for the home.\u000a\u000a"It's about creating a complete lifestyle experience for the consumer," says Allyson Rees, senior retail lifestyles editor at forecasting service WGSN , who has been tracking the trend.\u000a\u000a"Gucci is a perfect example because Alessandro Michele has created such a specific world for the brand, he has such a fully-formed point of view, and consumers want the whole experience, not just in their wardrobe."\u000a\u000aShe adds: "I wouldn't be surprised if we see more luxury houses moving into interiors, especially gifting and home décor, as these categories are simpler to execute than furniture."\u000a\u000aBig in Milan\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Spanish brand Loewe pipped Gucci to the post when it launched its first homeware collection in Milan at Salone del Mobile -- the equivalent of fashion week for furniture.\u000a\u000a"The home has never been so important as it is now, and it's also the most substantial way for brands to show their talent," said the designer, who worked with esteemed furniture maker Robert "Mouseman" Thompson on the collection.\u000a\u000aLoewe was not the only fashion brand in attendance at the annual design fair in Milan. In each case labels used homeware to strengthen their core brand message.\u000a\u000aItalian brands Dolce & Gabbana and Smeg collaborated on a series of kitchen appliances covered in colorful Sicilian-inspired patterns and motifs.\u000a\u000aTostapane grande SMEG Dolce&Gabbana\u000a\u000aBirkenstock introduced a line of beds, a logical choice given the brand's associations with practicality and comfort.\u000a\u000aLouis Vuitton grew its five-year-old travel-inspired homeware collection by 10 pieces, while Marni created an actual playground from its ever-evolving line of PVC furniture made by Colombian craftswomen.\u000a\u000aA bright future\u000a\u000aWhile furniture design may be unchartered territory for many fashion houses, others have straddled both worlds for years, such as Ralph Lauren Home (1983), Missoni Home (1983), Fendi Casa (1989), Versace Home (1992) and Armani Casa (2000).\u000a\u000aSo what can we expect to see next?\u000a\u000a"We'll see more brands move into the wellness lifestyle space," predicts Rees.\u000a\u000a"Ivivva, Lululemon's active line for girls, just unveiled a collaboration with PB Teen, which is very yoga-centric and promotes an active lifestyle. And Byredo is collaborating with Ikea on a home fragrance collection for 2019, so I wouldn't be surprised to see more niche fragrance brands teaming up with mass retailers on exclusive products like candles, bath and other scents."

aVMichelle Obama is the first lady of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Watch CNN Films' "We Will Rise: Michelle Obama's Mission to Educate Girls Around the World" on CNNgo.\u000a\u000aNeither of my parents and hardly anyone in the neighborhood where I grew up went to college. But thanks to a lot of hard work and plenty of financial aid, I had the opportunity to attend some of the finest universities in this country. That education opened so many doors and gave me the confidence to pursue my ambitions and have a voice in the world.\u000a\u000aFor me, education was power.\u000a\u000aAnd a few years ago, when I had the honor of meeting Malala Yousafzai , who was shot in the head just for trying to go to school, this issue got really personal for me. I saw that the terrorists who nearly killed her were trying to silence her voice, snuff out her ambitions, and take away her power.\u000a\u000aThat's why I decided to work on global girls' education as first lady: because right now, there are tens of millions of girls like Malala in every corner of the globe who are not in school -- girls who are so bright, hardworking and hungry to learn. And that's really the mission of the Let Girls Learn initiative we launched last year: It's a global effort to give these girls the education they need to fulfill their potential and lift up their families, communities and countries.\u000a\u000aNow, as first lady, I have no budget of my own for programs, and I have no authority to make or pass laws. That's why, when we first launched Let Girls Learn, many folks doubted that we could make a real impact on this global issue.\u000a\u000aBut over the past year and a half, we've established partnerships with some of the world's largest companies and organizations that are committing money, resources and expertise. We're collaborating with countries like Canada, Mexico and the Nordic countries on girls' education efforts. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have collectively pledged nearly $600 million.\u000a\u000aThe United States is investing over a billion dollars through new and ongoing efforts and running Let Girls Learn programs in more than 50 countries. The World Bank Group will be investing $2.5 billion over the next five years. And through social media campaigns, Let Girls Learn has rallied people across America and across the globe to step up and be champions for girls worldwide.\u000a\u000aAll this is happening because time and again, whether it's a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a 15-year-old girl here in the United States, when people hear the stories of girls who aren't in school, they want to help.\u000a\u000aThat's why CNN's new film on global girls' education, "We Will Rise," airing for the first time this week, is so critically important -- because it tells these girls' stories.\u000a\u000aThis powerful film chronicles the lives of some of the girls I visited this past summer in Liberia and Morocco, two countries in Africa where many girls struggle to get an education. I was joined in my travels by the actors and activists Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto , who are also passionate about girls' education, as well as CNN anchor Isha Sesay\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Why young girls in Morocco are missing school Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why young girls in Morocco are missing school 01:48\u000a\u000aTogether, we sat down with girls in both countries to discuss the barriers they face and the dreams they hold for their futures. Like so many girls around the world, many of these girls come from families struggling with poverty. Some endure dangerous commutes to and from school each day. Others face cultural pressures to drop out, marry young and start having children of their own.\u000a\u000aBut these girls have big plans for their lives. They want to attend college and become doctors, teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs; and day after day, they do whatever it takes to get the education they need to fulfill their dreams. They get up before dawn, and spend hours harvesting crops, cooking for their families and tending to their younger siblings before heading to class. After school, they work as maids and in factories, and they study for hours late into the night.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED She studies and dares to dream Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH She studies and dares to dream 00:52\u000a\u000aI hope you will be as moved by their stories as I was -- and I hope you'll visit LetGirlsLearn.gov to learn more about how you can take action to help girls like them worldwide go to school.

aVStory highlights Thousands in Kentucky wonder how their insurance will change, if they can keep it\u000a\u000aMore than 1.3 million Kentuckians are on Medicaid, a third thanks to its expansion\u000a\u000a(CNN) As Congress debates the future of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians are waiting to find out how their health insurance could change -- or whether they can keep it at all.\u000a\u000a"When I got pregnant, I didn't have insurance," said Alondra Toribio, 24, who has a 3-year-old son. "I was looking at a $600 visit for whenever I was pregnant."\u000a\u000aFor the single mother, now making just over $1,000 a month while working for a Head Start program, the expense of raising a child is overwhelming. Toribio, of Owensboro, said her current employer offers insurance, but the employee contribution would eat up more than half her take-home pay.\u000a\u000a"If I were to get that insurance," she said, "I would only come home with like $100 a week."\u000a\u000aBoth she and her son have health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid benefits to millions of Americans who couldn't previously qualify.\u000a\u000aRead More

The lavish meal happens 10 meters from the track and allows race access ($292).\u000a\u000aWith hundreds of yachts booking into the Yas Marina during the race weekend, one of the most decadent ways to watch the excitement is from the water.\u000a\u000aCeleb favorite Amber Lounge offers daytime yacht tickets that come with Bacardi cocktails and bottomless champagne (from $4,950 per two people).\u000a\u000aWhen the sun sets, visitors can dance to private performances by Jay Sean at Amber Lounge's glitzy after party (from $825).\u000a\u000aThe particularly flush can book Methuselah Tables.

That shouldn't put anyone off.\u000a\u000aThis elegant venue is a favorite VIP haunt during the F1 weekend, when celebs and the glitterati crowd in to feast on lobster stir-fried with truffle sauce.\u000a\u000aDo\u000a\u000aYasalam, Abu Dhabi's free entertainment festival, provides heaps of art, music and F1-friendly events from November 24 to 27.\u000a\u000aThe F1 FanZone has race simulations, food and games.

There's also a passenger option.\u000a\u000aThe truly passionate can book a private coaching to hone advanced racing techniques (from $408), then go all "Fast and the Furious" at the regular Yas Drift Nights and Yas Track Days.\u000a\u000aNot everything at the track is about cars.\u000a\u000aFor a dose of fitness, joining the 5,000 healthy types who workout at Yas Marina every week is an option.\u000a\u000aIt's also possible to walk, jog, race in the annual marathon or chalk-filled Color Run, and do crossfit or yoga.\u000a\u000aEven better, a lot of it's free. The Yas Marina Circuit website has exact timings.\u000a\u000aCircuits at the circuit\u000a\u000aUltimately, the F1 brings an epic buzz to Dubai's often calmer next-door neighbor.

aVJohannesburg (CNN) South Africa's first online auction of rhinoceros horn is underway, with more than 500 kilograms up for bid from Wednesday through Friday.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, the High Court in Pretoria paved the way for the controversial auction, ordering the minister of environmental affairs to hand over a permit for the sale of 264 rhino horns to breeder John Hume.\u000a\u000aHume, who owns the world's largest private collection of rhinos, has battled to overturn a ban on the sale of horn in South Africa for years.\u000a\u000aJohn Hume, pictured at his Johannesburg ranch in 2015, has obtained a permit to sell 264 horns.\u000a\u000aThe Private Rhino Owners Association estimates in the eight years the ban has been in place, owners have spent more than $100 million to protect their rhinos. Without the sale of horn, the association argues, the breeding of rhinos would become unsustainable.\u000a\u000aBut environmental groups say there is no conservation value in the auction, arguing that rhinos shouldn't be seen as livestock.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVBusiness leaders gather in Abu Dhabi for first ever CNN Middle East Business Forum\u000a\u000aOver 350 global business leaders gathered yesterday to discuss the theme \u201cBeyond Oil in a Changing World\u201d at the inaugural CNN Middle East Business Forum held at Four Seasons Abu Dhabi on Al Maryah Island.\u000a\u000aKeynote speeches were given by former President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso (pictured) and Mubadala\u2019s Group Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director H.E. Khaldoon Al Mubarak.\u000a\u000aPanel discussions and interviews with a stellar list of speakers were conducted by CNN\u2019s foremost experts on business and the Middle East \u2013 Anchor and Managing Editor, Abu Dhabi, Becky Anderson, CNNMoney Editor at Large Richard Quest, and CNNMoney Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios. A virtual reality \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 session from CNN\u2019s Jason Farkas closed proceedings.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis inaugural CNN Middle East Business Forum was a platform of informed and intelligent discussion amongst key influencers about the opportunities and challenges in the Middle East during a time of seismic change,\u201d said Rani R. Raad, President, CNN International Commercial. \u201cWe are proud to have worked with our partners Mubadala and twofour54 to bring together news-makers, agenda-setters and business leaders for meaningful debate about what the future holds.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Forum was held in association with Mubadala and twofour54 and with commercial supporting partners Al Maryah Island and Abu Dhabi Global Market on the weekend that eyes of the world turn to the UAE during the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\u000a\u000aHighlights show CNN Middle East Business Forum: Beyond Oil will first air on CNN International on 9 December at 2030 GST. Coverage from the Forum is also at money.cnn.com.\u000a\u000aKey quotes from the speakers at the CNN Middle East Business Forum include :\u000a\u000aIn conversation with José Manuel Barroso, H.E. Khaldoon Al Mubarak said: \u201cGlobal economic volatility is here for the foreseeable future; however, Abu Dhabi has acted to stay competitive and continue delivering against its economic development priorities.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe continued: \u201cStrong government to government relationships create a foundation for significant capital allocations in markets across the East and West, and we see incredible potential for significant investment in relatively new markets for us, such as China and Russia.\u201d\u000a\u000aJosé Manuel Barroso talked about the topic of diversification: \u201cLower oil prices is a job for all the GCC countries, but I believe the UAE is in a very good position. The GCC has turned from a net exporter to a net importer of capital with this focus on IPOs and privatisations. We are seeing here a very important change.\u201d\u000a\u000aTalking about Brexit, Barroso commented: \u201cIt is too soon to say what will happen with Brexit. Why? Because there is no strategy. Neither from the British or European side. The British haven\u2019t decided what they want. It was easy to vote no but the question is to vote how to do it. It is not clear how to do it\u2026. Frankly, nobody knows in London.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd on the US election result, Barroso said: \u201cPresident Elect Trump needs to adapt to the world and the world needs to adapt to him. In economic terms, investors are mainly happy about what he has announced so far \u2013 less regulation, lower taxes and huge programme of infrastructure\u2026 There is a question mark though on trade, where his rhetoric has been extremely negative. I believe that if the agenda of President Elect Trump is an agenda about growth, then he cannot do it without trade.\u201d\u000a\u000aH.E. Noura Al Kaabi, Chairwoman, Media Zone Authority-Abu Dhabi and twofour54 said: \u201ctwofour54, Abu Dhabi\u2019s content creation hub, and the Tourism and Culture Authority Abu Dhabi are working to drive the development of Abu Dhabi\u2019s cultural economy by bringing together the best of government, private sector and international partners to deliver major initiatives.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a location for blockbuster films such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the last stop on the global Formula 1 calendar, and home of international cultural collaborations such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi; we are creating an international brand and destination that appeals to a diverse global audience.\u000a\u000aShe further commented: \u201cAbu Dhabi organizations are working behind the scenes to incubate a sustainable media and cultural ecosystem by supporting infrastructure development, educational initiatives and legislative frameworks.\u201d\u000a\u000aH.E. Mohamed Al Mubarak, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority, said: \u201cBoth TCA Abu Dhabi and TwoFour54 play crucial roles in delivering Abu Dhabi\u2019s economic diversification ambitions.

aV(CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.\u000a\u000aBut as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.\u000a\u000aWhat began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.\u000a\u000aBut the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.\u000a\u000aGuatamala's past still haunts\u000a\u000aCifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual.\u000a\u000aMany women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.\u000a\u000aA 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.\u000a\u000aThere are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.\u000a\u000aSome 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.\u000a\u000aExplosion in violence\u000a\u000aMexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.\u000a\u000aPrevailing culture of machismo\u000a\u000aPerhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society.\u000a\u000aAccording to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, "80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed." This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.\u000a\u000aMake an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence\u000a\u000aU.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls\u000a\u000aThe political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.\u000a\u000a"Politicians don't think women are important," says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. "Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor."\u000a\u000aLack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.\u000a\u000aQuiroa says "They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade."\u000a\u000aSigns of progress\u000a\u000aAlthough the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.\u000a\u000aCifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.\u000a\u000aSince 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or "The Powerful," have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.\u000a\u000aFive Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or "The Powerful" share their stories and help other women get support.\u000a\u000aThe show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.\u000a\u000aThe taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or "Opening Opportunities". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.\u000a\u000aSenior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. "They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights."\u000a\u000aColom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.\u000a\u000aThe Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.\u000a\u000aPehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.\u000a\u000aAdelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence.\u000a\u000aBen Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, "We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women."\u000a\u000aBut the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.\u000a\u000aCifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.

aVGrocery giant Kroger reported sluggish sales growth and a slight drop in profits Friday. Its stock sank as investors remain concerned about lower food prices and the growing threat from Amazon and Walmart.\u000a\u000aKroger (KR), which also owns the Ralphs, Harris Teeter and Fry's chains of supermarkets, has nearly 2,800 stores in 35 states and Washington, DC. It is clearly a leader in the industry.\u000a\u000aBut deeper pocketed competitors like Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), which just completed the purchase of Whole Foods, are stepping up their grocery game.\u000a\u000aThe German-based chains Aldi and Lidi pose a threat too. Both have boosted their presence in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe increased competition from these rivals -- coupled with continued low prices for food and many other supermarket staples (avocados notwithstanding) -- are a big reason why Kroger's sales have been hurt.\u000a\u000aKroger's total sales rose just 3.9% in its second quarter. And same-store sales, which measure the performance at supermarkets open at least one year, were up just 0.7%. Shares fell 6% Friday on the news.\u000a\u000aWhat's more, Kroger expects anemic sales going forward, too. It said same-store sales would likely rise only 0.5% to 1% for the rest of the year.\u000a\u000aRelated: Amazon waging the war for retail\u000a\u000aKroger recognizes that it must keep prices low to entice shoppers, especially now that Jeff Bezos and Amazon are trying to rid Whole Foods of its overpriced, "Whole Paycheck" image.\u000a\u000aThis was a key line from Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen in the earnings release. He noted that "our customers' price perception is excellent and continues to improve. We have and always will put the customer first in all we do."\u000a\u000aMy translation: Bring it Amazon and Walmart! You too, Aldi and Lidi. Our prices are low already and can get even lower.\u000a\u000aKroger did tout strong digital sales growth. Online shopping sales more than doubled. But digital remains relatively small and doesn't move the needle.\u000a\u000aPlus, the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon shows that Bezos clearly still recognizes the value in physical grocery stores.\u000a\u000aRelated: Grocers clobbered by Walmart\u000a\u000aNot everyone wants to buy food online from places like Fresh Direct and Instacart or get meal kits delivered from Blue Apron (APRN).\u000a\u000aKroger did not mention whether or not it would be helped or hurt by the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma though. The company has many stores in Texas and Florida.\u000a\u000aIt's possible that a rush to buy groceries by consumers impacted by the storms could boost Kroger's sales. However, food shortages and damages or closures to stores may hurt Kroger. We just have to wait and see.\u000a\u000aWhat is certain though is that it's a great time to be a shopper at grocery stores like Kroger.\u000a\u000aBut an investor? Not so much. Kroger's stock is now down nearly 40% this year.

aV(CNN) When does a child stop being a child and become a girl or a boy? A difficult question which can have serious consequences for children, according to a new report by Plan International , which has been gathering data and analyzing statistics on young adults.\u000a\u000aOver the next decade, an estimated 40 million youngsters in Sub-Saharan Africa will drop out of school, according to the World Bank\u000a\u000aGirls drop out of school more than boys, according to Plan, and researchers want governments to change the way they gather data and pay more attention to the reasons why this happens in order to fight gender inequality.\u000a\u000aStatistics on the under-15s tend not to differentiate between boys and girls, and this keeps the specific needs of young girls in the shadows, according to Plan International's CEO Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen.\u000a\u000a"You simply cannot target the program to the girl child, because you can't analyze the data in a way that will allow you to tailor your programs in an appropriate way," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000a"We have fairly good statistics that show us that there are more girls that drop out of secondary (high) school than boys, but what we don't know is why they do it."\u000a\u000aAlthough this is a blind spot in the official data, organizations like Plan have begun to investigate the causes and have found three key reasons: child marriage, menstruation and poverty.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Siphethangani, 18, pictured, finished secondary (high) school with flying colors and is now doing her A-Levels (college exams). "I love school because that's the foundation of a good life," she tells the researchers. But life looks very different for some girls. From poverty to child marriage, there are an array of reasons why many young Zimbabwean women drop out of school. These are their stories, as told to Plan International.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Siphiwe, 19, is a stay-at-home wife and mother who couldn't afford to finish school.

Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Siphiwe's days are now filled with household and childcare tasks.

She took up work as a sex worker to make ends meet -- she earns a couple of dollars per client, according to Plan. Sometimes, clients reject her for being too young, she told Plan's researchers. Others are violent. "Sometimes the men use force. It's very painful." Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 Jenny's friend Pauline has been working as a sex worker for three years, and has lost count of the number of men she has been with, according to Plan.

Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Zimbabwe's stay-at-home daughters 'Invisible' girls of Zimbabwe \u2013 To pass the time, Melissa plays netball with other girls who no longer go to school. According to Plan, there are hundreds of Zimbabwean girls out of school living unfulfilled lives. Hide Caption 10 of 10\u000a\u000aTake menstruation for example. Approaching puberty can be tough for everyone, but in some African countries girls skip school during their periods if they have nowhere to wash or change sanitary towels and tampons, according to Albrectsen.\u000a\u000a"We have literally hundreds of thousands of stories of that kind," she says.\u000a\u000a"One month they might stay away a week, and then another week next month. Then they start falling behind and they don't want to go back to school, and some may drop out altogether," she adds.\u000a\u000aWhile the most common reason given is money, forced marriage and pregnancy are other key factors, despite most governments having targets for all children to complete secondary education, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aChild marriage, periods and poverty are among barriers keeping girls out of education.\u000a\u000a"We see time and time again that some of those programs fail, because they are not based on enough evidence on where to target the investment."\u000a\u000aPlan International's researchers have been interviewing girls and young women in Zimbabwe about their education.\u000a\u000a"A girl might be forced into marriage, then get pregnant, and therefore can't go to school," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aChild marriage, poverty and education are all linked, the interviews suggested. Some girls get married early for family financial reasons and then quit school, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000a"Basically you marry the girl off, and so she is less of a burden to the family."\u000a\u000aOthers in the case study quit school for financial reasons and then got married.\u000a\u000a"Whether it's poverty that forces the girl out of school, or marriage, is inconclusive, but it's clear that a combination of the prevalence of early marriage and poverty has a devastating impact on girls being able to complete secondary education," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aDue to a lack of job opportunities for young women without an education, some young girls in Zimbabwe have turned to prostitution, according to Plan.\u000a\u000aThe UN's Global Sustainable Development Goals include targets for improving gender equality, and Plan's report is a wake-up call to governments trying to bridge the gender gap.\u000a\u000aThis gap goes beyond education. The day-to-day realities of young boys and girls can be very different even within the family, according to a recent UNICEF report , with gender roles forming already early on and young girls bearing the greater burden of household chores.\u000a\u000aThis form of inequality in the household could be detrimental to girls' development and self-image, according to UNICEF's report.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are 1.1 billion girls in the world under the age of 18. More than half live in Asia and a quarter in Africa. While many regions will have fewer or as many girls by 2030, the number of girls in Africa will grow by 30 percent, according to UNICEF.\u000a\u000a"There are almost 2 billion children in the world under the age of 15, and most of those live in developing countries," Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aIf African governments are to improve the prospects for young girls, they need to tackle the blind spots in gender data for the under-15s, Albrectsen says.\u000a\u000aBut why in the eyes of data do children typically become men and women at the age of 15?\u000a\u000aAlbrectsen doesn't know the answer. But placing women's reproductive age between 15 and 49 is prevalent worldwide, she says, even though the actual reproductive age may begin earlier.\u000a\u000a"Fundamentally you're saying they are just children, and they are legally not allowed to, or shouldn't be, having sex," she says.\u000a\u000a"But they are."\u000a\u000aThis may mean that data on pregnancies and sexual activity under the age of 15 is not gathered, she says.\u000a\u000aCan a data revolution make the world a more equal place?\u000a\u000aThe result? Governments may be unable to tackle issues such as teenage pregnancies.\u000a\u000a"If you are not measuring it, how can you deal with the consequences?"\u000a\u000aHowever, data collection is expensive, and it can be hard for governments to justify spending money on this, at the expense of other areas, especially in developing countries.\u000a\u000aBut Albrectsen says it would pay off.\u000a\u000a"Initial investment in getting the data systems up and running will ultimately save money through better targeting of [equality] programs in the long run, and have a bigger impact."

aVMichael Smart is an assistant professor of transportation planning at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The views expressed are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Imagine being able to travel from New York to Los Angeles without having to step on a plane, yet be able to do so in a fraction of the time it would take to drive. On the surface, that tantalizing prospect took a step closer with the news last month that a Japanese maglev train had reached a top speed of close to 400 mph, breaking its own world record in the process.\u000a\u000aAnd the sight of futuristic looking trains whizzing past platforms at hundreds of miles per hour isn't confined to Japan: China, France and Spain, to name a few, have their own high-speed rail networks. Indeed, while these bullet trains may look futuristic, they have been around for decades; they're a tried and tested technology that the Japanese debuted over 50 years ago.\u000a\u000aSo surely it's only a matter of time before large numbers of U.S. passengers are doing a daily commute to New York from Washington and Boston in about the time it would take them to drive to work in their own cities, right?\u000a\u000aNot anytime soon.\u000a\u000aWhile several countries have undertaken the tough work of raising the money to invest in bullet trains, it's unlikely the United States will ever see the vast network of high-speed trains that blanket other countries. Indeed, passenger rail service in the United States lags behind much of the rest of the developed world, for several reasons.\u000a\u000aFor a start, much of the United States is not exactly an ideal market for high-speed rail. Compared to places where rail really flourishes -- Japan and Western Europe, for instance -- the United States is geographically vast. As a result, in much of the country, cities are far enough apart that air travel provides significant time savings, even compared to some of the fastest trains.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Japan's trains as safe as they are fast Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan's trains as safe as they are fast 02:19\u000a\u000aThe layout of cities matters, too. When you arrive in Tokyo, Paris or Barcelona, it's often convenient (and even pleasant) to walk to your final destination. When it's not, a fast and frequent mass transportation system awaits to whisk you away. This is not the case in many American cities, where arriving by train typically means jumping into a cab or renting a car for the last leg of your journey. Simply put, in many sprawling U.S. cities, getting to your destination by train can still mean you've got quite a way yet to get home. We could change that. And we probably should. But we're not there yet.\u000a\u000aStill, there are several parts of the United States where high-speed rail makes a great deal of sense.\u000a\u000aThe Northeast Corridor (Boston-New York-Washington) comes in at the top of just about every list of potential candidates for high-speed rail, with the distances involved being considered within the "Goldilocks" zone for fast trains. For example, at just over 200 miles from New York to both Boston and Washington, fast trains could compete with even faster airplanes by offering centrally located stations and providing an alternative to the hassle of airport security lines. These cities are dense, have strong downtowns, and extensive mass transit systems once you arrive.\u000a\u000aJust as importantly, rail on the Northeast Corridor can also compete with driving, mainly because traffic congestion makes driving in the region so slow and unreliable, while tolls and parking costs can make it an expensive and time-consuming option. Rail in the northeast even has a great track record; after Amtrak's almost-high-speed Acela service began on the Northeast Corridor in 2000, ridership exploded, quickly outstripping air travel between New York and Washington.\u000a\u000aHowever, the biggest barrier to improved rail service in the United States is simply the lack of political will. At the federal level, support for passenger rail service has languished and Washington has devolved decision-making (and increasingly, funding) to the states. With the nation's transportation trust fund nearly broke and no permanent solution in sight, it seems unlikely the federal government will champion high-speed rail -- a costly endeavor -- in the near future.\u000a\u000aWithout leadership from the federal government, the states are largely in control. Yet many of the most promising corridors for high-speed rail cross state lines, making it difficult to plan for better rail service. In 2009, the Obama administration awarded nearly a billion dollars of stimulus money to plan and upgrade a high-speed rail line connecting Chicago to Milwaukee and Madison. A year later, Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, rejected his state's portion of the money and the project was, for the time being, at least, derailed. (The money quickly found its way to a grateful California for its high-speed rail line.)\u000a\u000aStill, all is not lost for those hoping to see high-speed rail in the United States.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours 01:17\u000a\u000aCalifornia is committed to building its high-speed rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles, paying for the line largely with state money raised by a new cap-and-trade market on carbon emissions. Several privately funded projects are also in the planning stages. For instance, a Dallas-to-Houston line promises 205 mph service in 2021 without a single dollar from the taxpayer. Meanwhile, another private company has already begun construction on a Miami-to-Orlando line with a more modest speed of 125 mph, with service expected to begin in 2017.\u000a\u000aAll this points to how high-speed rail will likely progress in the United States: piecemeal. It is doubtful that we will have a nationwide system of fast trains soon. And this is not necessarily a bad thing; through a combination of private and public action, we should target markets where high-speed rail makes sense. That means looking for shorter corridors connecting dense places with existing mass transit infrastructure.\u000a\u000aHigh-speed rail won't be cheap, so we'll have to choose wisely. Some of the most promising corridors are also the most expensive; Amtrak estimates upgrading the Northeast Corridor to true high-speed rail would cost upward of $150 billion . Such an undertaking requires careful consideration of the economic, environmental and other costs and benefits of individual projects. But more importantly, it requires the kind of long-term planning that seems to have become vanishingly rare.\u000a\u000aThankfully, high-speed rail doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach. And while given the choice I would rather be riding Japan's speeding bullet trains, even the incremental improvements we've seen in services like Amtrak's Acela can make rail travel a lot more appealing for the hundreds of thousands of passengers who rely on it every year.\u000a\u000aRead CNN Opinion's Flipboard magazine.

aV(CNN) It's never easy keeping everyone happy, particularly when you have to decide which star player gets which tennis court at major tournaments.\u000a\u000aThose tensions were laid bare Thursday when Maria Sharapova's rival Caroline Wozniacki was riled by US Open officials putting the Dane on court 17 where she lost in the second round to Ekaterina Makarova.\u000a\u000aFeeling despondent after losing 6-2, 6-7, 6-1 to the unseeded Russian, Wozniacki tipped her hat to her opponent before turning her ire on Sharapova who won her first two matches on the US Open's main stage -- the prestigious Arthur Ashe Stadium.\u000a\u000a"I understand completely the business side of things, but someone who comes back from a drugs sentence -- performance-enhancing drugs -- and all of a sudden gets to play every single match on Center Court, I think that's a questionable thing to do," fifth-seeded Wozniacki told Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet.\u000a\u000aNothing quite like a Friday night in New York.

aV(CNN) Stephen King adaptations have a spotty track record, and grading on that curve, "It" delivers -- a creepy, smartly cast retelling of this ode to deep-seated fears and adolescence, which should scare up plenty of box office for a movie business desperately in need of a post-summer jolt.\u000a\u000aWith a popular book and memorable 1990 miniseries already to its name (a project that, like many a King thing, began extremely well before fizzling at the end), "It" serves notice early that it isn't just clowning around. And it gives away little to say that by focusing steadfastly on the youths in this story -- as opposed to jumping back and forth in time, as the miniseries did -- the movie shrewdly sets up an inevitable (and planned) sequel featuring their older selves pressed into battle.\u000a\u000aBattling what exactly has always been "It's" slightly fuzzy aspect, and that remains true here. Beginning in 1988, the movie takes place in the town of Derry, which is unusually prone to missing persons in general and especially children, snatched away by an ancient evil that, someone eventually figures out, appears to resurface every 27 years. (The time lapse between the aforementioned miniseries and the movie's opening is an especially nice touch.)\u000a\u000aThe malevolent spirit takes the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgard), who has picked up some CGI-abetted morphing skills since Tim Curry played him. His accessories, however, are still the the stuff of nightmares, from those razor-sharp teeth to the haunting image of bright red balloons.\u000a\u000a" allowfullscreen>\u000a\u000aAmong Pennywise's victims is the little brother of Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened, leading his posse of self-proclaimed losers in investigating a mystery about which the town's adults -- who are about as present as Charlie Brown's parents, when they aren't destructive and evil -- seem to care not at all.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000aAmsterdam (CNN) A dozen years ago, when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, I was out of the country, watching the wrenching images from Amsterdam, a city that sits almost seven feet below sea level, in a country that has endured more than its share of death and destruction from raging storms.\u000a\u000aNow, once again, the evening news in the Netherlands shows the suffering in the United States. The Dutch are watching stories narrated by drenched Dutch reporters in Texas, showing elderly Houstonians being evacuated and young families carrying their children and their pets to safety as all their worldly possessions sink in the epic flood brought by Harvey. But beyond having compassion, people here are wondering why it is that Americans seem so reluctant to apply the lessons the Netherlands already learned -- and at such high cost.\u000a\u000aMost reports about the disaster include a discussion about why the Netherlands, with much of the country lying below sea level, has managed to avoid a major flood in decades while the United States is suffering yet another catastrophe.\u000a\u000aThe answer, beyond the precise technical details the experts here provide, is about culture, politics and psychology.\u000a\u000aThe United States is in denial.\u000a\u000aAmerica's denial comes in two categories. First, there is climate change denial. Prior to entering politics, Donald Trump tweeted that climate change was a conspiracy against America, claiming that "global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive."\u000a\u000aAnd since taking office, President Trump has removed the United States from the Paris Agreement, disbanded his climate change council and seemingly rejected much of establishment science. And scientists -- specifically meteorologists -- predicted much of what Harvey would do, even if Trump claimed nobody knew how terrible it would be.\u000a\u000aThe fact is that hurricanes have always occurred, but they have become more destructive with warmer waters and higher sea levels. Hurricane Sandy would not have flooded Manhattan 100 years ago, when sea level was a foot lower . And the trend is sure to worsen.\u000a\u000aThe other form of denial is psychological; it's the one that says this will not happen to me, to us. Despite the certainty that more potentially devastating storms will strike, we have not seen a concerted effort to tackle the problem. In fact, the administration is rolling back flood-proof infrastructure regulations without facing much meaningful pushback.\u000a\u000aIn addition to denial, the United States, particularly on the right of the political spectrum, has a generalized aversion to government. Ronald Reagan famously declared "the nine scariest words in the English language are 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.'"\u000a\u000aAs it happens, there are some burdens only the government is strong enough to carry. The Dutch learned that battling the sea is one of them.\u000a\u000aThe wake-up call came in 1953, when a massive storm killed more than 1,800 people, flooding much of the country, damaging farmlands, killing farm animals and destroying property.\u000a\u000aImmediately after, the Netherlands established a commission to decide how to deal with a threat of more storms. The commission devised a plan that was enshrined into law, specifying what level of risk is tolerable.\u000a\u000aThe so-called Delta Law was passed in 1959 and updated into the Water Law in 2009. Under the law, the government launched a major engineering project at great cost, building the now-famous Delta Works, a system of locks and flood protection systems that was completed in 1997.\u000a\u000aInstead of waiting for so-called once-in-100-years rainstorms -- which now come more frequently -- the Dutch have lowered the flood risk to what they calculate is one in 4,000 years. The law even requires that authorities hold the risk in some parts of the country to one in 10,000 years\u000a\u000aThe systems now include walling off the water and, at the same time, letting it into canals and other bodies of water, where technicians can regulate levels.\u000a\u000aThe original Delta Works price tag was steep, $5 billion , but a bargain relative to the cost of inaction. Compare it to one storm in the United States, Katrina, with a total cost estimated by FEMA at $108 billion , and immense human suffering.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aWhen discussing the situation in Houston, Dutch experts note that US infrastructure is poorly maintained, and tolerable risk levels are not defined by law.\u000a\u000aBut they also acknowledge that there are no guarantees. They are looking at Houston's tragedy as further reason to upgrade Dutch infrastructure. After all, the sea level, already well above the city of Amsterdam, is projected to rise by as much as 4 feet by the end of this century.\u000a\u000aWith a risk of that magnitude, there is no room for denial. Dutch voters and politicians know that playing politics with it is simply unacceptable.

aVThe new movie based on Stephen King's classic horror tale "It" opens this weekend, sending shivers down the spines of clown-haters across the country. In the story, a creature disguised as a clown preys on the phobias of its young targets.\u000a\u000aThese fiendish clowns reportedly tried to lure women and children into the woods , chased people with knives and machetes, and yelled at people from cars. They were spotted hanging out in cemeteries and were caught in the headlights of cars as they appeared alongside desolate country roads in the dead of night.\u000a\u000aAfter eerily similar events occurred in the Boston area in the 1980s, Loren Coleman , a cryptozoologist who studies the folklore behind mythical beasts such as Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, came up with something called "The Phantom Clown Theory," which attributes the proliferation of clown sightings to mass hysteria (usually sparked by incidents witnessed only by children).\u000a\u000aIt's impossible to determine which of these incidents were hoaxes and which were bona fide tales of clowning around taken to the extreme. Nonetheless, the perpetrators seemed to be capitalizing on our longstanding love-hate relationship with clowns, tapping into the primal dread that so many children (and more than a few adults) experience in their presence.\u000a\u000aIn fact, a 2008 study conducted in England revealed that very few children actually like clowns. It also concluded that the common practice of decorating children's wards in hospitals with pictures of clowns may create the exact opposite of a nurturing environment. It's no wonder so many people hate Ronald McDonald\u000a\u000aBut as a psychologist, I'm not just interested in pointing out that clowns give us the creeps; I'm also interested in why we find them so disturbing. Last year I published a study entitled "On the Nature of Creepiness" with one of my students, Sara Koehnke, in the journal New Ideas in Psychology. While the study was not specifically looking at the creepiness of clowns, much of what we discovered can help explain this intriguing phenomenon.\u000a\u000aThe march of the clowns\u000a\u000aClown-like characters have been around for thousands of years. Historically, jesters and clowns have been a vehicle for satire and for poking fun at powerful people. They provided a safety valve for letting off steam and they were granted unique freedom of expression -- as long as their value as entertainers outweighed the discomfort they caused the higher-ups.\u000a\u000aJesters and others persons of ridicule go back at least to ancient Egypt, and the English word "clown" first appeared sometime in the 1500s, when Shakespeare used the term to describe foolish characters in several of his plays. The now familiar circus clown -- with its painted face, wig and oversized clothing -- arose in the 19th century and has changed only slightly over the past 150 years.\u000a\u000aNor is the trope of the evil clown anything new. Last year, writer Benjamin Radford published "Bad Clowns," in which he traces the historical evolution of clowns into unpredictable, menacing creatures.\u000a\u000aThe persona of the creepy clown really came into its own after serial killer John Wayne Gacy was captured. In the 1970s, Gacy appeared at children's birthday parties as "Pogo the Clown" and also regularly painted pictures of clowns. When the authorities discovered that he had killed at least 33 people, burying most of them in the crawl space of his suburban Chicago home, the connection between clowns and dangerous psychopathic behavior became forever fixed in the collective unconscious of Americans.\u000a\u000aThe nature of creepiness\u000a\u000aPsychology, however, can help explain why clowns -- the supposed purveyors of jokes and pranks -- often end up sending chills down our spines.\u000a\u000aMy research was the first empirical study of creepiness, and I had a hunch that feeling creeped out might have something to do with ambiguity -- about not really being sure how to react to a person or situation.\u000a\u000aWe recruited 1,341 volunteers ranging in age from 18 to 77 to fill out an online survey. In the first section of the survey, our participants rated the likelihood that a hypothetical "creepy person" would exhibit 44 different behaviors, such as unusual patterns of eye contact or physical characteristics like visible tattoos. In the second section of the survey, participants rated the creepiness of 21 different occupations, and in the third section they simply listed two hobbies that they thought were creepy. In the final section, participants noted how much they agreed with 15 statements about the nature of creepy people.\u000a\u000aThe results indicated that people we perceive as creepy are much more likely to be males than females (as are most clowns), that unpredictability is an important component of creepiness and that unusual patterns of eye contact and other nonverbal behaviors set off our creepiness detectors big time.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED How to follow the Clown Commandments Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How to follow the Clown Commandments 00:58\u000a\u000aUnusual or strange physical characteristics such as bulging eyes, a peculiar smile or inordinately long fingers did not, in and of themselves, cause us to perceive someone as creepy. But the presence of weird physical traits can amplify any other creepy tendencies that the person might be exhibiting, such as persistently steering conversations toward peculiar sexual topics or failing to understand the policy about bringing reptiles into the office.\u000a\u000aWhen we asked people to rate the creepiness of different occupations, the one that rose to the top of the creep list was -- you guessed it -- clowns.\u000a\u000aThe results were consistent with my theory that getting "creeped out" is a response to the ambiguity of threat and that it is only when we are confronted with uncertainty about threat that we get the chills.\u000a\u000aFor example, it would be considered rude and strange to run away in the middle of a conversation with someone who is sending out a creepy vibe but is actually harmless; at the same time, it could be perilous to ignore your intuition and engage with that individual if he is, in fact, a threat. The ambivalence leaves you frozen in place, wallowing in discomfort.\u000a\u000aThis reaction could be adaptive, something humans have evolved to feel, with being "creeped out" a way to maintain vigilance during a situation that could be dangerous.\u000a\u000aWhy clowns set off our creep alert\u000a\u000aIn light of our study's results, it is not at all surprising that we find them to be creepy.\u000a\u000aRami Nader is a Canadian psychologist who studies coulrophobia, the irrational fear of clowns. Nader believes that clown phobias are fueled by the fact that clowns wear makeup and disguises that hide their true identities and feelings.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThis is perfectly consistent with my hypothesis that it is the inherent ambiguity surrounding clowns that make them creepy. They seem to be happy, but are they really? And they're mischievous, which puts people constantly on guard. People interacting with a clown during one of his routines never know if they are about to get a pie in the face or be the victim of some other humiliating prank. The highly unusual physical characteristics of the clown (the wig, the big red nose, the makeup, the odd clothing) only magnify the uncertainty of what the clown might do next.\u000a\u000aThere are certainly other types of people who creep us out (taxidermists and undertakers made a good showing on the creepy occupation spectrum). But they have their work cut out for them if they aspire to the level of creepiness that we automatically attribute to clowns.\u000a\u000aIn other words, they have big shoes to fill.

aV(CNN) When Bitcoin and a subsequent raft of cryptocurrencies first landed in the early part of the decade, many people -- including noted economists and finance experts -- dismissed them as a fad.\u000a\u000aThese new forms of digital money were viewed as little more than capitalist Tamagotchis, currencies with no value to anyone except those looking to buy illicit items.\u000a\u000aThe raft of coffee shops selling lattes for Bitcoins have gone some way to disprove these negative perceptions, but the availability of luxury items like jewelry, cars and even fine art have really stated cryptocurrencies' case for permanence -- nearly a decade after they first came about.\u000a\u000a"Many economists dismissed it as a flawed form of money, something that could never achieve the level of adoption that it has," said Dr. Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the University of Cambridge and the London School of Economics.\u000a\u000a"Today we estimate 5 to 10 million unique active users of cryptocurrencies, and in my opinion that's nothing short of a minor economic miracle."\u000a\u000aBitcoin rules\u000a\u000aThe market leader is still Bitcoin, its name now so engrained in this alternative economy that it has become a catch-all moniker for other currencies, just like "Hoover" has become a name for all vacuum cleaners.\u000a\u000aDespite fluctuations in value, withdrawal issues, a potentially dangerous "hard fork" schism and what Hileman calls "internal governance challenges," Bitcoin has defied expectations and passed the $4,000 mark for the first time in August.\u000a\u000aOnly six years ago, in mid-2011, one Bitcoin was worth just $1. One expert, Saxo Bank's Kay Van Petersen, believes that in 10 years, the price of Bitcoin could reach as much as $100,000.\u000a\u000aArt for Bitcoin\u000a\u000aWith cryptocurrencies seemingly here for the long run, more and more industries are using them.\u000a\u000aMicrosoft and Paypal are among the more established companies now accepting Bitcoin, alongside all kinds of businesses across the world -- including pubs, plumbers and tattoo parlors.\u000a\u000aOne market that could prove something of a game-changer is the ever-investing art world, where art-for-Bitcoin is being pioneered by London gallery owner Eleesa Dadiani, of the eponymous Dadiani Gallery.\u000a\u000aIn her Mayfair, London base of operations -- which deals primarily with older, established artists such as sculptor Michael Sandle and painter Keith Milow -- Dadiani explains how she became interested in cryptocurrencies. "I looked into it a few years ago, but it didn't really mean much to me ... I have no computing or financial background, it was too abstract for me to embrace at that point," she said. "But through this gallery, I started to discover ways in which the business model can run better."\u000a\u000aFor Dadiani, the realities of selling work in Bitcoin are nearly as simple as accepting traditional tender. "Everything we have in the gallery is for sale with cryptocurrency," she said. "It's done very simply, it requires the other party to have a digital wallet and takes a matter of moments. We accept Bitcoin, Etherium, Etherium classic, Live Coin/NEM, Ripple. I'm open to accepting others."\u000a\u000aA serious investment\u000a\u000aThe first pieces available in Bitcon at Dadiani are Mike O'Connor's sculptures made out of used Formula 1 car engines.\u000a\u000aDadiani emphasizes that this is not a gimmick. For her, cryptocurrency is not only the future of her business, but a brave new way of doing things that will have ripples across the globe -- if people can get over their prejudices regarding it.\u000a\u000a"Bitcoin opened us to a whole market of people who wish to test the power of this currency against real assets," she said. "It validates the currency, it makes it real ... but until more businesses accept this currency, it will be hard to see it as a real currency."\u000a\u000aHileman goes a step further and suggests that the art world is the perfect industry for a cryptocurrency to survive. "Some people say that Bitcoin is more similar to a piece of art or an alternative asset than a currency," he said. "Some are buying goods and services with Bitcoin, but many are simply holding it as an asset, like gold or art. So it's a smart move by the gallery to notice that somebody who's investing in Bitcoin might also be interested in investing in art."\u000a\u000aDadiani says she doesn't know of any other gallery owners currently accepting cryptocurrencies, but she believes other luxury businesses are interested. "We're hoping that by spearheading it with art, we can get people to think about how they can expand their client base," she said. "There are so many more possibilities when you come into this new economy."\u000a\u000aWhat can Bitcoin get you?\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of other luxury items that Bitcoin can buy.\u000a\u000aA painting of rapper Notorious BIG is available on online gallery site Bitpremier.com for 2.946 Bitcoin (or about $10,000, for the more traditional buyer). Boats, planes and even a condo in the Trump hotel are for sale on other sites. Any of them would be the perfect status symbol for the modern tech millionaire.\u000a\u000aAccording to Hileman, there are also more practical factors that come into play when buyers choose Bitcoin, such as the speed of the transactions and lower fees compared to traditional payment methods like credit cards.\u000a\u000a"If you're only paying a $2 transaction fee on a piece of art that's worth tens of thousands, the fee is basically zero. But if you're paying 2 or 3% on a piece of art of that value, then the numbers can go up quite a bit."\u000a\u000aDeregulation and decentralization are central to Bitcoin's libertarian appeal -- and for Dadiani that is what is so exciting about it. "It's going to change everything, but it must start with people seeing the world differently," she said. "This is our chance to innovate, with something that doesn't ask for permission ... and that's why its exciting for me."

aVStory highlights It was a show of force from the former presidents\u000a\u000aIt highlighted the strain between Trump and his predecessors\u000a\u000a(CNN) President Donald Trump voiced his support late Thursday for a charity appeal from his five living predecessors, but wasn't included in the rollout -- a break from similar efforts in the past that brought together members of the Presidents' Club.\u000a\u000aPresidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all appeared in a public service announcement video that aired during Thursday's NFL season opener. They didn't appear together; instead, they filmed clips separately discussing Hurricane Harvey's devastation that were butted together into a 30-second spot.\u000a\u000aTrump -- who is busy corralling the federal government response as another impending storm barrels toward Florida -- tweeted later that he was "proud to stand with presidents" in supporting the effort, called the One America Appeal. But he wasn't featured in the video and wasn't asked to participate, according to a person familiar with the former presidents' efforts.\u000a\u000aWe will confront ANY challenge, no matter how strong the winds or high the water.

aVIt's an idea that intrigues German-born photographer Corinna Kern , who moved into a squatted commercial building for several months in order to document the uncommon lifestyle unfolding behind its walls.\u000a\u000aShe first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who don't own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master's degree.\u000a\u000aThe notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled "A Place Called Home," in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place.\u000a\u000aHaving moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that's both transient and close-knit.\u000a\u000aThrough the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio.\u000a\u000a"As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe," she said. "The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project."\u000a\u000aAll the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties.\u000a\u000aI came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe. Corinna Kern\u000a\u000aWith housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty.\u000a\u000a"What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living," she writes in the text accompanying her images.\u000a\u000a"The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt."\u000a\u000aThe squatters' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aThe Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says.\u000a\u000aBut since it's now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London's disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term.\u000a\u000aWhen squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern's photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric.\u000a\u000aOther images show "The Castle," a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked.\u000a\u000aAnother of Kern's photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood.\u000a\u000aFor her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. "The use of natural light adds to a candid feel," she said, adding to the authenticity of the images.\u000a\u000a"I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home."\u000a\u000aFar from encountering resistance as she ventured into people's intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs.\u000a\u000a"My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me," she said.\u000a\u000a"The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs."\u000a\u000aDespite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first.\u000a\u000aFrom her images and her words, it's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience.\u000a\u000a"You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views," she writes. "You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them. You may have to move 10 times a year, but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life, turning it into anything but ordinary."

aVManchester, England (CNN) If Manchester City used to be the club boasting high-profile signings on provocative billboards, these days this northern English city's "noisy neighbor" is taking a more softly, softly approach.\u000a\u000aAhead of Saturday's Premier League derby against rival Manchester United, it's all about the grand scheme for a club that was once written off for having "a small mentality."\u000a\u000a"It's been a bit like an iceberg coming out of the water," says Manchester City's chief infrastructure officer, Jon Stemp. "People only see the tip of it."\u000a\u000aGiven City were playing in England's third tier in 1999, the club's ascent to English football's top table initially necessitated the acquisition of players -- an investment of just under $1 billion since the Abu Dhabi United Group took over.\u000a\u000aWithin hours of the club changing hands, City had smashed the British transfer record for Real Madrid's Robinho. City's transfer policy was denigrated -- the new kids on the block were branded oil rich and regarded by many as no more than a billionaire's plaything.\u000a\u000aBut Sheikh Mansour and his team have never lost sight of the bigger picture...\u000a\u000aYou can win anything with kids\u000a\u000a"People were measuring the investments in the short term without knowing there was a long-term plan coming," Stemp says.\u000a\u000aBeneath the surface, greater plans have been afoot ever since Mansour declared in 2008: "We are building a structure for the future, not just a team of all-stars."\u000a\u000aIn the heart of the Etihad Campus, deep within the area of Manchester known as "Sportscity," the 5,000-seater, 7,000-capacity Academy Stadium is the shining jewel in one of the finest youth complexes in the world.\u000a\u000aThe Academy Stadium is predominantly used by the Elite Development squad and Manchester City Women. "I like to think of us as pioneers ... not just in England, but globally," says Man City and England Ladies midfielder Izzy Christiansen.\u000a\u000aIn fixtures against United last season, City went unbeaten in every age group, from the Under-9s all the way up to the U18s.\u000a\u000aA 9-0 aggregate win at U14 level against the Red Devils will have been particularly galling for a club so proud of Ferguson's Class of '92 -- featuring the likes of David Beckham -- and the Busby Babes\u000a\u000aIn an age when many of the world's wealthiest clubs' academies are filled with many different nationalities, 75% of the players in City's Football Academy are drawn from the Greater Manchester area.\u000a\u000aAll in all, the club engages with "the best part of 50,000 young people in Manchester every year," according to former City goalkeeper Alex Williams -- now manager of club's City in the Community program.\u000a\u000aEven United luminaries Robin van Persie, Phil Neville, Andrew Cole and Darren Fletcher have opted to send their sons to the Etihad Campus instead of the Trafford Training Center in recent years.\u000a\u000aStemp allows himself a contented smile. "Now, eight years on, you see the rest of the investment plan emerging."\u000a\u000aThe Mission\u000a\u000aPart of the legacy of the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the Etihad Stadium was the "first brick in the wall," according to Stemp.\u000a\u000aEver since, City plots its expansion in terms of "building blocks of eureka moments," from the transformation of blighted lands with the construction of the training complex, to the development of commercial opportunities around the East Manchester site.\u000a\u000aWithin a stone's throw of the Etihad, remnants of Manchester's industrial past are still very much visible -- disused gas holders dot the landscape while a canal runs side-by-side with the city's new tram network.\u000a\u000a"East Manchester was all industrial, and therefore the ideal location for regeneration," Stemp tells CNN.\u000a\u000aBut 80 acres of contaminated brownfield land have been transformed by self-confessed "grass nerd" Stemp and his team; 46 acres now comprise managed grass and wildflower meadows; and more than 2,000 trees have been planted.\u000a\u000a"It was very derelict," reflects Stemp, gesturing to the work the club has done. "We put our arms around the land and took control of it."\u000a\u000aThe final piece in the puzzle\u000a\u000aAs well as the physical building blocks, City officials believe coach Pep Guardiola is the final piece in a complex puzzle.\u000a\u000a"I have no doubt about his positive impact," City's chief operating officer Omar Berrada tells CNN. "We've already expanded the stadium and we think (Guardiola) will bring the potential for continued expansion."\u000a\u000a"Pep delivers a culture of success and style of play that will be developed across everything that we're doing here," Berrada says. "I'm sure that will have long-lasting effects."\u000a\u000aPep Guardiola already seems at home at the Etihad.\u000a\u000aBerrada branded Guardiola "the best in the world" within days of his arrival in a reference to the success he brought to his former clubs, Bayern Munich and Barcelona.\u000a\u000aThe Spanish coach's reputation is also helping lure the world's finest players to Manchester as the club bids to win its third Premier League title in six seasons.\u000a\u000aGundogan\u000a\u000aGuardiola's first foray into the market was for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan -- a distinguished Germany international.\u000a\u000a"To have this possibility is amazing for me," Gundogan tells CNN. "We have the best manager in the world, and day-by-day I recognize I have made the right decision."\u000a\u000aIlkay Gundogan began his career at VFL Bochum, going on to star for FC Nurnberg & Borussia Dortmund\u000a\u000aThe 25-year-old may have only been at the club for a matter of months, but he already perceives the investment transforming not just City, but the city.\u000a\u000a"Everything is developing really fast. I love the mix between old buildings and the new buildings," Gundogan says.\u000a\u000a"Manchester has a real charm."\u000a\u000aBreaking the glass ceiling\u000a\u000aIf the acquisition of players of Gundogan's stature is no longer breaking news for a club that has come so far, Kelechi Iheanacho's breakthrough from the academy shows progress is being made in all departments.\u000a\u000aIheanacho had the Premier League's best minutes- per-goal ratio in 2015-16, scoring on average every 93.8 minutes.\u000a\u000aSmashing through a glass ceiling that traditionally has proven so troublesome for young players aiming to make it in the world's richest league, the 19-year-old scored 14 goals in just 11 starts last season -- suggesting he has the mettle to become one of the most clinical finishers in Europe.\u000a\u000aWith key striker Sergio Aguero serving a three-match ban, Iheanacho could start against United Saturday.\u000a\u000a"City were a club on the way up," Iheanacho tells CNN, reflecting on his perception of the team when he joined, shortly after winning the U17 World Cup with Nigeria.\u000a\u000a"Coming from Nigeria where I was often unable to afford to watch the Premier League, I'm very proud to be playing here. It has been a great experience coming to Manchester."\u000a\u000aCitizens beyond The Citizens\u000a\u000aHowever, in an age of growing discord between fan and player -- as both Iheanacho and Gundogan earn tens of thousands of dollars per week -- how has the club's investment in its future served the rest of Manchester?\u000a\u000aWorking at Bonnie's Cafe near the Etihad Campus, Sheila Duffy has experienced first-hand the fruits of the area's regeneration -- as well as the potential pitfalls of gentrification.\u000a\u000a"We had drugs, street crime, everything like that, and nobody cared because it was derelict," she reflects. "The swimming baths were closed down, the youth club was shut. There was nothing for the kids so they'd be hanging around on street corners."\u000a\u000aDuffy acknowledges the "Sheikh up in his helicopter" may not have directly engaged with the man on the ground and his full English breakfast, but she's the first to admit her surroundings have changed dramatically -- a reference to the five and half acres of the Etihad Campus site donated to the local community.\u000a\u000aWhere the skeletons of Manchester's industrial boom once stood, a sixth-form college, leisure center, and cutting-edge medical institute now preside.\u000a\u000a"It was a rough area of the city and now there's certainly a sense of hope ... and I'm a Manchester United supporter!"\u000a\u000aA 190m span bridge across Alan Turing way is emblematic of the connection between club and community.\u000a\u000aPep vs. Jose\u000a\u000aIf the foundations are in place, can City make good on the club's rich promise?\u000a\u000aWhile Iheanacho may be a singular talent, his presence as a youth-team graduate in the Citizens squad currently remains similarly conspicuous.\u000a\u000aPromisingly, Guardiola gave 22 young players debuts during his time at Barcelona -- many of whom, from Busquets to Thiago Alcântara, have gone on to enjoy great success.\u000a\u000aBut there is still some way to go before City emerges from United's shadow in this regard.\u000a\u000aNicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville would all go on to become United regulars having progressed from the youth team under Sir Alex Ferguson.\u000a\u000aSince 1940, almost 50% of all Manchester United players have come through the club's youth system. United has had at least one academy player in the squad in every first team game since October 1937 -- a run spanning 3,808 consecutive clashes.\u000a\u000aStriker Marcus Rashford, already an England international at the age of 18, looks the latest in a long line set to benefit from that unwavering faith this year -- even if manager Jose Mourinho's commitment to youth has been questioned, and fellow "homegrown" player Paul Pogba required a $100M education abroad.\u000a\u000aExcept the envious glances toward Old Trafford have stopped.\u000a\u000aConverging with its more illustrious counterpart on and off the pitch, City has finished above United in four of the past five seasons, and Mourinho looks like he has quite the job on his hands getting the better of his old rival Guardiola.

aVHow can you enjoy fine wine by the glass without having the rest of the bottle turn to vinegar?\u000a\u000aThat was the challenge Greg Lambrecht set out to solve when his wife gave up alcohol while pregnant.\u000a\u000aFrustrated by opening bottles of wine that would then go to waste, he invented Coravin -- a device that allows you to pour a glass without removing the cork.\u000a\u000aIt works like this: A thin, hollow needle is pushed through the cork to inject argon gas into the bottle. The gas pressure forces wine back up through the same needle and into the glass, while preventing the rest of the bottle from oxidizing. When the needle is withdrawn, the cork reseals.\u000a\u000aLambrecht's inspiration for Coravin came from medicine. After studying nuclear engineering at MIT, he went into medical engineering after working at Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).\u000a\u000aHis first start up -- Intrinsic Therapeutics -- makes technology for spine implants and cancer treatments.\u000a\u000a"I thought - in medicine we go through things all the time with needles and don't damage them," he said.\u000a\u000a"My dad is diabetic, he has an insulin bottle, he sticks his needle through, he drives in the insulin. Maybe I can go through this cork and try to suck out wine like my dad does with insulin?"\u000a\u000aCoravin is available in 50 countries for $299, or $199 depending on how slick you want your model. The argon capsules cost $11 each and need replacing after 15 glasses of wine.\u000a\u000aThat begins to add up. The cost of pouring six glasses would add more than $4 to the price of a bottle.\u000a\u000aBut the serial entrepreneur rejects suggestions that Coravin is a luxury product.\u000a\u000a"I use Coravin even on a $10 bottle of wine. It's about drinking the amount I want and having that wine in the perfect shape every time I taste it," Lambrecht said.\u000a\u000aCoravin's biggest markets are in the U.S., U.K., and France but it's hoping to grow in China and Japan as well as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.\u000a\u000aThe company hired Frédéric Lévy, former president of Nespresso North America, as CEO in 2015 to lead its expansion. One of his early deals was with Morton's The Steakhouse.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant chain was one of the first to offer premium wines by the glass using Coravin. Lambrecht says his product can save restaurateurs a whole lot of money by preventing waste.\u000a\u000aHowever, individual consumers still account for 90% of Coravin's business. Lambrecht said it allows people to taste a far broader range of wine -- and that's proving particularly appealing to younger drinkers.\u000a\u000a"I've met more Millennials who have had Txakolina wine [from the Basque County in Spain] than Cabernet," he said.

aVBrooklyn, New York (CNN) Behind Andre Rozier's bright smile is an iron will to win.\u000a\u000a"I don't like to lose," the champion boxing trainer says. "I don't like my fighters to lose."\u000a\u000aHis brusque commands to "keep moving" and "don't fold up" echo through his basement gym in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes you have to punish yourself to achieve maximum success," the New York native explains.\u000a\u000aIt is clear Rozier knows what he wants in the ring. He also knows how to push his fighters to get there.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, this champion corner man never imagined life as a coach.\u000a\u000aFrom fighter to corner man\u000a\u000aRozier began his boxing career at 11 years old in the Junior Olympics.\u000a\u000aAt 16 he qualified for his first Golden Gloves tournament. But when he went for the physical, he received disturbing news.\u000a\u000a"I was told that I have high blood pressure," he recalls, "... and I said to myself 'what are you talking about?'"\u000a\u000aDoctors suggested Rozier go for a walk and retake the test.\u000a\u000a"I came back the next day and was told the same thing."\u000a\u000aRozier was stripped of his boxing credentials and, ultimately, his dreams of becoming a world-class fighter. Unable to compete, he hung up his gloves.\u000a\u000a"At that point, I was like, you know what, this is it. I'm finished."\u000a\u000aYears later, an eager young boxer pulled a reluctant Rozier back into the sport.\u000a\u000a"I met a young man in my apartment complex who kept asking me to take him to the gym," the trainer explains. "And I would say 'no, I don't have time for it.' "\u000a\u000aBut the relentless boxer continued to pester Rozier to train him.\u000a\u000a"He broke my shell," the corner man says with a laugh. "I wanted to break him."\u000a\u000aStepping back inside the ring\u000a\u000aAfter stepping inside the ring with the young boxer, Rozier says "a new fire was lit" within him. He believes it was the fighter's confidence and exuberance for the sport that slowly drew him back to his first love.\u000a\u000a"It brought me back full circle into the sport of boxing," the coach recalls. "This time as a teacher instead of student."\u000a\u000aRozier says he has coached more than 1 million athletes in his training career. Among his top fighters is Daniel Jacobs, who won the middleweight championship title in 2013.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes you train an athlete for two days and sometimes you train an athlete and they are with you for the rest of their lives," he explains. "It's only because I love it."\u000a\u000aPhotos: In 2011, American boxer Daniel Jacobs was diagnosed with a life-threatening form of bone cancer, and was partially paralyzed.

aVThe three shows provided an appropriate backdrop to a related message: luxury, within the context of design, is being redefined. Bling is passé. High-function trumps high-price, and subtle design details are favored over ostentatious add-ons. Less is more.\u000a\u000a"Modern luxury is about real value," said Marie Kristine Schmidt, Bang & Olufsen's vice president for brand, design and marketing, during the launch of the brand's new BeoSound speaker system.\u000a\u000aA post shared by CNN Style (@cnnstyle) on Apr 5, 2017 at 12:20am PDT\u000a\u000a"Modern luxury is not about mass consumption. I think we're moving towards a time when we are saying we'd rather have less. A few good items that you are really happy about, instead of this consumerism where you buy and throw away."\u000a\u000aDesigner Yves Behar added, "Our definition of luxury has completed shifted in recent years. Whereas luxury used to be about rarity and inaccessibility, luxury is now about ease -- something is luxurious if it makes our lives simpler and easier, in other words, if it enables us to navigate the world with ease."\u000a\u000aCraft and materiality -- storytelling -- still play an important role in modern luxury. Danish design practice Studio Copenhagen alluded to thoughtful design: "Post-bling luxury is about awareness and enlightenment. Luxury is not just about surface, it's about giving surface depth, care and meaningfulness, so that we can honestly relate and engage as human beings."\u000a\u000aFrom invisible technology to simple yet meticulously crafted furniture, explore eight highlights from Milan Design Week that reflect this new interpretation of luxury design.\u000a\u000a'Smart luggage' by Horizn Studios\u000a\u000aStudio Horizn blends travel, design and tech to create luggage that feels attentively designed but accessible to "the next generation of travelers."

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . He's jdsutter on Snapchat.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Update: This poll is now closed and the results are in: Readers selected food and meat's impact on climate change as the next topic for CNN's Two° series. Thanks to everyone who voted! Sign up for the Two° newsletter to get updates about that story and this series.\u000a\u000aPrevious story below:\u000a\u000aEvery story needs a villain -- and climate change is no exception.\u000a\u000aKnowing which countries and industries contribute to climate change, and in what proportions, is key to understanding how we can fix this problem and avoid 2 degrees Celsius of warming , which is what policymakers regard as the threshold for "dangerous" climate change.\u000a\u000aPlus, this story is complicated by the fact that nearly all of us -- certainly those reading this column on a mobile phone or computer -- contribute to climate change in some way.\u000a\u000aWe're all partly to blame.\u000a\u000aI'm going to be exploring this idea of "climate villains" for the next month or so, as part of CNN's Two° series , which looks at that threshold for dangerous warming. That's the point at which some island nations are expected to be submerged , drought risks go up considerably and water availability goes down.\u000a\u000aI'd like your help in deciding which bad guys to target.\u000a\u000aBelow, you'll find a Facebook poll that lists four of my favorite climate villains, all of which came from your suggestions. Pick the one you find most interesting and I'll go out into the world to report on the winner. The poll closes at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, August 16.\u000a\u000aMEET THE CLIMATE CHANGE VILLAINS -- the people and industries whose actions researchers say are causing global warming.... Posted by CNN on Thursday, August 13, 2015\u000a\u000aBefore you vote, though, you should know some of the basics. In talking to people about climate change this year, I've found there is SO MUCH confusion about what's causing warming and why.\u000a\u000aI've met people -- smart people, reasonable people -- who think that climate change is caused by aerosols from hairspray (it isn't) or that it's just part of a natural warming cycle (it's not). Burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat, as well as chopping down rainforests, contributes to climate change.\u000a\u000aHere's a breakdown of global greenhouse gas emissions by sector, according to 2012 data synthesized by the World Resources Institute. This is kind of a "blame" chart.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, I asked people on Facebook to identify their preferred climate villains . Among the most interesting (and sometimes humorous) responses you submitted: dinosaurs ("they turned into the oil that we want to get at, right?"); millennials ("It is always millennials' fault for everything ..."); parents ("the process of procreation ... results in increases in demand of the earth's resources and is the driving force for most of our planet's woes"). I was mentioned by name ("John Sutter. I bet he's double secret super villain. No doubt."), as was Willis Carrier , the guy who commercialized the modern air conditioner, and James Watt, who invented an efficient steam engine\u000a\u000aYou also identified more nebulous bad guys, like apathy, greed, ignorance and consumerism. Geography found its way into the mix, too. China, America and the "3rd world" all made your list.\u000a\u000aSome countries are more to blame than others, sure. But it turns out that the most industrialized countries -- the United States, European countries and, increasingly, China and India -- are among the biggest contributors to climate change, because they burn the most fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aHere's a list of the top 10 countries in terms of their overall contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions. This list is measured from 1850, the start of the Industrial Revolution, to 2012, and it's based on data synthesized by the World Resources Institute\u000a\u000aUnited States China Russia Germany United Kingdom Japan India France Canada Ukraine\u000a\u000aThose are the countries most responsible for the warming we're already seeing, as well as for much of the warming that we will seen in coming years. According to the World Bank, the atmosphere already has warmed 0.8 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times , and about 1.5 degrees of warming is already "locked in" to the atmospheric system because of how much carbon we've burned.\u000a\u000aRemember, 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is the danger mark.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change 01:16\u000a\u000aFor context, here's a list of the top climate polluters today. They create about 70% of all current greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, according to the World Resources Institute\u000a\u000aChina United States European Union India Russia Indonesia Brazil Japan Canada Mexico\u000a\u000aAll of this data is a rough guide to help you vote. Each of the four topics you suggested for this poll is a worthy candidate. Our diets, our reliance on fossil fuel reserves, our willingness to turn precious forests into farms and our addiction to gas-burning cars and other dirty modes of transit -- all of these contribute to climate change. And each is worth exploring in depth.\u000a\u000aI don't want to play the blame game forever. I agree with those of you who said we need to move past finger-pointing and toward solutions. I do think, however, that by exploring who and what's causing climate change, we'll have a better sense of how to solve this urgent problem.\u000a\u000aSo, please vote. Tell your friends. And thank you for helping decide where I'll focus my energy.

aVStory highlights Bannon: "They have an economic interest in unlimited immigration"\u000a\u000aBannon, a Catholic, downplayed the church's opinions on DACA\u000a\u000aWashington (CNN) Former White House chief strategist Steven Bannon said the Catholic Church's support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, is economically driven and owes to the church's struggle to fill pews.\u000a\u000a"To come to grips with the problems in the church, they need illegal aliens. They need illegal aliens to fill the churches. It's obvious on the face of it," Bannon said in a "60 Minutes" interview that was previewed on "CBS This Morning" Thursday. "They have an economic interest in unlimited immigration."\u000a\u000aBannon, a Catholic, downplayed the church's opinions on DACA, arguing that they carry little weight and saying the church was "just another guy with an opinion."\u000a\u000a"As much as I respect Cardinal (Timothy) Dolan and the bishops on doctrine, this is not doctrine. This is not doctrine at all. I totally respect the Pope and I totally respect the Catholic bishops and cardinals on doctrine. This is not about doctrine. This is about the sovereignty of a nation," Bannon said.\u000a\u000aDolan responded to Bannon's comments about the Catholic Church on SiriusXM later Thursday, calling them "preposterous" and "rather insulting."\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Reports of fatalities and widespread damage in northern Caribbean islands began to emerge Wednesday night after Hurricane Irma blasted through, packing devastating winds and rain.\u000a\u000a"Barbuda right now is literally a rubble," Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda told an interviewer with ABS TV/Radio Antigua.\u000a\u000a"The entire housing stock was damaged," Browne said after visiting the island of 1,800. "It is just a total devastation."\u000a\u000aIrma killed at least three people, destroyed government buildings, tore roofs from houses and left islands without power or communications. St. Martin/St. Maarten and St. Barts also felt the fury of the Category 5 storm, one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic, according to updates from the region.\u000a\u000aBrowne said there currently is no water or phone service for Barbuda residents. He said one fatality, an infant, had been confirmed.\u000a\u000aCommunication was disrupted after winds snapped a cell tower in two on the island.\u000a\u000aA harbor street in St. Martin left these vehicles flooded.\u000a\u000aIrma damaged Barbuda's lone airport, which will now force officials to ferry supplies by boat and helicopter from Antigua. Browne estimated rebuilding would cost about $100 million.\u000a\u000a"I have never seen any such destruction on a per capita basis compared to what I saw in Barbuda this afternoon," Browne told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\u000a\u000a'My family has nowhere to go'\u000a\u000aCharles Fernandez, minister of foreign affairs and international trade for Antigua and Barbuda, said that destruction on Barbuda was "upwards of 90%."\u000a\u000aOne woman told ABS TV/Radio her family of seven, including a 2-month-old infant, crammed into a closet before the hurricane force winds. The storm ripped the roof off, and they huddled together until rescuers reached them. Her home is destroyed, the woman said.\u000a\u000a"My main concern now is, how we're going to survive after this," the Barbuda resident said.\u000a\u000aOne man, whose home was also destroyed, echoed the woman's concerns.\u000a\u000a"My family has nowhere to go," he told ABS/TV Radio.\u000a\u000aAnother Barbuda resident it felt like "the whole house was ripping apart." The woman called 911 and authorities told the family to get in the closet or the bathroom.\u000a\u000a"I start praying and I ask God to just come and help me get out of this house because the house was like tearing apart," she told ABS TV/Radio Antigua. "It was like sucking us up, because we were holding on the bathroom door."\u000a\u000aHurricane Irma devasted the island of Barbuda\u000a\u000a'The palm trees are bent over'\u000a\u000aAt least two people died and two others were seriously injured on St. Barts and St. Martin, said French Overseas Affairs Minister Annick Girardin. The islands are French overseas collectivities.\u000a\u000aIrma destroyed government buildings, tore roofs from houses and left northern Caribbean islands without power or communications.\u000a\u000a"In terms of material damage, the four strongest buildings on the island of St. Martin have been destroyed," which meant that weaker structures likely had been damaged or destroyed, French Interior Minister Gérard Collomb told reporters.\u000a\u000aXaverius van der Hoek, who lives on St. Maarten, said his home -- which has a concrete roof and hurricane shutters -- was spared, but many other homes suffered damage.\u000a\u000aDamage from Hurricane Irma after it slammed Point Blanche, St. Maarten.\u000a\u000a"There is a sense of dread ... utility poles are down everywhere.

"From my balcony alone, I count at least 24 homes and apartment building with either partial or entire roofs missing."\u000a\u000aVan der Hoek said he get power from a generator. But he only has fuel to last about a week.\u000a\u000aThe firehouse in St. Barts was under a meter of water and is out of service, according to an update posted to Twitter by the government of the neighboring French territory, Guadeloupe.\u000a\u000a"Firefighters have taken shelter in an upstairs room. A number of houses have suffered damage, roofs have been ripped out.

aVDaniel Keating is a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and author of " Born Anxious: The Lifelong Impact of Early Life Adversity -- and How to Break the Cycle ," due to be published in April from St. Martin's Press. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) There are new clues that the high levels of stress many people endure every day are taking a deadly toll.\u000a\u000aWhite, working-class Americans are dying in middle age at a rapidly increasing pace, reversing a long-standing trend toward greater life expectancy across all races and social classes, according to a new report from economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton.\u000a\u000aMuch of this alarming trend comes from "deaths of despair," especially opioid addictions and overdoses, suicide, and alcohol-related diseases. To stem this epidemic, they argue that we need to understand the underlying reasons why this is happening. Case and Deaton make a plausible case that "slow moving and cumulative" social forces -- lack of labor market opportunities and fraying of the accustomed social fabric -- are key explanations. They reject arguments that attribute this trend to income alone or to a decline in virtue.\u000a\u000aBut an even more basic cause lies hidden at the intersection of psychology and biology -- a widespread stress epidemic that is affecting this group dramatically at the present but threatens all of us unless we soon understand the source of this trend and take steps to address it.\u000a\u000aStress-related disorders and diseases have been on the rise in the whole population for decades, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including those leading to these deaths of despair, but also to heart disease obesity , and diabetes\u000a\u000aNational surveys by the American Psychological Association that also capture how stressed, anxious and overwhelmed we feel show a similar increasing pattern. And it shows up in our bodies, even before we get sick or start down the many roads to self-harm.\u000a\u000aA recent study by the Hamilton Project looked at the "physiological stress load" in the US using biological markers tied to cardiovascular, kidney and liver function to create a stress load index. This physical stress load, a precursor to many diseases, has increased in striking fashion since the late 1970s, and it is getting worse as each new age group enters adulthood.\u000a\u000aWe should see this increase in mortality for what it is -- a leading indicator of what could be in store for many of us. What social forces are producing the broader stress epidemic, and how do they "get under the skin" to cause long-term damage? One major clue comes from a closer look at the stress load index.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED White working class says Christian values under attack Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White working class says Christian values under attack 03:42\u000a\u000aIt has increased for everyone, but with marked inequality -- it has risen more sharply for those with fewer social and economic resources but also more for the middle class compared to the well off. There is a clear line that connects increasing inequality in income and opportunities, to increases in stress and mortality that hits some groups earlier than others.\u000a\u000aA central biological pathway is from excess cortisol -- the fight-or-flight hormone -- that characterizes being over-stressed for long periods of time. This "stress dysregulation" leads to risky health decisions, like addiction or overeating, and directly to many health problems linked to excess cortisol.\u000a\u000aWhy are white, working-class Americans showing the earliest effects? Surely African-Americans and Hispanics have been experiencing inequality at equal or higher levels over these same decades. The key lies in different starting points in perceptions of control -- stress is largely a psychosocial phenomenon, though, of course, material deprivation also plays a role.\u000a\u000aMinorities have gained some ground materially, in relative terms, over recent decades, but they also did not start with an assumption of being in control in the wider society. Losing a sense of control that you believed you had, whether real or not, justified or not, creates stressful dislocations.\u000a\u000aWe have seen this pattern before. In the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the group that saw itself as having substantial control -- middle-aged Russian men in particular -- experienced a similar loss of control, economically and in terms of cultural identity as the "socialist vanguard." They also died younger, suffering dramatic increases in early mortality\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Type 2 diabetes hitting a younger generation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Type 2 diabetes hitting a younger generation 02:33\u000a\u000aIf we understand what is actually happening -- socially, psychologically and biologically -- we can see that this effect is not going to be limited to just one group in the future. My colleagues and I have reported a pattern of increasing inequality being tied to worsening population outcomes -- not for mortality, but for the health, achievement and social engagement of adolescents in rich Western countries. But what we also found was that this was not inevitable.\u000a\u000aCountries (Austria, Denmark, France, Sweden and others) that controlled income inequality and maintained investments in human development -- such as early childhood and parenting support, education, and social safety nets in health care and unemployment -- did not experience these increasing problems in adolescent and youth development.\u000a\u000aSlow-moving and cumulative social forces "get under the skin" early in life and can show up decades later in morbidity and mortality. The risk is magnified in light of very recent research showing that high levels of stress experienced by expectant mothers or by babies can make fundamental biological changes in infancy -- through what are known as epigenetic changes , which alter how genes work -- that can endure over a lifetime.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThis burden of stress dysregulation in young Americans from early life adversity amplifies the stress epidemic by making more of us vulnerable, and by increasing the total amount of ambient stress we all experience everyday in our schools, our workplaces, our social media, on our highways, in our malls -- in effect, throughout our communities.\u000a\u000aIncreasing inequality and decreasing investment in human development place all of us at risk -- a stressful recognition itself in the current political environment where there is the potential for going even further in the risky direction. Resisting these trends is essential to health, because the consequences will show up for all of us for decades to come.

aVDenver (CNN) When is a race more than a race? When it's an event.\u000a\u000aThat's not really a riddle as much as a puzzle Colorado race coordinators worked hard to solve after a professional bike race there was dissolved a couple of years ago.\u000a\u000aThe solution they devised is the Colorado Classic. Combined with a tandem spectator event called the Velorama, it's something like the Lollapalooza of bike racing. It may also be the most ambitious elite-level bike competition in the country after the Tour California. And year one is starting strong off the line.\u000a\u000aThe Colorado Classic is also the highest (in terms of overall elevation) bike race in North America. This year's event consisted of four days and some of the best racers in world lapping through the downtowns of three cities, up some of the state's prettiest and most demanding peaks, live-streamed by NBC, following a flotilla of pace and support vehicles, watched by hundreds of spectators and one helicopter.\u000a\u000aThe races culminated in a three-day festival in downtown Denver with food, drink, a marketplace and a concert by 20 bands including Wilco and Death Cab for Cutie.\u000a\u000aIt's a race series that seems organized more for spectators than for cyclists, which is sort of the point. The multiple laps ensure that no one misses the action, repeatedly. The Western backdrop gives the courses a cinematic quality. The bands, beer and bikes along the main streets, plus impromptu parties along the route, are all for fans of the sport and designed to make the race profitable and therefore sustainable.\u000a\u000aA new classic\u000a\u000aThe first Colorado Classic featured 16 men's teams and 15 women's for a total of 186 elite riders. The women completed 70 miles between two races in and around Colorado Springs and Breckenridge, with 8,000 feet of total elevation. The men had two additional stages, both in Denver, and over four days, they completed 313 miles with more than 21,000 feet of intense climbing.\u000a\u000aThe morning of the first stage, racers woke to the flash and boom of a thunderstorm. But by the time they kicked off in downtown Colorado Springs, the sky had turned into a blue canvas with puffy storybook clouds, broken only by a flash hailstorm in the middle of the men's race.\u000a\u000aThe Colorado Springs stage contained six laps of 93.5 total miles for the men and five laps of 38.36 miles for the women. The women's race, announced by Rio Olympic gold medalist Kristin Armstrong, kicked off dramatically with the James Bond theme blaring.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Colorado Classic bike race The Colorado Classic consisted of four days and some of the best racers in world lapping through the downtowns of three cities, starting with Colorado Springs.

It flowed up, down, left and right, past downtown shops and red moon rock formations jutting into the sky like the hands of an ancient giant. Clusters of crowds popped up along the route, many on bikes themselves, all in the shadow of fabled Pikes Peak.\u000a\u000aThe iconic sandstone formations, known as the Garden of the Gods, are located at the highest elevation of the race. It's popular with tourists and a hard-fought milestone for riders who repeatedly climbed nearly 600 feet to reach them. The Colorado Springs stage ended in cheers from the crowd downtown, followed by a traffic logjam as most of the racers and crews made their way to the next day's event, 100 miles away.\u000a\u000aStage 2 began and ended on main street Breckenridge, a pretty mining-cum-ski town 80 miles from Denver. It was mid-August, and there was still snow on the ridges of the nearby mountains. Grass freeways were visible between trees, carved out for ski runs in the winter.\u000a\u000aThe second-day race was made up of 10 laps over 64 miles for the men and five laps over 32 miles for the women. Each lap started downtown, whizzing past ski and bike rentals, après-ski bars, tourist shops, bakeries and a Smokey Bear sign (fire danger "low" on race day). Past Smokey, the field of racers began the steady climb along expensive houses and condos to the top of the mountain and then back down fun switchbacks through the natural beauty known as the Illinois Gulch.\u000a\u000aOther than the start/finish line, the most popular spot to watch the Breckenridge stage was along the steep climb known as Moonstone -- located 10,000 feet above sea level -- where bell-clanging spectators lined the road, some in costume. "The energy from the crowds was amazing," said Jillian Bearden, 36, who was taking part in her first pro race. She said Breckenridge tested her personally, but overall, the day was "epic."\u000a\u000aThe last two stages of the Classic over the next two days started in downtown Denver for the men's teams only. Stage 3 was a single out-and-back loop of 81 miles, with an elevation of 6,500 feet going through the beautiful Golden Gate Canyon park and taking a fun detour onto dirt roads in the foothills. Stage 4 was a thrillingly fast urban loop of 7.5 miles.\u000a\u000aMellow Velo\u000a\u000aAnd all that racing is just half the fun. The three-day Veloroma festival -- part concert, part craft fair -- took up more than six downtown Denver blocks over the weekend and attracted about 30,000 people who drank, ate and shopped among 200 vendors, as well as watching several more pro-am races. Velo is the French word for bike.\u000a\u000a"It was a broad, epic celebration of health, wellness and community," said Ken Gart, chairman of RPM Events, which organized the Colorado Classic. But there were some first-year problems: ATMs crashed, beer lines were long, food trucks ran out of meals before everyone enjoyed them, and some complained that the $25 to $50 entrance fee was too, shall we say, steep.\u000a\u000aThe Classic evolved from Colorado's USA Pro Challenge, which ran for five years. Despite the million spectators who came to cheer racers on, the annual event struggled to make a profit.\u000a\u000aColorado: First place for bikes\u000a\u000ato the effort and appointed Gart the state's "bike czar" to oversee the effort. Colorado is arguably the most bike-friendly state in the country . Topographically speaking, there is an extensive network of trails into mountains and along flat areas, cities are committed to bike lane expansions, and there are races all year long, both amateur and professional. Gov. John Hickenlooper even pledged $100 millionto the effortand appointed Gart the state's "bike czar" to oversee the effort.\u000a\u000aThe state's topography is well-suited for many types of recreation, from mountain climbing and biking to kayaking and fishing, but the hills and flats are ideal for bike race training and competitions. And the altitude helps any athlete increase their red blood count -- which in turn increases oxygen flow and improves performance -- a reason one of the three US Olympic Training Centers is located in Colorado Springs, next to the starting line of the Classic.\u000a\u000a"Colorado is unsurpassed in the US" in terms of outdoor recreation, Gart said. And what's special about supporting biking culture is that bike riding is "something anyone can do."\u000a\u000aReaching your own peak\u000a\u000aThe Classic invited the highest ranked racers they could get among teams licensed with the International Cycling Union. There were several national and world champions and one from the most recent winning Tour de France team. There were also sponsor teams. As if the scenery and prestige weren't enough of an incentive, prizes for racers totaled $84,400.\u000a\u000aIn order to qualify for race consideration, a cyclist must have accumulated enough points or have been a finalist in other races. For those not on the pro circuit but interested in participating, some of the Veloroma races are open to amateurs.\u000a\u000aOnce you've qualified for the Classic, your physical condition should be up to the challenge of multiple days of competition and hours of uninterrupted riding at speeds of up to 55 miles per hour, at high altitudes. But since it's possible to qualify without necessarily having done serious climbing, cyclists may still need to clock those climbing training runs.\u000a\u000aBearden trained for the Classic with "lots of climbing, every day, an average 10,000 feet a week." She also shed 13 pounds with a balanced diet in order to pull less weight uphill. And she raced elsewhere with her team so they were familiar with one another. Racers coming from lower sea levels need to build in days for acclimating to Colorado's elevation.\u000a\u000aBiking is, of course, excellent exercise, strengthening core and back in particular. Although biking has been common for more than 100 years, the sport continues to grow in popularity as a way to stay fit and lose weight (which helps in getting up those hills!). And cities around the world are getting progressively bike-friendly.\u000a\u000aMany runners turn to biking after an injury because it's easier on your knees while still engaging major leg muscles from your rear to your ankles: glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings and calves.\u000a\u000aAccording to fitness expert Dr. Tom Flaherty, who compared the two for CNN , running outdoors burned 970 calories an hour, while biking got only 570 calories. But biking uphill burns a lot more depending on steepness grade and headwind; it's two to four times the number of calories than on a flat surface.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAnd then there are the well-known mental benefits of exercise and exposure to nature. Before she started staying fit to compete, Bearden started riding to stay fit. She also loved to immerse herself in the outdoors. In general, she found biking to be an effective mental stress release, "a therapist, so to speak," she said. "It helped me move through challenges in life (and) eventually got me off antidepressants."\u000a\u000aCycling throughout Colorado, one could easily argue, is about as opposite from depressed as you can get without the use of pharmaceuticals.

"It was one of those things, 'Well, now what do I do?'... But it was the same girl, the same therapies."\u000a\u000aGetting on the court\u000a\u000aGrowing up in Orlando, Florida, Brittany looked up to her brother.\u000a\u000a"I always liked to do the same things my brother did," she said.\u000a\u000a"When A.J. started tennis, Brittany wanted to start tennis," her mom said. "But I said, 'You have to let me help you first. And then if we can get you hitting some balls across the net then I'll put you in lessons.'"\u000a\u000aBrittany was 18 when she first picked up a racquet. With patient coaching and a lot of repetition, she started improving. Her confidence grew both on and off the court.\u000a\u000aTagliareni was inspired by her brother A.J. to play tennis.\u000a\u000a"Before tennis, she would go to a home school class one day a week, and she would not talk to anyone," her mom said. "She really didn't have a social life at all. She didn't have any friends."\u000a\u000aShe would also go into what her mom called "autistic land."\u000a\u000a"It takes so much for her to go somewhere and carry on a conversation," her mom said. "It's much easier for her to go in her room and 'talk to the air,' listen to music or go on the computer and not have to deal with any of those issues."\u000a\u000aBut tennis gave her the motivation to improve her social skills.\u000a\u000a"Girls were coming up and saying, 'I want to be like you,'" her mom said. "And then she was like, 'Wow, this is really cool.'"\u000a\u000aWhen she plays in Special Olympics competitions, she gets paired up with men because she's usually in the top division.\u000a\u000a"She loves to beat the guys," her mom said.\u000a\u000aBrittany also competes in international tournaments through Athletes Without Limits. In 2014, she was the top-ranked woman in her division at the INAS (International Federation for Intellectual Disability Sport) World Tennis Championships in Mont-de-Marsan, France.\u000a\u000a"I am very happy about playing tennis because it's a lot of fun, and I like the fame and the fortune," Brittany said with a smile.\u000a\u000aVladimir Obradovic, her tennis coach, said she always brings a positive attitude to the court.\u000a\u000a"She's an inspiration for me every day ... she's very athletic."\u000a\u000aObradovic said he's seen a huge improvement in her skills.\u000a\u000a"The first lesson that we had, there were 60 balls in the basket, and all 60 balls went over the fence," he said. "Four years later, she's competing in money events here in Florida with people without any disabilities."\u000a\u000aThe sport has given her the chance to exceed expectations, her mom said.\u000a\u000a"When she was young, you always heard from professionals, 'She's not going to be able to do this. She's not going to be able to do that.' But they never said what she would be able to do," her mom added. "Being out there and being able to be more independent...that has changed her life forever."

aVA new study suggests that slowly but steadily shedding pounds each week can be more beneficial for long-term weight loss than seeing your weight drastically drop, only to rise again.\u000a\u000aDeveloping a stable schedule of healthy eating and exercise can help with keeping your weight management consistent, said Emily Feig, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital. The study was published Monday in the journal Obesity\u000a\u000a"We don't know yet what it is about weight variability that's problematic. It could be reflective of trouble following a diet and exercise plan consistently. But it's also possible that physiologically, some people tend to lose weight more consistently than others, regardless of how closely they are following a diet," said Feig, who conducted the study as a doctoral student at Drexel University.\u000a\u000a"My best recommendation for patients, based on this research, is to try to keep their eating pretty similar day to day," she said. "Things like planning ahead, prepping food for the week on Sunday and reducing frequency of eating at restaurants can help with this, since they reduce the chance of making impulsive decisions about what to eat. Building a habit of healthy, consistent eating can help patients reduce weight variability and lose weight more consistently, even if it's at a slow pace."\u000a\u000aThe study involved 183 overweight or obese adults, mostly white women, living near Philadelphia. For one year, they participated in a weight-loss program in which they were counseled on their diet and exercise.\u000a\u000aFrom the start of the program, their weight was tracked, measured and analyzed weekly. The adults also attended assessment meetings at six, 12 and 24 months.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that weight variability each week among the adults, measured at the first six and 12 weeks of the program, was positively associated with less subsequent weight loss at 12 and 24 months.\u000a\u000aIn other words, higher weight variability measured early in the program predicted which patients would continue to struggle with controlling their weight by the end of the program and one year later, according to the study findings.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Top plans for lasting weight-loss solutions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Top plans for lasting weight-loss solutions 01:41\u000a\u000a"This study goes even further in supporting the importance of early weight changes by showing that weekly variability in weight, above and beyond how much weight is lost, predicts weight loss maintenance up to two years later," she said. "So it seems that both success and consistency in weight loss at the beginning of a program is important for long-term success."\u000a\u000aDr. Zhaoping Li, director at the University of California, Los Angeles' Center for Human Nutrition, who was not involved in the new study, said the findings are consistent with what has been seen in scientific literature.\u000a\u000a"Whatever we do for those people to lose weight, if they can do it consistently, that means that particular plan not only physiologically fits the patient (and) that particular individual's body but also is feasible (and) practical for ... a day-to-day life," Li said.\u000a\u000a"So, if we now know someone is struggling from the beginning, we need to adjust," she said. "That can be diet; that can be a lifestyle change. Because we know that if we don't do an adjustment, they're going to fail. That's what this study is really showing."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED How to stop mindless eating Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How to stop mindless eating 01:23\u000a\u000aDr. John Morton, chief of bariatric and minimally invasive surgery at Stanford Health Care, said there were two findings of interest in the new study.\u000a\u000a"They found predictive value as early as six weeks. In the shorthand, it says past performance predicts future performance, but it's kind of interesting that they're able to see it that early," said Morton, who was not involved in the new research.\u000a\u000a"The other thing I see here is that weight loss doesn't occur in a straight line. You lose weight for a while, then it plateaus, and then you lose weight again," he said. "If you're responding to diet, that's generally how it works."\u000a\u000aAs for why some people consistently lose weight while others see fluctuations, "I think that that question is still out there" to be answered, Morton said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Simple weight loss is a good way to prevent diabetes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Simple weight loss is a good way to prevent diabetes 02:16\u000a\u000aStill, the new study came with some limitations. For instance, 81% of the participating adults were women, so more research is needed to determine whether similar results would be found in a nationally representative sample of adults.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, "the study was correlational, so we cannot conclude that weight variability causes changes in long-term weight control," Feig said.\u000a\u000aAnother ongoing area of research explores not only how weight variability might be linked to extra weight gain but how it's associated with overall health and potential problems, said Michael Lowe, a professor of psychology at Drexel University and co-author of the new study. Feig was his graduate student while conducting the new study.\u000a\u000aA separate study that was presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions last year suggests that intentional weight variability, known as "yo-yo dieting," may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and coronary heart disease mortality in post-menopausal women.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Those individuals who have a health problem, very often this is a cardiovascular kind of health problem, who also show more variation in their weight overtime, tend to have their health problems worsened," Lowe said.

aVUPPER DARBY, Pa. (CBS)\u2014Police in Upper Darby are searching for the people responsible after two dogs were apparently found abandoned in the park.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I picked her up she was as cold as an ice cube. She was on the brink of death right here, said Russell Harper, the chief humane officer with Justice Rescue. \u201cI\u2019ve investigated thousands of cruelty cases and I thought she was dead. Gracie, the one, I thought she was dead\u201d\u000a\u000aNow named Gracie and Layla, the two are in extremely critical condition at a nearby animal hospital. It is suspected they were used and abused for the sake of dog fighting.\u000a\u000aThe dogs were found in the Penn Pines Park in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to come up with a name for someone who would do something like this. I called them dirt balls I mean they really are dirt balls,\u201d said Superintendent Michael Chitwood, with the Upper Darby Police Department.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese animals were starved, they got very bad scars from physical abuse, not just the fighting, they were beat. So this is the life they have had for them,\u201d said Harper.\u000a\u000aBut in that violent horror, their love for each other was not broken.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven though they were used as fighting dogs, Layla would not leave Gracie and she was trying to nuzzle her to get up.\u000a\u000aLayla has been allowed to stay with Gracie\u2013the worse off of the two\u2013as both do what they have long been forced to: fight for their lives.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you can treat an animal that way, you can treat a human that way,\u201d Harber said.\u000a\u000aAnyone who can recognize these dogs, or has any information, is asked to call police at 610-734-7693 .

aVThe crisp fall air may put you in mind of getting back to the budget after a summer slide. No better time to hit the books.\u000a\u000aThere is no end to niche money books out there specializing in everything from student debt to retirement saving to investing.\u000a\u000aBut for those who are hankering for a big picture view on your money, here are our picks for personal finance life changers:\u000a\u000a"The Total Money Makeover" by Dave Ramsey\u000a\u000aOnce you start talking to people who have "gotten on track" with their money, it's amazing to hear how often people talk about the impact "The Total Money Makeover" had on their lives.\u000a\u000aThis action-oriented bootcamp for your financial life isn't so much aimed at your money as it is at your behaviors involving money. Ramsey, a folksy radio host who, after going broke in his late 20's, built an industry around his books and advice, admits in the book's preface there's nothing new here. It's just that he's offering financial principals from a behavioral approach.\u000a\u000aHe's confident, he writes, that you understand the numbers. The hard part is getting you to do something about them. Actions that encourage momentum and confidence (like his controversial "debt snowball" advice to pay off the debt with the smallest balance first, as opposed to the one with the highest interest rate) have made this a down-to-earth, nonjudgmental plan that has worked for millions of people.\u000a\u000aWho will love it: People who don't know where to start with their money, are in debt or are without established financial habits.\u000a\u000aWho will find it annoying: Anyone looking for investing tips and people allergic to down-home sayings like, "Even a turkey can fly in a tornado," and biblically and spiritually-based advice.\u000a\u000a"I Will Teach You To Be Rich" by Ramit Sethi\u000a\u000aLike Dave Ramsey, Ramit Sethi also takes a behavioral approach to getting you off your duff and taking financial action in your own life. But while Ramsey is "common sense dad," Sethi is more "outraged roommate." Like when he says, "Listen up, crybabies: This isn't your grandma's house and I'm not going to bake you cookies and coddle you. A lot of your financial problems are caused by one person: you."\u000a\u000aHe thinks you're missing the point with your hyper-focus on stock picks and market risks, when meanwhile you're still throwing your money at fees on your bank account. He suggests a budget broken down into four parts: fixed costs, savings, investments, and guilt-free spending money. He also recommends automating as much of your financial life as possible so you don't have to decide every two weeks how much to put in your savings account.\u000a\u000aThe book lays out actionable steps organized in a six week program that includes setting up your credit cards to your advantage, working to find no-fee bank accounts, opening 401(k) and investment accounts, organizing your spending and automating as much as possible.\u000a\u000aWho will love it: People who, like Sethi, like to get right to the point and don't suffer fools.\u000a\u000aWho will find it annoying: People who find a bro-y tone tiresome.\u000a\u000a"The Richest Man in Babylon" by George S. Clason\u000a\u000aHumanities majors, rejoice! There is a personal finance book for you: "The Richest Man in Babylon," written in 1926 by a Midwestern publisher, is a series of narrative parables on money basics that still ring true today.\u000a\u000aThe book is written as stories that the "richest man in Babylon" tells to two hard-working men who don't have any money. The timeless principles include the advice to pay yourself first (set aside your own cut from your paycheck, and then dole out the rest for your bills and expenses).\u000a\u000aThe book also reveals, through stories, how to make your money work for you, how to find good financial advice, and that you should continually live below your means. Nothing new or groundbreaking here, but the stories may help you to remember the advice.\u000a\u000aWho will love it: People who want a little story and character with their substance.\u000a\u000aWho will find it annoying: People with no patience for the pageantry of prose and just want the facts.\u000a\u000a"Get A Financial Life" by Beth Kobliner\u000a\u000aWritten for those in their 20's, "Get A Financial Life," is a compendium of just-starting-out personal finance advice.\u000a\u000aKobliner looks at everything from paying off student loans to buying a home to preparing for retirement. And there are all the questions that crop up in between like: How can you fix your credit score? When should you rent or buy? Should you invest in the stock market and, if so, how? What is a safe place to put my money and get a good return?\u000a\u000aThe first chapter is actually crib-notes of the whole book for those who need help fast. These tasks in adulting are organized in rough order of importance (No. 1: You need to have health insurance!) and points you to guidelines and resources for how to get it done.\u000a\u000aWho will love it: People with unending questions about money and what to do with it.\u000a\u000aWho will find it annoying: People who've already got the basics down.\u000a\u000a"The Automatic Millionaire" by David Bach\u000a\u000aThis book, originally published in 2003, has been updated in 2016 to account for changes in the economy and also the increasing number of ways that automating your finances can help you.\u000a\u000aIn "The Automatic Millionaire," Bach describes how to slowly and steadily, over the course of a working life, become a millionaire. A lot of this is by using automation to eliminate the weekly and monthly decisions about how to spend and save your money.\u000a\u000aBy telling people's stories, including that of a public utility manager and hair stylist couple who were able to retire early with assets of nearly $2 million, Bach demonstrates how paying yourself first can pay off -- significantly! -- over time.\u000a\u000aWho will love it: People on the quest for financial freedom.\u000a\u000aWho will find it annoying: People looking for a fast track to getting rich.

aV(CNN) Claire Frank has not heard from her two daughters since late Tuesday night, an hour before electrical power was cut in the tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda, some 1,200 miles southeast of Miami.\u000a\u000aWith Hurricane Irma approaching at the time, Afiya Frank, 27, who is pregnant, and sister Asha, 29, had packed plenty of food and water and boarded up the large brick house their family had nearly completed on the 62-square-mile island.\u000a\u000a"Everybody knew it was a superstorm," Claire Frank said on the phone from the United Kingdom.\u000a\u000a"When it's your children, you don't want to frighten them to death but you want them to know that they have to know what to do."\u000a\u000aFrank may have gotten news about one of her daughters late Thursday but she's still uncertain. It came in a Facebook post in which a stranger on the island wrote, "I saw the Asha Frank girl ... She all good. Running things."\u000a\u000a"I'm not going to say I know my daughters are safe until I've heard about it from the people organizing the evacuation," said Frank, referring to the voluntary evacuation of the island on Thursday as another hurricane approached.\u000a\u000aAbout 95% of the buildings in Barbuda, one of two major islands in the nation of Antigua and Barbuda, are damaged, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said.\u000a\u000aAsha Frank is 29 and has been through Hurricane Luis in 1995.\u000a\u000aWhile still assessing the extent of Irma's destruction, the northeastern Caribbean islands anxiously watched Hurricane Jose to the east. Antigua and Barbuda issued a hurricane watch for Jose, which could pass close on Saturday.\u000a\u000aIrma left at least six people dead, including four on St. Martin, one on Anguilla, and one on Barbuda, officials said.\u000a\u000aJose became the third major hurricane in the Atlantic basin on Thursday, with winds of 120 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The Category 3 storm was about 625 miles east-southeast of Antigua.\u000a\u000aIrma has left Barbuda -- a quiet, underdeveloped oasis with some high-end tourism -- barely habitable.\u000a\u000a"It's like a deserted island," said Michael Joseph, president of Red Cross in Antigua and Barbuda.\u000a\u000aTourism dominates Antigua and Barbuda's economy, accounting for nearly 60% of GDP and 40% of investment, according to the CIA World Factbook.\u000a\u000aAmy Potter, a geography professor at the Armstrong State University in Georgia, said the economy of Barbuda -- one of the lowest lying islands in the Caribbean -- relied heavily on sand mining operations for more than 30 years despite warnings about the island's vulnerability to major storms.\u000a\u000aAfiya Frank, 27, is pregnant. Her mother spoke to both daughters before Hurricane Irma hit.\u000a\u000a"Any time you have dunes, that's a very important protection," said Potter, a Savannah resident who was preparing to evacuate as Irma neared the US coast. "Dunes and mangroves provide really important buffers for low-lying islands during hurricanes."\u000a\u000aAndrew Sluyter, a professor at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said fraught relations between Antigua and the smaller island of Barbuda could worsen after the disaster.\u000a\u000a"I can tell you that the minute I heard that Barbuda had 95% of its houses destroyed and Antigua very little damage, I started thinking about how that would impact their relationship," he said via email.\u000a\u000a"Any help Antigua provides to rebuild Barbuda will no doubt come at a steep price in terms of allowing tourist development."\u000a\u000aFrank said her daughters had already lived through the deadly and destructive Hurricane Luis in 1995, which packed sustained winds of 140 mph.\u000a\u000aBut Irma, a Category 5 storm, churned in the Atlantic with 175 mph sustained winds.\u000a\u000a"It's not in their kind of recent memory but they do know what you would need to do," Frank said, recalling Tuesday's chat with her daughters via a messaging app.\u000a\u000a"They said in an hour or so they'll turn off the electricity. We just said, 'Bye. We'll speak to you soon.' I haven't heard from them since."\u000a\u000aFrank was upset that Browne has been widely available to the international media in the storm's aftermath but that she has not been able to get information from the local government.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately the Prime Minister has made himself the spokesman of this event and hasn't given any information to people about who they could speak to" for information about survivors, she said.\u000a\u000aBrowne could not be reached for comment.\u000a\u000aFrank, a UK native, has lived in Barbuda about 30 years. She runs ArtCafe, a cafe and art gallery where she sells silk paintings and handpainted T-shirts. She said she has about four customers a month. She met her husband, a Barbudan, in the United Kingdom.\u000a\u000aFrank's daughters grew up on the island but studied in the United Kingdom because Barbuda did not have a secondary school when they were ready for high school, she said.\u000a\u000a"Barbuda is a bit of a brain drain," Frank said.\u000a\u000a"People leave and they don't come back because there is nothing for them to come back to. We've always believed that young age group of people will make a difference. They will have skills. They will develop businesses and then Barbuda will stop being this kind of backwater to Antigua."

aVThe nucleus of Paris Design Week is the gigantic five-day Maison & Object trade fair, where more than 3,000 exhibitors come together to showcase the latest in the way of design.A cozy must-see at the fair is Comfort Zone , designed by François Bernard, founder of forecasting agency Croisements. "No longer just about technology, comfort is now about psychological as well as physical well-being," he explains. "Today, we want comfort everywhere -- at home, but also the office, waiting rooms, airports etc." The space explores comfort through 12 themes, illustrated through pieces found at the fair like temperature-regulating pillows, connected cocoons and pods that seal us away from technology. We see that comfort also has its own aesthetic that transcends time and trends.

aVThe skies have finally cleared from Harvey, but Hurricane Irma is wreaking havoc in the Caribbean and quickly heading toward Florida. Meanwhile, two other hurricanes are brewing in the Atlantic basin.\u000a\u000aYou may not be in the path of a storm now, but extreme weather events are becoming more common -- and you could one day end up facing down a powerful storm.\u000a\u000aOnce you've taken steps to ensure your family and home will stay as safe as possible, here's what you can do to protect your finances.\u000a\u000aSecure access to important documents\u000a\u000aIf you've worked with a financial planner, you likely have access to an electronic vault. Michael Resnick, a certified financial planner with GCG Financial in Illinois, recommends uploading copies of your financial statements, insurance documents, tax returns and other important documents in addition to passports and driver's license, to that vault.\u000a\u000aIf you don't have access to a secure online storage space through a financial service, you can still put copies of your files online.\u000a\u000aRelated: What Harvey victims can do right now to protect their finances\u000a\u000aCertified financial planner and owner of Compass Wealth Management Leslie Beck recommended scanning or taking photos of important documents and uploading them to the cloud. "Making a copy on a password-protected jump drive that you take with you is also a good idea," she added.\u000a\u000aYou can also store physical copies of your documents in a safe deposit box at your bank.\u000a\u000aTake photos of your home\u000a\u000aShoot video and take photos of the interior and exterior of your home and upload those to the cloud as well. Pre-storm photos will be useful in filing an insurance claim if your property is damaged.\u000a\u000aInterior photos can also be used to make an inventory of your belongings. Mychal Eagleson, a certified financial planner and president and founder of An Exceptional Life Financial, said an inventory "should include the date of purchase, original cost, serial number, a picture, and original receipt," for each item. You can refer to this list when filing an insurance claim.\u000a\u000aReview your insurance policy\u000a\u000aThough it may be too late to change the terms of your insurance policy, it's a good idea to review your coverage and know what you're owed. Make sure you have your insurer's contact information and the details of your particular plan.\u000a\u000aByrke Sestok, a certified financial planner and co-founder of Rightirement Wealth Partners in New York, recommended asking your insurer to clarify responsibilities -- like boarding up your home and securing loose items -- ahead of the storm.\u000a\u000aRelated: Tips for filing insurance claims after Harvey\u000a\u000aEven if you don't expect to be impacted by a storm imminently, it's a good idea to review your insurance policy and see if you'd like to increase coverage. "A good insurance agent should take the time to go through your policies with you and explain the level of coverage in each area and why it's important to be at that level," said Eagleson. Keep in mind that homeowners insurance typically does not include flood insurance.\u000a\u000aSet your bills to autopay\u000a\u000aSetting up automatic bill payments before the storm hits means you won't have to worry about missing payments if you're unable to get home or access your bank.\u000a\u000a"You do not want late payment fees or service termination if you have no way to get to the post office to mail checks," said Sestok, "or if power is out and you cannot pay online."\u000a\u000aMissed or late payments to creditors could lead to fees or affect your credit score down the line.\u000a\u000aSet up an emergency fund\u000a\u000aFinancial experts recommend keeping enough money to cover three to six months' worth of expenses in your savings account. While that's something everyone should aim for, having the money in place and easily accessible could be a lifeline in an emergency situation.\u000a\u000aIf you expect to evacuate because of a storm you should also hold on to some cash in case banks go offline, ATMs run out of money or electronic payment systems fail. Eagleson recommended keeping about $500 with you -- enough to cover basic needs, but not enough to deal a financial blow if it's lost or stolen.

aVStory highlights Frida Ghitis: Outrage over Cecil trophy kill went viral, spawned outrage backlash from those who say moral compass is skewed\u000a\u000aWhat about human suffering in Zimbabwe, Syria, among refugees?\u000a\u000aFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for the Miami Herald and World Politics Review and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Of all the stories you heard in the news in the past few days, which one moved you the most? Which outraged you, brought you to tears, led you to action? Which did you talk about with your friends, post on Facebook, discuss on Twitter? If the answer is the killing of Cecil the lion, you are in lots of company.\u000a\u000aFrida Ghitis\u000a\u000aBy now, it seems, most people agree that the killing, apparently for fun, of the majestic lion by a Minnesota dentist visiting Zimbabwe was a perplexing act of pointless cruelty and cowardice. It spawned millions of posts on Facebook and Twitter -- a kind of outrage tsunami.\u000a\u000aCecil, who was apparently well-known and loved in the natural park where he lived in Zimbabwe, died in a most unnatural way, lured from his home and slaughtered. (The dentist, now perhaps fearing for his life, has apparently gone into hiding.)\u000a\u000aThe intensity of the backlash over the trophy killing has triggered a counter-backlash. Why, some are now asking, do people care so much about the death of a lion when so many human beings are suffering and dying? The surge of sorrow for a dead lion, they say, when compared to the relative quiet about other wrongs, reveals a moral flaw in our humanity, a defect in our moral compass.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor decades, the majestic wildlife found across Africa has been a major draw for tourists wanting to catch a glimpse of roaring lions, towering elephants and rare rhinos.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut wildlife tourism should always be a case of look, but don't touch.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor several African countries, wildlife is more than a tourism treasure.

A recent The brutal killing of Cecil , Zimbabwe's famous black mane lion, has caused outrage around the world, highlighting once more the persistent threats faced by endangered animals.For decades, the majestic wildlife found across Africa has been a major draw for tourists wanting to catch a glimpse of roaring lions, towering elephants and rare rhinos.But wildlife tourism should always be a case of look, but don't touch.For several African countries, wildlife is more than a tourism treasure. It's also a key source of revenue. A recent study by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNTWO) compiled figures from government and tour operators throughout the continent to assess the state of the wildlife tourism industry. It found that the industry contributes 80% of international travel sales to the continent, a large percentage of the $34.2 billion African tourism industry.

Permits to visit a gorilla family cost between $500-700, meaning the forest, home to roughly half the world's wild mountain gorillas, generates approximately $15 million annually. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours The Serengeti-Ngorongoro southern circuit, a key migration route, is another tourist hotspot.

Hide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours Of the countries who submitted data, 14 generated a total of approximately $142 million in entrance fees to protected parks, bolstering the coffers of various conservation initiatives.

Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours UNTWO worked out that across the continent, the average wildlife tour lasts 10 days, has six participants and costs $433 per day.

When CNN asked me if I would like to meet Tiger and interview him, I jumped at the opportunity. I believed he would likely become the best golfer to ever play the game.\u000a\u000a"People were very excited to meet him. There was a buzz on the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey where this all took place. People knew he was a young man who was likely to make history.\u000a\u000a"Woods was polite, thoughtful, and considerate. I remember thinking to myself that I hoped he would always stay that way because I was so certain he would be immensely successful and so many people who become rich and famous don't keep the values they had when it all began.\u000a\u000a"Tiger clearly knew what he was capable of at a young age. And I also had little doubt about his capabilities. It is amazing now to look back and know that what he, I, and so many others thought would happen did indeed happen.\u000a\u000aGary Tuchman joined CNN back in 1990.\u000a\u000a"The difference of course is that he was relatively innocent and naive back then. Now, he has the physical and emotional scars that one often gets as the years go by.\u000a\u000a"With the benefit of hindsight, I would ask him if he was concerned about the pressures of being on the PGA Tour and his personal life off the tour. I would ask him if he felt he had the support to deal with all of that.\u000a\u000a"And then I wish I said to him that I hope he has a happy and healthy career. I try to be polite when I interview people and I don't think I got the chance to say that to him as he began his path to fame and fortune."\u000a\u000a2008, Dubai - Don Riddell\u000a\u000aFast forward 11 years and Woods was living up to the hype. Aged 32, he was ranked as the world's No. 1 golfer having won a further 12 majors -- including four in a row between June 2000 and April 2001. But away from the course, it had been a turbulent couple of years.

A minor car crash in November 2009 began a chain of events which led to the revealing of multiple infidelities and, ultimately, the break-up of Woods' marriage to Elin Nordegren. His golf game had suffered too. He won the U.S. Open in 2008 but a severe loss of form and fitness meant he'd failed to win a major in over three years by the time he sat down with CNN Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue in November 2012.

Rory had yet to be announced as a Nike player, but the rumors had begun of a multimillion dollar deal. I remember noting that he wore Nike trainers to the interview.\u000a\u000a"That was revealing, but we couldn't really speak about it, as he was still under contract to his other clothing sponsors. Rory and Tiger had both decided not to compete in the WGC event later that week in Shanghai, which caused a bit of a fuss.\u000a\u000a"They were here in Zhengzhou for a big money match and we were the only television interview that they were doing, so it was a real exclusive.

It wasn't bad or anything, just a very noticeable change in his demeanor as soon as we started. He doesn't really like interviews.\u000a\u000a"He was lighthearted again once we finished and wished me a safe trip home. I hope to interview Tiger many more times in the future!\u000a\u000a"I expect him to return to top class golf, and to win again.

aV(CNN) One of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather's shoulders, waving a flag as our astronauts returned to Hawaii. This was years before we'd set foot on the moon. Decades before we'd land a rover on Mars. A generation before photos from the International Space Station would show up in our social media feeds.\u000a\u000aI still have the same sense of wonder about our space program that I did as a child. It represents an essential part of our character -- curiosity and exploration, innovation and ingenuity, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and doing it before anybody else. The space race we won not only contributed immeasurably important technological and medical advances, but it also inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers with the right stuff to keep America on the cutting edge.\u000a\u000aThat's one of the reasons why, in my first address as President to the American people, I vowed to return science to its rightful place. In our first few months, my administration made the largest single investment in basic research in our history, and I went to the Kennedy Space Center to call for reimagining and reinvigorating our space program to explore more of our solar system and look deeper into the universe than ever.\u000a\u000aIn the years since, we've revitalized technology innovation at NASA, extended the life of the International Space Station, and helped American companies create private-sector jobs by capitalizing on the untapped potential of the space industry.\u000a\u000aLast year alone, NASA discovered flowing water on Mars and evidence of ice on one of Jupiter's moons, and we mapped Pluto -- more than 3 billion miles away -- in high-resolution. Our space telescopes revealed additional Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, and we're pursuing new missions to interact with asteroids, which will help us learn how to protect the Earth from the threat of colliding with one while also teaching us about the origins of life on Earth. We've flown by every planet in the solar system -- something no other nation can say. And we continue to drive down the cost of space exploration for taxpayers.\u000a\u000aThis week, we'll convene some of America's leading scientists, engineers, innovators and students in Pittsburgh to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers. Just five years ago, US companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it. More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aWe have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we're already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station.\u000a\u000aThe next step is to reach beyond the bounds of Earth's orbit. I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth -- something we'll need for the long journey to Mars.\u000a\u000aThe reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times, John Noble Wilford, later wrote that Mars tugs at our imagination "with a force mightier than gravity." Getting there will take a giant leap. But the first, small steps happen when our students -- the Mars generation -- walk into their classrooms each day. Scientific discovery doesn't happen with the flip of a switch; it takes years of testing, patience and a national commitment to education.\u000a\u000aPresident Eisenhower knew this: In 1958, he devoted great resources to science and math education around the same time he created NASA. And it's why I'm proud that we've passed important milestones in STEM education. For the first time, more than 100,000 engineers are graduating from American schools every year, and we're on track to accomplish my goal of training 100,000 excellent new STEM teachers in a decade.\u000a\u000aWhen our Apollo astronauts looked back from space, they realized that while their mission was to explore the moon, they had "in fact discovered the Earth." If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last, we won't just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we'll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves.\u000a\u000aSomeday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We'll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we'll know that because of the choices we make now, they've gone to space not just to visit, but to stay -- and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.

aVEven at a time when massive data breaches feel like the new normal, the Equifax breach is nothing short of shocking.\u000a\u000aEquifax (EFX) revealed Thursday that the personal information of as many as 143 million Americans -- or nearly half the country -- has been compromised.\u000a\u000aThe number of people impacted may pale in comparison to Yahoo's two security breaches last year, which exposed data from more than one billion user accounts. But the Yahoo breach only involved data like like email addresses and passwords.\u000a\u000aThe Equifax breach exposes some of our most sensitive personal information: names, social security numbers, addresses, birth dates and the some driver's license numbers.\u000a\u000aFor consumers, the situation is maddening in large part because we are nearly powerless to avoid it.\u000a\u000aUnlike Yahoo, Equifax is not a service you intentionally sign up for and then explicitly provide with your data. Equifax, a credit reporting firm, gets its data from credit card companies, banks, retailers, and lenders who report on the credit activity of individuals to credit reporting agencies, as well as by purchasing public records.\u000a\u000aRelated: The biggest data breaches ever\u000a\u000aEquifax is one of three major credit bureaus in the U.S., along with TransUnion (TRU)and Experian (EXPGF). If you live in the U.S. and have a financial pulse, chances are they are tracking and rating your financial history.\u000a\u000a"Our information security and technology teams are actively evaluating this incident to determine what, if any, actions from TransUnion might be appropriate," a spokesperson for TransUnion said in a statement.\u000a\u000aReps for Experian did not immediately respond to requests for comment on their security measures.\u000a\u000a"The credit bureaus -- which make piles of money by compiling incredibly detailed dossiers on consumers and selling that information to marketers -- have for the most part shown themselves to be terrible stewards of very sensitive data," Brian Krebs, a prominent cybersecurity blogger, wrote Thursday.\u000a\u000aKrebs says these firms are "long overdue" for greater regulatory oversight. Some legislators are proposing to do just that.\u000a\u000aSen. Mark Warner, a member of the Senate Banking Committee and cofounder of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, said Congress needs to implement a "uniform data breach notification standard."\u000a\u000aCongress also "needs to rethink data protection policies, so that enterprises such as Equifax have fewer incentives to collect large, centralized sets of highly sensitive data," Warner said in a statement Thursday.\u000a\u000aRep. Maxine Waters pledged to reintroduce legislation that would shift the balance of power in the credit reporting process more to consumers. Her earlier proposal called for "fixing the dispute process" so credit bureaus rather than consumers "bear the burden to prove the accuracy" of information.\u000a\u000aRelated: How to find out if you're affected by the Equifax hack\u000a\u000aFor now, though, consumers must rely on a different remedy offered by Equifax, with some strings attached.\u000a\u000aEquifax is offering free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring services, but it's a service that's actually also owned and operated by Equifax. To get it, you must first provide the last six digits of your social security number to Equifax, which just revealed having social security numbers stolen. And you had to sign away your right to sue Equifax.\u000a\u000aIf that's not enough, those who decided to sign up anyway were told the credit monitoring service would not be available until next week. This only adds to the feeling of helplessness. Equifax says the breach occurred months ago, in mid-May and July.\u000a\u000aReps for Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\u000a\u000aThe frustrations of consumers were laid bare on Friday morning when an official Equifax customer service account posted a what some called a "chipper" message on Twitter: "Happy Friday! You've got Stevie ready and willing to help with your customer service needs today!"\u000a\u000a"Why did you wait 2 months to notify us?" one person wrote in response. Another said: "Stevie, can you help repair my life your company just ruined?"\u000a\u000a"So why does your victim list require us to put in our SSN?" a third person wrote. "Why would we trust you with that ever again?"\u000a\u000aThe Equifax customer service tweet was quickly deleted.

aVBut he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.\u000a\u000aTen Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there.\u000a\u000aHis hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound.\u000a\u000a"I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aWith no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available.\u000a\u000aPhotographer Pieter ten Hoopen\u000a\u000aThe studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken.\u000a\u000aOne by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered.\u000a\u000a"This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aThe project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees.\u000a\u000aThe photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos.\u000a\u000aWhether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aThe word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely.\u000a\u000a"They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible," he said. "I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective."\u000a\u000aThe studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well.\u000a\u000a"I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way," ten Hoopen said.\u000a\u000aHe said some patients at the hospital "had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio."\u000a\u000aI build classic photo studios ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way. Pieter ten Hoopen\u000a\u000aTen-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength.\u000a\u000aHawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera.\u000a\u000aTen Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography.\u000a\u000a"I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment," he said. "It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you."\u000a\u000aHow did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear?\u000a\u000a"It wasn't hard," he said. "I just told them to relax and have fun.\u000a\u000a"Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature."

aV(CNN) When he started fiddling with chemicals in his home in March 1856, William Henry Perkin had no idea what was about to happen.\u000a\u000aHe was an 18-year-old student at London's Royal College of Chemistry, eager to impress his teacher. His homework assignment was to run experiments at home during the Easter break.\u000a\u000aPerkin was tasked with finding a cheap way to produce quinine, a substance used to treat malaria, which had to be extracted from the bark of exotic trees and was thus expensive.\u000a\u000aThe young man thought he could make it himself in his simple home lab in London. So he started mixing ingredients.\u000a\u000aA black goo\u000a\u000aTo make artificial quinine, Perkin turned to coal tar, the discarded sludge from Victorian gas lighting. It was believed that the two substances shared a similar chemical structure.\u000a\u000aBut once he finished his concoction, instead of the normally colorless quinine, all that was left in his test tube was a thick black goo.\u000a\u000aWilliam Perkin's original stoppered bottle of mauveine dye.\u000a\u000aWhen he tried to wash it off, it left behind a vivid purple color. Remarkably, he found that the color transferred to a cloth with untarnished brilliance.\u000a\u000aWilliam Henry Perkin had failed to synthesize quinine, but had accidentally invented the first synthetic dye, in one of the most astonishing examples of serendipity in science.\u000a\u000aRight color, right time\u000a\u000aPurple just happened to be the most coveted color of the time. "Various shades of purple, pink, lilac, mauve, and rose were at the height of fashion in the spring of 1856," Regina Lee Blaszczyk, professor of business history at the University of Leeds and author of "The Color Revolution," said in an email.\u000a\u000aPerkin realized that he was onto something. Until then, there were only natural dyes derived from plants and animals.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED When life on Earth began, it was purple Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH When life on Earth began, it was purple 01:30\u000a\u000aThe choice was limited, the colors were dull and the prices were high. In some instances, the extraction process was painstaking and laborious, particularly for purple. "It had to be extracted from a type of shellfish that grew in select places in the Mediterranean," Lee Blaszczyk said. "The process was costly, messy, and a general pain."\u000a\u000aFinally, as the world entered the post-Industrial Revolution phase, the manufacturing processes required to exploit the discovery were all in place and ready to go.\u000a\u000aThis perfect storm was not lost on observers, as Simon Garfield notes in his book "Mauve." "At one of the many jubilee celebrations of Perkin's discovery," he wrote, "the chemist CJT Cronshaw told a gathering of the Society of Chemical Industry: 'If a fairy godmother had given Perkin the chance of choosing the precise moment for his discovery, he could not have selected a more appropriate or more auspicious time.'"\u000a\u000aA fashion revolution\u000a\u000aPerkin initially baptized his new color Tyrian purple, as it was known in the ancient world, but then settled for the more fashionable French word mauve. "The color mauve was all the rage in the mid 1850s, as ladies of fashion adopted the new hues to come from the French and Swiss textile mills," said Lee Blaszczyk.\u000a\u000a"Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, was one of the leading trendsetters in Europe. On one occasion in the summer of 1857, she dressed in a 'plain lilac silk dress' and a charming hat trimmed with 'a small tuft of lilacs.' Ladies of fashion all around Paris emulated her."\u000a\u000aQuick to capitalize on his find, Perkin set up a factory to produce the dye industrially, at the cost of dropping out of school and asking his father for financial support.\u000a\u000a"In May 1857, one of his business associates in the textile industry wrote to him with congratulations that 'a rage for your color has set in among that all-powerful class of the community -- the Ladies,'" said Lee Blaszczyk.\u000a\u000aPerkin had not only created something entirely new and incredibly desirable, but he had done it through chemistry -- hardly seen as a money-making endeavor at the time. A plaque on the site of his London home says that he "founded science-based industry."\u000a\u000aFar-reaching impact\u000a\u000aThe mauve mania didn't last forever, and by 1870, other colors came in vogue. But the effects of Perkin's discovery were everlasting. "By laying the foundation for the synthetic organic chemicals industry, Perkin helped to revolutionize the world of fashion," said Lee Blaszczyk.\u000a\u000aHis aniline dye solved two major problems: the fact that colors faded after exposure to light or washing, and the expense of making dye. "For the first time, a schoolteacher could afford to buy beautiful calicos in printed bright colors and sew a colorful dress for herself, maybe using the new Singer sewing machine imported from America," Lee Blaszczyk said. "The calico wouldn't fade after washing or drying in the sun."\u000a\u000aA shawl dyed with Perkin's mauve dye.\u000a\u000aPerkin created several other colors by perfecting his technology, but most importantly inaugurated a new branch of chemistry, which would spawn world-changing inventions in numerous fields. "That industry not only brought new paints, pigments, and dyes into the world, but it was ultimately responsible for major innovations such as synthetic rubber, fibers such as nylon and polyester, and miracle drugs such as penicillin," said Lee Blaszczyk.\u000a\u000a"William Henry Perkin was no different that Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Jeff Bezos," she said.\u000a\u000a"All these entrepreneurs stumbled across an idea when they were young and unrestrained by the traditions that held back their elders, (and) were able to create something brand new -- and revolutionary."

aV(CNN) A night out drinking in Vietnam used to mean one thing: sipping Bia Hoi, a local draft beer with 3% alcohol content, from a tiny stool on the sidewalk.\u000a\u000aBut feather-light lagers aren't the only game in town anymore.\u000a\u000aThe country's craft beer scene is booming, having welcomed more than a dozen micro-breweries in the past two years.\u000a\u000a"The beer culture in Vietnam starts with Bia Hoi," Hao Tran, managing editor of lifestyle website Vietcetera , tells CNN. The craft beer scene that has evolved has done so from people drinking beer in the Old Quarter in Hanoi or Bui Vien Street in Saigon, he says.\u000a\u000a"But there's so much more to beer culture in Vietnam now than just that particular image."\u000a\u000aTapping new tastes\u000a\u000aPasteur Street Brewing Company draws a crowd.\u000a\u000aVietnam is one of the biggest beer consumers in Asia drinking 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.\u000a\u000aand Bia Hoi still account for the lion's share of that consumption, in Ho Chi Minh City alone artisan brewers such as Pasteur Street Brewing Co, Winking Seal, While stalwart brands such as Tiger, Saigon Beer,and Bia Hoi still account for the lion's share of that consumption, in Ho Chi Minh City alone artisan brewers such as Platinum Heart of Darkness , and Fuzzy Logic are providing a real alternative, says Tran.\u000a\u000aThe brands have, for example, introduced potent Indian pale ales (IPAs) and sour gose -- a tart and salty style of German beer -- to the market.\u000a\u000a"As Vietnam has continued to experience income growth and taste for global concepts and standards, that's where craft beer has really come in," says Tran.\u000a\u000a"The tastes and preferences of Vietnamese consumers are changing and evolving."\u000a\u000aWhat's brewing\u000a\u000aOne of Vietnam's craft pioneers, Pasteur Street Brewing Co opened its doors in 2015 and now distributes not only all over Vietnam, but also to Malaysia, Hong Kong, and the United States -- with Japan and Europe to come later this year.\u000a\u000aFor the past two years, Pasteur Street has been leading the revolt against boring lagers and predictable pale ales -- an effort that was rewarded with three gold medals at the 2016 Asian Beer Medal competition.\u000a\u000aalso behind Helmed by Americans John Reid and Alex Violette -- the latter isalso behind Upslope Brewing Company , in Colorado -- the brewery imports its hops from the US and malts from Europe, but adds a local touch to every recipe.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Vietnam's new brews The usual nightlife scene in Vietnam revolves around drinking Bia Hoi -- most commonly consumed street-side on tiny plastic stools. At 30 cents a pint, it's a light and easy choice with just 3% alcohol content.

You see craft beer happening in America, maybe some Vietnamese go visit family in California ... and they say: 'How come we don't have this in our country?'"\u000a\u000aA welcome change\u000a\u000aWhile many of the first microbreweries were set up by foreigners, Vietnamese entrepreneurs have also joined the mix.\u000a\u000aNewly opened East West Brewing Company , for example, is run by Loc Truong, a Vietnamese-American who worked at Anheuser-Busch InBev -- the company behind brands such as Stella Artois and Corona -- before striking out with his founding partners.\u000a\u000a"My being Vietnamese helps the craft beer industry, for sure, because that's one step to connect with the market," says Truong, who was born in Vietnam but studied in the US. "Why do people buy craft beer? It's higher quality, but who's behind it also adds value."\u000a\u000aTruong's lightly hopped beers, such as the East West Pale Ale, he says, provide a stepping stone to stronger flavors for new craft converts.\u000a\u000aFrom there, it gets more challenging, with a bolder Far East IPA, Coffee Vanilla Porter, or 12% ABV Independence Stout.\u000a\u000aThat's alongside Asia-inspired varieties, such as Le Wit, a wit-style beer made with Asian pear, and a dainty Saigon Rose that's infused with raspberries.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people don't know that there are so many different types of flavors in beer," says Truong.\u000a\u000a"We'll see customers coming back five or six times a week, saying they can't drink the traditional lagers or (Bia Hoi beer) anymore. Once they tried craft, they never went back."\u000a\u000aBuilding a bridge\u000a\u000aEast West Brewing Company's set up.\u000a\u000aIn the land of 30-cent drafts of Bia Hoi, charging consumers $5 for craft draft remains a challenge.\u000a\u000aAn on-site brewery was a crucial part of the persuasion strategy for East West Brewing Company, which opened in January.\u000a\u000a"It's all about really educating our (Vietnamese) consumers," Loc Truong, founder of East West Brewing Company , tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"You cannot show them what craft beer is if you don't have a craft brewery to really guide them through."\u000a\u000aIt helps that breweries and bars serving craft beers tend to be clustered in Ho Chi Minh City around central areas of Districts 1 and 2, where there's lots of foot traffic.\u000a\u000aAs a result, new beer-oriented tours have added to the buzz, such as the bar and brewery motorbike excursion operated by Vespa Adventures\u000a\u000aTruong and his team are based in the heart of District 1.\u000a\u000aInside the massive glass building, guests can mingle at the industrial-chic bar and restaurant downstairs, soak up the sun on the rooftop, or take a tour of the steel fermenting tanks and barrel-aging room.\u000a\u000aBefore opening, Truong expected expats and travelers to drive sales, but he was pleasantly surprised that 85% of his patrons were Vietnamese in the first six months of business.\u000a\u000aTruong says that is partly due to a growing middle class in Vietnam.\u000a\u000aWith a 6% annual increase in GDP per capita, the Boston Consulting Group predicts Vietnam's middle class will account for 23% of the population of 95 million by 2020, up from 16% in 2015.\u000a\u000a"Vietnam moves very, very fast," says Truong. "One thing catches on and the next thing you know, the whole market is shifting."

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge impact on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000a(CNN) tl;dr version : You can vote on the first story I'll report as part of this new series on 2 degrees Celsius -- which is the agreed-upon threshold for dangerous climate change. Go here if you don't see the poll . Thanks!\u000a\u000a* * * * *\u000a\u000aIn 2013, I did something that's a little scary for a journalist.\u000a\u000aI asked you to tell me what to cover.\u000a\u000aThose experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of democratic journalism. Editors shouldn't get all the control. You, the audience, have a vital say, too.\u000a\u000aStill, in the two years since I asked for your ideas, I haven't done much, if anything, to address one of the topics you most frequently asked me to cover : climate change.\u000a\u000aI'm hoping to make good on your request now.\u000a\u000aStarting today, Earth Day, I'm planning to spend the rest of the year writing about one tiny little number -- 2 degrees. It may be the most important number you've never heard of.\u000a\u000aMaybe that plan sounds excessive.\u000a\u000a(Eight months reporting on one number!?)\u000a\u000aBut here's why it matters: If we humans warm the world more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), we greatly up the odds of climate catastrophes.\u000a\u000aThink super droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions and acidifying oceans.\u000a\u000aWe don't want to cross that mark.\u000a\u000aHumans never have lived in post-2-degree world, said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, based in Germany, and author of a paper on this history of 2 degrees.\u000a\u000a"If we start warming the planet way beyond what humans have ever experienced, God knows what will wait for us," he told me.\u000a\u000aGood news, though. If we drastically cut carbon emissions, we can stay below the 2-degree threshold. As part of this series, I'll be exploring exactly what it would take to do so.\u000a\u000aThis matters a great deal this year, since the United Nations will gather leaders and policy experts in Paris in December to try to hammer out a new international agreement on climate change. Two degrees will be one useful benchmark to see if the world is on track.\u000a\u000a"It's almost kind of like a truth keeping mechanism," said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute. "It would be hard if it didn't exist to have a sense of whether countries are on track or not."\u000a\u000aIt's not a perfect yardstick. But it's a reasonable one. Think of it like a speed limit, said Jaeger, the economist in Germany. Would a 51 mph limit be better than 50? Or maybe it should be 49? The point isn't the exact number, it's the ballpark: 200 mph would certainly be too fast, as he put it, but 20 mph is too slow.\u000a\u000aFor climate change, the point is we don't know the world will fall into crisis at exactly 2 degrees and not 2.1 or 1.8. But that range is certainly dangerous.\u000a\u000a"The way I think of it is like smoking," said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech. "How many cigarettes are too many? I don't know. I have no idea. Nobody has any idea. But we do know the more cigarettes you smoke, the greater the risk."\u000a\u000aTwo degrees, then, is our most educated estimate. A way to focus attention.\u000a\u000aIt's incredibly valuable in that respect.\u000a\u000aSince the number emerged from a relatively obscure academic paper in the 1970s, it's become widely agreed upon in the international community. In 2009, for example, 114 countries initially signed onto the "Copenhagen Accord," a nonbinding agreement that recognizes the "scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius."\u000a\u000aThat level of consensus is rare on this topic.\u000a\u000a"If there's one thing the world has agreed upon about climate change it's 2 degrees should be the benchmark," said Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org , an advocacy group.\u000a\u000aI'll be writing more about the origins of 2 degrees soon -- where this number came from (one guy, turns out, and I chatted with him), how soon we may cross that mark if we don't take action (short answer: 2050), and how much we've warmed the planet since the start of the industrial revolution, in the late 1800s, which is how these temperature increases are usually measured (0.85 degrees).\u000a\u000aRight now, though, I'd like to ask you to do something that's scary and exciting.\u000a\u000aI want you to vote on the first project I'll report for this series.\u000a\u000aAll of the options center on one theme: What does a post-2-degree world look like?\u000a\u000aI love that question because it -- like all six choices you'll see below -- came from you.\u000a\u000aCNN hosted a Facebook chat on Friday , asking our audience to come up with questions for me about climate change or about 2 degrees of warming. Many of you said you wanted to know what a 2-degree world would have in store, in general. Other folks asked about specific impacts to people and ecosystems if the climate continues to inch toward that dangerous 2-degree mark.\u000a\u000aClay Miller, from Alaska, for example, asked about the Arctic.\u000a\u000aCindy Johnson wanted to know which animals would go extinct first.\u000a\u000aJon Locke was among those curious about farms.\u000a\u000aAnd many of you, including Kayla Helton, from Florida, asked about rising seas. Kelly, a 48-year-old from California, wanted to know what would happen to "climate refugees" as the coast vanishes.\u000a\u000aTell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees Posted by CNN on Tuesday, April 21, 2015\u000a\u000aThe topic with the most votes on Monday at 5 p.m. ET is the one I'll report in May.\u000a\u000aLook for more votes like this in the future as we explore this number together.\u000a\u000aIf you'd like to follow along, consider subscribing to my "2-degree" newsletter\u000a\u000asocial Or you can track me down on the usual networks , including Snapchat.\u000a\u000aI'm @jdsutter on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\u000a\u000aI think of this kind of like non-fiction improv: You throw out the prompts, and I'll go out there looking for the most interesting and informative story. It's an experiment, to be sure. And it scares the hell out of me. But climate change is a topic so big -- so critical to the future of our planet and humanity species -- that we've gotta be in this together.

aVFew places in the world have felt the pain of low oil prices like Saudi Arabia.\u000a\u000aCuts to the bloated public sector have changed the economic prospects for many Saudis. But one local industry is emerging as a winner from the oil bust.\u000a\u000aThe oil crunch is proving a "blessing in disguise" for the country's young tech sector, said Abdulrahman Tarabzouni, a former regional manager for Google (GOOGL, Tech30).\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia is pumping tens of billions of dollars into technology in an attempt to diversify its economy and become less reliant on volatile oil prices.\u000a\u000a"Any individual has a shot now at creating something extremely valuable and accessible to the rest of the world," Tarabzouni told young entrepreneurs and business leaders at a recent forum in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\u000a\u000aMany local and national governments dream of imitating Silicon Valley's success, but the Saudis at least have the cash to make a serious attempt.\u000a\u000aThe kingdom's sovereign wealth fund has already announced plans to pour $45 billion into a tech fund with Japan's Softbank (SFTBF). In June, the Saudi fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia has also set up tech incubators and established venture capital funds with headquarters in Riyadh and offices in Menlo Park, California. Among them is Riyadh Taqnia Capital, which has committed to investing over $100 million in local tech firms.\u000a\u000aRelated: Saudi Arabia and Burj Khalifa developer launch Gulf answer to Amazon\u000a\u000aAmerican tech investor Christopher Schroeder said that what he sees happening in Saudi Arabia represents a deeper entrepreneurial streak running through the Middle East.\u000a\u000a"There are remarkable surprises," he said at the forum. "Over 25% of these startups are run by women. Some of the hardest working entrepreneurs I've met are women -- across the Arab world.\u000a\u000aFemale entrepreneurs are seizing the opportunity to assert themselves in Saudi Arabia's male-dominated culture.\u000a\u000aLateefa Alwaalan, CEO and founder of Yatooq, a startup disrupting the Arabic coffee market with hardware which cuts the time it takes to prepare a drink, says the restrictions on women - especially the Saudi ban on driving -- means being extra creative to help each other.\u000a\u000a"I knew I wanted to hire women. So when I was looking for factories, instead of looking on the outskirts, I got space inside the city so transportation would be easier for them," says the Seattle-educated Alwaalan. "I also include the cost of a driver in their salary."\u000a\u000aSilicon Valley entrepreneurs are watching closely. Jeff Martin helped developed iTunes and is now CEO of Tribal Planet. A frequent visitor to the Gulf countries, he believes governments in the region are paving the way for innovation by digitizing services for citizens.\u000a\u000aRelated: Saudis believe Trump will unleash America's economy\u000a\u000a"In the Gulf countries, and Saudi [Arabia] especially, the notion that citizens are consumers and consumer are citizens, is what I see governments here doing much more intelligently than in other parts of the world," he said.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia's leading entrepreneurs say their biggest challenge is finding talent. And the sector will have to live in the shadow of oil for a while longer.\u000a\u000a"My biggest [challenge] is still getting people to work for a startup instead of the big Saudi brands like [oil giant] Aramco," said Salman AlSuhaibani, CEO and founder of roadside assistance app Morni.

aV(CNN) Favored by hardened yakuza gang members and law-abiding body art purists alike, large-scale Japanese tattoos are widely celebrated for their distinctive style, mythological motifs and vibrant coloring.\u000a\u000aBut while many of the common motifs are steeped in history and folklore, Japan's pictorial tattooing tradition is relatively new. Before the Edo period (c.1615-1868), tattoos were primarily used as crude markers of punishment for petty criminals or of fealty for lovers, or else the domain of the indigenous Ainu tribes of the northern islands.\u000a\u000aAccording to "Tattoos in Japanese Prints," a new publication from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it was only in the 19th century that they were elevated to the level of art.\u000a\u000aAuthor Sarah E. Thompson, curator of Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, traces their popularity back to the publication of "One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Water Margin," a series of woodblock prints by the artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, between 1827 and 1830.\u000a\u000aHis prints, adapted from a 14th-century Chinese novel, saw bandit heroes covered with elaborate, full-body tattoos rendered in impressive detail. The common motifs -- dragons and demons, fearsome predators, koi fish and cherry blossoms -- were laden with meaning, and added another layer to the narrative.\u000a\u000a"Yan Qing, the Graceful" from "One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Water Margin" (c. 1827-3) by Utagawa Kuniyoshi\u000a\u000a"By emphasizing the tattoos sported by some of the heroes, Kuniyoshi's print designs not only exploited the allure of the exotic but also provided a titillating hint of the illicit -- especially if the suggestion that pictorial tattoos in Japan had been outlaws and spread to fashionable urbanites is correct," Thompson writes.\u000a\u000aThe impact of the "Water Margin" series and similar works from Kuniyoshi and his contemporaries was immediate and broad-reaching. Men across class lines requested tattoos of scenes from "Water Margins" -- and, in some cases, the characters' tattoos. Textile artists started incorporating tattoo-like prints into their designs; kabuki stars painted simple designs onto their skin for performances.\u000a\u000a(The tattoos did have their detractors, however. In 1872, as Japan started its push toward Westernization, tattoos were banned by the Japanese government, who considered them uncivilized and old-fashioned. This ban was lifted after the American occupation after WWII.)\u000a\u000a"It is uncertain whether Kuniyoshi was responding to a recent craze for extensive pictorial tattoos, or whether -- as suggested by oral tradition among present-day tattoo artists -- it was the prints themselves that inspired the new fashion," Thompson writes.\u000a\u000a"Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between: large tattoos were already beginning to appear, but it was Kuniyoshi who transformed a temporary fad into a lasting art form."

aV(CNN) If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox.\u000a\u000aBut whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating.\u000a\u000aIn fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar.\u000a\u000aBut there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin.\u000a\u000a"Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old," said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of "The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great." "What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging."\u000a\u000aSugar addiction\u000a\u000aHere's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. "People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar," Alpert said. "We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Why sugar intake has increased Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why sugar intake has increased 02:52\u000a\u000aAbout 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff.\u000a\u000a"People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aHow to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three days\u000a\u000aThe good news is that even if you're not a true sugar "addict," by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance.\u000a\u000a"There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets," Lustig said.\u000a\u000aChildren can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed.\u000a\u000aBut going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.\u000a\u000a"Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clichéd and not effective," Alpert said. "It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.\u000a\u000a"What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate," she said. "They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to."\u000a\u000aSo for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. "You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats."\u000a\u000aFor example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.\u000a\u000aThough they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. "These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aConsuming artificial sweeteners causes "you not only (to) store more fat," Lustig explained, "you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage."\u000a\u000aHow to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candy\u000a\u000aOnce the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple.\u000a\u000a"By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy," Alpert said. "The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again."\u000a\u000aStarting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. "Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aYou can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too.\u000a\u000aDuring week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.\u000a\u000aFor week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.\u000a\u000a"Week three should be quite livable," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aWeek four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week.\u000a\u000a"You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier," Alpert said. "I want people living. Week four is the way to do it."\u000a\u000aWeek four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. "Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one," Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days.\u000a\u000a"The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aBenefits and cautions with slashing sugar\u000a\u000aDetoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. "We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction," Alpert said. "Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!"\u000a\u000aParticipants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Natural sweeteners Photos: Natural sweeteners Although maple syrup contains some vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the amounts in a typical serving are quite small. One tablespoon provides about 1% of your daily needs for calcium, potassium and iron. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Natural sweeteners Honey has been shown to possess small amounts of nutrients, antioxidants and antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory compounds. Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Natural sweeteners Whole dates are a good source of several key nutrients, including potassium, manganese, magnesium, copper, calcium, iron, B vitamins, vitamin K and antioxidants.

Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: Natural sweeteners Blackstrap molasses contains 6% of your daily value for iron and calcium. Plus, it has been shown to have higher antioxidant levels than any other sweetener. Hide Caption 5 of 5\u000a\u000a"I have lost approximately 40 pounds following the sugar detox," said Diane, who preferred not to share her last name. She has been on the plan for approximately two years.\u000a\u000a"I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes."\u000a\u000aDiane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. "This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal."\u000a\u000aThere are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive.\u000a\u000a"Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue," Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided.\u000a\u000a"If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit. But if you can push through and stay well-hydrated, you can really break your cycle of sugar addiction," Alpert said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIt's important to note that the plan may not be appropriate for diabetics, extreme athletes or anyone taking medication to control blood sugar. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.\u000a\u000aFinally, before starting a sugar detox, enlist the help of friends and/or family members for support. "You need people around you to help you be successful," Lustig said. "The whole family has to do it together."

aVKelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Like most parents, my weekends are consumed with getting my girls, ages 9 and 11, to and from various activities.\u000a\u000aThis weekend, we had two soccer games, one sleepover party, two play dates, religious school and an outing with my sister-in-law. We also would have had a baseball double header, but that was canceled due to the rain.\u000a\u000aIn between, there were definitely a few fights and complaints, homework assignments that needed to get done, a house to get ready for not one but two houseguests and, of course, meals to prepare and snacks to pack.\u000a\u000aIt's the same story every weekend and week. My mom jokes that she can't keep up with how crazy our lives are, but I know I'm not alone.\u000a\u000aAnd that is why a recent New York magazine story really resonated with me. Headlined "Just like Burnout at Work, It's Possible to Burn Out on Parenting," the story talked about a recent survey of more than 2,000 parents, conducted by researchers in Belgium. They found that just as people can burn out from their professional jobs, mothers and fathers can burn out, too.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, found that close to 13% of the parents surveyed, 12.9% of mothers and 11.6% of fathers, had what the researchers called "high burnout." That meant they felt exhausted, less productive and competent and emotionally withdrawn -- qualities that are similar to professional burnout -- at least once a week.\u000a\u000aI'm not sure I needed a study to tell me parental burnout is real, and neither did many of the parents I contacted via social media and email. What I wanted to find out from parents is why parents today may be experiencing burnout more than parents did in previous generations and what we can do about it.\u000a\u000aPressure to be a 'superhero in everything'\u000a\u000aLyss Stern is author of "Motherhood is a B#tch!"\u000a\u000aBy all accounts, Lyss Stern seems like the mother who has it all together. A mom of three, she built a thriving business called Divalysscious Moms, a networking and event company for New York City mothers, creating what she calls "fabuLyss" opportunities for mothers to connect and recharge.\u000a\u000aBut Stern was so busy taking care of her business; her three kids, who are now 3, 9 and 13; and her husband and dealing with the death of her father that she never took time for herself. About a year and a half ago, she said, she hit rock bottom and found herself crying on a rock during a retreat in Massachusetts.\u000a\u000a"I think I was just overwhelmed by everything," said Stern. "I think at that moment, it was like my 'aha' moment: 'Lyss, you need to get your life back on track. You need to start taking care of yourself.' "\u000a\u000aShe was burned out, she said, and experienced another "aha" moment when she returned home.\u000a\u000aThis parenting manual includes tips for moms to combat parental burnout.\u000a\u000a"I turned to my husband, I said, 'I need to make changes. I need to take baby steps, because I want to get healthy, healthy physically and healthy mentally, so I could be the best mom,' " said Stern, who wrote about her journey in the hopes of inspiring other burned out mothers in the just released book "Motherhood is a B#tch! 10 Steps to Regaining Your Sanity, Sexiness, and Inner Diva."\u000a\u000aHer mom (and my mom, too!) certainly wouldn't say they were burning out as parents when they raised us, said Stern. "Today, so many moms have these high-powered jobs, and they have the kids, and we want to be the best at our jobs, and you want to be the best with your kids, and then you want to sometimes take time for yourself, and you feel guilty, but you can't feel guilty. You're allowed to go to a movie with your husband. You're allowed to go to a movie with your friend without having a breakdown."\u000a\u000aThe "modern mindset" that you have to essentially be a "superhero in everything you do" is part of the problem, said Vanina Nikolova, a mom of two boys, ages 2½ and 6, in San Jose, California. Nikolova is the senior data analyst for Power to Fly, which connects women to remote opportunities in tech and prides itself on transforming how women are treated at work.\u000a\u000aShe said parenting burnout is so real that at times, she dreams someone would kidnap her for two weeks so she can finally get some rest from the kids, housework, co-sleeping with a toddler, food fights and everything else that comes along with raising two young boys.\u000a\u000a"You have to excel at work. You have to excel in your relationship. You have to excel in society. You have to be a great parent who feeds the kids with organic food, stimulates their brains while still in uterus, finds the right balance between protecting them and yet exposing them to the real world, shuttles them to sports, arts," and the list goes on and on, said Nikolova. "A supercomputer would go crazy. How about a simple human being!"\u000a\u000aParenting in social media age\u000a\u000aSocial media certainly hasn't helped, many parents said.\u000a\u000a"Gone are the days of backyard birthday parties with a homemade cake, a peanut hunt and a game of 'drop a clothes pin in the bottle,' " said Shelby Rideout, founder of Bright Signs Learning, a children's educational company that uses sign language to teach early reading concepts. "Thanks to Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram, parents now get to feel 'less than' for throwing that kind of party. These exaggerations on social media become a measuring stick in which to gauge your success or failure as a parent," said Rideout, a parent of four, ranging in age from 21 months to 6 years.\u000a\u000aParents exhaust themselves trying to keep up with the false standard of perfection they see around them, she said. "It doesn't seem to matter that these family portraits conjured up on social media do not offer a true depiction of what families are really going through. This is a perfect recipe for burnout."\u000a\u000aFor working parents, there is the pressure to excel in your career and master the work/life balance, while giving your children everything you never had to ensure that they turn into well-rounded, happy and successful adults, said writer Jennifer Bosse, a mom of two boys ages 4 and 6 in Fort Mill, South Carolina, who has contributed to the Huffington Post, Scary Mommy and Mamalode. For stay-at-home parents like herself, there are pressures too, she said.\u000a\u000a"There is the underlying need to feel valued and validated within society (a society which still places a higher value on what you provide to the job force)," she said. "Socializing with other adults can be difficult, the days long, the routine monotonous and the job, overall, relatively thankless."\u000a\u000aBosse, whose husband travels frequently for work, said she has definitely experienced burnout, and for her, the experience is one of a "complete shutdown."\u000a\u000a"I feel touched out, emotionally low and mentally blank. I am merely there," she said. What has helped her is finding outlets outside of home and openly communicating with her husband about her needs. "I was always afraid of saying I needed a break because I thought it would make me sound like a horrible mother, but as I progress in this journey, I realize that everyone needs time to realign."\u000a\u000aThe need for 'me' time\u000a\u000aFinding that "me" time is key, many parents said. Nikki Little, a mother of 4-year-old twin boys, said she and her husband agreed from day one that it is important that they both get time for themselves.\u000a\u000aThey recently trained for the same half-marathon and alternated their run days so one would run and the other would put the boys to bed. "My husband and I both want each other to feel like we can have our 'me' time without guilt -- which is why we encourage each other to take that time as needed, with the mutual agreement of not committing to so much that it takes significant time away from being together as a family," said Little, a social media director for a public relations firm.\u000a\u000aWhat pains her, she said, is when she hears from moms who say they truly do everything when it comes to parenting while their husbands enjoy plenty of "me" time.\u000a\u000a"That's not acceptable in my book. It is not a badge of honor to say you sacrifice everything for your family and put yourself last. Self-care and 'me' time are so, so important to avoid parental burnout," she said.\u000a\u000aJanis Brett Elspas had four children born in the same year, a singleton plus triplets, so she knows a thing or two about burnout. Up until the age of 3, her four kids were home with her all day. She remembers the relief she felt when her husband returned home from work and she could do basic things for herself that she was neglecting, like taking a shower, going to the dentist for an overdue appointment or even reading a book in a peaceful bedroom to get her energy back.\u000a\u000a"I just don't know how single parents raise their children without a second pair of hands to help. I'm convinced that there are few moms or dads out there who can deal with kids 24/7," said Elspas, founder of The Mommy Blog Expert.\u000a\u000aHer kids are now all grown and in college, but looking back, she thinks today's parents of young kids are even at higher risk for parental burnout than she was, in part because there are more single parents and households in which both parents need to work out of necessity. On top of that, there is the impact of technology.\u000a\u000a"Burnout is also fueled by the constant vigilance, the need to deal with the ever-increased speed of technology, the internet and all the dangers in the world we now have to protect our children against," she said.\u000a\u000aIs 'burnout' an excuse?\u000a\u000aMindee Hardin, a mom of six in Beaverton, Oregon, said that if parents are truly feeling "burnt out," they should examine why they are feeling that way and fix it as soon as possible. She worries that some parents may use it as an excuse to check out of engaging with their kids. She believes far too many parents are doing that already.\u000a\u000a"A large percentage of parents are already so selfish with the majority of their time being spent on many things besides investing in their kids, the last thing they need is one more excuse to disconnect the only hour a day they are engaging as it is," said Hardin, founder of Juice Box Consulting , where she helps moms make the best career choices for their family needs.\u000a\u000aShe says she overworked herself into a divorce and bankruptcy about seven years ago and has been trying not to make the same career, marriage and mothering mistakes in her second marriage. She wrote about her experience in her new book "Boogie Wiped: The Story of My Mom Life Crisis."\u000a\u000aShe believes the growing depression and suicide issues in tweens and teens is directly related to parents who "can't seem to enjoy their company long enough to have a meal with them once a day," she said. "Disconnected, overcommitted, exhausted parents + ignored, socially connected kids = a void so big in a child's heart it can't ever be filled," Hardin wrote in an email. "It's an epidemic in my opinion."\u000a\u000aLouise Sattler, a mom of two grown children, said the need to compete is driving some of the burnout parents feel today. "For some reason, we are not happy being 'just average,' " she said.\u000a\u000a"Moms in particular need to be 200% at everything. We need to give ourselves permission to be just 'average' at some parts of our lives and perhaps let other aspects go. That load of laundry can wait until tomorrow, as reading an extra bedtime story to your child is more important," said Sattler, co-founder of 411 Voices , a collective of professionals with social media experience.\u000a\u000aStern, the author of "Motherhood is a B#tch!" wholeheartedly agrees. "Everybody has to stop looking at everybody else and look to within," she said. "My kids this morning had Frosted Flakes for breakfast. They had sugary cereal. Now, the past two days, they had eggs, but today they didn't have eggs. ... Mothers, I'm sure, will come after me and say, 'Lyss Stern is a terrible mother, because she gave her kids Frosted Flakes for breakfast today,' but at the end of the day, it's OK."\u000a\u000aShe added, "We all need to let go of whatever that perfect image is in our heads and be content and happy with who we are and do the best job that we can do, because nobody knows what goes on behind anyone's closed doors at the end of the day."\u000a\u000aBurnout is certainly not just an issue for mothers. As the recent study revealed, almost the same number of fathers as mothers said they were experiencing high burnout.\u000a\u000aBuzz Bishop, a father of two, ages 7 and 9, jokes that he's just getting started with this thing called parenting. But he shares an interesting -- and hopefully helpful -- perspective about burnout.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Here's the thing about burnout: As soon as you're just about done, things change. An infant eventually learns to sleep through the night; a toddler will become toilet trained. When they walk, you don't have to pack a stroller when you go out. At meals, they eventually learn to feed themselves," said Bishop, a radio host in Calgary, Alberta, who writes about parenting at DadCAMP.\u000a\u000aIf you are feeling burned out as a parent, just hang in there, says Bishop. "The rules of the game will change soon enough, and you'll have an entirely different game to play, which may or may not be more fun. As my brother used to say, 'Whoever called them the terrible twos never had a 3-year-old.' "\u000a\u000aOr a tween or a teen, many parents might add.

aVLondon (CNN) One was a basketball fanatic who became an international soccer star.\u000a\u000aThe other dreamed of being a football great, and is bound for basketball's Hall of Fame.\u000a\u000aSteve Nash and Owen Hargreaves are two of Canada's greatest sporting exports who made their names on opposite sides of the Atlantic.\u000a\u000aBut through a passion for each other's sports -- along with kindred, crisscrossing pasts -- the two have formed a sporting bromance for the ages.\u000a\u000aHargreaves, the younger of the two, was a scrappy high school point guard who dreamed of playing for the Chicago Bulls, while Nash was so crafty with his feet that he was named British Columbia's most valuable high school soccer player as a lanky 16-year-old.\u000a\u000aYet it was Nash, of course, who would blossom into the NBA's two-time Most Valuable Player with the Phoenix Suns, while Hargreaves was winning bookend European titles with Bayern Munich and Manchester United.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Steve Nash: Hoops magician, footie addict Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Steve Nash: Hoops magician, footie addict 03:25\u000a\u000aTwo sides of the same coin\u000a\u000aAlthough the two met only after their careers took off, both standouts grew up in Western Canada as sports-obsessed sons of English soccer players.\u000a\u000aNash made his NBA mark in 1998, as a dynamic counterpart to Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas. It was during his six-year spell in Texas that he heard about a young Canadian soccer player who was making waves in Germany, and through a mutual family friend invited him to attend a Mavs game.\u000a\u000aHargreaves, who like Nash is a dual British-Canadian citizen, was breaking into the England squad and reciprocated with World Cup tickets.\u000a\u000a"I would have loved to have been Steve, because I would have loved to have been an NBA player," Hargreaves told CNN before this year's annual NBA game in London, where the 35-year-old soccer television analyst is a fixture.\u000a\u000a"We connected because we are basically opposites: I grew up in a football family, but wanted to be a basketball player," he explains, noting that he wore number 23 on his jersey throughout his career at Bayern in honor of his hero Michael Jordan.\u000a\u000aBorn to British parents and raised in Western Canada, Nash (L) and Hargreaves achieved greatness in two improbable sports.\u000a\u000aNash, in turn, says he found inspiration in watching soccer players excel during his 18-season Hall of Fame career, which ended last year.\u000a\u000a"I was a big fan of Owen's," the 42-year-old Nash tells CNN. "Obviously, it was phenomenal to hear of a Canadian kid who was making the ranks of Bayern Munich.\u000a\u000a"To watch him go on to Manchester United and win Champions Leagues in both countries, and to have the career that he did representing England ... It was thrilling for all of us Canadians."\u000a\u000aNash even tried to recruit Hargreaves to play for the Vancouver Whitecaps, the MLS team he partially owns, towards the end of the midfielder's career -- which was cut short by knee injuries.\u000a\u000aBut Hargreaves preferred to stay in England, launching stalled comebacks with Manchester United and Manchester City before retiring at 31.\u000a\u000a"The thing I like about Steve is he was such an amazing athlete, but he's such a great guy as well," Hargreaves reciprocates. "I like that people can be big stars and still be humble. Steve was a great example."\u000a\u000aSoccer fanaticism\u000a\u000aIt's no secret that Nash is equally as enamored with soccer as Hargreaves is with hoops.\u000a\u000aAs a fan he watches a lot more footie than he does basketball, even though he is contracted with the Golden State Warriors as a special consultant and is the general manager of Canada's men's team.\u000a\u000aA quick skim through Nash's Instagram feed confirms his soccer obsession.\u000a\u000aHe stars in a Venice Beach league which features the likes of ex-pros Alessandro Del Piero and Landon Donovan, organizes a celebrity charity game in New York going on its 10th year, trains with his beloved Tottenham Hotspur, and rubs shoulders with the likes of Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry.\u000a\u000aNash is a regular at White Hart Lane, home of Tottenham Hotspur. As a youth player, he chose to stay in Canada rather than try out for his family's beloved team.\u000a\u000aNash has also taken his role as a club owner a step further with an active investment in Spanish second division team Real Mallorca.\u000a\u000aThe resident of Manhattan Beach, California has made several trips to the Mediterranean island, known more as the birthplace of tennis ace Rafael Nadal.\u000a\u000a"We love the sport. We have fallen in love with the history of the club and the fans," Nash says on behalf of his investment group, led by Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver.\u000a\u000a"This is something that we are passionate about and want to see succeed."\u000a\u000aDespite his involvement in the club's boardroom, it's hard not to wonder whether something gnaws at Nash for diverting from the path of Hargreaves, or his own brother Martin, who made 38 appearances for the Canadian national team and captained the Whitecaps.\u000a\u000a"The competitor in me thinks that if I dedicated myself the way I did with basketball, I could have been a professional (soccer) player," he says, although he still can't quite admit that the ship has already sailed.\u000a\u000a"The dream is still alive; I'm not going to give up on it just yet," he says, perhaps reconsidering his teenage decision to spurn an offer to join Canada's national under-17 soccer team.\u000a\u000aBy his own admission, Hargreaves -- who is generously listed at 5 foot 11 inches to Nash's 6 foot 3 -- says Nash was a far better soccer prospect than he was on the hardwood.\u000a\u000aHe assesses a young Nash's chances of making it in the English Premier League as high, though "not as a two-time MVP-level player."\u000a\u000aUnlikely path in an unlikely sport\u000a\u000aAs a 12-year-old, Nash showed enough promise that his father John, a former professional in South Africa, offered to send him to live with his aunt in London to latch on to the youth club at Tottenham.\u000a\u000aBut Nash, who was also exceptional in hockey and baseball, found the prospect of moving to a strange city too daunting. Instead, he switched to a new school in Victoria and joined the other jocks playing pickup hoops.\u000a\u000a"Really, I started playing basketball for social reasons," he recalls. But Nash's hyper-competitiveness soon took over and he outgrew his surroundings.\u000a\u000aAt 16 he told his coach at Mount Douglas Secondary School that he was aiming for a scholarship to an American Division I college program, only to be informed he needed to "readjust his goals," according to the book "Steve Nash: The Making of an MVP."\u000a\u000aNash switched schools instead.\u000a\u000aAlthough league rules forced him to sit out a season, he returned as a senior and averaged a near-triple-double at St. Michaels University School. Still, the skinny Canadian kid was rejected by nearly every Division I program he approached.\u000a\u000aOnly tiny Santa Clara University offered Nash a full scholarship, and was rewarded by big-time upsets over UCLA and Arizona. Nash would lead his conference in scoring and assists, before being picked just two slots behind Kobe Bryant in the 1996 NBA Draft\u000a\u000aNash's past, he says, made all those no-look passes for easy buckets possible.\u000a\u000a"In soccer, you already have to know what you are doing before the ball comes to you, so you've calculated your options," he explains. "A lot of kids growing up playing basketball, they don't think like that. They have the ball, then they survey.\u000a\u000a"I think it gave me an advantage to have seen thousands of angles, and players moving, and reading defenses, and making decisions on the soccer field."\u000a\u000a'You did what your Dad did'\u000a\u000aHargreaves, meanwhile, credits fighting for a spot on his high school basketball team for later asserting himself in an unfamiliar sport.\u000a\u000aHis father Colin played soccer semi-professionally in Calgary, and brother Darren was set to play for English team Bolton Wanderers before tearing up his knee, leaving young Owen as the next big hope.\u000a\u000a"I played soccer because my Dad played, and you did what your Dad did," he shrugs.\u000a\u000aHargreaves cared so little for the sport, in fact, that he didn't even have a favorite team. "It wasn't on TV at the time," he recalls, "so I watched basketball."\u000a\u000aGrowing up in Alberta, where it was so cold he could only practice soccer twice a week, Hargreaves hit the indoor basketball courts for five hours a day instead.\u000a\u000aAs an undersized point guard, he struggled at first -- "I wasn't very good at it; I could barely shoot," he confesses -- but earned respectability on the court.\u000a\u000a"Because I worked so hard at getting good at basketball, when I took that competitiveness and applied it to soccer -- where I was more naturally gifted -- it actually helped me so much," he says, sounding a lot like Nash.\u000a\u000aAlthough Hargreaves became a star at Bayern Munich, he played a big part in Manchester United's 2008 Premier League and Champions League titles.\u000a\u000aGiven that Hargreaves only began playing soccer competitively at 15, it's remarkable that just one year later he landed a spot on Bayern's youth team and moved to Germany.\u000a\u000aAs a 19-year-old, he debuted as one of the first three Canadians -- all on the same day -- to ever play in the Bundesliga. He is also one of only seven English players to have played in Germany's top division.\u000a\u000a"Listen, I never expected to be a professional soccer player -- never in a million years -- because it just wasn't possible really," Hargreaves says.\u000a\u000a"And then you just go over one hurdle. And then you go over another one, and another one, and it just builds up your confidence."\u000a\u000aHargreaves' "welcome to world football" moment took place that rookie year when he stripped the ball from Real Madrid star Luis Figo, who he idolized.\u000a\u000a"I remember thinking 'It's Luis Figo, he's going to kill me,'" he says. "That gave me more confidence than anything I had ever had, because I realized he's actually just like me."\u000a\u000aIn many ways, he could say the same about Nash. Through the most improbable mirroring turns, both athletes took their dreams to the highest levels in sports which came secondary to them.\u000a\u000aThese days, Hargreaves seems content with watching his Chicago Bulls from afar as an NBA superfan, while Nash is giving soccer one more go from the owners' box.\u000a\u000aThe dream, as he says, is still very much alive.\u000a\u000aCorrects to reflect that Steve Nash is not yet in the Hall of Fame. He will be eligible for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.

aVWar & Fashion\u000a\u000aCarnage: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria. Catwalk: Armani, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWar is ugly. Fashion is beautiful. War projects the worst of humanity. Fashion displays sartorial splendor in its highest. War is fraught with danger, even for journalists and especially for photographers who must get up close to their subjects to frame an image. Fashion is far less perilous, though photographers must also get intimate with their subjects on and around the runways. There are photographers who shoot both: battlefields and runways, guns and glamour. At first, photographing war and fashion appear as incongruous acts that are difficult to reconcile.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUntil, perhaps, you take a deeper look.\u000a\u000aGaza, 2000. Gaza, 2000. Paris, 2006. Paris, 2006. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aI laid out photographer Christopher Anderson's images of war and fashion before him. He was on a lunch break from a New York Magazine cover shoot in a Manhattan studio.\u000a\u000a"Amazing," he said.\u000a\u000aHe'd never seen his own photographs juxtaposed like that. War belongs in one intellectual compartment; fashion in another. The two don't usually mix in project portfolios -- or in the mind.\u000a\u000aHe called over the magazine's photo director, Jody Quon, for a look. She, too, was astonished by the common threads.\u000a\u000aAnderson captured a Palestinian youth in Gaza during the second intifada and a Giorgio Armani show in Paris. Both images are blurred, the figures airy, almost diaphanous in the light.\u000a\u000a"It's about the optics," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 2006, Anderson shot rescuers attempting to remove bodies from the rubble of a Beirut apartment building hit by Israeli jets. "Lebanon horrified me," he said.\u000a\u000aTwo years later, he clicked his camera behind the scenes at a Proenza Schouler show in New York. The composition feels eerily similar. Both images show a cacophony of chaos.\u000a\u000aBeirut, Lebanon, 2006. Beirut, Lebanon, 2006. New York, 2008. New York, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThen there is a photograph of 3rd Infantry Division soldiers clearing a building during the battle for Baghdad after U.S. forces entered the Iraqi capital in 2003. And a shot showing models at a L'Wren Scott show in 2008. The movement in the Iraq photo mirrors that of the models in their high heels.\u000a\u000a"I see scared little girls who have come from all over the world, all dressed up to be something they're not," Anderson said. Just like the young men in the U.S. Army who got dressed up to fight, terrified, at times, of a still-invisible enemy.\u000a\u000aIraq, 2003. Iraq, 2003. New York, 2008. New York, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"People are people," Anderson said. "I see the human experience in these photos. When I'm looking to make a picture, I'm peeling back layers to get that emotional quality."\u000a\u000aAs in the photo of an Iraqi army sergeant surrendering to the Americans in Najaf.\u000a\u000a"I don't see war," Anderson said. "I see a man who is frightened."\u000a\u000aThe idea to juxtapose war and fashion evolved after CNN's Director of Photography Simon Barnett came across a war photograph that reminded him of a fashion shot he'd seen. (See Barnett's selection of images on CNN's photo blog.)\u000a\u000a"I got to thinking about a number of established combat photographers who have in recent years been turning their cameras toward fashion," Barnett said. "I wondered what we would find if we went deeper into their work."\u000a\u000aBarnett did just that; he asked Magnum Photos to send him a collection of images made by four photographers -- each of whom has won major photojournalism awards.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2005. New York, 2005. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aWhen they arrived in Atlanta, Barnett plastered the photographs all over CNN's media lab, and began moving them around.\u000a\u000a"We saw that many photos taken by the same photographer seemingly started pairing themselves together." Barnett said. "In a very immediate and simplistic way I found this stimulating to look at, but wondered whether this meant anything."\u000a\u000aHe was intrigued by the prospect of presenting the photographers with an edgy new body of work they'd created with no conscious awareness of having done so.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Jerome Sessini were both surprised at first but the more they talked about their work, the more it became apparent how the pairings made sense. Paolo Pellegrin and Alex Majoli, the two other photographers whose work is showcased here, were shooting a project in a war zone and could not be reached for comment.\u000a\u000aTo others, the idea of this odd juxtaposition seemed unfair. Disturbing, even.\u000a\u000aKabul, Afghanistan, 2004. Kabul, Afghanistan, 2004. Paris, 2008. Paris, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"Appalling," said Sonya Fry, executive director of the Overseas Press Club, which bestows the prestigious Robert Capa Gold Medal for courage and enterprise in photography.\u000a\u000aShe perceived war as serious; fashion, not.\u000a\u000aStill, she found it interesting to compare the dynamics of the photos.\u000a\u000aThat someone had put them together fascinated Anne Tucker, curator of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston: "It's kind of ballsy," she said.\u000a\u000aLook at the photographs, she said. Take away the first three things you see. Perhaps the number of people. Or gender sameness. Or chaos.\u000a\u000aThen you begin to see other realms -- of coded clothing, body posture, the relationships of people to their environment.\u000a\u000a"Its total unexpectedness is its value. It ain't ho-hum," Tucker said.\u000a\u000a"My experience is that combat photographers are some of the smartest people I have met. They're not just interested in conflict photography. They are image connoisseurs. It doesn't surprise me that one would inform the other."\u000a\u000aIraq, 2003. Iraq, 2003. Paris, 2008. Paris, 2008. Photographs by Christopher Anderson/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aProvocative. That's how Stefano Tonchi saw it. The mastermind behind The New York Times style magazine, T, and now the executive editor of W magazine, has worked with combat photojournalists in many fashion shoots.\u000a\u000a"Not to say that fashion is not war," he joked. "But what is compelling about the images is the technique."\u000a\u000aIn both situations, the photographers must move fast, quick to make decisions about light and composition. They are used to catching a moment, capturing something people believe in.\u000a\u000a"I think there are more believers in fashion," Tonchi observed, "than there are in human rights."\u000a\u000aAuthor and documentarian Sebastian Junger admitted he knew nothing about fashion. But when he saw the war and fashion photos, he felt that perhaps the fashion world was a bit of a battlefield.\u000a\u000a"It makes the world of fashion seem kind of brutal and filled with conflict," said Junger, whose collaboration with the late combat photographer Tim Hetherington in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley resulted in the gritty film "Restrepo."\u000a\u000aKosovo, 1999. Kosovo, 1999. Paris, 2009. Paris, 2009. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThe fashion world for Junger is all about performance. The emotions are exaggerated, even fake. The gestures, for the most part, posed.\u000a\u000a"It's funny, in my eye. They all look like they're trying very hard to stand out, striking very aggressive, confident poses.\u000a\u000aNot different, perhaps, than a rebel fighter posturing in front of a camera, trying to appear invincible.\u000a\u000aThat's evident in Sessini's portrait of a fighter in Libya along the road to Ajdabiya in 2011.\u000a\u000aWar, too, said Junger, can be about performance. Only the anguish is real.\u000a\u000aAjdabiya, Libya, 2011. Ajdabiya, Libya, 2011. Milan, Italy, 2012. Milan, Italy, 2012. Photographs by Jerome Sessini/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"It's not how a photographer looks at the world that is important. It's their intimate relationship with it." The words of French photographer Antoine d'Agata synthesize the work of Sessini.\u000a\u000a"I would say shooting is conditioned by the attitude on the ground, the emotional connection with the subject. That is, my personal relationship," Sessini said.\u000a\u000a"When this relationship is strong, my eyes and my perception take precedence over the subject, whatever it is."\u000a\u000aThe difficulty for photojournalists lies in balancing truth with emotion, information with appearance. In the 2004 Falluja offensive, Sessini photographed two Marines who were clearing houses. They are shown sitting back to back on a metal bed in a house clearly ravaged by war.\u000a\u000a"I felt their fear. Very young and very scared. They were lost in this space, wondering what they were doing there," Sessini said.\u000a\u000a"That's what I tried to transmit -- the psychology of the soldiers. Anxiety, fear. No sense of purpose."\u000a\u000aIn another photo that Sessini shot just last September at an Armani show, two models appear backstage, back to back, wearing the same dress, their uniform of sorts. As with the case of the Marines, you cannot see their faces but Sessini captured the essence of their emotions with their pose. Lost in the middle of a big show.\u000a\u000aFalluja, Iraq, 2004. Falluja, Iraq, 2004. Milan, Italy, 2012. Milan, Italy, 2012. Photographs by Jerome Sessini/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000a"Showing expression most of the time, it's too easy," Sessini said. "A smile -- it's the first thing that you can see. If you search more, you can find something in the body or the posture."\u000a\u000aJunger saw the same mechanics in those two photos but took away two completely different stories. The two women didn't seem connected.\u000a\u000a"In fashion, there's some kind of implicit competition of who is the prettiest. In combat, it's the exact opposite. Those guys are completely connected."\u000a\u000aIt made sense to Junger that photographers focus on the same physical statements they make about individuals in fashion as they do in war. But the human form has limited focus points, the face being the most obvious one.\u000a\u000aPellegrin used the face, gesture and posture to get across two very different situations, said Tucker of Houston's fine arts museum.\u000a\u000aThere is a man with his arms outstretched in Tahrir Square and a model with her left arm in the air at New York's Fashion Week. The two images look similar. One emits rage, the other grace.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2004. New York, 2004. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThe anger in the faces of Egyptians protesting the rule of Hosni Mubarak in Cairo's Tahrir Square is evident in Paolo Pellegrin's 2011 photo. His shot of four models at Fashion Week in New York in 2005 is composed and framed in very much the same vein. Only this time, audiences come away with a look of speculation.\u000a\u000aAnother Pellegrin photo shows a man with his face covered, running during the anti-Mubarak protests. Next to it is a Paul Smith model running through brush in a corseted skirt.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. Paris, 2010. Paris, 2010. Photographs by Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aThere's no mistaking the circumstances in which each subject is running. The model is wearing high heels and holding up a black bag. Her jaunt lacks desperation. The man, perhaps, is running for his life.\u000a\u000aWar and fashion. Opposite worlds?\u000a\u000aYes, of course.\u000a\u000aA photographer is not likely to be injured or killed at backstage Balenciaga. But take away the danger element and to Anderson, much of it feels the same.\u000a\u000aTo get through the logistics, to be able to position yourself just right is as difficult at Armani as it is in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a"You have to anticipate where you need to be so that when things unfold you're reacting to what's in front of you," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aBoth situations are uncontrolled. If you click too late, you've missed the drama of the moment.\u000a\u000aAnderson sees the same sensibility in all his photographs. The same person behind every frame.\u000a\u000aHe no longer shoots war. At a certain point, he believes, he was playing with statistics.\u000a\u000a"From a creative standpoint, I don't know what else to say about war."\u000a\u000aBut the thing is, there is beauty in war. Powerful beauty.\u000a\u000aTo understand it, you have to first understand war's ugliness.\u000a\u000a"The volume is turned up in war," Anderson said. "If it's beautiful, it's more beautiful. The ugly is uglier."\u000a\u000aIn war, you look for beauty of the human spirit. In a single gesture. Or act.\u000a\u000aCairo, 2011. Cairo, 2011. New York, 2009. New York, 2009. Photographs by Alex Majoli/Magnum Photos\u000a\u000aFor many combat photographers, fashion is the tougher subject in that it is less familiar. Pellegrin, in a 2010 interview with Reuters, said this about fashion: "It's a world I do not frequent or know well. But I did not want to dismiss it as superficial. There is a lot of talent and creativity in fashion. I came with respect and wanting to discover a world I knew not so much about."\u000a\u000aStrangely, shooting war is sometimes less complicated, from a purely artistic standpoint. There is so much that is happening in front of you, Sessini said. It's easier to tell an extraordinary tale than craft one from the ordinary.\u000a\u000a"For me, war photography is easier," he said. "The thing happens in front of you. You just have to frame and shoot. It's very easy to get a strong picture. At Fashion Week, it's much more difficult. You have to work, you have to find something different and find your own vision."\u000a\u000aShooting fashion was a challenge for Sessini. "I can feel stressed in the same way in Falluja that I feel in Milan."\u000a\u000aSessini found my questions interesting. No one had asked them before. He, too, had never studied his photos of war and fashion next to one another.\u000a\u000aWhen you have a vision of the world, it comes through in your work, he supposed. That is true whether in war or fashion.

The founders say the luggage startup recorded sales of $12 million in its first year.\u000a\u000aThe founders put Away's early success down to its team of 41 tech-savvy millennials and their love of photo sharing app Instagram.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot of people on our team who were coming of age when Instagram came out, so we've definitely learned from them that brand discovery and shopping through Instagram is an important part of how they find things," said Korey.\u000a\u000aWhat makes the perfect suitcase?\u000a\u000aAfter spending months interviewing hundreds of travelers, Korey says the team were able to create luggage that helps take the hassle out of any journey.\u000a\u000aAway suitcases have impenetrable and "unbreakable" shells, says Korey, USB ports that can charge devices, interior compression systems that save space, and wheels designed to provide the smoothest, 360-degree roll.\u000a\u000aRelated: Airline electronics ban: What you need to know\u000a\u000aPrices start at $225 for its carry on model, which includes a battery that can charge an iPhone five times.\u000a\u000aTravelers seem to like the formula. Away sold over 50,000 suitcases in its first year of business.\u000a\u000aBut Korey and Rubio, who met when they worked for eyewear unicorn Warby Parker, have bigger ambitions.\u000a\u000a"We don't think of ourselves as a luggage company at all and we very strongly view ourselves as a travel brand. For us it's all about how can we make travel more seamless," Korey says.\u000a\u000aAccording to the founders, investors include Forerunner Ventures, the original Warby Parker backers, Andy Dunn from menswear firm Bonobos, and Brian Lee from The Honest Company.\u000a\u000aLondon, New York, Los Angeles?\u000a\u000aAway plans to expand into accessories. It also wants to start a travel website with tips and recommendations.\u000a\u000aThe company has one retail store in New York's Soho, but it has also tested pop ups in Los Angeles, London and Berlin. Encouraged by the strong start, the firm is now looking at permanent stores in Los Angeles and London.\u000a\u000aKorey says the company has grown a lot faster than they expected. But they're very careful about who they hire, despite the intense workload.\u000a\u000a"It's going to be worth it to wait for that person who is truly aligned with this vision for creativity and execution and teamwork," Korey says.\u000a\u000aCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Jay Z as a direct investor of Away.

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation .\u000a\u000a(CNN) Mounting evidence suggests that the richer and more diverse the community of microbes in your gut the lower your risk of disease. Diet is key to maintaining diversity and was strikingly demonstrated when an undergrad student went on a McDonald's diet for ten days and after just four days experienced a significant drop in the number of beneficial microbes.\u000a\u000aYour gut microbiome is a vast community of trillions of bacteria that has a major influence on your metabolism, immune system and mood. These bacteria and fungi inhabit every nook and cranny of your gastrointestinal tract, with most of this 1kg to 2kg "microbe organ" sited in your colon (the main bit of your large intestine).\u000a\u000aWe tend to see the biggest diet-related shifts in microbes in people who are unhealthy with a low-diversity unstable microbiome. What we didn't know is whether a healthy stable gut microbiome could be improved in just a few days. The chance to test this in an unusual way came when my colleague Jeff Leach invited me on a field trip to Tanzania, where he has been living and working among the Hadza, one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer groups in all of Africa.\u000a\u000aMy microbiome is pretty healthy nowadays and, among the first hundred samples we tested as part of the MapMyGut project, I had the best gut diversity -- our best overall measure of gut health, reflecting the number and richness of different species. High diversity is associated with a low risk of obesity and many diseases. The Hadza have a diversity that is one of the richest on the planet\u000a\u000aThe research plan was devised by Jeff who suggested I should have an intensive three days of eating like a hunter gatherer during my stay at his research camp. I would measure my gut microbes before heading to Tanzania, during my stay with the Hadza, and after my return to the UK. I was also not allowed to wash or use alcohol swabs and I was expected to hunt and forage with the Hadza as much as possible -- including coming in contact with the odd Hadza baby and baboon poo lying about.\u000a\u000aTo help us record the trip I was accompanied by Dan Saladino, the intrepid presenter and producer of BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme , who was preparing a Hadza microbe special.\u000a\u000aAfter a long tiring flight to Mount Kilimanjaro Airport in Tanzania, we stayed overnight in Arusha, a city in the north of the country. Before setting off the next morning, I produced my baseline poo sample.\u000a\u000aAfter an eight-hour journey in a Land Rover over bumpy tracks, we arrived. Jeff beckoned us to the top of a huge rock to witness the most amazing sunset over Lake Eyasi. Here, within a stones throw of the famous fossil site of Olduvai Gorge and with the stunning plains of the Serengeti in the distance, Jeff explained that we were never going to be closer to home as a member of the genus Homo, than where we were standing at that moment.\u000a\u000aThe million-year-old diet\u000a\u000aThe Hadza seek out the same animals and plants that humans have hunted and gathered for millions of years. Importantly, the human-microbe tango that played out here for aeons probably shaped aspects of our immune system and made us who we are today. The significance of being in Hadza-land was not lost on me.\u000a\u000aUnlike the Hadza, who sleep around the fire or in grass huts, I was given a tent and told to zip it up tight as there were scorpions and snakes about. I had to be careful where I stepped if I needed a nocturnal pee. After an interesting but restless night's sleep, a large pile of baobab pods had been collected for my breakfast.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Wodaabe, Gerewol \u2013 At the end of the rainy season near Lake Chad, northern Niger, Wodaabe people come together for Cure Salee, the "Festival of Nomads." At the center of celebrations is Gerewol, a male beauty contest and courtship ritual. Young men -- traditionally herdsmen -- wear full makeup, jewelry and their finest clothes and stand in line to await inspection by female onlookers. White teeth and white eyes are highly prized, so participants will grin broadly and pull all manner of expressions in the hope of attracting attention. It's flirtation en masse, in the hope of winning a night of passion with one of the judges.

Once the hole is big enough the first of a succession of ornamental ceramic saucers are inserted, stretching it over a period of years -- one example from the neighboring Surma tribe measured Circular lip plates called dhebi a tugion are worn by some Mursi women near Jinka in Ethiopia's Omo Valley. They are one of the few tribes that continue the practice in East Africa, but archaeologists have discovered lip plates in the region stretching back 30,000 years, says anthropologist Dr Jerome Lewis of University College London. "It's a body modification that people find beautiful," he says. "It's also very striking and a distinctive way of marking your difference from other people around you."The bottom lip is pierced with a wooden peg inserted, which is replaced with larger pegs thereafter. Once the hole is big enough the first of a succession of ornamental ceramic saucers are inserted, stretching it over a period of years -- one example from the neighboring Surma tribe measured 19.5cm wide Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Himba, otjize \u2013 Women of the semi-nomadic Himba tribe in northern Namibia are famous for their reddish hair and complexion. It's the result of otjize, a paste of butter, fat and red ocher, applied daily to their hair and skin. It was once speculated that the otjize served as a form of sun protection and to ward off insects, however the women say it's purely for aesthetic reasons -- which makes sense, given that Himba men don't take part in the practice. Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Hamar, bull jumping \u2013 Herdsmen become hurdlers in the Omo Valley, Ethiopia. Young men of the Hamar tribe, one of many in the valley, prove their manhood by jumping on prize bulls and then running across their backs -- all while naked. The purpose? It's a coming of age ceremony, and only when the participant has traversed the bull run four times will he be allowed to marry. Slip and you risk a hard fall: "Because it's a manhood initiation ritual, [failure] is likely to affect the perception of someone's manhood and that of course can have all sorts of dire consequence," adds Dr Lewis. Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Xhosa, Ulwaluko \u2013 In Eastern Cape, South Africa, young Xhosa men take part in a coming of age initiation called Ulwaluko. The youths, known as abakhwetha, are first circumcised without anesthetic, before being sent away from their village and into the bush, with minimal supplies and wrapped in a blanket. Wearing white clay on their faces, initiates will fend for themselves for up to two months, living in a structure built by the village's adult community specifically for Ulwaluko. Upon their return they are no longer referred to as "boy" and receive a new blanket. The initiation has not been without its criticisms, due to complications and malpractice surrounding the circumcision process. Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Chewa, matriarchy \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOne thing Chewa women are shut out of is the Women of the Chewa tribe may not be quite on equal footing as men, but they do hold the key to one thing: inheritance. Descent and succession for the Bantu-speaking tribe, spread across Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique, is matrilineal, with property and land inherited from their mothers. "Although inheritance passes down the female line, which definitely gives women more power in society, it's still male-dominated and patriarchal in the sense that men are still at the apex of power," explains Lewis. "People have an assumption that matrilineal societies are somehow favorable to women -- and they are certainly more favorable than some of the extreme patrilineal societies -- but they're not societies that give women equal power."One thing Chewa women are shut out of is the Nyau brotherhood (pictured), a secretive society who can channel spirits and performs a ritual dance called Gule Wamkulu around harvest and at weddings and funeral. Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Maasai, spitting \u2013 Spittle is an essential part of life for the Maasai of East Africa, as it acts as a blessing. "People have different views about where the power and essence of somebody resides," explains Lewis. For some, "spit represents an essence of you as a person."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTo spit is "a way of blessing people by giving something of yourself; your own power to someone else." It starts at an early age, when newborn babies are spat on to wish them a good life. "If you leave a place, elders will come and spit on your head in order to bless your departure, and that whatever you do you're safe and kept well," adds Lewis. Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: San, healing dance \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLewis says that this tradition is under threat: "In some places in southern Africa the San now perform their traditional culture exclusively for tourists, because they've been forced out of all their territories as hunter-gatherers by conservationist organizations. This means that by extension... these performances are not the original initiations but a facsimile of them." The San of South Africa, Botswana, Angola and Namibia are, according to some researchers, the world's oldest people . Their hunter-gatherer culture stretches back tens of thousands of years, and integral to it is the trance dance, also known as the healing dance. Historically an all-night affair, the practice brings the whole community together, led by healers and elders dancing around a fire, chanting and breathing deeply until they induce a trance state. It offers the chance to commune with ancestral spirits of the departed and for healers, cure sickness within other dancers.Lewis says that this tradition is under threat: "In some places in southern Africa the San now perform their traditional culture exclusively for tourists, because they've been forced out of all their territories as hunter-gatherers by conservationist organizations. This means that by extension... these performances are not the original initiations but a facsimile of them." Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Bantu-speaking tribes, lobola \u2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"It's the cause of much conflict," says Lewis, "because in order for a man to get married he must provide often quite a substantial head of cattle, and so he's in indentured labor to his father until the herd he's caring for is big enough." In societies that are cattle based, men tend to marry in their mid-forties, he adds, explaining that "there's always a backlog of women who are available but unable to marry" because men of a similar age have not yet raised the required bridalwealth. A feature of marital affairs for many Bantu-speaking tribes in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, lobola is practiced by, among others, Zulus (pictured). Lobola is also referred to as "bridalwealth", with the prospective groom's family negotiating with the bride's for her hand in marriage. The dowry comes in many forms, including money, but some choose cattle. There were reports in 1998 that Nelson Mandela (of Thembu lineage) paid the marital lobola of 60 cows to the family of new wife Graca Machel."It's the cause of much conflict," says Lewis, "because in order for a man to get married he must provide often quite a substantial head of cattle, and so he's in indentured labor to his father until the herd he's caring for is big enough." In societies that are cattle based, men tend to marry in their mid-forties, he adds, explaining that "there's always a backlog of women who are available but unable to marry" because men of a similar age have not yet raised the required bridalwealth. Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Tuareg, tangelmust \u2013 Tuaregs are the only tribal communities in which men wear veils instead of women . The tangelmust, a wrapped headdress up to eight meters in length, is ubiquitous among the "blue men of the desert." The name does not allude to the muslin headdress, dyed with indigo, but rather because the dye gradually leeches out into the skin of the wearer. Tuaregs use the tangelmust for practical reasons: it protects from the sun and sand, but men will still wear them at night, and even during meals. Men cover their faces with the tangelmust in front of strangers and women, while women are free to show their face. Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Bodi, Ka'el obesity pageant \u2013 Every June or July in the Omo Valley, Ethiopia, the Ka'el -- the Bodi lunar new year -- takes place. With it comes an extraordinary show of pageantry. In the months before the event men live in isolation and drink to excess a mixture of cow milk and cow blood for months in order to become vastly bloated and overweight. Each clan will then present an unmarried male to compete for the title of fattest man -- and with the glory, the greater chance of finding a wife. With stomachs swollen, balance and fatigue can be an issue, but once the event is over, contestants return to their normal size in a matter of weeks. Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Dassanech, recycled jewelry \u2013 "It's important to remember that tradition doesn't mean 'the same'," says Lewis, "cultures will adapt and add elements all the time." A perfect example of this is the Dassanech tribe, another group found in Ethiopia's Omo Valley on the border with Kenya. Rubbish of all manner, but particularly bottle tops, have begun to be recycled by Dassanech women, who weave the metal caps into vibrant jangly headdresses. Other women have adapted broken watches and trinkets for similar purposes -- and a sure fire way of getting yourself noticed. Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aThe baobab fruit is the staple of the Hadza diet, packed with vitamins, fat in the seeds, and, of course, significant amounts of fibre. We were surrounded by baobab trees stretching in the distance as far as I could see. Baobab fruit have a hard coconut-like shell that cracks easily to reveal a chalky flesh around a large, fat-rich seed. The high levels of vitamin C provided an unexpected citrus tang.\u000a\u000aThe Hadza mixed the chalky bits with water and whisked it vigorously for two to three minutes with a stick until it was a thick, milky porridge that was filtered -- somewhat -- into a mug for my breakfast. It was surprisingly pleasant and refreshing. As I wasn't sure what else I would be eating on my first day, I drank two mugs and suddenly felt very full.\u000a\u000aMy next snacks were the wild berries on many of the trees surrounding the camp -- the commonest were small Kongorobi berries. These refreshing and slightly sweet berries have 20 times the fibre and polyphenols compared with cultivated berries -- powerful fuel for my gut microbiome. I had a late lunch of a few high-fibre tubers dug up with a sharp stick by the female foragers and tossed on the fire. These were more effort to eat - like tough, earthy celery. I didn't go for seconds or feel hungry, probably because of my high-fibre breakfast. No one seemed concerned about dinner.\u000a\u000aHadza woman and child sitting at a fire, Lake Eyasi, Tanzania.\u000a\u000aA few hours later we were asked to join a hunting party to track down porcupine -- a rare delicacy. Even Jeff hadn't tasted this creature in his four years of field work.\u000a\u000aTwo 20kg nocturnal porcupines had been tracked to their tunnel system in a termite mound. After several hours of digging and tunnelling -- carefully avoiding the razor-sharp spines -- two porcupines were eventually speared and thrown to the surface. A fire was lit. The spines, skin and valuable organs were expertly dissected and the heart, lung and liver cooked and eaten straight away.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the fatty carcass was taken back to camp for communal eating. It tasted much like suckling pig. We had a similar menu the next two days, with the main dishes including hyrax -- a strange furry guinea-pig-like hoofed animal, weighing about 4kg -- a relative of the elephant, of all creatures.\u000a\u000aHarvested high from a baobab tree, our dessert was the best golden orange honey I could ever imagine -- with the bonus of honeycomb full of fat and protein from the larvae. The combination of fat and sugars made our dessert the most energy-dense food found anywhere in nature and may have competed with fire in terms of its evolutionary importance.\u000a\u000aIn Hadza-land nothing is wasted or killed unnecessarily, but they eat an amazing variety of plant and animal species (around 600, most of which are birds) compared with us in the West. My other lasting impression was how little time they spent getting food. It appeared as though it took just a few hours a day -- as simple as going round a large supermarket. Any direction you walked there was food -- above, on and below ground.\u000a\u000aMassive increase in microbiome diversity\u000a\u000aTwenty-four hours later Dan and I were back in London, him with his precious audio tapes and me with my cherished poo samples. After producing a few more, I sent them to the lab for testing.\u000a\u000aThe results showed clear differences between my starting sample and after three days of my forager diet. The good news was my gut microbal diversity increased a stunning 20%, including some totally novel African microbes, such as those of the phylum Synergistetes.

aVSeattle (CNN) Calling President Trump's decision to end DACA, "appalling," Sen. Patty Murray, the third-ranking Democrat in the US Senate, challenged Republican leaders to defy party orthodoxy by voting on a permanent legislative solution to help the children of undocumented immigrants who were brought the United States by their parents.\u000a\u000a"My advice to Paul Ryan is follow your heart," Murray told David Axelrod on "The Axe Files," a podcast produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. "I think that if he follows his heart and tells his Republican caucus 'those of you who can't vote with this fine, but we're going to bring it to the floor, and we're going to vote on it," he will get the votes for it," said Murray.\u000a\u000aMurray emphasized that fixing the problem was not an issue of having enough votes in Congress, but a question of Speaker Paul Ryan's and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's own willingness to lead their colleagues to do what she said they knew was right.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"I know that if they bring it up for a vote that we will be able to permanently pass the policy. This is going to take leadership. You know what, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell's problem is not the votes on this. It's the leadership. You have to be willing to say this is what's right for my country rather than 'I'm worried if I bring this up that I'll get voted out of my leadership position.' People want leaders," Murray said. "They want people to speak from their heart. They want them to do the right thing. They don't want them to play politics. And I think we've got the votes if we have two leaders who will bring it up."\u000a\u000aRyan has said he thinks some sort of compromise on DACA is possible , but has suggested the compromise would include border security measures as well.\u000a\u000aMurray noted that Ryan, who she had previously collaborated with on a long-sought, bipartisan budget deal in 2013, knew that Trump's decision to end DACA would have a significant human cost for the children of undocumented immigrants, who are often referred to as "Dreamers."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"He knows what's right to do here. He knows the impact this will have to children and families in our country.

aVKathmandu, Nepal (CNN) On the streets of Kathmandu, the sight of people begging for kidney treatment has become common.\u000a\u000aThe capital of Nepal is no different from many places in the world where aging populations, poor diets and no health insurance systems mean increased organ disease.\u000a\u000aThe organ in highest demand is the kidney and black market traffickers are meeting that demand. Up to 7,000 kidneys are obtained illegally every year, according to a report by Global Financial Integrity\u000a\u000aOrgan trafficking is an illegal, yet thriving trade around the globe.\u000a\u000aThat same report shows the illegal organ trade generates profits between $514 million to $1 billion a year.\u000a\u000aIn Kathmandu, we spotted a couple begging on the street for their son's kidney treatment.\u000a\u000aJeet Bahadur Magar and his wife spent their entire savings to treat their son's kidney disease.\u000a\u000aOut of money and options, they are now out on the street hoping to raise enough funds to cover the medical bills.\u000a\u000a"I pray to God that no one has to ever go through kidney failure problems," Jeet Bahadur said.\u000a\u000aBut many Nepalis do.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Watch the full documentary: Nepal's Organ Trail Replay More Videos ...

But now the numbers are being tracked.\u000a\u000aIn the last five years more than 300 people have been reported to be victims of kidney traffickers in this district alone, according to Forum for Protection of People's Rights , a Kathmandu-based non-profit human rights organization. Some activists say the number is much higher.\u000a\u000a"Social stigma and threats from traffickers keep many victims from coming forward," said Rajendra Ghimire, a human rights lawyer, and director of Forum for Protection of People's Rights.\u000a\u000a'The meat will grow back'\u000a\u000aNawaraj Pariyar is one of the many victims of kidney traffickers.\u000a\u000aLike many in Kavre, Pariyar makes a living from selling cattle milk and doing seasonal labor jobs on nearby farms.

Pariyar remembers asking the foreman.\u000a\u000aThe foreman assured Pariyar that nothing would happen. He was given good food and clothes, and was even taken to see a movie.\u000a\u000aThen he was escorted to a hospital in Chennai, a southern state of India.\u000a\u000aTraffickers assigned a fake name to Pariyar and told the hospital he was a relative of the recipient. The traffickers, Pariyar says, had all the fake documents ready to prove his false identity.\u000a\u000a"At the hospital, the doctor asked me if the recipient was my sister. I was told by the traffickers to say yes. So I did," Pariyar said.\u000a\u000a"I heard them repeatedly saying 'kidney'. But I had no idea what 'kidney' meant. I only knew Mirgaula (the Nepali term for kidney.)\u000a\u000a"Since I didn't know the local language, I couldn't understand any conversation between the trafficker and the hospital staff."\u000a\u000aPariyar was discharged and sent home with about 20,000 Nepali rupees -- less than one percent of the agreed amount -- and a promise he would have the rest shortly.\u000a\u000aHe never received any more money and never found the trafficker.\u000a\u000a"After I came back to Nepal, I had a doubt.

One bad harvest or a big medical bill can easily ruin families.\u000a\u000a"The main reason is poverty and lack of awareness. It is very easy for the traffickers to brainwash the villagers. Also, the villages in Kavre are close to the capital and are easily accessible," Ghimire said.\u000a\u000aIndian links\u000a\u000aTraffickers use proxies at different stages of the process. First, someone will approach the victim, another will create the donor's fake documents and then another will escort the donor to the hospital.\u000a\u000aFew hospitals in Nepal perform kidney transplants.

That's why they go to the hospitals in India," said Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle, Director of the National Kidney Center.\u000a\u000aBut activists have other explanations for the demand for Indian surgeries.\u000a\u000a"It is hard to cross-check Nepali records across the border, so traffickers prefer to take the donors to India," Ghimire said.\u000a\u000aWe noted, before any kidney operation can be carried out in India, the hospital requires a No Objection Certificate, a letter drafted by the Nepali embassy in New Delhi confirming the donor as the kidney recipient's relative.\u000a\u000aPhotographs of the recipient and the relative, who would be the legitimate donor, were not included in the letter until recently.\u000a\u000aSince Indian hospitals accept official Nepali documents, anyone could show up at the hospital, provide papers saying they were that person and have their kidney removed.\u000a\u000aActivists say this is the loophole traffickers used for many years.\u000a\u000aWith the easy availability of forged documents, traffickers can beat the system.\u000a\u000aWhile the Nepali government tries to tighten policies, Nepal's police officers are trying to crack down on the criminal rings.\u000a\u000aLast year authorities arrested 10 people accused of organ trafficking in Kavre. Their case is still in court.\u000a\u000aSub-inspector Dipendra Chand, who led the police investigation, says stopping the underground trade is difficult.\u000a\u000a"If we crackdown in one village, the traffickers simply move to another," Chand said.\u000a\u000aRajendra Ghimire says that the trafficking rings are now moving beyond Kavre.\u000a\u000a"We have reports that this problem is expanding into other surrounding districts as well," Ghimire said.\u000a\u000aThe attention to this problem is growing in Kavre.

aV(CNN) At least 32 people have died after the most powerful earthquake to hit Mexico in a century struck off the southern coast.\u000a\u000aThe magnitude-8.1 quake , which was felt as far as Mexico City and Guatemala City, was registered off Mexico's southern coast just as heavy rains from Hurricane Katia lashed the east. The epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean, some 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) southeast of the capital and 74 miles (120 kilometers) off the coast.\u000a\u000aPresident Enrique Peña Nieto said the temblor -- felt by about 50 million people across the country -- was the strongest earthquake Mexico has experienced in 100 years. In September 1985, a powerful earthquake killed an estimated 9,500 people in and around Mexico City.\u000a\u000aThis one hit late Thursday, when many people were asleep. The states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, home to about 9 million people, are located closest to the earthquake's epicenter. They are two of the most impoverished areas in Mexico, and were likely hit the hardest.\u000a\u000aTwenty-three people were killed in Oaxaca state, Gov. Alejandro Murat and the Foreign Ministry told CNN. Seven others died in Chiapas state and two died in Tabasco, local and federal officials said.\u000a\u000aLatest updates\u000a\u000a-- A red alert was issued by the US Geological Survey (USGS) PAGER system , which predicts economic and human loss after earthquakes. "High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread. Past red alerts have required a national or international response," it said.\u000a\u000a-- The USGS reported multiple aftershocks, including at least six with tremors measuring above 5.0 in magnitude.\u000a\u000a-- The quake had a depth of 69.7 kilometers (43 miles), according to the USGS, which makes it particularly shallow, said Jana Pursely, a staff geophysicist. That means more intense shaking.\u000a\u000a-- A tsunami was confirmed in Mexico, with one wave coming in at 3 feet (1 meter), according to a tweet from the National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Tsunami waves taller than 10 feet (3 meters) could hit the coast of Mexico, while 3-foot waves could reach as far as Ecuador, New Zealand and Vanuatu, it said.\u000a\u000a-- Mexico's army, marines and federal police were mobilized to respond, Peña Nieto said. "Civil protection protocols are activated, including the National Emergency Committee," he tweeted.\u000a\u000a-- About 1.85 million homes lost electricity, but 74% of them have had service returned, Peña Nieto said. Some people lack water service, and it may take 36 to 48 hours to get it back up and running.\u000a\u000a-- Toppled buildings could be seen on video shared on social media from the city of Juchitan in Oaxaca state, where a local councilwoman said co-workers were trapped in the municipal building. A hospital there collapsed, and patients were seen on another video receiving treatment in an open field.\u000a\u000a-- Four people may be trapped inside a collapsed hotel in Oaxaca, Oaxaca Civil Protection Director Amado Bohorquez told CNN.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Deadly quake strikes off Mexican coast Soldiers remove debris from a partially collapsed municipal building in Juchitan, Mexico, on Friday, September 8.

That was the beginning of her orphanage.\u000a\u000aUNICEF estimates that there are 3.7 million orphans in South Africa. About half of them have lost one or both parents to AIDS\u000a\u000a"I made a deal with God, promising to look after these children if he promised to provide me with the resources to take care of these kids," Mashale said.\u000a\u000aWord quickly spread. Soon after, another child was left at her doorstep. Then she got a call from a maternity hospital, asking her to pick up two abandoned babies. By the end of the year, "Mama Rosie" was caring for 67 children, all in her own home.\u000a\u000a"I didn't have the heart to turn anyone away," Mashale said. "Young girls and boys and babies were in every part of my house."\u000a\u000aSince then, her program has blossomed into a multi-faceted organization that takes up an entire block in Khayelitsha.\u000a\u000aShe and her group, Baphumelele -- which translates to "we have progressed" -- have provided various levels of care for more than 5,000 children in desperate need.\u000a\u000aCNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Mashale about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: The kids living at your center -- what types of situations do they come from?\u000a\u000aRosie Mashale: Most of the children who are placed here in our facility are orphans due to HIV/AIDS. Others have been abandoned. Many have been infected with HIV/AIDS or have other illnesses, such as tuberculosis and fetal alcohol syndrome.\u000a\u000aWe are taking very serious cases. We take emergency cases of vulnerable children who were abused. Some were found living in the bushes or in the dump. We have children who came here when they were a day old, and now they are young adults. They've been with us for all these years.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Rosie Mashale: Child-headed households Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Rosie Mashale: Child-headed households 02:20\u000a\u000aCNN: How do you help the kids once they age out of your organization's homes?\u000a\u000aMashale: Our Fountain of Hope program is for all the children who are above 18 to 21 years who have graduated from the children's homes. Remember, most of them are abandoned; they do not have parents. That's the reason that we are teaching them skills -- they learn how to plant their own vegetables, how to write their own resumes, work etiquette, computer training.\u000a\u000aWe are empowering them with living skills so that they can be independent. We mold all those children to prepare them for work and provide them with job opportunities. For others, we help them to finish their education.\u000a\u000aCNN: Your organization has evolved to address many different needs in your community. What are some other programs you've incorporated?\u000a\u000aMashale: We have a medical clinic for children and another facility for adults. We care for those who have HIV/AIDS and other chronic diseases, such as cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes, and (we) operate a hospice for children.\u000a\u000aWe also have an outreach program for child-headed households. These are children who are left without parents, who are being taken care of by elder siblings. We've got social workers who go out in the community and provide support for these children.\u000a\u000aWe've also started a bakery to make our own bread for the children, employ the older kids, and sell to the community to raise money for the organization.\u000a\u000aIt's also important to still have a daycare center. Most of the parents in this community are working and they can bring their children here, and you are assured as a parent that your children will be safe here.\u000a\u000aOur center now has become a sentinel of hope for the people of Khayelitsha. I always feel like I can do more.\u000a\u000aCNN: What are your hopes for these children?\u000a\u000aMashale: I always encourage them to be educated so that they can be something. Our wish is for them to progress in life.\u000a\u000aI would like to see some of them being the future president of this country. Some of them tell me that they want to be social workers; they want to do the work that I'm doing.

Britain's Royals may be a firmly 21st century brand these days, but this regal bunch still exemplifies an older time of tradition and ceremony.\u000a\u000aIf you wanted to wave a flag at Queen Elizabeth's 90th birthday celebrations and shed a joyful tear at the news that Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their third child, you are not alone. The world just can't seem to get enough of arguably the world's best-known aristocrats.\u000a\u000aThere's no better destination than London if you want to plug into the 1,000-year history of British kings and queens. The UK's capital has an array of palaces, museums and galleries open to the public including royal HQ Buckingham Palace and Kate and Wills' official residence Kensington Palace.\u000a\u000aYou simply won't get a proper taste of royal London without visiting at least one of these places. Who knows, you might even catch a glimpse of the Queen herself.\u000a\u000aGilded public rooms at Buckingham Palace\u000a\u000aBuckingham Palace has 775 rooms including 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms and 78 bathrooms.\u000a\u000aBuckingham Palace, the official London residence of the Queen and Prince Philip, opens to the public when the royals are on summer vacation.\u000a\u000aYou won't be able to nose around the whole palace (the Queen does live there after all, in private apartments on the north side). But visitors can admire sumptuous Regency interiors and priceless art in the State Rooms, where the royal family entertain the great and good.\u000a\u000aThere's more art from the impressive Royal Collection in The Queen's Gallery and fairytale carriages in the Mews.\u000a\u000aA Royal Day Out ticket (adults about $52, under 17s $29) gives access to all three plus a stroll in the gardens. An audio guide is included in the price.\u000a\u000aDropping $100 secures an exclusive evening tour of the State Rooms with a glass of champagne thrown in.\u000a\u000aOut front, try to catch the Changing of the Guard for a pomp-and-ceremony-filled spectacle carried out by soldiers in giant bearskin hats.\u000a\u000aBuckingham Palace , London, SW1A 1AA\u000a\u000aGothic grandeur and royal tombs at Westminster Abbey\u000a\u000aWalk the same checkerboard floor as Kate did on the day of her 2011 wedding to Prince William.

Lewis, Philip Larkin, Jane Austen, Rudyard Kipling and many more commemorated in Poets' Corner in the South Transept.\u000a\u000aA new museum and gallery called The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries is planned for 2018. It's being built in a medieval arcade 20 meters above the Abbey floor that's been hidden from the public for 700 years.\u000a\u000aFor the full lowdown on all the Abbey's wonders, download the nifty audio tour narrated by actor Jeremy Irons onto your smartphone before you go.

Queen Victoria was born here in 1819 and was given the news of her accession to the throne here 18 years later.\u000a\u000aWith successive monarchs spending lavishly on decor, the palace has come to be thought of as "fashionable." This was cemented in the 20th century when it was home to Princess Margaret, the Queen's late sister and a fashion icon in her day.\u000a\u000aIt's also where glamorous Diana, Princess of Wales lived until she died. The national outpouring of grief following her death in 1997 led to thousands of tributes and flowers being placed at the foot of the palace's golden gates. You can trace Diana's style evolution in "Diana: Her Fashion Story," an exhibition of her famous fashions.\u000a\u000aKensington Palace , Kensington Gardens, London W8 4PX; +44 20 3166 6000; Admission: Adults $20 (£15.50), Under 16s Free.

Many are still used by the Queen in ceremonies like the State Opening of Parliament. Look out for the "in use" signs.\u000a\u000aThere's lots for kids here too: statues of the royal animals, costumed tours, feeding time for the Tower's famous ravens and a multimedia guide specifically designed for children.\u000a\u000aTower of London , London, EC3N 4AB; Admission: Adults $33 (£24.80), Child $15 (£11.50), Under 5s Free.

You can see what the king feasted on in a working recreation of Henry VIII's kitchens and then wander though his Great Hall, where the banquets were eaten. Don't forget to visit the purpose-built chocolate kitchens. How's that for extravagance?\u000a\u000aHampton Court Palace , East Molesey, Surrey.

Not only is it the world's largest continuously inhabited castle, it's also the oldest.\u000a\u000aIt also happens to be one of the Queen's main residences -- she spends most of her private weekends here. The Royal Standard flies from the Round Tower when her Majesty is home.\u000a\u000aThere's lots to see and the castle is not actually in London -- it's in the upscale town of Windsor, also home to the UK's best-known public school Eton College -- so budget a day to travel and see everything.\u000a\u000aHighlights include The State Apartments used by the royals for official events and the delicate Gothic architecture of St George's Chapel where 10 kings including Henry VIII and Charles I are buried.\u000a\u000aIf you missed the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, you can see a version here, weather permitting during spring and summer months.\u000a\u000aQueen Mary's Dolls' House is a real don't-miss object: We know what some of you may be thinking, but this is an architectural marvel in miniature. It was created by British architect Edwin Lutyens (also known for his role in designing New Delhi) and features extraordinary attention to detail including running water and electricity.\u000a\u000aBecause this is one of the Queen's residences, some parts can be closed depending on the time of year.

On special occasions like the State Opening of Parliament, their plumed hats, colorful jackets and gleaming black horses provide a massive dose of pomp and ceremony as her mounted escorts.\u000a\u000aThe museum gives you an intimate look behind the scenes at what goes into the duties of over 350 years as bodyguards to the Sovereign.\u000a\u000aThe museum, although small, is filled with objects spanning that history: royal standards, ceremonial uniforms, Faberge silver and horse furniture including huge silver kettledrums.\u000a\u000aTwo mounted sentries are on duty daily and in a moment of genius someone built a glass screen between the museum and the stables so visitors can get an intimate glimpse of the soldiers at work with their steeds (Go for 10.45 a.m. and you can watch them prepping the horses for the Daily Guard Change on Horse Guards Parade).\u000a\u000aThe soldiers are also fully trained fighters and the regiment has served in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aHorse Guards Parade , Whitehall, London SW1A 2AX.

He famously lived here during one of his episodes of "madness" (thought by some to have been caused by a genetic disorder called porphyria), which was dramatized in Nicholas Hytner's film "The Madness of King George."\u000a\u000aIf you go, don't miss the miraculously well-preserved great kitchen, which is a sight to behold, as are the princesses' bedrooms, which display the pinnacle of interior design fashions of the Georgian era.\u000a\u000aVisitors can also check out the rustic cottage George's wife Queen Charlotte had built in the gardens, which the family used for tea and rests during walks in the grounds.\u000a\u000aNearby is a paddock, which among other things was used for breeding kangaroos as curious royal pets in the early 19th century. The palace is open from April to October each year.

aV(CNN) In a doctor's waiting room in South London sit three people of varying ages and ethnicities, waiting among a sea of empty green plastic chairs.\u000a\u000aIt's Tuesday afternoon in the Hetherington Group Practice, which serves more than 8,500 people from dozens of miles in every direction from its base in the bustling area of Brixton.\u000a\u000aAdorning the many notice boards on the walls are posters asking people to get flu vaccinations, to embrace more walking as part of their day to day and to speak up if they feel that they may have symptoms of bowel cancer.\u000a\u000aAnother poster informs that the Accident and Emergency room at the local hospital "won't kiss it better," appealing to people not to visit their local ER when something is not urgent.\u000a\u000aRecords from the National Health Service show that the numbers of people visiting an emergency room in England have risen from just over 4.5 million per quarter in 2004 to almost 6 million per quarter by the end of 2017 -- almost a 25% increase.\u000a\u000aThe "patient pod" at the Hetherington Group Practice allows those registered to monitor their vitals and their mood in their own time.\u000a\u000aIn the corner of the waiting room sits a "patient pod" consisting of a computer, a blood pressure machine and scale, for people to measure their vitals in their own time.\u000a\u000aThey can even monitor their mood by answering a series of questions about how they're feeling and what they're thinking. The practice has more than 230 patients registered with severe mental health problems, such as psychosis.\u000a\u000a"It's about managing demand," said Dr. Steve Mowle, one of the nine physicians at the practice and a spokesman for the Royal College of General Practitioners\u000a\u000aThis "pod" and the option of a phone consultation aren't the norm for all general practitioners' facilities but Mowle -- like any other GP in the United Kingdom -- has a budget to spend on his practice each year, based on a capitation, an amount paid from the government's budget per patient registered. He and his partners may use it how best they see fit to meet the multiple needs of their large patient base.\u000a\u000aDemand on the practice has increased significantly in recent years.\u000a\u000aUnusually, the rise is not in terms of patient numbers, which have in fact fallen, but by people living longer with greater numbers of increasingly complex conditions to manage. Each day, Mowle will have contact with 40 to 50 patients, he explained, with 60% of those in person and the rest through phone consultations.\u000a\u000a"My clinics are longer," Mowle said. A clinic represents a half-day of seeing patients and is meant to last three hours each. His clinics routinely last at least five hours.\u000a\u000aSteve Mowle works at the Hetherington Group Practice in London, contacting 50 patients, on average, each day.\u000a\u000a"Being a full-time GP is impossible," he said, adding that there is "more and more administration" on top of seeing patients.\u000a\u000aThe demographic of his patient base is as vast as the region the practice covers, ranging from the homeless, newly arrived refugees and blue-collar workers to high-earning middle-class and lawyers and bankers whose houses are worth millions. More than 140 languages are spoken locally.\u000a\u000aDespite their differences, the patients at this clinic -- and anywhere else in the UK -- have one thing in common: Not one of them will pay or receive a bill for the care they receive here.\u000a\u000aTheir health care is free and universal and has been since the formation of the country's National Health Service in 1948.\u000a\u000aThe population's health care is funded through tax and compulsory national insurance contributions deducted from income, which go toward many state benefits.\u000a\u000aBut as the demand for health care has increased across all levels of care -- primary, secondary and tertiary -- so has the strain on this once-coveted health system -- particularly on its finances.\u000a\u000aA changing climate for health care\u000a\u000aHealth care budgets in the UK have been plateauing, with only minor increases in spending, as percentages of gross domestic product spent on it have been declining.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Kings Fund, an independent health care charity, the National Health Service is halfway through its most austere decade ever. Figures from the World Bank reflect this: In 2009, the UK spent 9.8% of its GDP on health care; by 2014, it fell to 9.1%, according to the World Bank.\u000a\u000aAlong with this came more people, who are living longer and with multiple conditions like diabetes and heart disease that require treatments also rising in cost. Meanwhile, hospital bed numbers have fallen, numbers visiting emergency rooms have risen, and the demand for social care -- such as home care or equipment -- in the community has increased with limited services in place to provide it, again leaving more people with fewer hospital beds.\u000a\u000a"The current situation is unsustainable," said Dr. Ian Eardley, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK and practicing surgeon at a hospital in Leeds. "There are patients who are medically fit but can't get help in the community, or support, to leave hospital."\u000a\u000aAusterity has brought extended wait times for people seeking elective or routine treatments, such as knee or hip surgery, while emergency treatments for serious issues such as cancer or heart attacks continue to be treated promptly, as they should, according to Mowle.\u000a\u000aGuidance requires anyone in the UK with signs of cancer be seen within two weeks.\u000a\u000a"(But) you can't bring patients in for elective surgeries," said Eardley, who further stressed the complexities surrounding people living longer.\u000a\u000a"People often live longer with other medical problems being controlled and managed," he said, adding that greater expectations by patients today and the tendency to discuss cases in greater detail all add time and strain to an already overwhelmed system.\u000a\u000aAnother financial constraint is the increasing, but important, role of computing.\u000a\u000a"Most of these countries have seen a need for increased spending with changing technology," said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\u000a\u000aReal National Health Service spending in 2015-16 increased by just 1.6%, according to the Kings Fund.\u000a\u000a"The budget has been frozen for too long," McKee said.\u000a\u000aMore funding is needed, he said, to decrease the debt owed by hospitals whose budgets were not enough and to ensure a greater transition from care settings into the community.\u000a\u000aIs more spending better for health care?\u000a\u000aThe UK spring budget for 2017 announced last week pledged £2 billion ($2.5 billion) toward adult social care over the next three years to "ease pressure on the NHS."\u000a\u000a£425 million ($525 million) was also announced to be invested in the NHS in the next three years, with £100 million ($125 million) going to Accident and Emergency departments in 2017-18, to help them manage increasing demand.\u000a\u000aExperts like McKee and Eardley welcome the investment, but believe it will not be enough.\u000a\u000a"The UK is not exceptional," McKee said, adding that other countries have similar levels of health care coverage using a tax-based system, including Finland, Sweden, Portugal and Spain. "The broad model of tax-based funding is common in quite a few countries."\u000a\u000aA recent report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (PDF) highlighted that, although access to care in the UK is good, the quality of care is uneven and continues to lag behind that of many other countries.\u000a\u000aMcKee also highlighted Germany and France, which spent 11.3% and 11.5% of their GDPs on health care, respectively, in 2014 and have more beds per capita, more doctors per 1,000 people and longer life expectancies\u000a\u000aGermany and France use a social insurance model to pay for their health care: Deductions are taken from income, but unlike in the US, everyone is covered, and companies don't make a profit. Those contributing also "own" the organizations involved through boards and unions, McKee said.\u000a\u000aPeople pay a fee at the point of care, though it's just $5 to $11 in Germany and $25 in France, which is often reimbursed.\u000a\u000aThe Western country spending the most on its health care is the US, which spent 17.1% of its GDP on health care in 2014.\u000a\u000aYet a series of factors -- such as a lower life expectancy and uneven coverage -- highlight that increased expenditure alone is not always a good thing. A system to manage it best is key.\u000a\u000a"The US is an outlier internationally," McKee said. "No one would say the US (model) is good ... for the population."\u000a\u000aTreatments and new technologies for conditions such as cancer often lead from the US, but the key issues are access and the varying amounts that could be charged as a fee to provide them.\u000a\u000aMcKee added that the private insurance-based model in the US, covering only those who are insured, leads to companies in the industry working toward profit. "This leads to more division and less universal coverage," he said.\u000a\u000a"If you have lots of money, you get good care," Eardley said about US health care. "If you don't have money, you don't fit into the system," he added, calling such a system "wasteful."\u000a\u000aExperts in the UK are eager to stress the cost-efficiency of the National Health Service. According to the Royal College of General Practitioners, the UK pays the least per patient than most countries in the West.\u000a\u000aIn comparison with the US, Europe's universal coverage, with tax- and social-fund-based financing through contributions, spends less and has more care that's better, according to McKee.\u000a\u000aMany countries on the continent still have a small sector of patients using private insurance. In the UK, an estimated 11% of the population has private insurance, often through their employers. In Germany, top earners can opt out of the public system and pay privately instead, representing an estimated 10% of Germans.\u000a\u000aAt the core of the debate around health care, money alone is not the issue; it's the model of care.\u000a\u000aWhat is health care?\u000a\u000a"Health care should be free at the point of delivery," said Dr. Richard Kerr, a council member of the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK and consultant neurosurgeon at a large regional hospital in Oxford. "There is a fee structure behind it, but when a patient comes to see me ... the issue of money never comes into it."\u000a\u000aKerr believes countries worldwide can learn from those on mainland Europe, such as Germany and France, where the population receives great care, in his opinion, with good quality but pays more for it through taxes. "They are taxed higher but have much more investigative health care," Kerr said.\u000a\u000a"We should look at the different models of health care and take the good aspects of it ... without getting rid of the basics of what we've got," he added. "But what you get for your buck is more here."\u000a\u000aWith the UK being more cost-efficient, he ponders whether that is something to be proud of. "If you receive the same level of care with less money," that is indeed a point of pride. But with patient waiting times up to 20 weeks in some cases, he added, that is not the case.\u000a\u000aThe neuroscience department at his hospital in Oxford is the regional hospital, a point of tertiary care where patients requiring specialist procedures are referred from their district hospitals. It serves more than 2.8 million people across a 100-mile radius, said Kerr, with just 60 beds in his main ward and another 13 in the intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aThe building is just a decade old, light and airy in design, but as he walks through the wards, he highlights the shuffling he and his team do on a regular basis between main wards and the ICU to ensure that all patients can access a bed and undergo their procedures.\u000a\u000aStaffers borrow beds between the departments, he explains, so spare beds in the ICU will sometimes be used for his less severe cases. But he shows further frustration with the lack of social care resources for patients away from his hospital, such as the provision of home carers or equipment to keep them mobile, or changes to make their homes more accessible or to help them access day centers. These are crucial, he believes, particularly as the population continues to live longer.\u000a\u000aNeurosurgeon Richard Kerr faces the challenge of bed shortages in his hospital in Oxford most weeks.\u000a\u000aBetween 2014 to 2015, 72% of more than 1.8 million new requests for social care support requested from councils in England were clients aged 65 and over, according to NHS data\u000a\u000aIn addition to keeping beds unnecessarily occupied, resulting in a "domino effect," he explains that "if a patient has social care needs, a busy environment (like a hospital) isn't the best place for them," he said.\u000a\u000aNeurosurgical procedures vary also greatly, with some patients needing just 24 hours to recover while others have stayed as long as 100 days.\u000a\u000a"We have to cancel patients at short notice sometimes," he said, not only leaving patients untreated but leaving surgeons unable to do their jobs.\u000a\u000aDuring this visit, Kerr is smiling, as for once, he has some beds going spare on his wards. He is ready for whatever comes his way. This is not the norm, he said.\u000a\u000a"There is pressure on us now, but this is not new," he said of demands on the wards and his outpatient clinics. "My clinic overruns. It always does ... so there's frustration there."\u000a\u000aBut Kerr wants to carry these realities forward and kick-start a debate to get the UK government investing more for even greater efficiency, enabling greater capacity to deliver care.\u000a\u000a"When I'm old and crumbly, I don't want to have to wait," he said, thinking of his patients. He and others in the field want reform or restructuring to get people discussing what health care is, as its meaning has changed dramatically since the National Health Service's inception.\u000a\u000a"We need a commission," he said, stating a need to push for patients, cross-party politicians, policymakers and medical practitioners to come together to define health care.\u000a\u000aMowle agreed, adding that the separation of "health care" and "social care" is no longer acceptable and is what has led to the fragmentation of services in the UK.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We need a debate asking, what do you want out of health care?" Kerr said. "Do you want to continue treating everything? Yes, you do, but we can't do it under the current financial envelope."\u000a\u000aCurrently within the health service, certain conditions are not covered -- such as more cosmetic procedures -- leaving some patients unsatisfied.\u000a\u000aThe need to identify what people on each side of the debate believe health care to be, and which aspects they prioritize, will help manage expectations as well as resources, Kerr explains, not only in the UK, but also more globally.\u000a\u000aHe believes this will lead to a happier and more satisfied patient base, particularly among those left behind -- either waiting in the UK or uninsured in the US. But it won't be easy.\u000a\u000a"Health care is incredibly complex. ... The growing number of older people with multi-morbidities are having very very complex trajectories through the health and social care system," McKee said. "We shouldn't underestimate the challenges."

aV(CNN) Caught between an ascendent China and an increasingly unreliable United States, Singapore's diplomatic future is at the heart of a debate on who really calls the shots in Asia.\u000a\u000aThe Lion City has historically had strong relations with both countries, an ally in Asia for Washington during the Cold War and one of China's first partners in their efforts to modernize their economy.\u000a\u000aOver the years Singapore has been very good at picking "the middle path" between the two superpowers, analysts tell CNN, balancing their positive relationships with both America and China.\u000a\u000aBut as new US President Donald Trump's attention drifts and Chinese leader Xi Jinping grows more powerful, Singapore finds itself in a tenuous position.\u000a\u000a"If anyone can do this balancing act, Singapore can," Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College London, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"If Singapore can't, no one can."\u000a\u000aThe mouse who roared\u000a\u000aJust seven years ago it seemed like Singapore's path was stable and secure.\u000a\u000a"We are in Asia; Asia is booming," Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an interview in 2010.\u000a\u000a"China is a big story and a major trading partner for us, but China is not the whole story ... America plays a role in Asia which China cannot replace, and nobody can replace."\u000a\u000aSingapore, which marks its National Day August 9, is politically and geographically unique.\u000a\u000aThe South East Asian nation, which is home to a majority ethnic Chinese population, is the only country in the world to have both English and Mandarin among its official languages.\u000a\u000aWith a population of five million, the Lion City is also a international financial hub and a fiercely free market.\u000a\u000aAs its neighbors have succumbed to successive waves of political and financial turmoil, Singapore has remained prosperous and stable.\u000a\u000a"It's a bridge between the West and the East," Wang Yiwei, professor at the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China said.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, hundreds of billions of dollars in exports and imports poured through Singapore's teeming waterways, consistently the second busiest container port in the world after Shanghai.\u000a\u000aPolitically, Singapore regularly punches above its weight. The city state was a founding member of ASEAN, the powerful grouping of south-east Asian nations including Indonesia and the Philippines, and since 2010 has often been invited to participate in G20 events\u000a\u000aCNN contacted Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan for this story but he didn't respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aPowerful friends\u000a\u000aThe country's power doesn't just come from its wealth but also from the powerful friendships it has made with the world's two largest superpowers.\u000a\u000aSingapore has close historic and military ties to the United States, forged during the Cold War when former leader Lee Kuan Yew took a firm stand against communism in South East Asia.\u000a\u000a"When the United States was fighting the Vietnam war, Singapore offered a place for US troops to come for their vacation, sometimes dock their ships and refuel their aircraft," Chong Ja Ian, associate professor at National University of Singapore's Department of Political Science, said.\u000a\u000aUS President Donald Trump and Singapore Prime Minister Lee meet at the G20 Summit in Germany, July 8.\u000a\u000aDespite Lee's firm stance against communism, Singapore was also quick to embrace China once it began to open up economically in the 1980s under then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\u000a\u000a"Singapore seized the opportunity for working with the Chinese ... in terms of friendship it blossomed very quickly, not just because of of the economic opportunities but linguistic similarities that made it a bit easier for them to enter the Chinese market earlier," Chong said.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, China's Xi demonstrated how highly Singapore sat in Beijing's estimation when he held a landmark meeting with then President of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou in the city.\u000a\u000aThe tactic paid off: China and the United States are today two of Singapore's largest trading partners, according to UN numbers.\u000a\u000aA full quarter of Singapore's exports, about $60 billion, are destined for China and Hong Kong while $30 billion of its imports flood in from the United States.\u000a\u000a"It's very natural ... Singapore is a very important international trade and finance center not only in China but also for other countries (in the region)," he said.\u000a\u000aBut in the past year, amid the rise of both Trump and an assertive Beijing, Singapore's position has become less simple.\u000a\u000aChinese President Xi Jinping (right) shakes hands with prime minster Lee during the G20 at Hangzhou in 2016.\u000a\u000a"China sees Singapore as being too close to America and there's a sense in which that's correct," said Michael Barr, associate professor of International Relations at Adelaide's Flinders University and author of "The Ruling Elite of Singapore."\u000a\u000aBarr said Singapore is uncomfortable with the unpredictability of President Trump, whose country the Lion State still relies heavily on for their ongoing security.\u000a\u000a"This is their dilemma. There is not a lot they can do about pulling back from America ... (but) they know full well that in the long term they have to orient towards China," he said.\u000a\u000a'Cranky bear in a small cave'\u000a\u000aAs with so much political wrangling in South East Asia, Singapore's problems began with the South China Sea.\u000a\u000aRelations between Singapore and China certainly haven't always been smooth. At an ASEAN meeting in Vietnam in 2010, incensed by discussions over the South China Sea, then-China foreign minister Yang Jiechi issued a warning to the Singaporean minister in attendance.\u000a\u000a"China is a big country and other countries are small countries, and that's just a fact," he said to the crowded room.\u000a\u000aSix years later, Singapore urged China to abide by a UN arbitration on the South China Sea, which was originally filed by the Philippines despite huge protests from Beijing.\u000a\u000aChina immediately plunged relations with Singapore into a deep chill.\u000a\u000aIn November 2016, nine of Singapore's armored troop carriers were impounded for two months in Hong Kong on their way back from Taiwan. It was widely seen as a slap on the wrist by Chinese authorities.\u000a\u000aBut the freeze showed China is fully willing to exercise its ever-growing regional and international power against countries who go against its interests.\u000a\u000a"China has reached the stage ... where they feel that they can dictate to smaller powers the relationship they will have with China, and if they wish to exercise levels of independence then China will decide how far they can go," Barr said.\u000a\u000a"It will be more and more like living with a cranky bear in a small cave."\u000a\u000aThe age of Trump\u000a\u000aIn the past, Singapore's strong security alliance with the United States helped temper concerns regarding China.\u000a\u000aBut that's no longer the case. "No one (in Asia) really knows what's happening in Washington," explained Brown.\u000a\u000a"Singapore are very aware they can't make any assumptions now, their assumption for the past 50 years is that keep close to the Americans no matter what. But now the big boys are acting in a very unpredictable way."\u000a\u000aThe new US president hasn't visited the Lion State but his Secretary of Defense James Mattis swung by in June for the annual Shangri-La Dialogue Asian Security Summit.\u000a\u000a"Once we've exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing. We will still be there," he said, pledging to stand by Washington's allies in Asia.\u000a\u000aBut experts have questioned whether the Obama Administration's highly publicized pivot to Asia would survive under President Trump.\u000a\u000aThere may also be stark policy disagreements between the two countries, on a topic they were previously in lockstep.\u000a\u000aSingapore is one of the world's staunchest defenders of the free trade, because without it the tiny city-state would not be able to exist.\u000a\u000a"Trump on his own has the capacity to take away any good and sensible reason for Singapore and most of Asia to maintain relations with the US," Barr said.\u000a\u000a"If he seriously goes down the path of closing down free trade, putting up obstacles, being an unreliable ally ... I can see not just Singapore but the whole of South East Asia lining up with China."\u000a\u000a'Singapore is not unique'\u000a\u000aSingapore is not alone in considering what Asia's future will look like with a dominant China and an inward-looking United States.\u000a\u000a"Philippines, Malaysia, all across the region there's been a real push (by Beijing)," Brown said. "Singapore is not unique, it's just because Singapore's been so adept at balancing (both sides)."\u000a\u000aOne of the first signs of a closer relationship between Singapore and Beijing would be any changes to their military exercises with Taiwan, a sensitive topic between the two countries, as China views it as a breakaway province.\u000a\u000aSingapore's famous Merlion (C) in front of the city's skyline in February, 2015.\u000a\u000a"I think there is an awareness that at the end of the day the relationship with China is so much more important than anything else, in terms of economics, so they might think of this as something of a tradeoff," Brown said.\u000a\u000aBut already Singapore's rhetoric has begun to change. In his Singapore National Day speech in 2016, Prime Minister Lee's language had come a long way from his 2010 interview, where he said China could never replace the US.\u000a\u000a"We are friends with both America and with China ... Both believe the Pacific is vast enough to accommodate both powers and President Xi said recently that America and China should "cultivate common circles of friends," he told his countrymen.\u000a\u000a"That is precisely what Singapore's trying to do."

aV(CNN) When it comes to Confederate monuments and reckoning with the past, America could learn a lot from Germany, says CNN's Fareed Zakaria.\u000a\u000aZakaria's comments came a week after violence broke out in Charlottesville, Virginia, when white supremacists and neo-Nazis held a rally to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E Lee. Heather Heyer , 32, was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters gathered to oppose the rally.\u000a\u000aThe protests reignited an ongoing national debate over whether the more than 700 Confederate memorials and monuments across the country should be removed.\u000a\u000aThe United States should take inspiration from Germany, a country that has gone through the "difficult national process of reckoning with its history," Zakaria argued Sunday on his show, "GPS."\u000a\u000a"The country has gradually come to accept a sense of collective guilt. It has not been immune to push-back and backlash. There have been far-right nationalist parties -- today, there is one called the Alternative for Germany -- but by and large the country has rejected its Nazi past," he said.\u000a\u000a"Anyone who uses the swastika or performs a Hitler salute in Germany faces potential prison time, and there are strict prohibitions against hate speech. Hitler's book Mein Kampf was not published in Germany for 70 years, until the copyright expired," he added.\u000a\u000aZakaria brought up the tens of thousands of "stumbling blocks," an ongoing Holocaust memorial project in which brass plaques are placed in the ground across Germany, each bearing the name of a Nazi victim who lived at that location.\u000a\u000aHowever, Zakaria noted, these memorials had not been greeted "without controversy."\u000a\u000a"The so-called stumbling blocks have offended some people, who say the Holocaust victims are being trampled daily, and the city of Munich went so far as to ban them," he said.\u000a\u000aBut this kind of debate, he insisted, was "healthy."\u000a\u000a"Wrestling with a country's history is not easy, and should not be easy," he said.\u000a\u000aAmerica, he said, was now "wrestling as well."\u000a\u000a"The South is still littered with monuments honoring, celebrating the people whose only claim to fame was that they marched and fought in mutinous opposition to the government of the United States because they wanted to defend slavery," he said.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, the CNN host noted, "there are relatively few memorials to the millions of slaves who were violently oppressed in these same lands."\u000a\u000aThat's why it's ironic to note that America is actually one of the reasons why Germany was able to confront its past so effectively, Zakaria argued.\u000a\u000a"When it occupied Germany after World War II, the allied powers prohibited the display of 'any monument, memorial, poster, statue, edifice, street or highway name marker, emblem, tablet, or insignia which tends ... to revive militarism or to commemorate the Nazi Party,' " he said.\u000a\u000aIn doing so, Zakaria said, the United States helped Germany show "that it could bury its militarism and Nazism."\u000a\u000a"The circumstances are very different, of course, but some of the lessons from Germany might well apply in America today," he concluded.

aV(CNN) Donald Trump's new best friends "Chuck and Nancy" probably shouldn't get too chummy with the President just yet.\u000a\u000aThat's because the political whiplash that Washington experienced with Trump's dance with Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proved that in the President's world, there are no permanent political friends, no permanent political enemies, just his own unpredictable interests.\u000a\u000aAnd if Democrats need further evidence of the fragile half life of Trump's political friendships, they might consider the cast of his pinballing political orbit, like Gary Cohn, Rex Tillerson, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus, all of whom have been up, down and sometimes out in his tumultuous eight months in power.\u000a\u000aStill, there's no doubt the President left Washington reverberating to its partisan roots. His deal with Democrats for a three-month extension to the federal borrowing limit was an astonishing snub to GOP leaders.\u000a\u000aAfter leaving Republicans -- who wanted an 18-month extension -- high and dry, Trump enthused about his Democratic partners, mooted a future deal on the fate of undocumented migrants brought to the US as children.\u000a\u000a"Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I," he said.\u000a\u000aThe way Trump makes connections\u000a\u000aIn retrospect, it's surprising that everyone was surprised.\u000a\u000aAfter all, it's long been clear that Trump is estranged from GOP establishment leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, impatient at their failure to advance his agenda.\u000a\u000aAnd he has a habit of developing a crush on political allies and aides, and then souring on them when they fail to match his exacting standards of loyalty.\u000a\u000aSo while a conventional President might have thought twice about humiliating the two Capitol Hill leaders who control the destiny of his political agenda, Trump probably didn't give it a second thought.\u000a\u000a"These relationships are completely transactional and there is no philosophical affinity required," said Michael D'Antonio, author of the book "The Truth About Trump" and a CNN commentator. "He has never had to agree with someone to use them. It's all completely opportunistic."\u000a\u000aBy jamming Republicans with a demand to pass a law to protect the so-called dreamers and by claiming a short-term win -- including billions in hurricane relief funding -- while snubbing his supposed GOP friends, Trump carved conservative divides much wider.\u000a\u000a"I would not be surprised to see President Trump become the first sitting President to run against a 'do nothing' Congress controlled by his own party," said Alvin Tillery, professor of political science at Northwestern University.\u000a\u000aTexas Sen. Ted Cruz saw this coming . While he was losing to Trump in the primaries, he predicted his foe would rush to do a deal with Democrats if he was elected President.\u000a\u000aBut Trump, who once told Americans he would do so much winning on their behalf that they would be sick of winning, has been desperate for a win after a threadbare first eight months as President.\u000a\u000aAnd the message from Wednesday was that if the GOP could not deliver victories for him, he would go looking elsewhere.\u000a\u000aSince he stormed the national political stage, it's been clear that in many ways, the notion of political friendships, permanent alliances and immovable principles are foreign to Trump.\u000a\u000aHe often looks like a third-party candidate tearing at the GOP from within. And it's pretty obvious he made a deal with Pelosi and Schumer because he believed it helped him at the time.\u000a\u000a'A different relationship'\u000a\u000aBy Thursday morning, Trump was on the phone with his two former Democratic antagonists, even as Republicans fretted he had played directly into their hands.\u000a\u000aThe most polarizing President of modern times, in a week in which he was denounced by Democrats as callous for sending 800,000 undocumented migrants into limbo , then declared a new bipartisan era had dawned.\u000a\u000a"I think we will have a different relationship than you've been watching over the last number of years," Trump told reporters. "I hope so."\u000a\u000aSince Trump seems rarely to plot five moves ahead as many Washington insider players do, it might not concern him that he's probably stacked up a huge political showdown for December, when the debt ceiling must be raised again, and with Democrats possibly ready to hold him hostage.\u000a\u000aFor clues about how Trump would behave, Republicans might have cast an eye at his White House, where advisers are often unveiled with hyperbole but where political fortunes often prove fungible.\u000a\u000aNot so long ago, Trump delighted in unveiling Cohn, his new top economic adviser and a wealthy former investment banker like a trophy at photo-ops.\u000a\u000a"You all know Gary from Goldman," Trump told manufacturing CEOs in February. "(He) just paid $200 million in tax in order to take this job, by the way ... But he's great."\u000a\u000aIn the Kremlinology of Trump's West Wing, Cohn was once seen as a guru for Trump.\u000a\u000aNo longer. Two sources close to the President told CNN Thursday his dream of running the Federal Reserve is sunk, after he criticized Trump's response to racially motivated violence in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aA GOP source close to the White House told CNN's Jake Tapper that Cohn is "more likely to get electric chair than Fed Chair."\u000a\u000aAnother fallen star in Trump's orbit, Bannon, turned the knife Thursday, telling CBS News that Cohn should have resigned\u000a\u000aSecretary of State Tillerson may be another faded Trump crush.\u000a\u000a"I have tremendous respect for him. He's a world class player," Trump told "Fox News Sunday" as he lined up Tillerson to be secretary of state.\u000a\u000aBut a GOP source told CNN's Jim Acosta this week that the President was souring at Tillerson's establishment style. "What change is he bringing?" the source asked.\u000a\u000aSince his election, Trump has damned supposed allies and foes alike with faint praise before turning on them.\u000a\u000aHe once described now former chief of staff Priebus as "one of the top Greeks in the country." Sen. Bob Corker was a "fantastic guy" until he got a Twitter lashing for questioning Trump's stability . Ryan was a "good guy." After leading birther conspiracies and before accusing former President Barack Obama of wiretapping him , Trump called him a "very good man" when they met in the Oval Office and the President-elect wanted to appear presidential.\u000a\u000aEach example has one thing in common -- all of those lauded were momentarily placed to provide reflected glory, praise or political advantage to Trump, just as Pelosi and Schumer were this week.\u000a\u000aThe two Democrats have been in Washington for decades and may have calculated that Trump was ready for a deal, any deal.\u000a\u000aBut McConnell and Ryan aren't exactly Beltway neophytes either. And Republicans are likely to remember what happened Wednesday the next time Trump comes to them and demands loyalty and a tough vote.\u000a\u000aThis time, the GOP just happened to be on the wrong end of the deal. Next time, it could be different and Pelosi and Schumer might get burned.\u000a\u000aBut now, at least, everyone knows how the President's mind works.\u000a\u000a"If you recognize you are dealing with this kind of creature and can work with what he gives you, then you might think 'OK, so he wants to win, he doesn't really care how he wins, and I don't think he is very discriminating about the prize,'" D'Antonio said.

aV(CNN) Building a resort in the middle of a forest is nothing new. But few can boast as many credentials in sustainability as this retreat in South America.\u000a\u000aLocated 950 meters above sea level in the Chocó-Andean forest of Ecuador -- a three-hour drive from the capital of Quito -- Mashpi Lodge is designed to blend seamlessly into one of the most biodiverse spots on the planet.\u000a\u000aAt the 3,000-acre (1,200-hectare) reserve alone guests can watch the club-winged manakin bird conduct its courtship dance, trek to 190-feet-tall waterfalls, climb an observation canopy into the treetops, or spot the Mashpi torrenteer frog species, discovered by a team of hotel scientists.\u000a\u000a"The idea is that you have a symbiosis with all that nature and you become part of the nature," Alfredo Ribadeneira, lead architect behind Mashpi Lodge, tells CNN.\u000a\u000aRooms cost around $1,200 per night, and the hotel also has restaurants, a spa and a boutique.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Rooms cost around $1,200 per night, and the hotel also has restaurants, a spa and a boutique.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge also runs a Life Center where guests can take a closer look at the abundance of local butterfly species.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Mashpi Lodge also runs a Life Center where guests can take a closer look at the abundance of local butterfly species.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge has a team of scientists who research and discover wildlife in the area, which is home to some 500 species of birds, as well as trees and frogs endemic to the region.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Mashpi Lodge has a team of scientists who research and discover wildlife in the area, which is home to some 500 species of birds, as well as trees and frogs endemic to the region.\u000a\u000aHousing 24 guest rooms, it sees more than 2,000 visitors a year, who are attracted by its unique position in the rainforest and abundance of activities designed to bring guests closer to nature.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Housing 24 guest rooms, it sees more than 2,000 visitors a year, who are attracted by its unique position in the rainforest and abundance of activities designed to bring guests closer to nature.\u000a\u000aThe lodged was designed to blend into the impressive natural landscape.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 The lodged was designed to blend into the impressive natural landscape.\u000a\u000aThe architects tried to cause minimum disruption to the local wildlife and natural environment when building the property.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 The architects tried to cause minimum disruption to the local wildlife and natural environment when building the property.\u000a\u000aThe idea was to create a retreat in the middle of the jungle, says lead architect Alfredo Ribadeneira.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 The idea was to create a retreat in the middle of the jungle, says lead architect Alfredo Ribadeneira.\u000a\u000aThe luxury eco-resort, which took two years to build, was constructed using sustainable techniques.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 The luxury eco-resort, which took two years to build, was constructed using sustainable techniques.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge is nestled in the midst of Chocó-Andean forest -- a three-hour drive from the capital of Quito.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge, Ecuador \u2013 Mashpi Lodge is nestled in the midst of Chocó-Andean forest -- a three-hour drive from the capital of Quito.\u000a\u000aAt one with nature\u000a\u000aThe man behind Mashpi Lodge is Ecuadorian entrepreneur, environmentalist, and former mayor of Quito, Roque Sevilla.\u000a\u000aThe idea was to make a bubble of comfort in the middle of the jungle. Alfredo Ribadeneira, lead architect\u000a\u000aA timber company had previously owned the site, which Sevilla purchased 11 years ago, to save the forest and its inhabitants. Two years of building work and $10 million later, the resort opened in 2012.\u000a\u000a"I think Mashpi Lodge is a very special case when it comes to the numerous eco-resorts around the world," Sevilla tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"(Protection of the area) is an ongoing effort and we're still working on purchasing more land so we can guarantee 100% protection from logging, agriculture and mining."\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge as seen from an observation tower built for guests.\u000a\u000a"The idea was to make a bubble of comfort in the middle of the jungle," explains Ribadeneira. "The real luxury is the possibility of being part of this web of life as a spectator."\u000a\u000aOn top of the network of logging roads that once covered the site the architects laid a grid of metal mesh tubes "encrusted in the land" to serve as the foundation of the property.\u000a\u000a"The time it took to make all the foundations was very long," Ribadeneira says. "In another place, you would just go and dig a hole and put down foundations -- and that's it."\u000a\u000aBut Ribadeneira and his team took great care to avoid disturbing the forest, where possible.\u000a\u000aFor example, the timber firm left behind a platform where lumber machinery had been stored. Ribadeneira decided to locate the hotel there: not only did it have expansive views, but it also didn't require trees to be cut down since the site's vegetation had already been removed.\u000a\u000a"If you walk around you're not going to see building debris," Marc Berry, the hotel's general manager, tells CNN. "We're very respectful of the forest."\u000a\u000aLost in the jungle\u000a\u000aVertical lines have been used throughout Mashpi Lodge to mirror the forest.\u000a\u000a"We tried to make all the vertical elements of the structure very slender and tall, aiming for a similar proportion to the trees nearby," Ribadeneira explains.\u000a\u000aMashpi Lodge's vertical structural elements are designed to evoke a feeling of being "lost" inside the jungle for its guests.\u000a\u000aAnother way of bringing the forest inside was the extensive use of glass -- there are floor-to-ceiling windows in the guest rooms, for example.\u000a\u000a"The glass reflects the jungle; the glass makes you see from the windows. This generates a magnificent relationship with the exterior," Ribadeneira adds.\u000a\u000aOne moment you are at ground level ... and the next moment you are practically inside the canopy of the jungle. Alfredo Ribadeneira\u000a\u000aFurthermore, the hotel was built across three floors to provide a layered view of the forest.\u000a\u000aThe ground level, where the entrance and communal areas are, offers views of two lateral mountain ranges.\u000a\u000aMost of the guest rooms take up the two floors above, looking out into the higher reaches of the forest.\u000a\u000a"One moment you ... are at ground level with bases of the trees very close to you -- and the next moment you are practically inside the canopy of the jungle.\u000a\u000aViews of the rainforest are visible at every turn from inside Mashpi Lodge.\u000a\u000a"The sensation that this generates is very interesting," Ribadeneira says.\u000a\u000aIn more practical sustainability terms, Mashpi Lodge has been running on hydro-electricity over the past year.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, 75% of the property operates energy efficient LED lights. The lodge sources its water from local rivers and treats it in a natural water plant on site, while used beverage crates are recycled to cover slippery paths.\u000a\u000aLocal villagers grow organic produce -- fruits and the heart of palm vegetable -- for the hotel's kitchen, reducing the property's carbon footprint.\u000a\u000aIf you build it, they will come\u000a\u000aRibadeneira admits that the building process was challenging.\u000a\u000a"Initially, when the hotel was not yet inhabited, the reflection of the jungle in the windows made the birds crash against the glass," he says.\u000a\u000aThe team leveled the windows in different angles so the birds wouldn't hit them.\u000a\u000aThe Cloud Forest surrounding Mashpi Lodge is teeming with wildlife.\u000a\u000aTransporting materials to the site and constructing the building was also difficult.\u000a\u000a"Normally, you would work with materials that are nearby. In this case, the place is so complex that it's very hard thinking about getting the materials there."\u000a\u000aI think people miss out this bit (in Ecuador) so this would be a lovely way to come and see it. Michael Bloy, Mashpi Lodge guest\u000a\u000aTo avoid disturbing the wildlife, the architects used small cars and lots of manpower, rather than trucks. Each sheet of glass was carried in. Parts of the property were built off-site and reassembled once they arrived.\u000a\u000a"You have to be very, very silent and you cannot go and have huge trucks and all those things," he explains, or else the wildlife the property wanted to showcase would have fled forever.\u000a\u000aSome parts of Mashpi Lodge were pre-assembled in Quito before taking shape on site.\u000a\u000aIndeed, an initial downturn in biodiversity proved unavoidable.\u000a\u000a"The animals went away -- but after a couple of years they were all back again," says Ribadeneira. "That was a very good thing."\u000a\u000aWith Mashpi Lodge receiving some 2,200 guests a year, it would seem that their efforts have paid off.\u000a\u000a"Ecuador has a lot to offer anyway, but this seems a little bit special in terms of how you can approach the cloud forest and how you can see a little bit more of Ecuador," guest Michael Bloy tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"People tend to think of Ecuador as the Galapagos or the rainforest. I think people miss out on here, so this would be a lovely way to come and see it."

aVEquifax is offering help for people whose personal information was hacked -- but there are big strings attached.\u000a\u000aThe credit reporting agency announced Thursday that the personal information of as many as 143 million people was compromised in a data breach between May and July. The stolen data includes names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers.\u000a\u000aIf your information was exposed, Equifax is offering free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring services. But the offer comes with some conditions that may make you think twice.\u000a\u000aYou can't get help right away. When people enter their last name and part of their Social Security number on the site to see whether they were affected, some are being told: "Based on the information provided, we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident."\u000a\u000aBut even in that case, Equifax is not offering the credit monitoring service until next week at the earliest. Monday is the first day you can sign up.\u000a\u000aYou could be giving up some of your rights to sue. At first, Equifax said anyone who gets the credit monitoring service, TrustedID, must agree to submit any complaints about it to arbitration. Those people wouldn't be allowed to sue, join a class-action suit, or benefit from any class-action settlement.\u000a\u000aAfter public pressure, Equifax added an opt-out provision on Friday. Customers can get out of the arbitration requirement by notifying Equifax in writing within 30 days of accepting the monitoring service.\u000a\u000aAnd Alex Southwell, a privacy lawyer at Gibson Dunn and a former federal prosecutor in New York, said the original rules still left room for people to sue Equifax over the original hack, even if they can't sue over the credit monitoring.\u000a\u000aRelated: The biggest data breaches ever\u000a\u000aThe federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently published rules against these kinds of arbitration requirements by banks and credit card issuers.

"We do not offer, provide, or furnish any products, or any advice, counseling, or assistance, for the express or implied purpose of improving your credit record, credit history, or credit rating," the company in its 7,200-word terms and conditions.

He is editor-in-chief of the journal "Tourism Culture & Communication."\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Golden temples, Mekong River cruises, mighty waterfalls, and nearly two dozen national parks.\u000a\u000aOn paper, Laos has it all.\u000a\u000aBut the land-locked Buddhist country welcomed only around 4.2 million visitors in 2016 -- a paltry achievement compared with its southeastern Asian neighbors.\u000a\u000aIn that same year, there were 32 million tourist arrivals in Thailand, 26.8 million in Malaysia and over 10 million in Vietnam -- all countries boasting long coastlines of gorgeous beaches.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile elsewhere in the region, Cambodia is famed internationally for its Angkor Wat "Tomb Raider" temples, and recently opened-up Myanmar is growing its tourism industry.\u000a\u000aLaos, it seems, just isn't on the radar for most international travelers headed to southeast Asia, aside from young backpackers.\u000a\u000aBut things could be set to change.\u000a\u000aA high-speed rail link between Laos and China expected to open in 2022 has poised the country for a game-changing influx of Chinese tourists.\u000a\u000aWhy visit Laos?\u000a\u000aCNN's Road to ASEAN visits the Mekong Tourism Forum in Luang Prabang to find out how this region is coming together through tourism.\u000a\u000aA former French colony, Laos retains the nostalgic charm of an earlier era -- note the stylishly restored villas in the historic Old Quarter of the former trading post and now capital Vientiane.\u000a\u000aUnlike the car-choked metropolises of Bangkok or Hanoi, Vientiane's low-key boulevards invite a walking pace with their wandering Buddhist monks.\u000a\u000aIt's the upside of Laos' undeveloped economy: Vientiane's status as national capital hasn't prompted the frenzied high-rise construction that has been evident in Ho Chi Minh City. The motorbikes are there but, somehow, with less intensity.\u000a\u000aIn addition to its heritage, Laos also offers mystique.\u000a\u000aThe so-called Plain of Jars sees clusters of giant Iron Age stone structures scattered across the hillsides around Phonsavan, in Northern Laos. Nobody knows who created them or why, although theories abound.\u000a\u000aThat the bizarre jars have survived is itself a miracle. The area was heavily bombed by America during the Vietnam War and only a few are today open to the public while unexploded cluster bombs are cleared.\u000a\u000aBut the quintessential Laos postcard scene is probably Luang Prabang.\u000a\u000aSet in the mountains of Central Laos, the ancient town -- named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995 -- is the former home of the Royal Palace and capital of a kingdom of the same name.\u000a\u000aTrouble in paradise\u000a\u000aLaos' main problem is its lack of the three Ss -- sun, sand and sea.\u000a\u000aThe country is making a bold attempt to overcome this natural deficit by becoming the first foreign country using Chinese technology, equipment and investment to connect with that giant nation's domestic fast and vast rail network.\u000a\u000aVietnam and Myanmar will eventually be connected to China's rail network, too, but Laos looks likely to be the first to do so using Chinese technology. Critically, that means Laos and China will have a common rail gauge on both sides of the border making traveling between the two countries seamless.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, if all goes as planned, Laos will be the first stop on one route of the Pan-Asia Railway, which aims to connect China with all of Southeast Asia, with trains traveling at speeds of up to 125 miles per hour, carrying both passengers and cargo.\u000a\u000aThe route from Kunming to Singapore will take just 10 hours.\u000a\u000aLaos' flight connections with China are improving, too. A direct link operated by Sichuan Airlines launched between Kunming and Vientiane in May, while a Hainan Airlines route to Haikou, the capital of Hainan Island, began last year.\u000a\u000aKeeping its cool\u000a\u000aTo be a tourism powerhouse, Laos will need to welcome Chinese, and other, tourists without sacrificing its unique, peaceful atmosphere.\u000a\u000aIt would do well to learn from the mistakes of its neighbors.\u000a\u000aIn Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, for example, the local tourist authority had to create etiquette pamphlets to educate visitors on how to respect the local culture and temples, in response to incidents involving Chinese nationals in 2015.\u000a\u000aLaos also needs better facilities -- a change that's already underway.

aVMartha Cheng, CNN \u2022 Updated 8th September 2017\u000a\u000aHonolulu (CNN) \u2014 From Sweetfin Poke in Santa Monica to Sons of Thunder in New York , poke restaurants are all the rage across the continental United States.\u000a\u000aBut in Hawaii , where this chopped, raw fish dish originated, locals have been enjoying poke for decades.\u000a\u000aPoke (pronounced POH-kay) is as much a staple in Hawaii as hamburgers are throughout the rest of the US mainland, found in supermarket delis and high-end restaurants, at family events and tailgate parties, and at potlucks and pau hana (after-work gatherings).\u000a\u000aIts roots go back to the native Hawaiian preparation of chopped fish, seasoned with sea salt dried in the sun; limu (seaweed), giving it another layer of texture and flavor; and inamona (roasted and crushed kukui nut, or candlenut), lending an oily richness.\u000a\u000aBut it wasn't until the 1970s, when advanced fishing techniques made deep-sea fish like tuna more accessible, that the dish really gained popularity. That's when poke, a Hawaiian word that simply means to slice or cut crosswise into pieces, came to be associated with the dish we know now.\u000a\u000aCookbook author Martha Cheng\u000a\u000aToday's poke has evolved with Hawaii's multicultural influences, a result of the Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Filipino plantation workers brought to the Hawaiian islands to work the sugar and pineapple fields in the 19th century.\u000a\u000aThe most popular poke these days is cubed, raw tuna tossed with soy sauce, sesame oil, raw onions, scallions and red chilies, but Hawaii's seafood counters offer plenty of variety.\u000a\u000aFlavorings may include wasabi, spicy mayo, kimchi or oyster sauce, and the seafood ranges from salmon to clams to raw, chopped crab -- shell and all.\u000a\u000aPoke doesn't even have to be raw.\u000a\u000aLegendary poke chef Sam Choy makes a fried poke, transforming yesterday's poke into today's fought-over leftovers. The dish stretches even beyond seafood these days, with tofu or vegetable poke right at home alongside ahi.\u000a\u000aWhile poke is on the menu at white tablecloth restaurants around the state, locals favor the cramped hole-in-the-wall joints where you'll have to fight for a seat (if there are any). Best to take your poke to go and head to the nearest beach.\u000a\u000aCheng's cookbook.\u000a\u000aOver the past 11 years of living and working in Hawaii and writing a poke cookbook , I've tried dozens of places in the search for the perfect poke. Here are some of my favorites:\u000a\u000aAhi Assassins, Honolulu, Oahu\u000a\u000a"Slayed. Weighed. Filleted. MADE in Hawaii," is Ahi Assassins' slogan, referring to its poke made with locally caught fresh tuna. (In an effort to keep costs down, many places use tuna\u2014frozen and gassed with carbon monoxide to preserve its color\u2014from Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries.)\u000a\u000aTucked in the top corner of a two-story office complex near the University of Hawaii, this takeout-only spot isn't easy to find. Look for the colorful fishing flags on the balcony.\u000a\u000aIt's worth the search. You'll find a half dozen varieties of impeccably fresh poke displayed in the refrigerated case, from one seasoned simply with inamona and chili to the Lunatic, a slightly sweet, garlicky hot sauce paired with cool fish.\u000a\u000aAhi Assassins , 2570 S. Beretania St., Honolulu (808) 439-4045\u000a\u000aOno Seafood, Honolulu, Oahu\u000a\u000aA new, bright red paint job makes this tiny shop stuck to the side of an apartment building a lot easier to spot than it used to be. This is one of Honolulu's most popular spots for poke, and with good reason.\u000a\u000aThe fish is always fresh and on the fattier side, and the eight varieties of poke are tossed to order, which lets the fish shine. Try the popular shoyu ahi, slicked in sesame oil and a gingery soy sauce, or Hawaiian style, with coarse salt and crunchy limu (seaweed).\u000a\u000aOno Seafood, 747 Kapahulu Ave., Apt 4, Honolulu (808) 732-4806\u000a\u000aMaguro Brothers, Honolulu, Oahu\u000a\u000a"We know great tuna," says Junichiro Tsuchiya, one of the brothers of Maguro Brothers ("maguro" is Japanese for tuna). He used to work at Tokyo's Tsukiji Market as a fish buyer, picking out fresh fish every day.\u000a\u000aAt this little fish counter in a marketplace in the heart of Honolulu's Chinatown or at its brand-new Waikiki location, you'll see Tsuchiya or his brother, Ryojiro, breaking down ruby red tuna into cubes and meticulously mixing poke to order. Try the novel ume (pickled plum) and shiso (an herb that tastes like basil and mint) poke, a bright pairing of salty and tangy.\u000a\u000aMaguro Brothers, 1039 Kekaulike Street #113, Honolulu, (808) 259-7100 and 421 Lewers Street, Honolulu, (808) 230-3470\u000a\u000aIshihara Market, Waimea, Kauai\u000a\u000aThis family-owned market has been around since 1934 and is a favorite on the west side for its bentos, lunch specials, and poke -- over two dozen varieties pre-mixed and sold by the pound.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the ever-popular ahi shoyu poke, try the spicy lobster poke, kimchee clams, shell and all; a buttery hamachi poke; and wasabi tako, made with raw octopus.\u000a\u000aIshihara Market, 9894 Kaumualii Hwy, Waimea (808) 338-1751\u000a\u000aTin Roof, Kahului, Maui\u000a\u000aTop Chef contestant Sheldon Simeon opened Tin Roof, sandwiched between a gallery and payday loan business, serving a short menu that reads like a "best of" list of Hawaii's favorite comfort food.\u000a\u000aAmong the items: a poke bowl, where the fish depends on what's available that day and the preparation based on what Simeon feels like at the moment.\u000a\u000aMost often, it's the spicy ahi, with a house-made mayo, masago (tiny, crunchy capelin roe) and a furikake crumble, but you might also find salmon poke seasoned with oyster sauce or cooked tako (octopus) mixed with kimchi.\u000a\u000aTin Roof , 360 Papa Place Suite Y, Kahului, (808) 868-0753\u000a\u000aSuisan Fish Market, Hilo, Hawaii (Big Island)\u000a\u000aIn 1907, a group of immigrant Japanese fishermen and peddlers pooled their money together to start a fish auction and market so they'd have a central place to sell their fish.\u000a\u000aMore than a century later, Suisan, located on a little peninsula jutting into Hilo Bay, is still one of the main spots on the Big Island where fishermen sell their catch, and the result is sparkling fresh poke next door.\u000a\u000aUnique to Suisan is the Kohala mix poke, like a treasure chest of Hawaii's sea, with uhu (parrotfish, the bright fish you see when snorkeling), he'e (octopus) and opihi (limpet).\u000a\u000aIf you get here early, between 4 a.m and 11 a.m., you might see fishermen unloading their catch, a rare opportunity to glimpse whole ahi, with their silvery torpedo-like bodies.\u000a\u000aSuisan Fish Market, 93 Lihiwai St, Hilo (808) 935-9349\u000a\u000aDo-it-yourself poke\u000a\u000aCan't make it to Hawaii? Poke is incredibly easy to prepare, even if you can't find ahi. Use any seafood that's available, such as salmon. If you're wary about raw seafood, substitute cooked shrimp.\u000a\u000aHere's my recipe for shoyu poke, the classic and most popular variety in Hawaii.\u000a\u000aShoyu Ahi Poke\u000a\u000aServes 4\u000a\u000a1 pound sushi-grade tuna, cut into ¾-inch pieces\u000a\u000a½ cup thinly sliced yellow onion\u000a\u000a½ cup thinly sliced green onions (green parts only)\u000a\u000a2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more to taste\u000a\u000a1 teaspoon sesame oil\u000a\u000a½ teaspoon sambal oelek (sambal, a chili paste, can be substituted with chili flakes or sriracha)\u000a\u000a1. In a medium bowl, combine the tuna, yellow onions, green onions, soy sauce, sesame oil, and sambal. Fold gently until evenly distributed. Taste and adjust with more soy sauce as desired.\u000a\u000a2. Serve immediately, or cover tightly and refrigerate for up to a day. If you let the poke marinate, taste it again right before serving; you may want to add another splash of soy sauce.

aV(CNN) Republicans may be jubilant that revamped health care legislation finally passed the House on Thursday, but many of the professional associations that represent America's health care workers are clearly unhappy.\u000a\u000aThe groups said they were "disappointed," "deeply disappointed" and "extremely disappointed" with legislation that is "unacceptable," "shameful," "harmful and irresponsible." Their reactions immediately followed the 217-213 House vote\u000a\u000aThe American Medical Association said in a statement that although change is needed in the health care system, people with pre-existing health conditions "face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question."\u000a\u000aThe American Cancer Society expressed concerns that the bill will leave cancer patients unable to pay for plans, arguing that the bill would make pre-existing condition protections "virtually meaningless." The legislation may bring back high-risk pools, which "have not historically been an adequate safety-net," according to the statement from Chris Hansen, president of the society's Cancer Action Network.\u000a\u000aThe American College of Physicians disagreed with a provision that will allow insurers to opt out of covering essential benefits like mental health care, maternal care and cancer screening. The group also took issue with cuts and caps on federal contributions to Medicaid and an end to Medicaid expansion, which they say will leave tens of millions without coverage.\u000a\u000aIn a statement from Dr. Jack Ende, the group's president, it vowed to fight for a better change to the health care system instead of this "harmful legislation."\u000a\u000a"The American Health Care Act (AHCA) plays Robin Hood in reverse. It fails to deliver better, cheaper health care for all Americans, instead giving massive tax cuts to the rich while causing 24 million people to lose coverage," the National Education Association said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIt too expressed concerns about funding cuts to Medicaid, which covers millions of students nationwide.\u000a\u000aThe Main Street Alliance , a group that works with small businesses on health care issues, called the vote "a shameful display of partisan politics at its worst" in a statement from its national director, Amanda Ballantyne. It added that the legislation would raise costs for all families while giving tax breaks to "the very wealthy and the big insurance and drug companies."\u000a\u000a"Today, the sunny, flamboyant promises of better health care at a lower cost during a political campaign gave way to the cold, dark realities of politics in America," said Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of Mental Health America, in a statement. He called it a "tragic day for all those dealing with or caring for someone with serious mental health concerns."\u000a\u000aIn an emailed statement, Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said: "Today the U.S. House of Representatives voted on the worst women's health legislation in a generation. It makes it harder to prevent unintended pregnancy, harder to have a healthy pregnancy, and harder to raise a family."\u000a\u000aPhysicians for Reproductive Health's statement argued that the bill is a "targeted attack against reproductive health care" and that it takes away health care from millions of Americans, disproportionally affecting low-income women and women of color.\u000a\u000a"It is appalling that the House would push forward legislation that offers no significant improvements to the bill that was rejected just last month," said a statement from Dr. Diane Horvath-Cosper, the reproductive health advocacy fellow at the association. "I am terrified for my patients and for the health of this country."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThere was at least one association that was applauding the passage of the legislation in the house. #ProtestPP , which stands for Protest Planned Parenthood Coalition. The group organizes rallies around the country in support of defunding Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000a"With today's vote in the House, our leaders in Congress have taken a giant step toward keeping the promise they made to voters last year to defund Planned Parenthood. Now it's time for the Senate and President Trump to get the job done," said Eric Scheidler, one of the association's national directors.\u000a\u000aThe office of the Health and Human Services secretary also sent out a statement on the legislation.

The boats will be inspected Saturday, skippers are briefed the following day, with racing starting on Monday.\u000a\u000aA record 52 yachts from 60ft and upwards have turned up for a week of inshore racing and coastal sprints along the spectacular Costa Smeralda and its notorious stretches of water with names like "Bomb Alley."\u000a\u000aSardinia's Costa Smeralda offers stunning sailing among rocky islands.\u000a\u000aBillionaire lifestyle\u000a\u000aThe sailors, globe-trotting guns for hire, exude an air of surf chic combined with preppy pro jock. The younger the sailor, the more disheveled the look. Much like life.\u000a\u000aHands are strong and coarse. Handshakes firm to crippling. Eyes crinkle into smiles, the effect of years sailing in sun and wind.\u000a\u000aWhile the scene is glitzy, at least in the marina, the sailors' office can be a dangerous salt-lashed bucking bronco with high stakes.\u000a\u000aThe hardest part is signing the cheques. That, and steering the boat. Sir Peter Ogden\u000a\u000aChatting to the crews, the number one trade-off is not the risk but the time spent away from home and families.\u000a\u000a"You're part performance athlete and part hobo," says Andy Green, a Newport, RI-based British sailor and America's Cup commentator.\u000a\u000a"You're living out of a bag but living the life of a billionaire. When it's all over you go back to your apartment or whatever and live a normal life."\u000a\u000aThe big yacht circuit generally begins in the Caribbean with races such as the Caribbean 600 from Antigua in February and Les Voiles de Saint Barth in April before moving to the Mediterranean for the summer and regattas in oh-so chic spots like Majorca, Corfu, St Tropez, Porto Cervo and Palermo in Sicily.\u000a\u000aAmong the traveling tribe there is a distinct hierarchy at work.\u000a\u000aAt the top, at least on shore, are the owners. High-achieving businessmen with big bucks to lavish on their chosen sport. A new mainsail costs north of $160,000 and just the running costs for a summer campaign can be anything between about $1.5 million and $5.4 million.\u000a\u000a"It's highly competitive. All the owners are very friendly, we have drinks and invite each other to parties but on the water nobody gives you any quarter -- on the water you want to kill them," Sir Peter Ogden, owner of Maxi 72 Jethou, told CNN.\u000a\u000aBritain's Ogden, who built up UK company Computacenter and owns the Channel Island Jethou, adds: "The hardest part is signing the cheques.

In 2013 I was on the road 300 days," said Henderson, who grew up sailing in Michigan.\u000a\u000aUnlike the more cruising oriented Wally class, Bella Mente is a stripped-out racer, a black carbon shell with no frills down below.\u000a\u000aThe toilet is of the "bucket and chuck it" variety. There is no galley in day-race mode, and sleeping facilities, should they be needed for longer offshore races, are pull down canvas shelves, operated on a "hot-bunk" basis for sailors on different watches.\u000a\u000aLast year a storm in Porto Cervo meant Henderson and another had to sleep on board and take turns to keep watch as a big sea surged into the harbor, threatening to ram her onto the dock -- Bella Mente's keel is too deep to retreat further inside the marina.\u000a\u000a"That was stressful. More so than the racing," said Henderson.\u000a\u000a'Dangerous'\u000a\u000aWhile the permanent crew are the workhorses, the stardust comes from the tacticians and other members of the "brains trust," the big-money signings making the racing decisions.\u000a\u000aAmong those calling the shots this week are Open Season's Jochen Shuemann, a multiple Olympic champion and former sporting director for America's Cup outfit Alinghi, and former America's Cup-winning tactician and skipper Brad Butterworth on Jethou.\u000a\u000aThere's not huge job security.

aVBlåvand, Denmark (CNN) Bjarke Ingels certainly has a way with words when it comes to describing his design for the newly opened Tirpitz Museum.\u000a\u000a"It's almost compared to when you have a hot potato," he says. "When you make a cross and you squeeze, it opens up and reveals the softness inside. That's pretty much what's going on here, just with culture and nature."\u000a\u000aHe's alluding to the entrances to the new museum, open corridors carved into a large sand dune, which meet like a cross in an open courtyard. From there, glass windows allow visitors to peek into the vast underground galleries below.\u000a\u000aLight-hearted comparisons aside, the museum builds upon a dark historical heritage.

This is a serious storm.\u201d\u000a\u000aHupp added, \u201cThis is a monster storm. You can. We were in Homestead after Hurricane Andrew and we saw what can happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aRelated: Broward County Shelters That Will Open Thursday\u000a\u000aAround Broward, there were long lines for gasoline and water at places like a Target store behind the Broward Mall in Plantation.\u000a\u000aPrivate contractors Dave Baltz and George Howard said they received a record number of calls to put up shutters around Broward County for homeowners and businesses.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith this hurricane there seems to be more people taking this seriously. We have been getting back to back calls to put up shutters. At this point at midday we have already received 10 calls and we are going to keep on going. It has been busier than ever,\u201d Baltz said.\u000a\u000aIf the storm causes extensive damage, Baltz expects to be busier than ever.\u000a\u000aThe county opened 14 shelters at noon to house those that have nowhere else to go.\u000a\u000aThose leaving the area are urged to have patience, long lines at gas stations persist. Waits at some stations have been said to be up to three hours.\u000a\u000aSy Garber from Boca Raton was out before dawn looking for gas.\u000a\u000a\u201cI went to four stations and they were out,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe ended up at a 7-Eleven in Fort Lauderdale which had gas but the wait was two hours.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey would block the traffic, you can\u2019t even get by, it\u2019s like the world is coming to an end,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFrank Sensec also ended up at the 7-Eleven.\u000a\u000a\u201cI live in Hialeah and I drove away out of there because it was pretty bad over there,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aSensec said he needed gas but he has other worries too.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen Wilma hit us we were out (of electricity) for about three weeks. So, I just don\u2019t want to go through that again,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBroward emergency managers say they prefer people who evacuate to go further inland to stay with family and friends on Thursday. They feel that way they can prevent an excessive amount of cars on the roads late Friday or Saturday morning when the weather will be deteriorating.\u000a\u000aIf the gas lines are bad, finding bottled water can be even worse. Store after store is selling out of the liquid gold moments after stocking their shelves.\u000a\u000aJoann Bowleg said she got lucky at a Publix in Hollywood when a second shipment of H2O arrived at the store on Sheridan Street just east of U.S. One.\u000a\u000a\u201cThank God we got water because we couldn\u2019t find it nowhere else,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s such a relief, we\u2019ve been looking for water for the past days,\u201d said Jennifer Petersen.\u000a\u000aShe said getting her hands on it meant getting up extra early.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was here when it opened so you know that was necessary,\u201d she said. \u201cBut other than that they seem to be resupplying pretty quickly.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt Sheridan Lumber in Hollywood, some people lined up for hours waiting for plywood.\u000a\u000aJamie Rashbaum said, \u201cI am hoping to get plywood. When I first got here, they originally said there would be plywood and said I could get as much as my car could hold.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Rashbaum was not able to get plywood as the store ran out of it.\u000a\u000aManager Francisco Vidal said, \u201cAll the supplies are running out. We are down to the wire.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Humane Society of Broward County has evacuated more than 175 dogs and cats ahead of the storm. They were flown to an animal rescue foundation in northern California in hopes of finding new homes in that area.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy taking the vast majority of the population of animals that are here at the facility out of harm\u2019s way than we can concentrate on other things after the storm,\u201d said spokeswoman Cherie Wachter.\u000a\u000aBroward residents can sign up for AccessBROWARD to receive email alerts.

aVKaren Catchpole, CNN \u2022 Published 7th September 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Manaus, Brazil , is a city of 1.8 million people surrounded by 2 million square miles of Amazon jungle more than 1,500 miles from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Though it doesn't get as many tourists as those two cities, Manaus is a gold mine of brightly colored architecture, riverfront views and world-class eating, minus the huge crowds.\u000a\u000aAt the turn of the 20th century, Manaus was the center of a lucrative global trade in rubber. Today, it's the gateway for thousands of tourists seeking Amazon jungle adventures at the many lodges outside the city.\u000a\u000aYet there's still only one road in from the more populous areas of Brazil -- a tortuous 540-mile stretch of dirt and asphalt called the BR-319, which runs from the city of Porto Velho. Most visitors arrive on daily flights from Azul, a low-cost Brazilian airline which was started in 2008 by David Neeleman, who is also the founder of JetBlue and of Brazilian descent.\u000a\u000aWhat to eat and drink\u000a\u000aThe elegant but casual upstairs dining room at Caxiri is the place for gourmet takes on Amazon food classics like the beloved tambaqui river fish. Caipirinhas get a fresh kick with house-infused cachaça and even the straight-forward gin and tonic gets a jungle update with the addition of an Amazon herb that tastes vaguely of nutmeg.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, Sao Paulo native Fernando Vieira converted a UPS van into a burger truck, named it Borala, and brought it to Manaus. It was the first food truck in the city.\u000a\u000aVieira went on to open Villa Food Park, which offered space to about a dozen food trucks and attracted the city's tattooed set with live music and casual food (burgers dominated the offerings). When Villa Food Park closed, Vieira launched a monthly Street Food Festival which pops up around Manaus with many of the same vendors and the same vibe.\u000a\u000aThe El Caldeira Bar has occupied a cramped space near the center of town since 1961. Live bands often set up on the sidewalk outside the bar and red plastic tables and chairs spill out until half of the street is blocked. The other half is soon blocked by mobile vendors hawking freshly grilled meat.\u000a\u000aMany consider Banzeiro Cocina Amazonica, opened in 2009 by Chef Felipe Schaedle, to be the best restaurant in Manaus and this place is currently enjoying nascent buzz as a possible new addition to the list of Latin America's Top 50 Restaurants. In 2016 the same team opened Moquem do Banzeiro, a more casual place with a serious focus on local fish cooked in live embers (the word moquem refers to cooking in this fashion).\u000a\u000aBeer's & Beer, located in the Container Mall alongside other businesses housed in re-purposed shipping containers, offers more than 300 different beers and ciders including Manaus-made Cervejeria Rio Negro. In 2017 the owners debuted a mobile beer trailer with four taps to bring fresh beer to events around the city.\u000a\u000aCaxiri , Rua 10 de Julio 495, +55 92 3304-8700\u000a\u000aEl Caldeira Bar , Rua José Clemente 237, +55 92 99982-7535\u000a\u000aBanzeiro Cocina Amazonica , Rua Libertador 102, Nossa, +55 92 3234-1621\u000a\u000aBeer's & Beer , Container Mall, Rua Doutor Thomas, +55 92 3084-9488\u000a\u000aWhat to do\u000a\u000aThe Amazonas Theater's pink color makes it one of the most recognizable buildings in town.\u000a\u000aManaus' Amazonas Theater (aka Teatro Amazonas or simply The Opera House) is an opulent ode to the rubber boom of the 1800s when rubber barons and the local government had more money than they knew what to do with. Some of that windfall was used for the construction of the theater. It took 15 years to complete and includes tiles, stained glass and other elements brought from Europe. One-hour guided tours in English are available daily on the half hour and the theater presents a packed year round roster of performances from ballet to opera to the White Stripes.\u000a\u000aYou can take a boat tour to a spot where the milky waters of the Solimões River and nearly black waters of the Negro River meet and mix to create the Amazon River in an event dubbed The Meeting of the Waters. A more dramatic way to see this natural phenomenon is via a 30 minute air tour with Seaplane Tours.\u000a\u000aArena Amazonas, the $220 million dollar, 44,000 seat stadium which was built for the 2014 World Cup, regularly hosts matches between regional and national soccer teams. Tickets are cheap and it's a great way to check out the ethereal architecture of the structure (inspired by local woven bags) and hang out with Manauras.\u000a\u000aIt's hot in Manaus, so spending a lazy afternoon in cool, gentle tributaries of the Amazon River is a long-standing tradition.\u000a\u000aAbare SUP & Food puts a new twist on the idea by offering stand up paddle boarding as well as swimming for guests at their floating restaurant who want to cool off between rounds of cold beers and plates of fresh food al fresco. In 2017 the owners opened the floating Abare Hostal next door.

The 30 room hotel is sleek, the pool in the central courtyard is inviting and the bistro-style Fitzcarraldo restaurant is stylish and sexy with wood floors that are from the original 1800s construction.\u000a\u000aIn 2018 Manaus will get its second boutique hotel when Hotel Juma Opera opens in an opulent Belle Epoque style rubber baron's home which was built in the 1800s.\u000a\u000aHotel Casa Teatro is a boutique B&B with a wide range of rooms (some are tiny) right on Sao Sebastian park.

aVStory highlights Anthony H. Cordesman: The US must accept that threatening "fire and fury" is not a practical military option in North Korea\u000a\u000aInstead, the US should devote resources to building up its own military deterrence and that of its allies, Japan and South Korea, he writes\u000a\u000aAnthony H. Cordesman holds the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and is a national security analyst on a number of global conflicts. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It is easy for the US and North Korea to posture and threaten -- for North Korea to carry out nuclear and missile tests and for the US to conduct B-1B bomber and F-35 flights and military exercises.\u000a\u000aIt is equally easy for the hopeful and the well-intentioned -- and nations on the margin of events, such as China -- to call for negotiations or believe that some form of dialogue will lead to conflict resolution and change North Korean behavior.\u000a\u000aThere is always hope that someone else will solve the problem: China, the UN, South Korea or the somewhat mythical "international community." US military experts can continue to search for preventive options -- or any option that will avoid triggering a process of mutual escalation leading to a major military exchange or war.\u000a\u000aAnthony H. Cordesman\u000a\u000aAnd the US should seek to negotiate and continue to demonstrate its commitment to its East Asian allies. But it is becoming all too clear that the US may well have to accept the reality that to threaten "fire and fury" is not a practical military option, and there probably won't be any miraculous change in Kim Jong Un's behavior.\u000a\u000aAt a minimum, he will soon nuclearize the Korean Peninsula and be able to threaten all of Asia, or at least as far as Japan and Guam, with nuclear weapons. In one to two years , he will have a reasonably credible capability to fire a missile with enough accuracy and reliability to carry a nuclear warhead so far as to strike a major city in the West Coast of the continental US.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVNanjing, China (CNN) Outside China, architect Zhou Qi is best known for the People's Daily headquarters, a Beijing tower that went viral in 2013 when social media users drew attention to its distinctly phallic appearance.\u000a\u000aBut the building's notoriety does a disservice to its designer.\u000a\u000aNot only did the 590-foot (180-meter) skyscraper go on to win an international award (the viral photographs had been taken during construction), it also distracts from a distinguished architectural career.\u000a\u000aZhou may design the occasional high-rise, but he spends most of his time restoring treasured pre-war buildings in his home city of Nanjing.\u000a\u000aA city endures\u000a\u000aAs rampant development unfolds across urban China, the country's former capital has retained much of its old charm. Many historic buildings still stand in Nanjing amid the steel and glass.\u000a\u000aAnd over 100 of them owe their longevity to Zhou. From a disused church to a crumbling hotel, he has breathed new life into the city's buildings, fighting to preserve the past in a country where heritage is often forfeited in the name of progress.\u000a\u000aThe new headquarters of the People's Daily newspaper during construction.\u000a\u000a"This preservation work is so important," Zhou told CNN at his office in Nanjing's Southeast University, part of a magnificent Western-style campus dating back to 1902. "It means we can keep old buildings for our own use -- and for the next generation. Through them you can see that the city is alive."\u000a\u000aSite of Nanjing's former provisional government senate.\u000a\u000aThe abundance of historic buildings in Nanjing -- both Western and Chinese in style -- results from the city's unique past.\u000a\u000aMost of the finest examples date back to Nanjing's time as the country's capital, before the Communists came to power in 1949, according Charles Musgrove, author of "China's Contested Capital: Architecture, Ritual, and Response in Nanjing."\u000a\u000a"From 1927 to 1937 quite a few government buildings were constructed along the main artery of the city, Sun Yat-sen Boulevard," he said over email. "Mostly, these buildings housed key ministries, particularly those that it was believed would help the government raise revenue for investment in infrastructure."\u000a\u000aThe area is also home to banks, churches and mansions from this era. Zhou says that around 80% of the period's noteworthy architecture remains, albeit in varying states of disrepair.\u000a\u000aFit for purpose\u000a\u000aJust over a mile south of Zhou's office stands the Dahua Cinema, a 1930s structure that once housed a movie theater and concert hall. When the architect's team began renovating the building in 2008, it had been in disuse for almost 15 years.\u000a\u000aToday, the cinema has been restored to its former glory -- or something resembling it. The building's Art Deco design has been revived with a grand foyer composed of striking red columns and golden embellishments.\u000a\u000aThe Dahua Theater.\u000a\u000aBut Zhou describes restoration projects as exercises in compromise. Although he occasionally -- and painstakingly -- restores old buildings to their original form, he is normally tasked with preparing them for the 21st century.\u000a\u000aAt the Dahua Cinema, for instance, Zhou was forced to sacrifice much of the building's interior to accommodate the trappings of a modern movie theater: cafes, popcorn vendors and multiple screening rooms.\u000a\u000a"These projects have to meet the requirements of modern use," he said. "We have make sure the building has another 100 years of life.\u000a\u000a"It can be very controversial. Sometimes, if we make the interiors especially modern, people say that we shouldn't have. But while historic buildings have to be preserved, they also have to offer new functions."\u000a\u000aZhou's pragmatic approach makes restoration more appealing to city authorities and private developers alike.\u000a\u000aA modern cinema will generate more revenue than a faithfully restored monument to the past, offsetting the substantial cost of the work.\u000a\u000a"Preserving these buildings can cost three times as much as it would to just destroy them and build new ones -- it requires a lot of energy and money," Zhou said, referring to an old British-built storage facility that he is transforming into a shopping mall.\u000a\u000aOne of his most extensive projects to date, Zhou must feed steel reinforcements into the structure's dilapidated concrete frame before cosmetic work can begin.\u000a\u000aChanging attitudes to heritage\u000a\u000aIt appears that government protection, not economic forces, has kept the bulldozers at bay. In the last two decades there has been a sea change in official attitudes, according to Musgrove, who is also an associate history professor at St. Mary's College of Maryland.\u000a\u000a"When I first lived in Nanjing back in 1996 (...) a lot of old buildings were being torn down," he said. "And while the officials I talked to recognized the cultural value of the old architecture, they clearly wished they could work in one of the new 'modern' (government) buildings being built.\u000a\u000a"(Now) Nanjing city officials seem to have woken up to the fact that these buildings provide a distinctive quality to the city that can be used to add a special cultural cachet (...) and to attract tourists."\u000a\u000aAcross China, buildings with historical value are being offered national-, provincial-, city- and even district-level protection.\u000a\u000aPublished in 2010, the Nanjing government's ten-year plan for protecting the city's heritage pledges to "emphasize the revival of history and culture" while "strengthening the organic integration of various historical and cultural sites (with) modern city functions."\u000a\u000aThese protections, which now safeguard hundreds of buildings in Nanjing, forbid property owners and developers from making certain alterations and have been designed to enhance "the vitality of the old city."\u000a\u000aA former Communist Party building in Meiyuan Xincun.\u000a\u000aThis can be considered progress in a country with a reputation for demolishing the past. In Beijing, for instance, large swathes of the old city were razed as part of Mao Zedong's campaign to destroy what he called the "Four Olds" (old customs, old culture, old habits and old ideas).\u000a\u000a"During the Cultural Revolution, people tried to destroy everything -- like the Taliban," Zhou observed.\u000a\u000aAs neither a political or commercial hub, Nanjing was afforded protection of sorts. Zhou also attributes old buildings' survival to the city's slow urban development when compared to nearby Shanghai, which accommodates more than three times the population.\u000a\u000aPioneering preservation\u000a\u000aBut while old buildings remained, it was not until the late 1980s that Zhou perceived any official interest in protecting them. Despite providing little to no funding for restoration at that time, the city's government helped him survey old government buildings -- the first research of its kind in Nanjing.\u000a\u000aBy the time he returned from completing a Ph.D. in Chicago in 2003, public and private heritage projects were becoming commonplace. Now, Zhou's team at Southeast University -- which comprises architects, researchers and mature students -- typically carries out five or six restorations at any one time.\u000a\u000a"Over the last 20 years, the government has made real efforts to establish national laws, local laws and regulations so we can pursue this work," he said, of his optimism for the city's heritage preservation efforts. "It has just become common sense."

That's what's important to me."\u000a\u000aSevastova was diplomatic when asked about Sharapova's return to grand slam events.\u000a\u000a"I think some players have that. I don't have that.

aV(CNN) At first glance a Rio de Janiero favela would seem an unlikely place to find an athlete who was one of the sporting stories of the last Olympics.\u000a\u000aJudoka Popole Misenga -- one of the stars of the refugee team at the Rio 2016 Games -- lives with his partner and children in the Bras de Pina favela in the northern part of the sprawling Brazilian city.\u000a\u000aIt's a place that, on some days, isn't safe enough for him to jog through. Its streets are frequented by drug dealers and occasional police presence.\u000a\u000aIn the first two months of 2017, at least 182 people were killed during police operations in Rio's favelas -- a 78% increase on the same period in 2016, according to official figures, reported by Amnesty International\u000a\u000aBut Misenga, who ran away from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) team camp at the 2013 World Championships in Rio, remains eternally grateful the city gave him a home, helping him compete at the Summer Games last year.\u000a\u000a"My life really changed after the Olympics," Misenga told CNN. "I have a good life now.

"I didn't have a home, money or food. Everything was missing in my life.\u000a\u000a"I was hungry and it was a lot to suffer.

aVMichael D'Antonio is the author of the new book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Having long ago committed himself to the proposition that there is no such thing as too much press, Donald Trump may be the most photographed, filmed and quoted man of our time.\u000a\u000aAdd his own words, offered in books, speeches, Facebook posts and Tweets, and you might conclude that there's little left for this man to share.\u000a\u000aBut think again. What if all those words were intended, not to reveal, but conceal? What if Trump talks so much because he wants to control the conversation?\u000a\u000aNow that Trump is the GOP's presumptive nominee for president, he'll face more intense scrutiny about his many claims to personal success, his political beliefs, his temperament and his character. In each case, the public record is filled with incidents and examples, but a skeptic finds little clarity.\u000a\u000aThis state of affairs may suffice for anyone buying a steak or an apartment from Trump the salesman, but voters contemplating Trump the candidate for president deserve better answers to the lingering questions.\u000a\u000aHere they are:\u000a\u000aWhat is Trump's temperament?\u000a\u000aTV audiences have been treated to more than 100 episodes of Trump's reality TV shows "The Apprentice" and "Celebrity Apprentice." The Trump depicted on air is the product of so much editing and consulting by producers and directors that it is no better than a cartoon. More useful is the cumulative Trump record, which includes as many negatives as positives.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aTo Trump's credit, he has shown himself to be resilient, coming back from failures that would have sent less confident men and women into business exile. Most notable, of course, is the crisis he experienced in the early 1990s when he was unable to pay personal and corporate debts in the neighborhood of $3.4 billion\u000a\u000aTrump is also a nimble entrepreneur, who looks for opportunities and seizes them decisively. Witness his ability to deal in real estate, entertainment and retail merchandising, all at the same time.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the ledger, open questions remain about his consistent record of cruelty and excess when dealing with critics and competitors. Trump's code begins with the belief that he's justified in "hitting back ten times harder" whenever he's offended. If our presidents believed in this approach, America would have engaged in shooting wars with untold numbers of countries that have, in recent decades, committed transgressions against the United States.\u000a\u000aWould Trump have hit back 10 times harder when North Korea detained the spy ship Pueblo? What about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over the territory of our ally Ukraine. U.S. intelligence indicates a Russia missile likely was responsible.

MUST WATCH Keeping Them Honest: Trump on Afghanistan & gun control 03:48\u000a\u000aWe can ask additional questions about Trump's penchant for bullying. In some cases this trait has shown itself in mere words, as he has attempted to humiliate, disparage and marginalize others. In other instances he has sought to force innocent landowners off their properties to make way for his developments. This willingness to use any means necessary to get what he wants raises serious concern about Trump's ability to manage America's affairs in a complex world.\u000a\u000aWhat does Trump believe?\u000a\u000aMore than any political figure in modern times, Trump represents an ideological puzzle. Although he now claims the conservative Republican mantle, he has often associated himself with liberal and Democratic Party ideas. In 1999 he told CNN, "I've actually been an activist Democrat and Republican."\u000a\u000aIn the past, Trump said he is "totally pro-choice." Now he is against abortion rights, recently musing about punishing women who might violate a ban on the procedure.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump flip-flops on abortion ahead of Wisconsin primary 02:02\u000a\u000aIn the past, Trump was in favor of levying a big tax on the rich , himself included, to pay down the federal deficit. Like banks, rich people have the money, and Trump reasoned that they could afford to help the country out. Today, Trump is in favor of big tax cuts for the wealthy.\u000a\u000aIn 2000 Trump proposed banning private ownership of assault weapons and increasing the waiting period for the purchase of guns. In the current campaign he has declared himself to be an ardent defender of gun rights, and he has even proposed eliminating gun-free zones near schools.\u000a\u000aThe list of Trump flip-flops is long and includes his positions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his regard for Hillary Clinton's performance as secretary of state. Voters, especially those conservatives who want a clear sense of what their standard-bearer will do as president, deserve explanations for these shifts.\u000a\u000aHow rich is he?\u000a\u000aThroughout his life Trump has cited his wealth as evidence of his excellence but without offering verifiable proof of his claims. In the 1970s he cruised Manhattan in a chauffeured limousine and gave others the impression that he was in control of the $200 million fortune amassed by his father.\u000a\u000aIn the 1980s, when he first made it onto the Forbes magazine list of America's wealthiest men and women, Trump complained often and loudly about how his holdings were underestimated. More recently he said he is worth some $10 billion.\u000a\u000aThe record produced by those who have looked closely at Trump's finances raises many questions. Writer Wayne Barrett reported in the 1980s that Trump's income as of 1978 was less than $100,000. In the 1993 biography of Trump called "Lost Tycoon," Harry Hurt III noted that during his divorce from his first wife, Ivana, her attorneys found that Trump had never been worth the billions of dollars he claimed. Hurt also reported that in March 1992, Trump's own lawyers said he could not afford to pay Ivana even half of the $20 million he had offered as a settlement.\u000a\u000aMore recently doubts about his wealth arose in 2005 when journalist Tim O'Brien wrote that Trump was probably worth between $150 million and $250 million. For a man who reveled in his image as a billionaire, O'Brien's estimate was too much to bear. Trump sued. The case was dismissed by the trial judge. Trump appealed. He lost\u000a\u000aWere Trump a more circumspect and well-mannered man, who never bragged about how rich he is, his wealth would be less of an issue. However Trump has made his fortune such an important part of his identity that voters deserve to know the truth. Many of the facts are contained in Trump's personal income tax filings, and it is now a campaign tradition for candidates to make these documents public. Clinton has made public all of her returns going back to 2000.\u000a\u000aSo far, Trump has refused to release his returns because, he says, he is undergoing an audit on returns filed in the last few years. Nothing in the law, or in federal regulations, would prohibit him from making the documents public now, but if he is uncomfortable with releasing those forms, he could simply match Clinton for those years that are settled.\u000a\u000aSuch a release would reassure the public that Trump is who he says he is -- a really rich man -- and allow a glimpse into other matters, including his charitable giving. It is a matter of conservative orthodoxy that the rich should be spared excessive taxation so they can support society freely with their philanthropy.\u000a\u000aIs he a man of character?\u000a\u000aPersonality, which can be seen in a smile, heard in a glib remark or felt when viewing a performance, is not the most important measure of a man or woman. Many people with winning personalities are, in fact, hucksters, con men, manipulators and deceivers. In fact, the false signals flashed by well-practiced performers, including politicians, compel us to look for the signs of the character beneath the personality.\u000a\u000aExperts in assessing character generally look for some traits such as autonomy and life purpose that Trump clearly possesses in abundance. But there are other areas of character , including positive relations with others, ethical behavior, empathy, honesty and humility where Trump would not achieve a very high score.\u000a\u000aIn his long and very public life, Trump has often shown he is willing to do things others consider wrong in order to get what he wants. This includes using a false identity to make claims about his success, carrying out a bitter divorce dispute in the tabloid press, criticizing the appearance of others and refusing to take the high road when offered the chance.\u000a\u000aThe most troubling aspect of Trump's character can be seen in his devotion to the so-called birther campaign that sought to delegitimize President Barack Obama. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, birthers led by Trump insisted that some mystery surrounded Obama's status as a citizen born in the United States.\u000a\u000aLong after documents were produced to settle this falsely posed question, Trump continued to raise doubts and thus signal his allegiance to those who considered the President to be an unworthy "other." The racism latent in the birther movement was documented in a study by University of Delaware psychologist Eric Heyman, but the link to prejudice was always plain to see. Rather than stand against birtherism, Trump built a following by exploiting it.\u000a\u000aIn fact, one can find precedent for Trump's birtherism in his previous provocative statements about racially sensitive subjects. Other evidence of his character can be found in his selective use of facts, his tendency to inflame conflict rather than cool it and his devotion to self-promotion.\u000a\u000aIn the past Trump's character has been well-suited to his pursuit of success as he defines it. But as revealed thus far, it would disqualify him when it comes to the presidency. We can only hope Trump has something better to show and will do it when placed under the pressure of the coming campaign.

This is a soft power issue. This is a political issue."\u000a\u000aDubai, it should be noted, made a splash back in 2004 by placing the name of its state carrier, Emirates Airlines, on Arsenal's new stadium in a reported deal of approximately $160 million that included jersey sponsorship.\u000a\u000aNot to be outdone, Abu Dhabi branded Manchester City with its carrier, Etihad, in a reported $640 million deal in 2011\u000a\u000aMeanwhile Qatar, via its national carrier and the charitable Qatar Foundation, inked its own sponsorship deals with Barcelona. Then in 2011 it purchased a controlling interest in the French capital's marquee club.\u000a\u000aPSG was asked to comment on the influence of its transfer policy by owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments, but did not respond to CNN.\u000a\u000a"Football is unquestioned in its international reach and adulation," says Montague, "so if you want to project an image of yourself on an international stage, there is no greater vehicle than a suitable football club.\u000a\u000a"Owning a football club, sponsoring a stadium, having your name on a shirt, being seen in over 200 countries around the world, week in, week out, without any kind of negative connotations feeding into people's homes: That is an incredibly powerful tool to mold an image on an international stage."\u000a\u000aPhotos: Neymar: The world's most expensive footballer After telling Barcelona he wanted to leave the club, Brazilian football star Neymar is heading to Paris Saint-Germain.

"The issue is, are they making it difficult for everyone else to compete?"\u000a\u000aIn his report, Bell notes that 60 to 80% of revenues from most English Premier League clubs are generated from lucrative TV rights sales. Those rights appear under threat given the viewing habits of younger audiences less inclined to pay for expensive cable and satellite TV packages.\u000a\u000aThe world's richest sports league, the NFL, posted a nine percent drop in viewership for most of last season, according to research analysts MoffettNathanson.

"They've been putting out fires almost since they day they won it."\u000a\u000aIndeed, Qatar has battled charges of manipulating the World Cup voting process -- which it has been cleared of by FIFA -- and of poor treatment of migrants building the tournament's stadiums.

aV(CNN) Millions of Americans are uncertain about their future as a new health care bill heads to the Senate.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would shake things up. It could open the door for insurers to charge sick people and pregnant women much higher premiums.\u000a\u000aUnder Obamacare, all insurers are required to charge everyone the same premium, despite their medical history. This new version of the bill would weaken protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\u000a\u000aWhat is a pre-existing condition?\u000a\u000aIt's a "health problem you had before the date that new health coverage starts," the US Department of Health and Human Services says.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 52 million of adults under 65 years have pre-existing health issues, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found.\u000a\u000aBut the term itself is vague and every insurance company has their own lists of "declinable" or "uninsurable" conditions.\u000a\u000aSome companies even considered domestic violence and rape a pre-existing condition before the Obamacare era.\u000a\u000aDo I have a pre-existing condition?\u000a\u000aMaybe. By law, there are not set parameters, and some insurers consider these as pre-existing conditions:\u000a\u000aAcne\u000a\u000aAnxiety\u000a\u000aAsthma\u000a\u000aBipolar disease\u000a\u000aDepression\u000a\u000aMenstrual irregularities\u000a\u000aSex reassignment\u000a\u000aSleep apnea\u000a\u000aTranssexualism\u000a\u000aThe list of pre-existing conditions could be endless. Three of the largest insurers in the US -- United Healthcare, Cigna and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield -- considered a person generally "uninsurable" and could decline coverage without reviewing any medical records if an applicant had a certain health issue.

aVAmy Ingram was trying to schedule a meeting earlier this month when she received a sharp response.\u000a\u000aOne of the meeting participants called her a "nag" for sending "PERSISTENT emails."\u000a\u000aThe exchange might raise eyebrows in any office, but this one was notable for a different reason. Amy Ingram is not actually a person. It is a personal assistant powered by artificial intelligence. The product, from a startup called X.ai, has only one purpose: scheduling meetings by email.\u000a\u000aApple (AAPL, Tech30), Google (GOOGL, Tech30), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) have all invested in voice assistants connected to smartphones and smart speakers. More than 35 million Americans are expected to use a voice-activated assistant at least once a month this year, according to an estimate from research firm eMarketer. And that doesn't even take into account chatbots and products like Amy Ingram.\u000a\u000aBut as tech companies introduce more advanced assistants and chatbots, some of these conversations inevitably turn hostile.\u000a\u000aMaybe Apple's Siri mistakenly calls your boss at night instead of your girlfriend. Or you're upset that your meeting is being rescheduled and decide to shoot the automated messenger.\u000a\u000aCall it version 2.0 of banging on your keyboard or throwing a mouse at the wall. And now, the machine talks back.\u000a\u000a"Many of the interactions are you and the machine," Dennis Mortensen, founder and CEO of X.ai, says about most of the assistant products on the market. "In that setting, people tend to feel comfortable applying their frustration."\u000a\u000aThis creates a new challenge for tech companies: how seriously should the products respond to the hostility?\u000a\u000aSherry Turkle, director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, says there's more at stake here than just the customer experience. Venting at machines could lead to a "coarsening of how people treat each other."\u000a\u000aRelated: Apple unveils an Amazon Echo competitor\u000a\u000a"You yell at Alexa... you know Alexa is a machine," Turkle told CNN Tech by email. "We treat machines as though they were people. And then, we are drawn into treating people as though they were machines."\u000a\u000aThere is little data on the frequency of people raging against the new machines. Tech companies mostly stay vague on the details. Amazon declined to comment and Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aCortana, the personal assistant product offered by Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), is hit by curses and offensive language on a daily basis. It falls to Cortana's in-house editorial staff to craft the right response.\u000a\u000a"While Cortana is always ready and eager to have a productive and positive conversation, the goal is to shut down offensive behavior immediately," says Deborah Harrison, a writer on the Cortana editorial team.\u000a\u000aWhen someone calls Cortana a b****, for example, Cortana's responds by saying, "Well, that's not going to get us anywhere." Try hurling the same insult again and you'll get the same response, potentially limiting the incentive to repeat it.\u000a\u000aSiri offers a similar mix of cute responses to foul language, but the same curse can elicit a number of replies. Tell Siri to "go f*** yourself," and it might respond with, "I'd blush if I could," or "I'll pretend I didn't hear that."\u000a\u000aIt's not just curses that elicit these types of responses. Complain to Siri that "you're not helping" and she might reply with "If you say so."\u000a\u000aHowever, this approach may not be enough to curb our worst behavior or address the user's underlying grievances. What's needed, according to Cynthia Breazeal, is something more than "a system that fails and gives you a cute response."\u000a\u000a"This is a hard problem to solve," says Breazeal, founder and chief scientist at Jibo, a startup developing a robot for the home. She expects the "next big thing" will be a deeper understanding of the user's frustration and what can be done to fix it.\u000a\u000aIBM attempts to do some of this now. Its Watson AI platform powers customer service chatbots and "virtual agents" for clients. IBM's team relies on tone and emotion analysis to detect and deal with angry customers, according to Rob High, CTO of IBM Watson.\u000a\u000aThe first time Watson detects a user getting angry, it tries to "interpret and respond to their intention," High says. The second time, Watson may apologize and say it doesn't understand. If the incident continues beyond that, Watson goes to the last resort: actual people.\u000a\u000a"We will offer to turn it over to a live agent," High says.\u000a\u000aRelated: Alexa, can you save Sears? Sears to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon\u000a\u000aOf course, anger may only be one of possible explanations. Some users may simply want to vent, or test the limits of what they can and can't get away with.\u000a\u000aMortensen of X.ai says he would like to see a "penalty" imposed on users who are hostile to personal assistants "just like in real life." One idea he tosses out: the assistant's response time could drop precipitously.\u000a\u000a"Amy's response speed [could go] from being almost instant to, 'I'll just let you cool off for a little bit' so you'll get a response in two hours."\u000a\u000a"You'd know immediately that you lost," he says.\u000a\u000aThen again the startup might lose customers, too.

aVSee Momo run.\u000a\u000aSee Momo run faster, farther and with far more vigor, energy and youthfulness, his owners say, now that he's taking a drug meant for humans with cancer.\u000a\u000a"It's been remarkable," Paola Anderson said as she watched Momo, her 13-year-old white Pomsky, run around the backyard, keeping up with dogs a third his age.\u000a\u000aThe drug is called rapamycin. After nearly a decade of research showing that it makes mice live up to 60% longer, scientists are trying it out as an anti-aging drug in dogs and humans.\u000a\u000aRapamycin was discovered nearly 50 years ago in soil collected from Easter Island in the South Pacific and studied in a Canadian lab, and it's the most promising drug to fight aging that Arlan Richardson has ever seen.\u000a\u000aA professor at the Reynolds Oklahoma Center on Aging, Richardson has been doing this kind of research for 40 years.\u000a\u000a"It's the best bet we have," he said.\u000a\u000aNow, scientists are moving forward and testing the drug in dogs.\u000a\u000aResearchers at the University of Washington's Dog Aging Project gave rapamycin to 16 dogs and imaged their hearts.\u000a\u000a"It started to function better. It started to look like a more youthful heart," said Matt Kaeberlein, co-director of the Dog Aging Project, who has presented this research at conferences but hasn't yet published it.\u000a\u000aThose dogs took rapamycin for only 10 weeks. Here's what happened to Momo and his "brother," Sherman, who took it for much longer.\u000a\u000aSherman the Pomeranian\u000a\u000aSherman and Momo's story\u000a\u000aFor many years, Momo and Sherman were regular visitors to the Laguna Pet Spa in Laguna Hills, California, getting baths and haircuts.\u000a\u000aThen, on Christmas Eve 2010, their owner dropped them off and never came back.\u000a\u000aAnderson, who runs the spa, said she called the owner, but her phone had been disconnected.\u000a\u000aAnderson was horrified but not shocked. This was during Southern California's housing loan crisis, and this owner wasn't the first to abandon a dog to her care.\u000a\u000aBut this was more than a foreclosure. Sherman was sick, very sick.\u000a\u000aOn Christmas Day, the tiny 8-year-old Pomeranian was vomiting and howling in pain. Anderson rushed him to the emergency room. It was an attack of acute pancreatitis.\u000a\u000aAnderson nursed him back to health and became, in her words, "mom" to Sherman and Momo.\u000a\u000aThe dogs had another mom, too: Anderson's partner, Sarah Godfrey, who was then living in Northern California but moved a few years later to Laguna Hills to live with Anderson and "the boys."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Can dogs smell cancer? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Can dogs smell cancer? 02:21\u000a\u000aAll was well until one day in May 2015, when Sherman fell over. He'd had a stroke.\u000a\u000a"They gave him two weeks to live, unless he had surgery," Anderson remembers. Even with an operation, he had only a 20% chance of surviving.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Godfrey were wary of surgery for a fragile dog who was already 13 years old; that's equivalent to 68 years old for a human being, according to the American Kennel Club\u000a\u000aOver the years, the couple had sought help from an herbalist for people problems, and now they desperately turned to him for help with their pooch problem. The herbalist did some research and came up with a possible treatment: rapamycin.\u000a\u000aExcited but also skeptical, Anderson and Godfrey went online and ran across Kaeberlein and the Aging Dog Project, which was recruiting canine subjects for the rapamycin research.\u000a\u000aThey begged Kaeberlein to enroll Sherman, but the answer was no. Dogs had to be healthy and over 40 pounds. Sherman was neither.\u000a\u000aThe couple calculated their next step.\u000a\u000a"We knew we could go to Mexico and get rapamycin or order it online, but we wanted to be guided by a veterinarian, by a professional," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aThat proved to tougher than they thought.\u000a\u000aFive vets refused to prescribe the drug. Finally, a sixth vet agreed to prescribe rapamycin, but only after consulting with Kaeberlein to determine the best dose for Sherman.\u000a\u000aBy this point, a month after his stroke, Sherman was so weak, he had to be fed by hand and carried everywhere.\u000a\u000aBut rapamycin changed all that, Anderson and Godfrey said.\u000a\u000a"The third day after taking rapamycin, he could eat on his own. By the seventh day, he was walking on his own," Anderson said.\u000a\u000aSixteen months later, the dog who had been given two months to live is still alive, and while clearly old, he's still active and able to run around the yard.\u000a\u000aThat got the moms thinking about Momo. He wasn't sick like Sherman, but at 13, he was getting old and achy and losing stamina. The couple decided to try rapamycin on him, too.\u000a\u000a"Why not have your dog live longer if you can?" Godfrey said.\u000a\u000aShe said that within days of taking the drug, Momo was able to run for hours, whereas before, just a 30-minute walk would tire him out. On a hot summer day when CNN visited, he was able to keep up with Anderson's parents' dogs, who are 4 and 5 years old.\u000a\u000aAnderson and Godfrey couldn't be happier.\u000a\u000a"We call Sherman and Momo our rapamycin babies," Godfrey said.\u000a\u000aArlan Richardson with his Tibetan terrier, MoMo.\u000a\u000aBut there's a catch\u000a\u000aTake a look at the labels for Rapamune , made by Pfizer, and Afinitor (PDF), made by Novartis, two drugs that are essentially the same as rapamycin and are used to treat cancer patients and organ transplant recipients. The list of things that can go wrong is long and horrifying: cancer, diabetes, infections and more.\u000a\u000a"You have to be concerned about these side effects," Kaeberlein said. But that hasn't stopped him from doing research on the drug.\u000a\u000aFirst, Kaeberlein thinks the side effects seen in cancer patients and transplant recipients might not be because of rapamycin per se but because those patients were very sick to begin with, because they were taking a whole host of other drugs as well, or both.\u000a\u000aSecondly, he uses a much lower dose of the drug on his healthy dogs compared with the dose used on sick people.\u000a\u000aRichardson, the aging expert at the University of Oklahoma, agrees with Kaeberlein. He's so convinced that he gave a low dose of rapamycin to his own dog, coincidentally named MoMo.\u000a\u000aMoMo had a heart problem, and Richardson said it stabilized after he started taking rapamycin. He said the Tibetan terrier looks and acts younger than his 14 years, which would be around 80 or 90 in human years.\u000a\u000aPlus, he said, there have been no side effects.\u000a\u000a"We've been doing blood chemistries on her the whole time, and there's nothing bad," Richardson said.\u000a\u000aThe researcher was quick to note that one dog's experience did not constitute proven scientific data -- but he added that he's given rapamycin to tiny monkeys called marmosets and hasn't see any negative side effects for them, either.\u000a\u000aBut what about humans?\u000a\u000aRapamycin has had very limited testing in healthy humans. Novartis gave rapamycin to 218 elderly volunteers , and it enhanced their response to the flu vaccine by 20%.\u000a\u000aThe results "raise the possibility that (rapamycin) may have beneficial effects" on the decline in immune function that occurs naturally as we get older, the study authors wrote.\u000a\u000aThey reported that the side effects of rapamycin were "relatively well-tolerated." Severe side effects, they wrote, occurred at a "similar" rate as those experienced by the patients in the study who took a placebo, or a sugar pill.\u000a\u000aOf the 53 patients on the lowest dose of rapamycin, 22 suffered some side effect, most commonly mouth sores.\u000a\u000aDr. Monica Mita, who's done her own research with drugs like rapamycin, said she thinks the side effects can be managed.\u000a\u000a"It's really a matter of using the right dose and keeping an eye on the patients," said Mita, co-director of experimental therapeutics at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.\u000a\u000aThe future of rapamycin\u000a\u000aKaeberlein, the professor of pathology at the University of Washington, is nervous about this article.\u000a\u000aHe wants readers to know that Momo and Sherman's story is a tale of two dogs -- that's it -- and not scientific evidence in any way, shape or form, especially considering the placebo effect, meaning Momo and Sherman's owners might subconsciously be seeing what they want to see because they believe so much in rapamycin and fought so hard for it.\u000a\u000aHe doesn't want Momo and Sherman's seeming success to "encourage dog owners to go off to their veterinarians and demand rapamycin."\u000a\u000aAnd Kaeberlein, who's also president of the American Aging Association, is nervous for another reason, too.\u000a\u000aHe dislikes the term "anti-aging," as it conjures up images of snake oil salesmen peddling the fountain of youth.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aInstead, he prefers to think in terms of treatments that will delay the onset of diseases of aging, such as dementia or heart disease. In mice, rapamycin has been shown to slow these two types of declines, as well as several others.\u000a\u000aOver the next year, Kaeberlein will be studying rapamycin in a much larger group of dogs: about 150, compared with the 16 he studied earlier.\u000a\u000aHe said other groups are looking at doing more aging studies in rapamycin in humans, too.\u000a\u000aIt's been a long journey for the compound discovered more than half a century ago in the dirt of a South Pacific island.

aV(CNN) When Kate Townsend took her kids for their back-to-school health checkups last month, she got a surprise.\u000a\u000aThe Western Springs, Illinois, mother of three wanted to make sure their vaccinations were up-to-date. The pediatrician did talk about shots, but also mentioned her daughter's body mass index.\u000a\u000a"She said to my daughter, 'you are in this percentile, which is in total normal range,' but she made it sound like one more number, and that is too big," Townsend said.\u000a\u000aThe family was surprised. The girl is an active volleyball player, Townsend said, who grew 2½ inches this year. "My daughter's in great shape. And she was sensitive about this news. I tried to reassure her 'that is just a number' and to move on."\u000a\u000aTownsend was right, many experts say, because a growing body of research shows that body mass index, or BMI, may not be the best measure for a growing girl -- or for adults.\u000a\u000aAn increasing number of scientists are calling BS on BMI.\u000a\u000aA tool with a different purpose\u000a\u000aBMI is an easy and straightforward tool used to screen for obesity and to gauge whether you should worry about your weight. Divide your weight (in pounds) by your height (in inches) squared, and multiply that number by 703. If the resulting number is 30 or higher, by American standards, you are considered obese. You're overweight if your BMI is between 25 and 29.9. If you're under 18.5, you are underweight. The "normal" range is 18.5 to 24.9.\u000a\u000aBMI was invented in the 1800s for use in population studies. In 1972 , a key study that tested for the best formula to measure body fat percentage in more than 7,400 people found that the BMI formula best measured body-fat percentage as compared to merely calculating weight and height. It was this study that gave BMI its official name -- and its what popularized its use in research. But that study also warned against using BMI to calculate an individual's levels of fat.\u000a\u000a"BMI really was a measurement created for epidemiology to give data that was relative and could be used in research," said Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez , an obesity expert at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Up until the 1980s, he said, doctors and scientists had been using a variety of measures to track whether a person had gained so much weight that it could hurt their health. The variety in measurement made it hard to chart trends. And as doctors were noticing that people were getting bigger, they wanted to understand how big a problem it was.\u000a\u000aA handful of national and international government agencies then started to recommend that doctors use BMI, as it would be a uniform standard and was seen as more accurate than the insurance company height/weight charts the doctors had been using.\u000a\u000aIn 1985, the US National Institutes of Health recommended BMI to measure obesity. In 1997, the World Health Organization jumped on the bandwagon. The US Preventive Services Task Force, which sets guidelines for American medical professionals, still includes it as a measure in its recommendations.\u000a\u000aIt's not only doctors who use it. As the childhood obesity epidemic grew , more than a dozen states started to require schools to chart students' BMIs, with some even recording the measurement on report cards . Life insurance companies may also ask for it to determine whether you should get a policy or are too big a risk.\u000a\u000aYet while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls BMI "a reasonable indicator of body fat," the agency does not recommend that doctors -- or anyone else, for that matter -- use it as a diagnostic tool.\u000a\u000a"Over time, BMI has gained a clinical use, but that was not the original intention behind its creation," Mayo Clinic's Lopez-Jimenez said. "That's because it does have real limitations."\u000a\u000aWhy do they use it?\u000a\u000aBMI is a free and easy way to get a gauge on obesity for research, but as doctors started using it for individuals, they noticed that it doesn't tell the whole story.\u000a\u000a"Some people who are labeled overweight by BMI have a broader frame or more muscle," said Courtney Peterson , an assistant professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Department of Nutrition Sciences.\u000a\u000aPeterson said that the most exact ways to measure obesity can be expensive, so BMI became the "next best thing we use" for adults. But, it's important to think of it as only one of several screening tools that "helps show at a quick glance that this person's health may be hurt by their weight, so it is an important thing to measure." More measurements would be needed to tell the whole story, Peterson noted.\u000a\u000aThat's because BMI doesn't distinguish between fat and muscle, which could be a real problem for someone who is athletic. The average football player, for instance, has a BMI of 31.35 , considered obese by these standards. Yet many of these world-class athletes are solid muscle, and the average player probably does not have a level of fat that will threaten their health.\u000a\u000aa study in the journal BMI can also underestimate the threat for people who are "skinny fat," as some doctors call those who tend to be fit, but have big bellies. Studies show that this belly fat can be more dangerous for health than any other kind, anda study in the journal Frontiers in Public Health found that using BMI as the lone measure missed 50% of cases of people who had what was determined to be dangerous fat that could hurt their health.\u000a\u000aPaul Laursen, co-author of that study, prefers the term "overfat" to "overweight," because it really is the fat, rather than the weight , that hurts your health, he said.\u000a\u000a"We shouldn't be as much worried about weight," said Laursen, an adjunct professor and performance physiologist at the Sports Performance Research Institute in New Zealand. For example, you could have gone on a fad diet and lost three pounds, but that doesn't necessarily make you healthier. Those three pounds could merely have been water weight.\u000a\u000a"What we should really be worried about is the fat part and where your fat is concentrated," Laursen said. BMI misses that level of detail.\u000a\u000aGrowing children can also be shortchanged. Peterson's latest study found that BMI was off 19% of the time in children. The BMI measurements used for children are weighted for age, but when boys go through puberty, they add muscle at a rapid rate; girls add fat. BMI tends to miss these nuances.\u000a\u000aBMI can also miss subtle racial differences. Peterson explains that African-Americans tend to have more muscle than fat, compared with Caucasians. Doctors in some countries have had to adjust their BMI ratios because studies have shown that Asians are at a greater risk for heart disease at much lower BMI than non-Asians.\u000a\u000aWhat should doctors use?\u000a\u000aOne of the most exact ways to measure obesity is an X-ray, which can distinguish between fat and other innards. But that is expensive, and regular radiation exposure is not advised, so hospitals and doctors are trying a variety of methods and tools.\u000a\u000aSome hospitals use a highly accurate machine for a bioelectrical impedance analysis , which runs an electric current through body tissue to determine fat composition. The Mayo Clinic's Lopez-Jimenez uses a Bod Pod, which takes measurements based on body volume. He recommends against the scales or handheld devices available on the consumer market, as they are not precise.\u000a\u000aWhere kids are concerned, if you can't get a bioelectrical impedance analysis, Peterson suggests a measurement called TMI , or tri-ponderal body mass index. The calculation is weight divided by height cubed. Her study showed that this was a much better measure of obesity for kids between 8 and 17, particularly boys. TMI misclassified obesity only 8% of the time (versus more than 19% with BMI).\u000a\u000aFor adults, Laursen suggests getting out a tape measure. Measure your circumference at your belly button. If your waist circumference is half your height or less, you are at a healthy fat level, if you are over that number, your fat could put you at risk for ill health.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIf you want something even simpler, look at your hip to waist ratio . It's something even a doctor could eyeball quickly. "If the waist is bigger than the hips, it tells me that the risk carried with that weight is much higher for that person for premature death," Lopez-Jimenez said.

aV(CNN) Tens of thousands of refugees are trapped on the border into Bangladesh without basic food and medicine amid operations by the Myanmar military, which have already killed hundreds.\u000a\u000aSatellite photos released by Human Rights Watch Saturday showed what they are desperate to escape -- entire villages torched to the ground in clashes between Myanmar's armed forces and local militants.\u000a\u000aMore than 73,000 Rohingyas have now fled across the border since August 25, the United Nations said Sunday.\u000a\u000aBut in northern Rakhine State there are reports of at least another 30,000 Rohingyas trapped in hilly terrain without basic supplies of food, water or medicine, according to activists.\u000a\u000aThe Rohingya, a Muslim minority in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, are considered some of the most persecuted people in the world. Myanmar, also known as Burma, considers them Bangladeshi and Bangladesh says they're Burmese.\u000a\u000aIt is the second time in less than a year that a military crackdown has led to a mass exodus.\u000a\u000aRohingya refugees travel on an open-back truck near Kutupalong refugee camp in Ukhiya, Bangladesh, on September 3.\u000a\u000aStranded\u000a\u000aUnable to cross the Naf river into Bangladesh and fearful to return to what's left of their homes, Rohingya activists say the refugees are stranded between Maungdaw and Rathedaung townships.\u000a\u000aVideos provided to CNN by activists show dozens of men, women and children stranded on a mountain, surrounded by dense jungle, living in makeshift shelters made of sticks and sheets.\u000a\u000a"The human lives that are most vulnerable must be rescued immediately without delay," executive director of Burma Human Rights Network, Kyaw Win, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe trapped refugees are just some of at least 100,000 Rohingyas who have been forced to flee their homes since August 25, after armed forces began "clearance operations" across Rakhine State\u000a\u000aThe government blames "terrorists" for starting the violence. Rohingya militants killed 12 security officers in border post attacks two weeks ago, according to state media, intensifying the latest crackdown.\u000a\u000aA top military official said the government was "taking great care in solving the (Rakhine State) problem."\u000a\u000aDue to Myanmar's policy of shutting off all access to Rakhine state for the media, CNN is not able to verify any figures independently or any stories told by refugees.\u000a\u000aVillage burnt down\u000a\u000aHuman Rights Watch renewed its calls for the Myanmar government to allow independent observers into Rakhine State, after releasing troubling satellite photos from inside the region.\u000a\u000a"This new satellite imagery shows the total destruction of a Muslim village, and prompts serious concerns that the level of destruction in northern Rakhine state may be far worse than originally thought," Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe images were taken on August 31 of Chein Khar Li village in northern Rakhine State. According to Human Rights Watch, they show about 700 buildings have been burned down, making up about 99% of the village.\u000a\u000aImages obtained by Human Rights Watch which allegedly show the complete destruction of the Rakhine State village of Chein Khar Li.\u000a\u000a"This is only one of 17 sites that we've located where burnings have taken place," Robertson said.\u000a\u000aReports of villages being burnt down, allegedly by Myanmar's military, previously emerged in a United Nations report investigating the 2016 crackdown on Rohingyas.\u000a\u000aMyanmar's government has blamed the most recent violence and property destruction on Rohingya extremists.\u000a\u000a'Hacking our people to death'\u000a\u000aThe Rohingya have long been persecuted by the Myanmar government. Despite living in the country for generations, they've been denied citizenship and are regularly harassed.\u000a\u000aA separate outbreak of violence in 2016 saw 85,000 Rohingya fleeing across the border, bringing with them horrifying stories of rape, torture and murder inside Rakhine State\u000a\u000aSome refugees who poured across the border into Bangladesh told CNN what they had witnessed since the latest crackdown began two weeks ago.\u000a\u000a"They are beating us, shooting at us and hacking our people to death," Hamida Begum, a refugee who has left everything behind, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"Many people were killed. Many women were raped and killed. We are very poor."\u000a\u000aTop general: Military 'solving the problem'\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, a top Myanmar general issued an defiant statement on the violence in Rakhine State.\u000a\u000aPosted to his Facebook page, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said the only action been taken against "Bengalis" was "to ensure everything is within the framework of the law."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Thousands of Rohingya flee violence in Myanmar Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Thousands of Rohingya flee violence in Myanmar 01:35\u000a\u000a"The Bengali problem was a long-standing one which has become an unfinished job despite the efforts of the previous governments to solve it," he said.\u000a\u000a"The government in office is taking great care in solving the problem."\u000a\u000aIn his post, Gen. Hlaing didn't address protests made by Bangladesh alleging Myanmar's military had violated their airspace on multiple occasions in the past week.\u000a\u000aIn a note sent to Myanmar's embassy in Dhaka on Friday, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs "strongly protested" the incursions and warned it could lead "to an unwarranted situation."\u000a\u000a"Bangladesh demanded Myanmar take immediate measures to prevent recurrence of such incursion in the future," a statement posted to the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry's website said.\u000a\u000aInternational condemnation grows\u000a\u000aOn Sunday night, Indonesia's minister for Foreign Affairs Retno Marsudi flew to Myanmar to request the government cease all violence against the Muslim Rohingya minority.\u000a\u000aIndonesian president Joko Widodo announced the move in a statement , condemning the attacks and demanding real action to help the Rohingyas.

aVMs. Soffer and Ms. Birkner found the emotional and psychological support resources for people in their early adult life-stage lacking. \u201cI went to a family of homicide victims support group run through Safe Horizons in a church basement in Harlem when I was living on the Upper West Side and there was no one in my generation,\u201d said Ms. Birkner, a Brooklyn-based writer and editor. \u201cStill, it did save my life.\u201d Ms. Soffer said she was the only person under 65 at the grief support groups she joined, adding that among those her own age, \u201cI barely know anyone who had lost both their parents.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor a generation known for broadcasting internal monologue across the Internet, some of its members seem eager for spaces to express not just the good stuff that litters everyone\u2019s Facebook newsfeed, but also the painful. In November, Melissa Lafsky Wall, 35, the founder of New York-based Brick Wall Media, turned to Modern Loss after a miscarriage, posting an essay called \u201cThe Silent Sorrow.\u201d \u201cThe Internet should speak to the parts of life that we all experience, but aren\u2019t represented in most media, a large one being grief and loss,\u201d Ms. Wall said, adding that the feedback she got was all positive, which she attributes to the site. \u201cIf you are going to write about your miscarriage on Reddit, for instance, it\u2019s going to be a very different community.\u201d\u000a\u000aModern Loss is a repository of essays, resources and advice that the founders try to edit so that it doesn\u2019t sound glib, overly religious or trite. For instance, you\u2019ll never hear, \u201cAt least they are in a better place.\u201d (\u201cOur least favorite line ever,\u201d Ms. Soffer said.) The website also examines decidedly 21st century topics like what to do when Gmail keeps suggesting someone who has died as a contact, a topic that Esther D. Kustanowitz, the founder of the blog My Urban Kvetch, explored in a post called \u201cDeleting My Mother.\u201d Befitting the target audience, it is not overly earnest. \u201cStay tuned for upcoming Modern Loss events in real life,\u201d the site\u2019s \u201cabout us\u201d page says. \u201cBecause misery loves company, and nachos. And margaritas.\u201d\u000a\u000aMs. Soffer, a former producer at \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d said of the site, \u201cYou have to have a sense of humor.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother mourning site speaking to the younger generation is Lisa Frank Mixtape, promising \u201c90s Music, 21st Century Grief.\u201d Its founder, Zoe Feldman, 29, solicits essays about human loss (sorry, no pets), sending her contributors a mix tape in return for submitting an essay about a human loss they have experienced. Named after the company Lisa Frank, known for its brightly colored products that Ms. Feldman said are to her the antithesis of grief, the venture was inspired after her former girlfriend and Smith College classmate, Rebecca Rosenthal, known as Becca, died in October 2012 at age 27.\u000a\u000a\u201cI went to a Shaman, a healer and every psychiatrist in Manhattan, and the only thing that helped me was talking to people my age who had experienced some devastating loss,\u201d said Ms. Feldman, who works on business strategy for PepsiCo in New York and has mailed around 50 mixtape cassettes (she will burn a CD for those who don\u2019t have a tape player). \u201cOne person wrote and said it\u2019s like being part of a weird, sad tribe,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThose who are accustomed to social media as a way to tout how fabulous your life is, beware: these sites can be unflinchingly graphic and wrenching. In November, K. H. (submitters use their initials on Lisa Frank Mixtape) wrote, \u201cMy dad passed away on May 31, 2003 in my arms as I tried to give him CPR.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aMs. Doughty, the author of a forthcoming book \u201cSmoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons From the Crematory,\u201d to be published by W. W. Norton in September, said she is seeing a cultural shift happening around what she calls \u201cdeath awareness.\u201d Her peers are engaging in more-open and public discussions about mortality and loss, a movement of which her \u201cAsk a Mortician\u201d channel on YouTube is on the frontier.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThe series has received over a million views since 2011, fielding questions such as: \u201cHow do you become a mortician?\u201d (Go to mortuary school) and \u201cCan you bake cremated remains into a chocolate cake?\u201d (Yes, but it\u2019s kind of gross.) On Ms. Doughty\u2019s blog, contributors discuss issues like, \u201cWhat do dead bodies really look like?\u201d and \u201cSuicide is the cause of death. Do you share?\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, \u201cGirls,\u201d the HBO show about young people making their way in modern-day Brooklyn, has twice tackled the issue of grief and death this season, first when Hannah Horvath\u2019s e-book editor, David, is found dead in the Hudson River. \u201cDo you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?\u201d Ms. Horvath asks her editor\u2019s widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\u000a\u000aThe show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual, and therefore more fraught. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you mourning quietly?\u201d asks Adam, Hannah\u2019s boyfriend, after she reads him a part of her editor\u2019s obituary on Gawker, which in real life has a tag called \u201cAnd Now They\u2019re Dead.\u201d Twitter responses to death, like the hashtag RIP, which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer L\u2019Wren Scott\u2019s suicide, can also seem more like display than distress.\u000a\u000aMs. Birkner, a former obituary writer, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the nature of social media, generally, to react thoughtfully to things and think, \u2018How can I really help?\u2019 It would be great if everyone said, \u2018Can I buy your groceries, or can I start a meal train?\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aLast February, on what would have been Ms. Rosenthal\u2019s 28th birthday, Ms. Feldman found a long post on her dead friend\u2019s Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms. Rosenthal had died. \u201cA lot of what she wrote wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. \u201cBecca\u2019s mother was so upset, and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management.\u201d Ms. Feldman\u2019s explanation for that kind of behavior is \u201cperformative grief,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the only excuse I can think of. The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, \u2018look at me\u2019 behavior.\u201d On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, \u201d said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.\u000a\u000aThen there\u2019s the lingua franca of social media \u2014 the like button \u2014 that\u2019s totally discordant with death. \u201cMy God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing \u2018136 people like this\u2019 underneath?\u201d Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a \u201csympathize button,\u201d something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company. (Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, but allows friends and family, depending on privacy setting, to leave posts on the timeline.)\u000a\u000aThe fact that the Internet is perhaps not the best channel for grief (with gaffes immortalized in cyberspace) is why David Fajgenbaum, 28, the founder of National Students of AMF, a support network for college students with sick or deceased parents, said his organization of 40 chapters on campuses has been cautious about integrating an online component. \u201cSomeone could say the wrong thing online, and could really hurt someone,\u201d said Mr. Fajgenbaum, who started the support group in his mother\u2019s memory while an undergraduate at Georgetown.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aMiss Manners, a.k.a. Judith Martin, writes rather unequivocally on the matter. \u201cLetters of condolence should be written by hand,\u201d she said. \u201cBurdensome as it may be, it offers the comfort of knowing that one is representing the deceased to those who cared about him.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut as Mr. Fajgenbaum acknowledged, young people are eager for that virtual connection; after all, technology and the Internet are a ubiquitous part of their existence. That\u2019s what Jason Feifer, 33, creator of the instantly viral Tumblr \u201cSelfies at Funerals,\u201d discovered when he posted a few dozen photos of teenagers taking pictures of themselves at funerals. In doing so, Mr. Feifer, an editor at Fast Company magazine, said he was documenting a newfangled mourning practice. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the older generation to see more than disrespect and to see some kind of genuine communication,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, though, some of the images made him cringe, in particular the young woman who wrote: \u201cLove my hair today. Hate why I\u2019m dressed up #funeral.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Feifer said, \u201cI think there are a lot of kids who saw this Tumblr and will not take a selfie at a funeral, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the kids who did take these photos don\u2019t know how to grieve.\u201d

aVJohn Everard is a former British ambassador to North Korea and a former adviser to the UN. The opinions in this article belong solely to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In a war of words, like the one in which the USA is currently engaged with North Korea, it is essential to use those words effectively. But President Donald Trump is mangling the US's ability to do so.\u000a\u000aIn such an exchange, each state needs three aspects of its words to do three things.\u000a\u000aTheir substance needs to convey exactly what that state means, their register needs to convey how relaxed or how angry it is, and the rank of their speaker needs to show how much authority they carry.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is careful on all three points. It expresses itself in uniquely colorful terms, but it usually uses standard phrases with quite precise meanings and deviates from these phrases only to signal a change in its thinking. The same goes for register.\u000a\u000aNear-hysterical opprobrium of the US is routine and changes in the flamboyant language signal shifts in mood. Paradoxically this means that sometimes when North Korea is really angry, its language is almost sober. And it uses a carefully graded system of speakers to indicate how firm its statements are. At the bottom of the scale, remarks by unnamed state media commentators are often just trial balloons. At the top, any remark attributed to Kim Jong Un is scripture, unchangeable and non-negotiable.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVAugust 16 marks the 40th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death. Presley was one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century, and is frequently referred to as "The King of Rock 'n' Roll."\u000a\u000a(CNN) Big hair, leather jackets and a touch of danger -- these were photographer Denny Renshaw's first impressions of Japan's "Roller-Zoku" gangs.\u000a\u000aInspired by the likes of Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley, Roller-Zoku is a fashion tribe that gained traction in the 1980s when a rock 'n' roll and rockabilly revival swept Japan. The groups are still active today, with regular gatherings and musical performances taking place all over Tokyo.\u000a\u000aFor Renshaw, creating a photo series about the Roller-Zoku gangs has been an evolutionary process. He began collecting images of them in 2013, but he said his first two trips to Japan resulted in an "incomplete" set of photographs.\u000a\u000aIn the hope of completing the series, Renshaw returned to Japan again this year. CNN spoke to him about the unique fashion and subculture of the Roller-Zoku.\u000a\u000aCNN: What does the name Roller-Zoku mean?\u000a\u000aDenny Renshaw: Zoku means "family," though it also roughly translates to "tribe." You'll often hear them call each other "rollers."\u000a\u000aThe tribe gets together once a week -- often on Sundays, like many of Japan's fashion tribes -- and its members (gravitate) around the things they are interested in. I've been to big meetings with 30-plus people, and others with about ten.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did you first come across the Roller-Zoku gangs?\u000a\u000aDR: I was in Tokyo on vacation in 2009, and as we walked around the park, we stumbled upon these incredibly-dressed rockers. They immediately grabbed my attention.\u000a\u000aCNN: What was it about them that caught your eye?\u000a\u000aDR: Their look is so striking -- the big hair and their clothes. They have a swagger about them, and an attitude and style seemed just a touch dangerous.\u000a\u000aI'm originally from Jackson, Tennessee, where rockabilly music is originally from and not far from Memphis. Memphis, of course, is the home of Elvis Presley and SUN recording studios.\u000a\u000aWhen I first saw the Roller-Zoku I was immediately reminded of that influence.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did your first portraits of the Roller-Zoku come about?\u000a\u000aDR: At first, I couldn't find them. Whoever I had spoke to sent me in the wrong direction. I eventually went into a rockabilly record shop and made friends with the owner, who was quite helpful and willing to draw me a map. But he told me that photographing the gang would likely be "impossible."\u000a\u000aHe was partially right. At first the rollers didn't want anything to do with it. I went through a long process of rejection. Even as I began to make friends, I was told that permits and locations would be an issue.\u000a\u000aEventually I managed to shoot a few photographs with some of the connections I had made. But there were just six subjects, which wasn't enough to make a full series. I left with a mini-series that was promising but far from complete.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did you build the collection from there?\u000a\u000aDR: Two years later, I flew back to Japan purely for the sake of completing this series. It was on this trip that I got particularly lucky.\u000a\u000aOne night I was at Shibuya Crossing -- one of the most populated intersections in the world -- and I spotted these rockers getting out of a taxi with a guitar. I stopped one of them and asked where they were playing.\u000a\u000aIt happened to be the birthday party for Pitpi, one of the original vocalists of The Cools -- a 70s Japanese band that was very important to the rock 'n' roll revival in Japan -- and they asked me to join, so I did.\u000a\u000aWhen I looked around, I realized the people I had traveled around the world to photograph were here in front of me. I approached some of the attendees to see if they'd let me take their photographs, but initially there was a lot of polite resistance.\u000a\u000aBut then I asked Pitpi (whose birthday they were celebrating) if I could photograph him. Because he said yes, the audience members in the bar also started saying yes.\u000a\u000aThis was a crucial moment in growing the photo series.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did your approach differ on your most recent visit to Japan?\u000a\u000aDR: This time I focused on building the relationships that I'd forged in 2013. This trip was more organized, and I used my connections. On the trip before, I was basically hanging by a thread.\u000a\u000aCNN: What is it about the Roller-Zoku that makes them so unique?\u000a\u000aDR: When rockabilly and rock 'n' roll music were first introduced to Japan, they were marketed as just one idea. In Japan, the two genres are often simply referred to as "rock 'n' roll," which is something particularly unique.\u000a\u000aAnother -- and perhaps more obvious -- answer is the large and extravagant hairdos. They are called pompadours in the West, but in Japan the hairstyle is called a regent.\u000a\u000aSome members shave in a receding hairline to achieve a more authentic hairdo. They can spend hours on their hair. The guy with the biggest hair that I've seen is part of a gang called Black Shadow -- one of the original Roller Zoku gangs -- and he apparently spends one and a half to two hours a day on it, but says at times he has spent as much as four to five hours.

aV(CNN) Peyton West's parents would never have thought that his first day of school this year was going to be his last.\u000a\u000aThe 13-year-old had survived a heart transplant in March and spent the past five months living a full and fun life, said his father, Corey West. He developed a passion for food, especially Mexican. Soccer became his favorite sport, and he would watch FC Cincinnati professional games with his dad. It wasn't a coincidence that it had been his heart donor, Derek's, favorite sport, too.\u000a\u000a"Peyton thought, 'hey, if Derek loved soccer, then I love soccer,' " West said.\u000a\u000aPeyton woke up on Thursday excited for his first day of eighth grade in Goshen, Ohio. He was being goofy, West said, and the family took a photo of him smiling on their front porch. But 15 minutes later, when older brother Ethan dropped him off at school, everything changed.\u000a\u000aHe told Ethan he didn't feel well and then collapsed, West said. Ethan carried him to the school nurse's office. An ambulance rushed the boy to the hospital before his mother, Melissa, joined them.\u000a\u000aThe medics told Melissa West that they were quick to leave because Peyton's heart had stopped and it was a sight that no mother should see, West said.\u000a\u000aDoctors tried for 2½ hours to revive him, but Peyton died at the hospital.\u000a\u000aHalf of a heart\u000a\u000aPeyton was born November 6, 2003, with hypoplastic left heart syndrome\u000a\u000a"Basically, you're born missing the left side of the heart," said Dr. Emile Bacha, chief officer of cardiac surgery at Columbia University Medical Center. "Instead of having two ventricles, you only have one ventricle."\u000a\u000aVentricles are the two chambers in the heart that pump blood throughout the body. The condition requires three open-heart surgeries to allow the right ventricle to function on its own normally, Bacha said.\u000a\u000aPeyton had his third surgery at age 5, West said, and nearly died. He sustained brain damage and had to relearn how to walk and talk. But over the next few years, he kept up his spirits.\u000a\u000a"He was so positive and so happy, and even when he was sick, someone would walk in, and he'd just smile. He'd just light up a room with his smile," West said.\u000a\u000aPeyton's story made the news in 2013 when he decided to go on the field and score his first 65-yard touchdown for his football team. Since he couldn't fully participate in sports, he helped coach the basketball team at school and lived vicariously through his brothers' football experiences, West said.\u000a\u000aIn January, the doctors told Peyton's parents that his heart was failing and that he was "teetering on the edge," West said. He needed a heart transplant. On March 9, a heart became available, and Peyton went in for transplant surgery at Cincinnati Children's Hospital that afternoon.\u000a\u000aOver the next few months, he began to feel better, according to West.\u000a\u000aWhat went wrong?\u000a\u000aPeyton's family and doctors are still unsure what went wrong with his heart last week.\u000a\u000aThe Cincinnati Children's Hospital Heart Failure and Transplant Program, where Peyton was treated during his transplant and final moments, said it could not comment on the case.\u000a\u000aBacha said that the course of Peyton's death was unusual for someone in his situation and that there would typically be a much longer period of not feeling well, allowing more time for medical intervention.\u000a\u000a"The rapidity of his demise is surprising, really surprising," said Bacha, who had not treated Peyton or seen his medical records.\u000a\u000aIt could be that his body was rejecting the new organ, which manifested in an abnormal heart rhythm. Or any number of other things may have occurred, he said, like a strange infection.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAn autopsy was performed Friday, and the results, which Peyton's parents hope will shed some light on the case, are pending.\u000a\u000aThe Wests agreed to donate his body parts in hopes of saving someone else's life.\u000a\u000a"When they asked the question, 'Do you want him to donate?' I looked at the doctor, and part of me just for a brief second wanted to say no, because the boy had been through four ... surgeries, so many struggles," his father said. "But obviously, it didn't take another half-second to say 'absolutely,' because organ donation is what saved Peyton's life and was able to give him the five months of full, fun life."\u000a\u000aVisitation for Peyton is Tuesday at Goshen High School. His funeral service is scheduled for Wednesday at Eastside Christian Church in Milford, Ohio.\u000a\u000aThe family of Derek Cisneros, Peyton's heart donor, will also be in attendance, West said. They love Peyton and call him their son, and Peyton loved them, too.\u000a\u000a"He always said, 'I wish I could have met Derek,' and you know, now he's in heaven playing soccer and football with Derek," West said.

aVAnnie Ivanova is a curator, entrepreneur and author. The following is an edited excerpt from her new book "Taiwan by Design: 88 products for better living."\u000a\u000a(CNN) The tag "Made in Taiwan" has come a long way since the island first emerged as a post-war manufacturing powerhouse.\u000a\u000aOnce the source of many of the world's cheap goods, Taiwan had become a global force in electronics industry by 1990s. In the process, industrial design has moved away from traditional low-cost production to the creation of original, high-value products.\u000a\u000aNow, the island's creative industries are striving to replace the once-ubiquitous "made in Taiwan" with a label befitting of the present day: "Designed in Taiwan"\u000a\u000aThe seeds of industry\u000a\u000aTaiwan's mass manufacturing history dates back to the 1950s, when the government signed a mutual defense treaty with the United States (that agreement expired in 1979 and was partly replaced by the Taiwan Relations Act). Needing a powerful regional ally, America poured foreign aid and investment into the island's economy.\u000a\u000aThis suited Taiwan's technocratic government planners as they sought to spearhead industrialization based on the US model. By adopting American know-how, manufacturing businesses expanded rapidly and profitably.\u000a\u000aBy implementing Western industrial processes and using cheap domestic labor, businesses -- making new electrical appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, television sets and radios -- became highly self-sufficient and capable of producing almost anything demanded by overseas clients. Taiwan became a manufacturing hub for some of the world's most powerful brands.\u000a\u000aAn IT powerhouse\u000a\u000aThen in the 1990s, state initiatives and home-grown ingenuity had brought about a second wave of industrial boom. No longer just the world's factory, the growing electronics sector made Taiwan one of the "Four Asian Tigers."\u000a\u000aSome of most robust technology companies in the world were established in Taiwan during this era, including ASUS, Acer and Quanta Computer. These domestic IT powerhouses produced a vast range of items, from desktop computers, tablets, flat screens and phones, to motherboards, graphic cards and servers.\u000a\u000aBut the market liberalization of the 1990s enabled companies to trade globally, challenging the very factories that had created Taiwan's prosperity. As they were no longer able to offer competitive advantage, foreign investors started relocating. Many previously thriving industries slowed down; places once vibrant with activity sunk into ghost towns.\u000a\u000aDesign destination\u000a\u000aFoldable bench by Elvis Chang and Homer Concept.\u000a\u000aCultural reinvention and economic renewal would only arise through a new wave of design thinking. In addition to making goods for overseas buyers, Taiwanese companies would need to focus on investing in their own intellectual property if they were to emerge from the depths of the downturn unscathed.\u000a\u000aThey did. Designers have learned from previous generations that adaptability, matched with efficiency and high quality, is essential to remaining relevant. Today, Taiwan's patents registration per capita is exceeded only by the US and Japan, ranking it amongst Asia's most knowledge-driven economies.\u000a\u000aThe island remains a major figure in the electronics industry, and is still one of the world's biggest producers of computer chips and LCD panels, among much else. But premium household goods and covetable furniture are among the many design innovations now coming out of Taiwan.\u000a\u000aScroll through the gallery above for examples of products designed in Taiwan.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000aHow are you? It must be so exhausting running for President. I hope you're taking good care of yourself.\u000a\u000aI happened to be flipping through the channels on Thursday night when I saw you talking to Donald Trump at the Republican debate about what you called "New York values." I wasn't sure at first what you meant, but then you explained: "I think most people know exactly what New York values are: socially liberal, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, focused on money and the media."\u000a\u000aFor a moment I actually thought Mr. Trump was speechless, but duh, he's a New Yorker like me, and nobody cherishes the First Amendment more than us!\u000a\u000aAnyway, it's a new day.\u000a\u000aAnd I just took a car service home from my fiance's apartment on the Upper East Side. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with the UES. It's in Manhattan on the opposite side of Central Park where you had that fundraiser at those two gay guys' apartment in April? I hope that while you were here, you and your wife had time to visit the Goldman Sachs' headquarters to thank them for that big loan they gave you.\u000a\u000aJudy Gold\u000a\u000aI bet you saw the building as your plane was landing; it's one of those huge towers downtown by ground zero. Maybe you didn't have enough time, since you never know how the traffic is going to be on the George Washington Bridge when you're driving in from the airport.\u000a\u000aI live on the Upper West Side and my girlfriend and I are planning to get married as soon as we can find a big enough apartment to comfortably fit all four of us (two kids included). Both our apartments are rent stabilized, so we're taking our time finding the right place. If you're not familiar with the rent laws in New York, you should check them out.\u000a\u000an 1997 , our Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, extended rent regulation laws after a big to-do with Republican State Sen. Joseph L. Bruno, who wanted them eliminated. Thank goodness, our mayor had two important allies: Republican State Sens. Roy Goodman of Manhattan and Frank Padavan of Queens, who both agreed with the Democratic-controlled State Assembly.\u000a\u000aHave you ever been to Queens, Ted? It's the most racially diverse county in the contiguous United States . My favorite Greek restaurant is in Astoria. Do you like Greek food? It's yummy. Asghar, my driver, and I were talking about how many great places there are to eat here in NYC. He was born in Pakistan, and moved here as a baby. He married a woman from Colombia and their two kids are just beautiful, and get this -- they're also tri-lingual! They speak English, Urdu and Spanish. I must admit that I'm a little jealous about that.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Republican presidential candidates line up on stage before a debate Thursday, January 14, in North Charleston, South Carolina. From left are Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Jeb Bush. It is the sixth GOP debate of this election cycle and the first of 2016. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Trump, who has been leading GOP polls for months, answers a question during the debate. "I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly, and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger," he said. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Cruz speaks during the debate. The senator from Texas opened the event by talking about the U.S. sailors recently detained by Iran. "Today," he said, "many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads. ... I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America." Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Bush waves to the audience. The former Florida governor has been trying to build momentum that he had in the early stages of his candidacy, and he went after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton early in the debate. "She's under investigation with the FBI right now," he said. "If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that." Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Rubio delivers an answer during the debate. He frequently attacked President Barack Obama. "When I become president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders," the senator from Florida said. "When I'm president of the United States, we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military." Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Carson promised this week he would "insinuate" himself into the conversation when needed. After a discussion between Rubio and Christie during the debate, Carson told moderator Neil Cavuto, "Neil I was mentioned too." Cavuto asked, "You were?" Carson quipped, "Yeah, he said everybody." On a more serious note, Carson noted the "divisiveness and the hatred" in today's society. "We have a war on virtually everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imagine, we have people at each other's throat," he said. "And our strength is actually in our unity." Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Kasich touted his economic record as governor of Ohio. "Our wages are growing faster than the national average," he said. "We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life." Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Christie, like most of the candidates on stage, continued to be tough on the current administration. "Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama," he said of the recent State of the Union address. Christie also said "you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership. I will not do that. If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House."

Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, delivers remarks during the debate. "The biggest reason that we're seeing the hollowing out of middle America is the breakdown of the American family," he said. "We have been too politically correct in this country because we don't want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children." Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Fiorina makes a point during the undercard debate. "The state of our economy is not strong," she said in her opening comments. "We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them. ... It's time to take our country back." Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Huckabee laughs during the debate, which was hosted by the Fox Business Network. His opening statement was much more serious. "There are a lot of people who are hurting today," said the former Arkansas governor. "I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way he's managing it." Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aHey, I heard that you are a huge fan of "The Princess Bride." Me, too!! Did you know that they are talking about bringing it to Broadway? That would be so amazing, because William Goldman wrote the book right here in NYC!\u000a\u000aHave you seen any Broadway shows recently? I think you would just LOVE "Hamilton." Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote it and it's very historical. He's from Washington Heights and he's so talented. I'm warning you that it's hard to get tickets, but I'm sure you have some "in" somewhere. And check out "Kinky Boots" and "Fun Home" if you can. You won't be sorry!\u000a\u000aI wish I had more time to write, but I have so much to do.

aV(CNN) His rhymes are reminiscent of the gangster rap of 50 Cent, but instead of a do-rag and six-pack, baby-faced teenage rapper Rich Chigga sports a pink polo and fanny pack.\u000a\u000aIndonesian-born Rich Chigga, whose viral hit "Dat $tick" has racked up more than 50 million views online, is the principal -- and some say unlikely -- face of a new generation of edgy, young Asian hip-hop acts, whose growing popularity among US audiences is helping to subvert Asian music stereotypes.\u000a\u000aBorn Brian Imanuel, 17-year-old Rich Chigga is signed to 88 Rising, a Brooklyn-based record label responsible for acts such as Korean rapper Keith Ape , Chinese hip-hop group Higher Brothers and Joji , a Japanese-Australian producer who kicked off the Harlem Shake meme video phenomenon.\u000a\u000a"We want to push the culture forward," said 88 Rising head Sean Miyashiro. "We're not trying to break stereotypes or change people's mindsets. We're showing people what we can do, by doing what we do."\u000a\u000aMiyashiro, a Japanese-Korean Brooklynite, founded the label in early 2016 after leaving his job at Vice Media's electronic music platform Thump. "At first it's a wild visual to see, somebody Asian rapping that way, killing it in a video," said Miyashiro of the label's appeal.\u000a\u000aThe company, which is known for its slew of massive viral video hits and collaborations with established American artists such as Ghostface Killah and Skrillex, has reached a sort of cult status among fans, especially those in Asia.\u000a\u000a"Our artists and our brand is the most influential in Asia because we aren't coming from some manufactured pop machine. We are the tip of the sphere of a new face of music," said Miyashiro. "The reason for that is we are the first label that actually is making impact in the West and East."\u000a\u000aJapanese-Korean Brooklynite Sean Miyashiro\u000a\u000aStraight outta China\u000a\u000aBut 88 Rising acts are not the first Asian faces to make inroads in America.\u000a\u000aIn 2004, Chinese American rapper MC Jin made headlines after winning numerous freestyle battles, before later signing to the well-known hip-hop label Ruff Ryders.\u000a\u000a"It was good that Jin and people like that existed to trailblaze the way, but it's a completely different era now," said Miyashiro. "I think with social media, people are used to seeing Asian people in general ... and the world is more open."\u000a\u000aCompared with MC Jin's debut single "Learn Chinese," Higher Brothers' online hit "Made in China" offers more of a nuanced take on modern Asian identity. Both songs mix English and Chinese lyrics, but the Higher Brothers go deeper, poking fun at themselves. (Sample lyric: "My chains, new gold watch, made in China. We play ping-pong ball, made in China.") In the video, which has so far racked up more than 3 million hits on YouTube, they don China Olympics track suits and Chun Li-style buns, all the while rapping in a slow Dirty South-like drawl.\u000a\u000aUnlike themes common in US hip-hop, the Higher Brothers rap about their everyday lives, with songs about 7-11 convenience stores and the social media platform WeChat. Their lyrics alternate between the profane and the profound. One of their emcees, Melo, even got in trouble with China's notorious censors over a viral song about Uber that featured the lines, "I don't write political hip-hop. But if any politicians try to shut me up, I'll cut off their heads and lay them at their corpses' feet."\u000a\u000aWe're "straight outta China!" said band member MasiWei of the band's unique style and attitude, adding that "nothing" is off limits to the group.\u000a\u000aHigher Brothers, who have four singles off their latest album "Black Cab," attribute their new-found popularity with American audiences to 88 Rising.\u000a\u000a"It's so exciting. We're all Asian, but we have a different culture and style," said MasiWei, of working with the label.\u000a\u000aThe 24-year-old added that while language can sometimes be a barrier, their goals are "the same."\u000a\u000aChengdu rap crew HIgher Brothers\u000a\u000a"Generally, people are very supportive," said Rich Chigga, who is ethnically Chinese. "When I came to America [for his summer five-city tour] and I met with all these rappers I talked to online, they showed a lot of love ... There was probably just a few racist YouTube comments, but that was really it."\u000a\u000aBrian Imanuel, better known as "Rich Chigga," in Miami\u000a\u000aIn some ways, their paths seem to be easier than their Asian-American counterparts'.\u000a\u000a"We grow up in America, getting slotted into a lane and having to follow the American societal norms, political norms, etc., but these guys are free from all that," said Andrew Fung, half of Fung Bros ., a Chinese-American duo popular on YouTube, who collaborated with Higher Brothers. "They're Asian from Asian countries, so there's cultural space for them to be more fluid. They get to be who they want to be, say what they want to say and it's refreshing."\u000a\u000aUp next for 88 Rising are more tours and more artists, as well as maybe adding a female artist to the lineup. Rich Chigga just finished a summer tour and is going on a wider US tour in the fall. Higher Brothers is playing a China-wide tour, with a sold-out concert in Hong Kong in August and a November appearance at Clockenflap , Hong Kong's massive music festival, whose lineup includes Massive Attack, Feist and The Dandy Warhols.\u000a\u000aJoji, Keith Ape and Rich Chigga\u000a\u000a88 Rising is also bringing American artists to Asia.\u000a\u000a"People are coming to us to collaborate now. We're the tastemakers," said Miyashiro. "They want to be big in Asia and appreciate our freshness and unique point of view."

aV(CNN) When you've banked just shy of $50 million in career earnings, what's left to play for? How about another $10 million as a bonus for winning the PGA Tour's end-of-season FedExCup points tally?\u000a\u000aThat's the prospect facing world No.1 Dustin Johnson after he beat Jordan Spieth in a playoff at the first FedExCup event Sunday to take his season earnings to $8.4 million.\u000a\u000aThe 33-year-old Johnson leads the rankings with three events left in US golf's big-money run-in.\u000a\u000aStay top, and Johnson will trouser a cool $10 million -- with $1 million deferred to his retirement account -- to add to any additional prize money. The winner's cheque at the Tour Championship is $1.575 million. Finish second in the FedExCup, and the bonus drops to $3 million.\u000a\u000aBut Johnson, who missed the Masters with a freak injury on the eve of the event, won't have it all his own way.

aV(CNN) Can the sight of a greenish-brown color really be enough to deter smokers from reaching for their next pack of cigarettes?\u000a\u000aLawmakers in the UK hope the "world's ugliest color" will be helpful in lowering smoking rates in their country. In May, previously passed legislation will go into effect requiring all packs of cigarettes to be standardized. Tobaccos products will be stripped of brightly colored branding and replaced with a sludge-like color.\u000a\u000aBut does the stripped-down, "ugly" packaging really reduce smoking?\u000a\u000aResearchers from the UK and Canada summarized several studies that look at the impact of tobacco packaging on consumer attitudes and behavior. Their findings were published today in a Cochrane Review\u000a\u000aJamie Hartmann-Boyce of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, co-author of the review, noted that "the evidence we have so far suggests that standardized packaging may reduce smoking prevalence and increase quit attempts."\u000a\u000aThe UK law, passed last year, is similar to a cigarette standardization plan Australia enacted in 2012, which also features graphic health warnings and standardized fonts.\u000a\u000aThe muddy color -- Pantone 448C -- was chosen after marketing research company GfK Bluemoon was commissioned to develop ideas for unappealing cigarette packing. The agency asked Australian smokers about colors they found unappealing and overwhelming. Pantone 448 C was later named "the world's ugliest color."\u000a\u000aRespondents reportedly associated the color with the words "dirty," "tar" and "death."\u000a\u000aI used to feature so much in all your 70s couches, curtains and wallpapers. What did I do to deserve this? \u2014 Pantone 448 C (@Pantone448C) August 17, 2012\u000a\u000aDeterring bathroom breaks\u000a\u000aCigarette and tobacco packaging is not the first time the murky shade has been used in an attempt to turn people away from certain behaviors. According to Angela Wright, a color consultant and author of "The Beginner's Guide to Colour Psychology," the technique has been around for decades.\u000a\u000aShe cites American color consultant Faber Birren, who in the 1960s devised a way to stop department store employees from taking lengthy bathroom breaks.\u000a\u000a"The company asked him, 'Can you improve the working area so they don't have to leave all the time and use the restrooms?' " Wright said.\u000a\u000a"Birren actually took a different view and painted the restrooms in a color similar to Pantone 448C. And nobody wanted to spend time in the restrooms after that."\u000a\u000aThis is just one of the many examples that the "world's ugliest color" has been used to minimize appeal to control human behavior.\u000a\u000aIs Pantone 448C really that bad?\u000a\u000aWhat makes Pantone 448C so off-putting? Wright said she believes it's the association with human waste.\u000a\u000a"It makes perfect sense that smoking packets would use a vile green that looks like bodily fluids and makes people feel slightly nauseated," she said.\u000a\u000aBut not everyone agrees.\u000a\u000aFrance will also introduce plain cigarette packaging.\u000a\u000a"I actually quite like the color," said psychologist Dr. Carolyn Mair of the London College of Fashion, UAL. "It's an earthy, muted, rich color, very much of nature. But then I also don't smoke."\u000a\u000aColor in advertising\u000a\u000aThe use of color can play a key role in brand perception among the public.\u000a\u000a"Blue is often used in services such as banking and law because of its association with loyalty, honesty and reliability," Mair said. Red meanwhile "raises the pulse rate ... and communicates strength and high energy," Wright said.\u000a\u000aColor associations Red: Strength, energy, passion Blue: Focus, loyalty, calmness Yellow: Ego, optimism, openness Green: Balance, youth, eco-friendly Purple: Luxury, femininity, glamour Sources: Angela Wright, Carolyn Mair\u000a\u000a"Football teams who have red uniforms are giving themselves more physical energy but also communicating to the opposite team that they are powerful and strong."\u000a\u000aAnd purple has connotations with luxury, Mair said.\u000a\u000a"Think of Cadbury chocolate (which has a purple logo). At least when it started out, it had the association with a glamorous, smooth, feminine brand," she added.\u000a\u000aColor combinations can also have powerful connotations.\u000a\u000aIn the UK, the Esso petrol logo features red, white and blue -- much like many national flags, including those of the United States, Great Britain and France.\u000a\u000a"So this combination can result in an instinctive loyalty," Wright said.\u000a\u000aThe eye of the beholder\u000a\u000aThat said, perception also plays a huge role -- as seen in Wright's and Mair's different responses to Pantone 448C.\u000a\u000a"Red could be seen as aggressive and demanding -- or as exhilarating and exciting," Wright said. "Similarly, blue could be perceived as calming and well-thought-through -- or excessively bureaucratic and emotionless."\u000a\u000aWright sees the overwhelming color of our times as a bleak gray.\u000a\u000a"Gray is the color of austerity," Wright said. "And we're going to keep wearing gray until we feel better financially."\u000a\u000aThat is, unless you feel compelled to lighten things with a splash of Pantone 448C.

At the heart of the country's digital payments boom are QR codes, two-dimensional images made up of a series of black and white squares.\u000a\u000aIn the U.S. and Europe, QR codes (short for "quick response") never really took off. They are slowly becoming more common in social media apps: Snapchat (SNAP), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Spotify have been pushing their users to scan the barcodes to unlock new filters, add friends or access playlists.\u000a\u000aBut in China, QR codes are everywhere -- used by major retailers, street markets and even beggars and buskers.\u000a\u000aRelated: Pay with your face at this KFC in China\u000a\u000a"The market is colossal and it is still growing," said Shen Wei, deputy director of the a research institute that specializes in QR codes. He estimates that more than $1.65 trillion of transactions used the codes last year, accounting for about a third of all mobile payments in China.\u000a\u000aTencent's (TCTZF) WeChat Pay and Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) spinoff Alipay are the dominant mobile payment apps in China. People can use them to pay in a store by scanning a product's QR code or showing their personal code to the cashier. The money is deducted from mobile wallets that are usually linked to regular bank accounts.\u000a\u000a'If you don't do it, you will lose out'\u000a\u000aThe codes are easy to create and use, making them popular with small retailers and street vendors who don't take credit cards, said Pan Helin, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences.\u000a\u000aThey've started cropping up in all kinds of situations.\u000a\u000aIn April, Chinese media carried photos of a bridesmaid in Beijing who wore a QR code around her neck to collect gifts of money for the bride and groom, reportedly upsetting the groom's mother with the unorthodox behavior. Chinese wedding guests traditionally hand over money in red envelopes, but the bridesmaid said wearing the QR code would help people who forgot to bring enough cash with them.\u000a\u000aRelated: How to land a job in China's booming tech sector\u000a\u000aBut because the codes are so simple and accessible, they are also vulnerable to scammers who can try to trick users into scanning ones that install viruses designed to steal money or personal information.\u000a\u000aBusiness owners say they can't afford not to use QR codes.\u000a\u000a"If you don't do it, you will lose out on revenue," said Alan Wong, an American businessman who owns 15 Japanese restaurants in Shanghai and Beijing.\u000a\u000aWong added QR code payments at his restaurants less than two years ago and says he expects them to account for 70% of transactions in the near future.\u000a\u000aBusiness cards, bikes and bills\u000a\u000aBeyond payments, the codes are now used for all sorts of services in China, like exchanging business cards and renting bikes.\u000a\u000aChinese authorities are also getting on board.\u000a\u000aIn Hangzhou, where Alibaba is headquartered, the local government has connected several public services to Alipay.

aV(CNN) Of all of the odd couples created by Donald Trump's presidency, none was odder than Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus.\u000a\u000aBannon was the blustering bomb-thrower of Breitbart News fame/infamy. Priebus was the poster boy of the Republican establishment. And yet, according to all accounts in the early days of the Trump White House, the two men got along famously. They loved each other! Mutt! Jeff!\u000a\u000aBannon and Priebus appeared onstage together at CPAC in February after Trump took office.\u000a\u000aBannon and Priebus appeared onstage together at CPAC in February after Trump took office. 02:34\u000a\u000aBannon and Priebus appeared onstage together at CPAC in February after Trump took office.\u000a\u000aTurns out they were slightly less chummy than we were all led to believe.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with Charlie Rose set to air on "60 Minutes" this Sunday, Bannon slams Priebus for his reaction to the pre-election release of the 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape in which candidate Trump tells host Billy Bush of his interactions with women : "Grab them by the p--sy. You can do anything."\u000a\u000aBannon recounts a meeting Trump called in the days following the tape's release that he and Priebus attended. Here's Bannon's recollection of it:\u000a\u000aTrump went around the room and asked people the percentages he thought of -- of still winning and what the recommendation. And Reince started off and Reince said, 'You have -- you have two choices. You either drop out right now, or you lose by the biggest landslide in American political history.' And Trump, with his humor goes, 'That's a great way -- that's a great way to start our -- start our conversation.'"\u000a\u000aBannon goes on to add that he spoke last and told Trump he had a "100 percent" chance of winning as long as he stuck to his core message and ignored the "Access Hollywood" stuff as much as possible.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Donald Trump responds to lewd 2005 comments Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump responds to lewd 2005 comments 01:31\u000a\u000a"He goes, 'Come on, it's not 100 percent,'" Bannon says of Trump. "I go, 'It's absolutely 100 percent.' And I told him why. 'They don't care.'"\u000a\u000aFor Bannon, that "Billy Bush Saturday" was a critical defining moment. He told Rose\u000a\u000a"Billy Bush Saturday showed me who really had Donald Trump's back to play to his better angels. All you had to do, and what he did, was go out and continue to talk to the American people. ... People didn't care. They knew Donald Trump was just doing locker room talk with a guy. And they dismissed it. It had no lasting impact on the campaign. Yet, if you see the mainstream media that day, it was, literally, he was falling into Dante's Inferno."\u000a\u000a(Side note: Bannon is arguing here that Trump following his "better angels" meant ignoring the deeply misogynistic comments he made about women simply because voters didn't care.)\u000a\u000aTo Bannon, his time with Trump can be divided between pre-"Access Hollywood" and post-"Access Hollywood." That moment crystallized for him who was really all in on Trump and who was still part of the GOP mainstream -- protecting their own interests rather than standing firm in their commitment to Trump.\u000a\u000aBannon was on one side of that line. Priebus was the leading voice on the other.\u000a\u000aBut, hey, once Trump actually got elected, Bannon forgot all about that moment right? Um, no.\u000a\u000aCheck out this exchange between Bannon and Rose:\u000a\u000aRose: Boy, you took names on Billy Bush Saturday, didn't you?\u000a\u000aBannon: I did. O -- I gotta -- I gotta -- you know, I'm Irish. I gotta get my black book and I got 'em. ... Christie, because of Billy Bush weekend -- and -- was -- was -- not looked at for a Cabinet position.\u000a\u000aRose: He wasn't there for you on Billy Bush weekend so therefore he doesn't get a Cabinet position?\u000a\u000aBannon: I told him, "The plane leaves at 11 o'clock in the morning. If you're on the plane, you're on the team." Didn't make the plane.\u000a\u000aWhile that passage is about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- another attendee of the "Billy Bush Saturday" meeting -- the lesson applies to Priebus too.\u000a\u000aPriebus and Bannon may have found common cause in the White House. But, Bannon makes clear in this interview with Rose that he never really trusted Priebus to be loyal to Trump after the "Access Hollywood" moment.\u000a\u000aWhich, if you think about it makes sense. Bannon is the consummate outsider, far more comfortable charging the gates than defending them. Priebus is a guy who built his career on effectively coloring within the lines, following the rules laid out by the defenders of the status quo.\u000a\u000aBut, what Bannon's recollection of "Billy Bush Saturday" does do is put to lie the idea that he and Priebus were great friends and comrades in arms. They weren't, at least according to Bannon.

aVHackers can unlock a high-tech Tesla car door by using the same run-of-the-mill techniques they use to crack open computers.\u000a\u000aThat's according to security researcher Nitesh Dhanjani, who spoke about his findings at a recent hacker conference in Singapore. All it takes is cracking a six-character password, considered low-hanging fruit in the cyber security world.\u000a\u000aAnd if it can happen to a Tesla (TSLA), other cars may also be susceptible. After all, many modern cars made by others like Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) can also be controlled via computer and mobile phone apps and come equipped with wireless connections that tap into Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell phone networks.\u000a\u000a"We now have ways of accessing our cars we never did before, and consumers aren't quite aware of that. Hackers will try to take advantage of that lack of awareness," said Erik Cabetas, managing partner at the consulting firm Include Security.\u000a\u000aDhanjani said today's cars should be held to a higher security standard than the average laptop. Not only are they more expensive, but losing control of a car can put lives in danger.\u000a\u000a"We can't attempt to secure our vehicles the way we have attempted to secure our workstations at home," Dhanjani, who advises companies on computer security, said in a blog post. "The implications to physical security and privacy in this context have raised stakes to the next level."\u000a\u000aRelated story: Tesla and Audi to become AT&T cars\u000a\u000aDhanjani was especially worried about Teslas.\u000a\u000aTesla owners must create a password-protected online account, which lets them use a smartphone app to access car locks, locate a car, and also see how much its batteries are charged. A single password gives complete access to an account, which is a problem, according to Dhanjani.\u000a\u000aHe also found that Tesla's website didn't lock users out even if someone typed several incorrect passwords. That opens up the site to what's known as "brute-force attacks," where a computer tries thousands of passwords per second until it breaks in. On Monday afternoon, Tesla updated its requirements, locking out users after five incorrect attempts, Dhanjani said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aDhanjani learned about this firsthand when he bought his own Tesla Model S P85+ three weeks ago. He noticed the single password requirements, and decided to test the system by submitting a wrong password 150 times straight. It never locked him out, nor did it ask for the jumbled letters that keeps automated hacker attacks at bay.\u000a\u000aRelated story: Tesla reaches deal to keep selling in New York\u000a\u000aDespite the findings, Dhanjani said he isn't uneasy about his own car and can't wait to get back from vacation to drive the Model S parked at home in Bellevue, Wa.\u000a\u000aHowever, he's concerned about the security of a Tesla, especially if it were to be the security standard for electric cars.\u000a\u000a"The time is right now for Tesla to fix this," Dhanjani said. "As other car manufacturers draw inspiration from Tesla's design and architecture, there will be more people to compromise and launch attacks against."

aVThe soft-spoken 26-year-old with a "Peace Love Tai Chi" T-shirt flowed into a grounded stance on a Long Beach, California, hilltop. He was among several dozen people taking a free tai chi class this warm July day.\u000a\u000a"I do tai chi to reconnect my mind, body and spirit, as well as to strengthen my muscles, loosen my joints, get my body relaxed," York said.\u000a\u000aWhat is tai chi?\u000a\u000aTai chi is an ancient martial art developed in China that's often referred to as a "moving meditation."\u000a\u000a"It takes the principles that we've observed in nature and uses it as a martial art," said Daniel Hoover, tai chi master, chiropractor and owner of School of Healing Martial Arts in Long Beach. Hoover gives a free class every Sunday on this hill.\u000a\u000aTai chi's slow, graceful movements are accompanied by deep circular breathing. Though tai chi is practiced slowly for health benefits -- stress relief, improved balance and flexibility -- it can be sped up and used as a fighting form in very advanced classes.\u000a\u000aChinese physicians prescribe tai chi as a gymnastic form of medicine to complement other traditional treatments such as acupuncture and herbs, according to tai chi master Terry Dunn, who helped popularize it in the West.\u000a\u000aThe movements are working with what is called "qi" or life force, a type of "flow" that, according to tai chi practitioners, everyone has.\u000a\u000a"Within every tai chi movement is the principle of yin and yang. The idea that there is unity within opposites: positive and negative, full and empty, dark and light, hard and soft, cause and effect," writes Dunn\u000a\u000aMillennials are taking up tai chi to reduce stress and become more "grounded."\u000a\u000aEach posture has a classical Chinese name, such as "Wave Hands Like Clouds," "Golden Rooster Stands on One Leg," "High Pat the Horse," "White Crane Cools Its Wings" and "Shoot Tiger with Bow."\u000a\u000aBeyond just the forms, there is sparring called "push hands," in which two practitioners try to unbalance one another by redirecting the other's energy.\u000a\u000aThough studies show that most of those who practice tai chi are 50 years old and up, several instructors report a renewed interest among younger folks looking for an antidote to stress.\u000a\u000aYoung practitioners looking for peace\u000a\u000aYork does tai chi three times a week, which he says helps him be more patient and go with the flow.\u000a\u000a"I live in Southern California, so driving on the freeways, it can be tempting to rush through traffic and go as fast as you can," he said. "But since I've been doing tai chi, I've been able to stop and pull back and just be like 'all right, here I am in the flow. I'm going to go with it, and if it's slow, that's OK.' "\u000a\u000aIt also helps him be more patient in his job as classroom aide for special-needs children.\u000a\u000a"A couple of times I have guided them through some breathing exercises, and within minutes, they're more focused. I'm more relaxed, they're more relaxed, and we're able to move on to the lessons," York said.\u000a\u000aDunn, who has been teaching tai chi in Los Angeles for more than three decades, says that in the past year and a half, he's gotten an uptick in calls from young men in the tech industry.\u000a\u000aTaniela Irizarry, 37, takes a free tai chi class on Long Beach's Signal Hill.\u000a\u000aHe gives private lessons to 20 people, including one young man who works for eHarmony and another for Yahoo.\u000a\u000a"Computer tech people, they love tai chi. It's a good destresser for them: sitting hours behind a keyboard, hunched over doing programming," Dunn said. "A lot of these people are more introverted. They like that gentle nature of tai chi that doesn't have sparring and hitting bags."\u000a\u000aGoogle headquarters has been offering tai chi to its employees for the past couple of years.\u000a\u000aMaster David Chang, owner of the Wushu Central Martial Arts Academy in San Jose, says he has several students in their 20s and 30s.\u000a\u000a"It used to be all senior citizens. It was uncommon for anyone younger than 30 learning tai chi. I've seen it's shifted quite a bit."\u000a\u000aChang, 41, says those students are looking for both a good source of exercise and something to relieve stress.\u000a\u000a"We have some students working in high-tech companies, environmental site analysis, another in air-conditioning repair. It goes across the board," Chang said.\u000a\u000aTai chi slowness is deceptive\u000a\u000a"Tai chi has a stigma of being for old people because it's slow. Tai chi is great for young people because it helps you to develop that slowness, which can be very beneficial in the world when things are stressful," York said.\u000a\u000aHe says that although it's practiced slowly, it's not easy.\u000a\u000a"The slowness of tai chi is deceptive. It's more difficult to remain slow and connected to the breath."\u000a\u000a"Each movement uses almost every muscle. So when we're standing and we're in a form and we're centered low -- the legs are engaged, the torso, the arms -- everything's engaged but not stressed like it would be in a workout in the gym. My legs have become much stronger."\u000a\u000aTaniela Irizarry, 37, says it helps with her injuries from years of beating up her body as a professional dancer. She too practices it outside on Signal Hill.\u000a\u000a"At first, it does seem a little difficult to slow yourself down at that point. But once you do, you realize that it's so calming and it's so relaxing. I just feel like everything just kind of releases," Irizarry said.\u000a\u000a"You feel the wind blowing through. Sometimes, maybe it's the energy we're creating, but little bees, butterflies and birds come zipping around us," she said.\u000a\u000aMay guard against inflammation, chronic disease\u000a\u000aMost health research into the benefits of tai chi focus on people over 50. But the earlier you start in life, the more you reap the rewards, says Dr. Michael Irwin, director of UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center. He says the benefits are cumulative.\u000a\u000a"A younger person that's experiencing stress, there's a way for them to target that stress so that it does not accumulate over time -- increasing the likelihood of them developing disease."\u000a\u000aDaniel Hoover teaches a free tai chi class on a hilltop in Long Beach, California.\u000a\u000aIrwin has carried out more than a dozen peer-reviewed studies evaluating the ability of tai chi, yoga and mindfulness to improve health outcomes.\u000a\u000aIrwin's earliest tai chi study in 2003 found an increase in the number of disease-fighting "T cells" that fight off shingles in patients who practiced tai chi. The 15-week study showed no increase in those who did not participate.\u000a\u000a"As we age, we find you can be more at risk for an infectious disease, or you can be more at risk for an inflammatory disorder," he said. "Tai chi importantly impacts both elements of the immune system. It improves our ability to fight off infectious disease. It also decreases our inflammation. "\u000a\u000aIrwin is now studying whether tai chi can be as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy to treat depression and anxiety.\u000a\u000aWhat makes it so effective?\u000a\u000aWhat is is about tai chi that is so impactful on our health?\u000a\u000a"We simply don't know, but we have various clues," Irwin said. "What happens when you practice tai chi: We're slowly moving, but we also have to be present in this moment -- not tomorrow, not yesterday, but in this moment."\u000a\u000aPatrick York, 28, says he finds peace and strength in his tai chi practice.\u000a\u000aHe adds that this is true not just for tai chi but for other mindfulness practices such as yoga and meditation.\u000a\u000a"Being present in the moment turns off these kinds of stories that we tell ourselves, that our brain tells our body. When we're telling all these stories about all these horrible things that have been happening to us, we get an activation of these stress response pathways," Irwin said. "So being present in the moment helps us maintain a sense of calmness but also short-circuits activation of these stress pathways."\u000a\u000a'We need a practice ... that allows us to slow down'\u000a\u000aAt the end of the tai chi class on Long Beach's Signal Hill, York says he brings his practice with him everywhere he goes.\u000a\u000a"If I'm feeling agitated, it's a good lesson for me to remember to slow down and tune in with my breath. I do tai chi to get back into myself and to my center, because throughout the week, the world will pull us in different directions," York said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I think tai chi is great for younger people because it forces you to disconnect from the world around you."\u000a\u000aHoover agrees.\u000a\u000a"We all need a practice, whether it's tai chi or something else, that allows us to slow down."

aVSarah Sekula, CNN \u2022 Published 21st August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Meet Leland Kent. He is slightly obsessed with rust and decay, peeling paint and piles of debris. He's OK breathing in musty air and unusual smells, crawling through mud, squeezing through fences and hoisting himself over barbed wire.\u000a\u000aAll in the name of art.\u000a\u000aHe's what you call an urban explorer. Part historian and part artist, he spends much of his time photographing New Orleans' long-forgotten buildings.\u000a\u000a"Most people are amazed at what I photograph," says Kent, creator of abandonedsoutheast.com . "They are intrigued by the decay and what objects are left behind."\u000a\u000aSince 2014, he's explored about 100 derelict buildings across the Southeast and a dozen or so in New Orleans.\u000a\u000aDuring that time, he's come to realize that there's no shortage of vacant buildings to explore. Twelve years after Hurricane Katrina ripped through the city, New Orleans still has loads of abandoned buildings -- about 20,000, according to local government officials.\u000a\u000aThe ruins of New Orleans\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 11 The auditorium inside Booker T. Washington High School in New Orleans. The school was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina. It's near the Superdome.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor Kent, each of those crumbling structures is another chance to discover beauty -- even in the former New Orleans Public Service Power Plant, also known as the Market Street Power Plant, which shut down in 1973.\u000a\u000aWhen you enter, he says, you can see all five levels, the bottom of which is flooded with murky, green water. Light streams in through broken windows. You are surrounded by pipes and rust. It's steampunk heaven.\u000a\u000a"It's quite a sight," he says. "It's really awe-inspiring standing inside of it. I mean, it's massive."\u000a\u000aNot to mention creepy. The perfect backdrop for movies and TV shows. The science fiction film "Oblivion" was shot there as well as the AMC series "Into the Badlands."\u000a\u000aA growing trend\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of folks just like Kent who are intrigued by the beauty of decay. Just Google #urbex #ruinporn or #urbxunderground, and you'll find everything from defunct amusement parks in Kentucky to dilapidated mansions in Detroit.\u000a\u000aFor Kent, the chance to see something others will never see is particularly appealing. One place he has visited a handful of times is Charity Hospital in the lower Mid-City neighborhood.\u000a\u000aThe building has recently been cleaned up, but when Kent visited in January 2015, he says there were containers of discarded body parts, biohazard waste, broken windows, walls of peeling paint and piles of debris. On the basement wall he could see the water line left behind by Katrina's floodwaters.\u000a\u000aThat begs the question: How safe is it to enter these buildings?\u000a\u000aYou never know what to expect. Kent has come across graffiti artists, homeless people, other explorers and drug addicts. But he says no one has ever been aggressive.\u000a\u000aHe has had a few alarming animal encounters, however. He spotted a huge black snake in an abandoned Florida factory once that chased him out of a building.\u000a\u000aThe New Orleans Police Department points out that trespassing is not only illegal, but can also be dangerous.\u000a\u000a"There may be structural problems with the building that could cause harm. In some situations, dangerous individuals may be using the building for illegal activity, posing additional hazards for urban explorers," says Beau Tidwell, communications director for the NOPD.\u000a\u000a"A lot of times there are abandoned places in the rougher part of town, so you just have to be cautious," Kent says. "I've avoided places because people were hanging around outside."\u000a\u000aGaining access\u000a\u000aHow exactly does Kent go about gaining access? "If someone owns the property, I ask for permission to photograph," he explains. "Sometimes it is a matter of finding a broken window or unlocked door."\u000a\u000a"There are places I visit that are considered off limits," he adds. "No one would be given permission, so the only way to gain access is by trespassing."\u000a\u000aDespite the risks, he says he'll continue to explore, even going back to places he's already visited like the Touro-Shakespeare Home, a former nursing home on the west bank of the Mississippi River.\u000a\u000aOutside, vines swirl around the columns and concrete fountains are overgrown with weeds. There are stepped parapets, a prominent front portico and diamond-patterned brickwork. Inside, 20-foot domed ceilings tower over walls covered in graffiti and all the stained-glass windows have been removed. But it's easy to imagine the building being quite a sight in its glory days.

aVJake Adelstein is an investigative journalist and special correspondent for the LA Times, The Daily Beast, and VICE News. He has been covering organized crime in Japan since 1993 and is the author of "Tokyo Vice," "Operation Tropical Storm: How an FBI Jewish-Japanese Special Agent Snared a Yakuza Boss in Hawaii" and the forthcoming "The Last Yakuza."\u000a\u000aTokyo (CNN) In August, Japan's largest crime group, the Yamaguchi-gumi, split into two main factions, potentially creating a gang war that may ultimately involve all 21 designated crime groups in Japan.\u000a\u000aThe new group, which was formally created in early September , is calling themselves the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi and is already setting up alliances with other organized crime groups. The National Police Agency says they have had an emergency meeting to discuss how to handle the crisis, and police nationwide are on alert.\u000a\u000aTetsuya Shiroo, a local gang member affiliated with the Yamaguchi-gumi, shot and killed the mayor of Nagasaki in 2007.\u000a\u000aIn the Japanese underworld, the 21 other organized crime groups are trying to decide which way the wind blows and who to align themselves with. The last split in the Yamaguchi-gumi, which began in 1984, resulted in several years of epic warfare marked with assassinations, attempted bombings and gun battles that terrified and enthralled the nation.\u000a\u000aJapan has very strict gun control laws, and in a land of 127 million people, there were six gun-related deaths last year, according to statistics by the National Police Agency. The possibility of the gang war reigniting frightens the general public considerably.\u000a\u000aWho are the yakuza?\u000a\u000aThe yakuza is a blanket term for Japan's organized crime groups: The country's mafia. They were traditionally federations of gamblers and street merchants, but while the yakuza like to tout their history as going back hundreds of years, the oldest continuous group is, author Kazuhiko Murakami estimates, probably the Aizukotetsu-kai in Kyoto, founded in the 1870s.\u000a\u000aWhile many yakuza groups started as loosely run gambling associations, they really came into their own in the chaos after World War II, first running the black markets, providing gambling, and entertainment -- even managing some of Japan's top post-war stars and singers -- before moving into construction, real estate, and engaging in extortion, blackmail, and fraud. And then of course, politics.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Japan begins probe against Yakuza, banks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan begins probe against Yakuza, banks 04:47\u000a\u000aThere are 21 major groups with more than 53,000 members, according to the National Police Agency. The three largest groups are the Yamaguchi-gumi (23,400), The Inagawa-kai, (6,600), and the Sumiyoshi-kai (8,500). The yakuza are not outlawed; they are regulated and monitored.\u000a\u000aMany of their money-making activities are illegal but they also run legitimate enterprises. The third-generation leader of the Yamaguchi-gumi, Kazuo Taoka, famously told his followers, "Have a real job." They claim to be humanitarian groups that keep order in Japan. This is why they have office buildings, business cards, fan magazines, and comic books about their exploits.\u000a\u000aYakuza members tend to be from those marginalized in Japan society traditionally -- the Korean-Japanese whose parents and grandparents were brought into Japan as slave laborers and members from the former outcast class of Japan, according to Mitsuhiro Suganuma, a former officer of the Public Security Intelligence Agency.\u000a\u000aThe Yamaguchi-gumi began as a labor dispatch service on the docks of Kobe in 1915 -- 2015 marks its centenary -- and their corporate emblem is known by everyone.\u000a\u000aHow much of the yakuza legend is true?\u000a\u000aWhen we speak of yakuza in the west, we tend to think of heavily-tattooed thugs and noble gangsters with missing pinkies.\u000a\u000aThe older generation of yakuza did favor tattoos, but this has fallen out of favor as they were first used as identifiers by the authorities, and latterly have gained popularity with an expanding subset of Japanese. The traditional tattoo was extremely painful to have done and showed that the individual was tough, had turned his back on society, and that he had money to spend.\u000a\u000aThe tattoos are also corporate branding at its finest -- some gang members have their organization emblem tattooed on their chest. It makes changing jobs or organizations difficult.\u000a\u000aYakuza don't have their fingers chopped off as a punishment. There are two situations in which a yakuza chops off a digit, usually a pinkie. When he does it in lieu of payment of his own debts, or to atone for a mistake and stay in the organization or stay alive, this is called a "dead finger." If a yakuza sacrifices a finger for the sake of his subordinate or a friend, that's a "living finger."\u000a\u000aProsthetics specialist Shintaro Hayashi, left, inspects the silicone finger of a former yakuza member in Tokyo.\u000a\u000aOne former yakuza boss sometimes would refuse to accept a severed finger for a debt saying, "I can't turn this into money. Bring me cash."\u000a\u000aYounger members avoid carving up their bodies or chopping off their fingers as they bring unwanted attention.\u000a\u000aWhat do they control in Japan, and overseas?\u000a\u000aIn Japan, the yakuza have some control over the entertainment industry -- many major talent agencies have yakuza ties and rule over their empires ruthlessly. The head of the National Police Agency on August 31, 2011 publicly stated: "We will do what is necessary to aid the entertainment industry in cutting their ties to organized crime."\u000a\u000aThe Yamaguchi-gumi has even been linked to the funding of one of Japan's ubiquitous, super-cute teen girl bands. The band's management has not publicly commented on the claim, which has been reported in Japanese weekly magazines.\u000a\u000aThey have a huge hand in the construction, real estate, currency exchange, labor dispatch, and the IT and financial industries, according to the National Police Agency. They also supply much of the labor for Japan's nuclear industry and have had influence in the neverending cleanup of the Fukushima disaster, according to Japanese and English media reports and books like Tomohiko Suzuki's "Yakuza and The Nuclear Industry."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED New look inside Fukushima Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New look inside Fukushima 01:08\u000a\u000aYakuza members were, according to Reuters , arrested in 2013 for infiltrating the construction giant tasked with the Fukushima cleanup and providing illegal workers.\u000a\u000a"We are taking it very seriously that these incidents keep happening one after another," said Junichi Ichikawa, a spokesman for Obayashi, adding that the company was examining its subcontracting firms to ensure that they were not linked to gang members. "There were elements of what we had been doing that did not go far enough."\u000a\u000aThe Yamaguchi-gumi has been called Japan's second largest private equity group. Because they are gamblers and they are privy to, and willing to use, insider information, they see the stock market as a casino, where they are the house. The modern-day yakuza use their network of men and women working in Japan's "hospitality" industry -- escorts, "hosts" and "hostesses," to collect information that can be used to judiciously blackmail company executives, politicians, and bureaucrats to maximize profits in their areas of interest.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED U.S. Treasury targets Yakuza Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH U.S. Treasury targets Yakuza 02:22\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Treasury Department has labeled the Yamaguchi-gumi a transcontinental organized crime group and even placed sanctions on the second tier group that rules them.\u000a\u000a"In order to conduct its criminal activities, the yakuza has relationships with criminal affiliates in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In the United States, the yakuza has been involved in drug trafficking and money laundering," a statement from April reads..\u000a\u000a"Including today's action, OFAC (the Office of Foreign Assets Control) has designated 13 senior yakuza members and five yakuza entities -- the Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi-kai, Inagawa-kai, Kudo-kai, and Kodo-kai. Today's designation of the Kodo-kai marks the first time a second-tier yakuza affiliate is being targeted."\u000a\u000aHow much influence do they wield?\u000a\u000aEven Japan's ruling party was not immune to the influence of the yakuza. The notorious yakuza Yoshio Kodama financed the Liberal Democratic Party in its early years, noted in "Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld" by David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro.\u000a\u000aThe Minister of Education in Japan is alleged to have received political donations from a yakuza front company. After denying receiving donations, he later admitted to getting a 180,000 yen ($1500) donation that he has since returned. He denies any other wrongdoing.\u000a\u000aAnother Abe cabinet member, Eriko Yamatani, who heads the Public Safety Commission, which oversees the National Police Agency, is "suspected of consorting" with a racist right wing group that has ties to the yakuza. After posing in a 2009 photograph with members of the Zaitokukai, the group in question, the government said she didn't know that the people in the photograph were connected to the group.\u000a\u000aEriko Yamatani denied ties to a right-wing group known for its hate speech.\u000a\u000aAsked about it at a Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan speech, Yamatani would not comment on what she thought of the organization's views.\u000a\u000aThe Vice Chairman of Japan's Olympic Committee has also been photographed with a top member of the Sumiyoshi-kai. The official, Hidetoshi Tanaka, claimed the photographs of him with the head of the Yamaguchi-gumi which were published last year are fake.\u000a\u000aIn the business world, they are a last resort in crushing labor unions, scandals and finding labor for jobs that no one wants to do.\u000a\u000aWhat does this latest Yakuza activity mean for Japan?\u000a\u000aThe Yamaguchi-gumi split into two groups at the end of August could spark gang wars in Japan.\u000a\u000aThe Yamaguchi-gumi had 72 factions before the split. The other 21 organized crime groups in Japan will have to decide which group to support: the old guard or the rebels. That may cause groups such as the Inagawa-kai, the third largest group, to split apart as their own factions decide loyalty.\u000a\u000aThe Sumiyoshi-kai, Japan's second largest crime group, may already be splitting apart in response to the Yamaguchi-gumi conflict. According to police sources, the powerful Kohei-Ikka faction has expressed solidarity with the "Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi" and may split apart from the Sumiyoshikai to join them.\u000a\u000aThe one thing that should keep casualties low is that under civil law, yakuza bosses can be sued for damages committed by their underlings. In 2012, Goto Tadamasa, a former crime boss, paid $1.4 million to the family of a real estate agent that his men had killed. He was never convicted in a criminal court.\u000a\u000aYamaguchi-gumi members gather at their leader's funeral in Kobe, Japan.\u000a\u000aIn the modern-day yakuza, money is worth more than blood. That's why the rebel faction of the Yamaguchi-gumi may win simply by offering reduced association dues to those who join them.

CNN spoke with ten female storytellers -- Elisabeth Moss, Tig Notaro, Rachel Bloom, Samira Wiley, Mandy Moore, Freida Pinto, Emmy Rossum, Regina King, Logan Browning and Constance Zimmer -- whose work in front of and behind the camera helps bring to life the kind of characters that generations before them fought to make possible.\u000a\u000aTelevision has come a long way in the five decades or so since producers realized it was time to show the average American viewer the truth -- that women were more than happy, pearl-wearing homemakers.\u000a\u000aThe journey to fuller, more complete portrayals of women on television has been a fraught one, filled with as many setbacks as triumphs, with more to come.

aVWhy won't Facebook show the public the propagandistic ads that a so-called Russian troll farm bought last year to target American voters?\u000a\u000aThat lack of transparency is troubling to many observers. "Show us the ads Zuck!" Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jason Calacanis wrote on Twitter when The Washington Post reported on the surreptitious ad buys on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aCalacanis said Facebook was "profiting off fake news," echoing a widely held criticism of the social network.\u000a\u000aIt was only the latest example of Facebook's credibility problem. For a business based on the concept of friendship, it's proving to be a hard company to trust.\u000a\u000aOn the business side, Facebook's metrics for advertisers have been error-prone, to say the least. Analysts and reporters have repeatedly uncovered evidence of faulty data and measurement mistakes.\u000a\u000aFacebook's opaqueness has also engendered mistrust in the political arena. Conservative activists have accused the company of censoring right-wing voices and stories. Liberal activists have raised alarms about its exploitation of personal information to target ads.\u000a\u000aAnd the news business is worried about the spread of bogus stories and hoaxes on the site.\u000a\u000aSome critics have even taken to calling Facebook a "surveillance company," seeking to reframe the business the social network is in -- not networking but ad targeting based on monitoring of users.\u000a\u000aRelated: Facebook's Russia problem: What we know\u000a\u000aFacebook executives dispute that their site is a "black box" of secretive algorithms. And they say they've taken concrete actions to halt the spread of so-called fake news.\u000a\u000aBut some news industry executives don't trust that Facebook fully recognizes the problem. Inaccurate and just plain made-up information spreads virally across Facebook and other social networks every day.\u000a\u000aThe misleading advertising figures may be the best bottom-line illustration of Facebook's woes.\u000a\u000aBrian Wieser, an analyst for Pivotal Research, reported this week that he found big disparities between the number of people Facebook claimed to reach through its Ad Manager platform and the actual populations.\u000a\u000aAccording to the U.S. Census, there are 31 million people in the United States aged 18 to 24. Facebook's platform claims to be able to reach 41 million of them.\u000a\u000aRelated: Facebook under scrutiny for inflated ad reach in U.S.\u000a\u000a"In media measurement issues there is no evidence that Facebook seeks to intentionally deceive anyone," Wieser told CNNMoney via email on Thursday. "And yet errors revealed in the past or issues like the one I wrote about (which might be characterized as unintentionally misleading) continue to pop up."\u000a\u000aWieser wrote: "The question is: is this sloppiness? Or a lack of focus? Or can it be pegged to reasonable challenges associated with managing a company that is both massive and still growing incredibly fast? One might then assume these issues play out elsewhere, as with the news about Russian-based propaganda." Facebook hasn't responded to a request for comment Thursday from CNNMoney.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Facebook disclosed that it had discovered about 3,000 ads connected to 470 inauthentic accounts and pages, much of them purchased during the 2016 campaign. Facebook's chief security officer said they appeared to come from Russia.\u000a\u000aThe ads were meant to "sow discord" among voters by amplifying divisive messages about issues including race, immigration, guns and LGBT rights, Facebook said.\u000a\u000aThe disclosure, which came after the Post report, involved a relatively small amount of money -- about $100,000, according to the company.\u000a\u000aBut some analysts and lawmakers immediately wondered whether more details would come out later.\u000a\u000aFacebook says it has provided information about the ad buys to investigators.\u000a\u000aThe company's account of election-related ad activity has changed over time.\u000a\u000aIn July Facebook told CNN, "We have seen no evidence that Russian actors bought ads on Facebook in connection with the election." When CNN followed up this week, the company said that statement "was accurate at the time we shared it," and "we found this activity as part of our more recent internal review."\u000a\u000aOn the ad metrics front, Facebook has overpromised and underdelivered before. And the problem is not unique to Facebook: Other digital ad giants have come under scrutiny from ad buyers.\u000a\u000aThe only other one with the scale of Facebook is Google. The two companies are increasingly portrayed as a "digital duopoly," and trust issues are at the fore for both.

aVTHE REAGAN SHOW Bows Monday, Sept. 4 at 9:00pm Eastern as CNN Film\u000a\u000aFilms documenting Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House yield insights into 40th presidency\u000a\u000aAs a new television-savvy president wields his unique brand of politics from the White House on the world stage, a CNN Film exploring an earlier president\u2019s novel approach to communications comes to CNN from filmmakers Pacho Velez and Sierra Pettengill. The Reagan Show is an all-archival film, comprised largely of footage filmed by the U.S. Naval Photographic unit and called \u201cWHTV.\u201d This material documented Reagan\u2019s eight years in the White House and was preserved by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. While previous administrations made WHTV, the Reagan White House far exceeded its predecessors in the volume of filmed self-documentation that it produced. Archival news footage from the era augments this fly-on-the-wall perspective on the dramatic history and pageantry of the Reagan years.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show also represents a new milestone for CNN Films, which celebrates its fifth anniversary this fall. Velez and Pettengill are alumni of the inaugural filmmakers\u2019 retreat created by a partnership with Tribeca Film Institute, Camden International Film Festival, and CNN Films in 2015. Each June, the annual workshop is hosted by Points North Institute in Camden and Rockport, Maine, and provides master classes, mentorship, and guidance to emerging documentary filmmakers. This film is the first co-production to be acquired for broadcast by CNN Films from alumni of the workshop, fulfilling a goal of CNN Films to contribute to the industry through nurturing documentary filmmaking and filmmakers.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show, will premiere on CNN/U.S. Monday, Sept. 4 at 9:00pm and Tuesday, Sept. 5 at 12:30am, with limited commercial interruption. The film will encore Saturday, Sept. 9 from 10:00pm to 11:30pm and Sunday, Sept. 10 from 2:30am to 4:00am on CNN/U.S., again with limited commercial interruption. The Reagan Show will also screen for the public at New York\u2019s Museum of the Moving Image on Wednesday, Aug. 30 at 7:00pm, followed by a discussion with the co-directors, moderated by CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter. All times Eastern.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe went through nearly 1,000 hours of footage, and think that this all-archival approach allows for an exciting insight into the tools of performance that Reagan employed,\u201d Velez and Pettengill said about The Reagan Show.\u000a\u000aThrough the juxtaposition of network news coverage and WHTV footage, the viewer often gains a behind-the-scenes view of many of the events profiled in the film: the president at inauguration, pardoning turkeys in the Rose Garden, and negotiating arms reductions with Mikhail Gorbachev. Often, this technique reveals how the event was conceived by Reagan and his White House planners, as well as how the public would eventually see the event later through the network news.\u000a\u000a\u201cSubstantively and stylistically, Ronald Reagan was perhaps the most skilled communicator-in-chief of our modern era. Pacho and Sierra have made an impressive and extensively-researched film that demonstrates how essential media communication skills are to a president\u2019s success and legacy\u201d said Amy Entelis, executive vice president for talent and content development for CNN Worldwide.\u000a\u000aThe filmmakers ultimately focus on the geopolitical rivalry between America and the Soviet Union, the most fraught and consequential diplomatic relationship of the Reagan era. The film shows how, as the former film and television star began his second term as president, Reagan was challenged on the world stage by the relatively youthful new Soviet leader. Gorbachev, shrewdly determined to wield power through leveraging his own charisma and media savvy to modernize the image of his nation, rarely missed an opportunity to play any diplomatic advantage to global news cameras.\u000a\u000aMany of the pivotal inflection points in the critical INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) Treaty deliberations between these two men were made for television, and conducted before an expectant international press corps. The film shows how, alongside the technical negotiations, Reagan\u2019s years of actor-training helped him gain advantage symbolically, which had realpolitik consequences that seem to continue to have lasting influence for the U.S.-Russia relationship.\u000a\u000aReflecting on Reagan\u2019s time in office, journalist Peter Jennings remarks in a contemporaneous news report included in the film: \u201cNo presidency before this one was so often judged as if it were a performing art. I shudder when it\u2019s suggested that politicians who come after him are going to have to succeed first on television.\u201d With political irony and insight, the \u2018media archaeology\u2019 of The Reagan Show reveals how the communicator-in-chief effectively used his skills to his advantage for official diplomacy, as well as to establish his legacy in the role of a lifetime, the presidency.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the telecasts, The Reagan Show will also stream live for subscribers via CNNgo on Sept. 4 (at www.CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV, and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android. The film will be available the day after the premiere (Monday, Sept. 5) on demand via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms, and CNN mobile apps.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show is a CNN Films co-production in association with Impact Partners and Artemis Rising Foundation, and presented for U.S. broadcast exclusively by CNN Films. The film is executive produced by Dan Cogan, Amy Entelis, Houston King, and Regina Scully. The film is edited and written by Francisco Bello and written by Josh Alexander; Daniel Garber and David Barker also edited the film. Laura Karpman is the film\u2019s music composer. The supervising producer is Courtney Sexton.\u000a\u000aArt http://bit.ly/2itqhcn\u000a\u000aAbout CNN Films\u000a\u000aCNN Films, celebrating its fifth year in 2017, produces and acquires documentary feature and short films for theatrical and festival exhibition and distribution across CNN\u2019s multiple platforms.

aVLondon (CNN) The summer is over and Britain's lawmakers are back in Westminster, with Brexit taking center stage.\u000a\u000aOver the next few months, Britain's departure from the European Union will start to gather pace as MPs vote on a host of bills and amendments.\u000a\u000aThe debate on what's known as the European Union (Withdrawal) bill -- designed to transfer EU law into UK legislation upon the country's departure from the bloc in March 2019 -- began Thursday, ahead of a vote next week in the House of Commons.\u000a\u000aThe next round of Brexit talks, party conferences and the upcoming German election could all have some effect on the process.\u000a\u000aAll of this comes after a tumultuous few months for Britain's embattled Prime Minister Theresa May , whose position remains the source of constant rumor and speculation.\u000a\u000aMay defiant\u000a\u000aMay has been under increasing pressure since June's election, at which her Conservative Party lost its governing majority and was forced to make a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland to remain in power.\u000a\u000aLast week May dismissed reports claiming she would quit in 2019 and insisted she was looking forward to the 2022 election.\u000a\u000aPressure on Prime Minister Theresa May has been growing since the June election that cost her a majority in the House of Commons.\u000a\u000aBut British newspapers have been full of stories claiming that some of her own members of Parliament want her to step down, while various names have been touted as replacements.\u000a\u000aHer latest challenge is steering the European Union (Withdrawal) bill through Parliament, with Labour set to oppose it and plenty of MPs aiming to make amendments when it's debated in the Commons for the first time.\u000a\u000aSecond reading of the EU (Withdrawal) bill\u000a\u000aIn addition to codifying existing EU laws, the bill also means that the UK will no longer have to adhere to new laws made in Brussels beyond March 2019.\u000a\u000aBut the government intends to use controversial laws from the time of King Henry VIII to enact corrections to the statute book, prompting opponents to complain of a "power grab."\u000a\u000aMPs from both sides of the house have questioned the use of the powers, which will allow the government to change large amounts of former EU law without the Commons' permission.\u000a\u000aThe government says those powers will not be used for any significant changes but rather for technical amendments and for a limited time.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED May: Free movement to Britain will end in 2019 Replay More Videos ...

"Too many promises have been made about Brexit which can't be kept."\u000a\u000aThe party wants to introduce a number of amendments and has also changed its stance to support remaining in the single market and customs union during a four-year transition period.\u000a\u000aLabour would also accept free movement of people during the transition phase as well as paying into the EU budget and accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the four years.\u000a\u000aBut while Labour, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party are likely to band together to vote against the bill, May should have the numbers to pass it.\u000a\u000aThe legislation will then pass onto the committee stage in the House of Commons in October where amendments are likely to be added under pressure from backbench Conservatives and opposition MPs.\u000a\u000aBrexit talks\u000a\u000aVictory in the Commons would be a welcome boost for May with Britain enduring a difficult start to negotiations with Brussels, highlighted by the frosty encounter last week between Brexit Secretary David Davis and his European counterpart Michel Barnier during their latest round of negotiations.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Brexit: UK and EU concerned over slow progress Replay More Videos ...

The two sides have yet to come to an agreement over the Northern Irish border, the rights of EU citizens or Britain's financial obligations.\u000a\u000a"Nobody has ever pretended this would be simple or easy," Davis told MPs Wednesday.\u000a\u000a"We've always said this negotiation would be tough, complex and at times confrontational.

aV(CNN) Energy bars are a convenient source of nutrition and come in a wide variety of flavors to satisfy different palates. They are often fortified with vitamins and minerals, which can help fill nutritional gaps.\u000a\u000aBut, like many foods in a specific category, not all energy bars are created equal. Those that are low in saturated fat and sugars, with a decent amount of protein and fiber, can provide a nutritious, satisfying pick-me-up. Others can closely mimic a candy bar. For example, some bars covered in chocolate contain as much saturated fat as a Snickers bar; others contain almost as much sugar.\u000a\u000aGranola bars are a convenient source of nutrition, but can vary significantly in terms of nutrition.\u000a\u000aEnergy bars containing mostly fruit and nuts can serve as satisfying snacks. But if you're looking for a meal replacement, aim for a bar with a higher amount of protein: about 10 to 20 grams. Athletes can also benefit from choosing a bar with more protein and carbohydrates, as their needs are higher.\u000a\u000aYou can afford more calories if bars are consumed in place of meals and not as snacks. But if a bar is intended only to tide you over until dinner, limit it to 150 to 200 calories.\u000a\u000aIn general, try to aim for bars with less than 3 grams of saturated fat and at least 4 grams of fiber. Palm kernel oil in yogurt and chocolate coatings will boost saturated fat. Also watch out for bars with ingredients such as brown rice syrup or cane invert syrup listed first, as they are generally higher in sugars than others and are better suited for athletes, not weight watchers.\u000a\u000aNote that some bars contain sugar alcohols such as maltitol or erythritol, to lower the sugar content. Because they are not fully absorbed, sugar alcohols provide fewer calories than sugar -- but they can also cause some gastrointestinal distress.\u000a\u000aOne last point: Don't be fooled by the word "energy." In the nutrition world, energy is synonymous with "calories," and all food gives you energy because it provides calories. There's nothing magical about energy bars in and of themselves, and they won't give a boost in strength or focus unless you've been skipping meals and snacks.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, energy bars shouldn't take the place of whole foods, especially fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts, which provide a package of beneficial nutrients that are important not only for energy but for overall health.\u000a\u000aSo stock up on a stash of healthful energy bars to keep in your bag or at your desk and enjoy them on days that don't allow for a break to sit and eat. Just don't make them the main staple of your diet.\u000a\u000aSeven energy bars that meet the above recommendations:\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

aV(CNN) Energy drinks are a $2.8 billion-a-year business in the United States alone, built on the promise of helping you push past that "2:30 feeling."\u000a\u000aWhile somepeople are early birds and others are night owls, one thing many people have in common is a feeling of sluggishness in the afternoon. This is in large part due to your circadian rhythm , a roughly 24-hour "master clock" that regulates hormones in your brain -- including, most prominently, the ones that make you feel tired or awake.\u000a\u000aBut you don't just experience a physical lack of energy. Your brain's reward processing system also takes a hit, according to a study published this week in The Journal of Neuroscience by researchers at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology\u000a\u000aIn the simplest terms, this system is responsible for helping you weigh potential risks vs. rewards, and arrive at a decision as far as what -- or what not -- to do.\u000a\u000aJamie Byrne, the study's lead author, says conventional wisdom has been that reward response is driven by "reward-related factors," such as the relative appeal of a reward ($10 vs. $100, for example) and "internal factors," such as whether you are an optimistic or pessimistic person.\u000a\u000a"This study is testing a third component that may be relevant to this relationship: time of day," said Byrne, a Ph.D. candidate in clinical psychology at Swinburne. "Our best bet is that the brain is 'expecting' rewards at some times of day more than others, because it is adaptively primed by the circadian system."\u000a\u000aExpected vs. unexpected rewards\u000a\u000aByrne and her colleagues recruited 16 healthy young men who worked normal daytime hours and hadn't done any recent long-haul travel, which could have resulted in jet lag. The men were asked to perform a gambling exercise while inside an MRI scanner , so blood flow in their brains could be monitored in real time.\u000a\u000aThe researchers said existing literature has found that an area of the brain known as the left putamen is a "core component of reward-related function in humans," and so they structured their study to observe subjects' activation in that area at three times of day: 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Of these, the lowest levels observed were at 2 p.m.\u000a\u000aTo put it simply: Rewards we receive in the morning or evening seem to come as more of a surprise than rewards we get in the afternoon. That surprise factor causes certain parts of the brain to light up more. This is a consequence of what is often referred to as our "primitive brain," from when our ancestors were hunter-gatherers. If they were going to venture out in search of food, for example, they would have done so during daylight hours; doing so at night would have presented an unnecessarily elevated risk.\u000a\u000a"The human reward system is primed to be more active during daytime hours when reward potential is high and risk relatively low, and less active overnight when this balance is reversed," the researchers wrote, citing " Mood and Temperament ," a 2000 book by University of Notre Dame psychology professor David Watson\u000a\u000a"Outside of 'time of day' variables, multiple lines of evidence suggest that neural activation is higher in rewards regions in response to unexpected rewards, compared to expected rewards," Byrne said. "A good analogy for this is your response to a surprise birthday party in comparison to a planned birthday dinner. Both are rewarding events; however, when the rewards are unexpected, your brain has to work harder to understand what is happening."\u000a\u000aImplications for daily life\u000a\u000aPrior research has demonstrated that it might be harder for you to think clearly, exercise good judgment and avoid making mistakes in the afternoon. This study is provides more evidence that it's not only what you do that matters, but when you do it.\u000a\u000aScience has shown there are many ways to optimize daily life activities around your circadian rhythm.\u000a\u000aPsychologist Eric Barker says you should always organize your to-do list from worst to best , knocking out the things you don't want to first, since "your self-control is at its peak first thing in the morning." Save the mindless tasks for the afternoon, he says.\u000a\u000a"Some fitness gurus recommend working out first thing in the morning, because that's when you're least likely to have scheduling conflicts and therefore more likely to exercise regularly," says Robert J. Davis, author of " Fitter Faster ." But you actually perform best at exercise later in the day , he says.\u000a\u000aEven weight loss can be tied to when, not just what, you eat . "Skipping meals or eating too few calories earlier in the day appears to stack the odds against us," says nutritionist Lisa Drayer , a CNN contributor. "More and more research points to the fact that when you front-load your calories instead, you have a much better chance of shedding pounds."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aInvestigating how to better treat diseases affected by the body's internal clock -- such as depression, substance abuse and sleep disorders -- is something Byrne would like to study next.\u000a\u000a"A range of evidence suggests that circadian rhythms are less robust in people vulnerable to depression and bipolar disorders, and we have shown that depression is indeed associated with a blunted circadian reward rhythm," she said.\u000a\u000aByrne thinks patients could benefit from a more precise focus on when they receive their treatment, maximizing rewarding experiences in the middle of the day and minimizing them at night.

aVThe 33-year-old Georgia resident doesn't currently get her health insurance through the exchanges, although she has in the past, nor is she on Medicaid. Both could be impacted by the Republican legislation proposed as a replacement to Obamacare.\u000a\u000aStill, she is watching that legislation closely because she, like 117 million Americans, has a chronic condition. It has no cure and requires expensive care. She worries about whether her husband's job will still come with benefits and whether they'll be able to avoid penalties by maintaining consistent coverage.\u000a\u000aTo Daniel, the health care debate is not political, it's personal.\u000a\u000aDaniel has Crohn's disease, which is inflammation of her GI tract. Sometimes she feels fine and can go about her day as if she is well. Other times, the condition leaves her in such pain and with so little energy, she is confined to bed for days at a time. She's had bouts when she can't swallow. Sometimes her body rejects all food. Once, when she was in college, she spent an entire weekend on the bathroom floor, too sick to eat, drink or move, she said.\u000a\u000aIt's been rough, particularly since she is a busy mother with two young children who demand a lot of her time.\u000a\u000a"It's been really hard, especially this year, on my kids," Daniel said. "They can't comprehend what's really going on with me. They just know that I'm sick. Thankfully, they're really great kids, and I have a lot of friends and a lot of family who have volunteered to help."\u000a\u000aShe said the help comes in handy when she gets her treatments. Her doctors have had her try nearly every medication that's out there. She's also had to have surgery to remove part of her colon. None of it worked permanently, so her doctors put her on Remicade. The drug comes in the form of an infusion that she must get at a hospital that's a 40-minute drive away. She gets it every few weeks. Without insurance, the drug would cost about $20,000 a year.\u000a\u000aThe good news is, it seems to be working.\u000a\u000a"This type of medicine is a lifetime commitment," she said. That means she can't afford to go without insurance if she wants to stay well.\u000a\u000aHer husband, Justin, rarely gets sick, she said, so he might be able to get away without insurance, but her daughter may also have an autoimmune disease, so the family has to keep its coverage, which they get through his work.\u000a\u000aThe absolute need for insurance is something that keeps Daniel focused on what is going on with the GOP health care bill.\u000a\u000a"What are they going to do for people like me who have chronic illness?" she asked. "There is a little bit of nervousness here."\u000a\u000aThe current GOP bill does not bring health care back to the way it was before Obamacare.\u000a\u000aBefore the Affordable Care Act, if you shopped for a plan on the individual market, companies often wouldn't sell a plan to someone who had a chronic or pre-existing condition. There were also lifetime caps on how much a company would spend on your care. With an expensive drug like Remicade, Daniel could have easily maxed out a policy in the old system.\u000a\u000aObamacare eliminated lifetime caps and made it so insurance companies couldn't discriminate against you if you had a pre-existing condition. The current bills do not change either issue, but the bills do incentivize people to have continuous coverage. And large employers would no longer be required to offer affordable insurance to their employees, like they do now.\u000a\u000aThat means if the bills become law and her husband's company decides to drop its benefits, Daniel could lose her insurance. And although the family has done everything in its power to keep coverage, she said, she could easily see when there could be a gap.\u000a\u000aThat nearly happened a few years ago, when her husband lost his job. For the three months he was out of work, the family went on COBRA, which is not subsidized. It cost $900 a month. It was such a steep expense, Daniel said, they had to ask family members to help them cover their bills. Without generous family, they could have taken their chances and skipped insurance coverage to keep afloat financially.\u000a\u000aBut skipping coverage would be an even tougher decision if they faced another job loss. With the proposed GOP health care plan in place, they could face a 30% penalty if they bought a plan on the individual market for the rest of that year.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aDaniel said she hopes, whatever Obamacare replacement goes into law, that she and others with chronic conditions will be OK. Until then, she'll be thinking constantly about what could happen to her insurance.\u000a\u000a"I'm nervous not knowing the future," Daniel said. "You never know how much you're going to end up with that you're responsible for. You never know how bad it's going to get."

aV(CNN) Huang Xuejing broke away from the kingdom he once called home six years ago. At just 130 centimeters -- a little over 4 feet -- Huang's height permitted him entry into the kingdom in 2009.\u000a\u000aHis physical growth was limited when he injured his spine in a fall at age 8. Having been warned that surgery to restart his growth could lead to paralysis, his family chose to not take the risk.\u000a\u000aAfter studying graphic design at a school for the disabled in China, Huang found his talents to be of use in the Kingdom of the Little People, a small theme park where about 100 people of short stature, including some with dwarfism, live and perform dances and songs for tourists each day.\u000a\u000aThe maximum height for workers there is 130 centimeters, meaning Huang just made the cut. He soon found himself working behind the scenes as a manager.\u000a\u000aBut life wasn't quite what he had been promised.\u000a\u000aExploring the kingdom\u000a\u000aAn hour's drive east of the city of Kunming in southwest China, the park has been branded a disgrace by some overseas, stoking debate about the treatment of people with disabilities in China.\u000a\u000aThe US-based dwarfism support group Little People of America highlight that opinions vary about whether dwarfism/short stature is actually a disability and believe the kingdom was comparable to a zoo.\u000a\u000aThe kingdom is billed as a tourist attraction, by its owner, real estate mogul Chen Mingjing. Now, seven years after opening its doors, the kingdom remains open, but few tourists seem to be buying into the fairy tale. Just 15 customers, mainly families with young children, could be counted on one recent day, most of them Chinese.\u000a\u000aAfter paying the 100 yuan ($15) entry fee, customers sit in front of the main stage to watch the morning performances. On this day, 30 performers in pink and red coats dance while a "king" character, complete with a cloak and crown, swans around regally. Shortly afterward, an all-female dance team performed a Bollywood-style routine.\u000a\u000aThe tone is cute and quirky, with a karaoke feel to the songs sung between dance routines. Another regular performance involves male dancers dressed in female ballerina outfits and pirouetting to "Swan Lake" music.\u000a\u000aIt's like any other show performed in jest, but with a much shorter cast.\u000a\u000aLife in -- and out of -- the kingdom\u000a\u000aHuang joined the work force in the theme park after having been enticed by its owner, Chen, who was impressed by Huang's abilities and sold him his dream for the kingdom, Huang said.\u000a\u000a"He was very keen and sincere," Huang said in his small but impeccably tidy studio apartment in central Kunming. "He explained that he wanted to make the kingdom the biggest in the world."\u000a\u000aHuang Xuejing, in the red jacket, used to work in the kingdom as a manager but left six years ago to work as a freelance performer in Kunming.\u000a\u000aChen explained to Huang that managing a team of people with height impediments would be best by someone who understands their perspective.\u000a\u000a"That was why he wanted me," said Huang, who in turn felt that a job helping people like himself might be more meaningful.h\u000a\u000aThe kingdom provides accommodation for staffers, who live in a cluster of dormitory blocks a short walk from the performance area. Many workers move there straight after leaving school, as managers regularly advertise jobs in schools for disabled people in Kunming and find them as students, like Huang.\u000a\u000aThe workers sleep on bunk beds in shared rooms cluttered with clothes, stuffed animals and phone chargers. A strong constitution is required to visit the separate toilet building, and the roof of one of the blocks serves as a dining area where the staffers prepare and eat communal meals. It's rustic but liveable.f\u000a\u000aBut after 3½ years, Huang chose to set out and work as a freelance performer in Kunming. He wanted to earn more and found life in the kingdom too isolated, despite regular travel to Kunming, his hometown.\u000a\u000a"I prefer more lively places; it was too far traveling between the kingdom and city," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang said he largely enjoyed the experience, despite initially being concerned that the shows his colleagues performed were demeaning. "Gradually, I began to feel that it's not a bad thing for (short people) to have a place to work, a career to look forward to and an environment to stay together."\u000a\u000aHe felt comfortable knowing that everyone else was the same. "They were all together; they didn't have pressure (of interacting in mainstream society)," he said.\u000a\u000aBut he wanted more.\u000a\u000aThese days, "I host, sing rock music in bars and attend launch ceremonies and weddings," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang earns 5,000 to 20,000 yuan ($740 to $3,000) a month. He didn't want to reveal how much he earned inside the kingdom but said his current salary was "a lot more."\u000a\u000aEarning a (good) living\u000a\u000a"People like us have to save for the future," said Yang Qianjun, a former colleague of Huang's at the Kingdom of the Little People who also ventured out in search of more lucrative employment.\u000a\u000aYang, 30, is 125 centimeters (about 4 feet) tall and worked in the kingdom as a performer until he left four years ago.\u000a\u000aHe says he was initially paid 800 yuan ($120) a month at the kingdom, later rising to 1,200 yuan ($180) with deductions for food. "It wasn't enough," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen asked whether the wages and location made the kingdom hard to leave, Yang was quick to reply: "Yes. Indeed." He then explained that most of his colleagues still inside were struggling. "Money would be spent the day it was given to us, on daily essentials. We couldn't save anything."\u000a\u000aYang Qianjun used to work as a performer in the kingdom but left to become a restaurant host in the city of Kunming.\u000a\u000aCharismatic and talkative, Yang now works as a host in Kunming at a Cultural Revolution-themed eatery plastered with Mao Zedong imagery and staffed by waiters in soldier uniforms.\u000a\u000aHe earns about 3,000 yuan ($440) a month and says he rarely is discriminated against for his height -- something he had feared while in the safety net of the park. "People around here are really nice," he said.\u000a\u000aHuang also said he seldom faces discrimination in public life, and on the rare occasions he does, he simply brushes it off. "Sometimes people watch me, but never adults, only kids," he said, adding that the attention never gets more serious than children whispering about him.\u000a\u000aHiding away in the kingdom\u000a\u000aBut in China, especially in rural areas, attitudes about disabled people bringing "shame" to families can often persist.\u000a\u000aSome workers still living and performing in the kingdom said they'd had more negative experiences in public.\u000a\u000a"In the outside world, people look at me differently, like I'm some kind of monster," said singer Li Jia, who has worked in the park for six years and has no plans to leave.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes, when I walked alone on streets, it made me uncomfortable and embarrassed when people stare at me," he said while refueling with a bowl of noodles before his next performance.\u000a\u000aNeither he nor his colleagues was eager to discuss in detail the discrimination they had been subject to, but they revealed glimpses.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I got pointed and laughed at by kids. I didn't like it," said Lin Zheng Xio, 24, another performer who specializes in singing. He says the struggle for people considered disabled, such as himself, to get work is all too real.\u000a\u000aLi Juan, a dancer who is also 24, added, "People would say, 'Why are you so short?' and would call me dwarf."\u000a\u000aLi Jia explained that he saw the kingdom as a safe haven. "I chose to come here because everyone here is the same. I feel like it's a big family," he said. He believes there is a future for him in the park.\u000a\u000a"Some people find love here and get married. We have two married couples, each with two children, plus four or five couples. I met my girlfriend here," he said.\u000a\u000aIn 2006, the China Disabled Persons' Federation estimated the number of people with disabilities in the country to be 83 million, a number including anyone who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and who has lost -- wholly or in part -- the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal, according to the International Labor Organization.\u000a\u000aAn opportunity for some?\u000a\u000aChinese legislation requires that all public and private employers reserve at least 1.5% of their job opportunities for people with disabilities. However, according to Cindy Zhang, an employment lawyer with Shanghai's Conshine Law Firm, companies often choose to pay fines for not hitting the target instead.\u000a\u000aIt is often difficult to get cases regarding disability discrimination in the workplace to court, she said, and even if cases are successful, compensation payouts are low. Zhang said many lawyers in China advise against pursuing them at all.\u000a\u000a"A lot of factories don't want us because we're not able to finish assignments that 'normal' people can finish," Li Jia said, adding that the park is a draw for those without many qualifications. Many of those who work in the park are from poor backgrounds. "A lot of us can't get office jobs because we don't have enough education."\u000a\u000aThe Cultural Revolution-themed restaurant where Yang Qianjun works.\u000a\u000aFor those who do manage to get jobs outside the park, problems remain. "When I worked in a noodle restaurant with taller people before, they wouldn't let me do some of the work because they didn't think I'd be able to," said Li Bao Xing, 46, a cleaner working in the kingdom.\u000a\u000aAll the staffers interviewed at the kingdom said they were generally happy to work there.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I feel it sometimes, but work is work," Li Jia said with a shrug when asked whether tourists treated his shows like a joke.\u000a\u000aLi Juan, who had little experience performing before joining the kingdom, said she found strength in numbers. "At first, I wasn't used to it, but gradually, I got used to it. After all, there is a group of us here."\u000a\u000aHuang's assessment is that his kingdom experience was worthwhile, if not quite the life-changing revelation Chen promised. "During the years I was there, it was not bad: not too fast nor slow," he said nonchalantly. "Working there was fine."\u000a\u000aThough content with her current life in the kingdom, Li Juan hopes to one day emulate Huang and leave, as she dreams of working in a shadow puppet theater. For now, however, she is not ready to venture into the unknown or leave the security of the park.\u000a\u000a"I wasn't feeling secure before. That's why I found a job with colleagues who are the same as me," she said. "We respect and care for each other."

aVPart one Investment\u000a\u000aIslamabad\u2019s Chinatown\u000a\u000aHow Pakistanis view China and the US (Source: Pew Research Center 2015)\u000a\u000aIslamabad, Pakistan -- In a bustling street in Pakistan\u2019s capital the air is thick with the familiar smell of mutton sizzling on charcoal. The plumes of smoke rising into the night sky are illuminated by something once uncommon here -- the blinking red neon of a sign bearing the restaurant\u2019s name in Chinese.\u000a\u000aGulab Khan Shinwari, the owner, stands at its entrance welcoming a steady stream of Chinese customers. \u201cMy restaurant is called Khyber Shinwari but everyone here calls it the CPEC Hotel, since so many Chinese customers have started arriving since the deal was announced.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, popularly known by its acronym of CPEC, has become a buzzword for longed-for economic prosperity in Pakistan. An integral part of China\u2019s One Belt, One Road initiative, the corridor is a combination of projects ranging from road networks, a fiber optic cable project, railway lines, a deep-sea port, coal mines and solar farms that Pakistan views as a huge opportunity to develop its economy.\u000a\u000aMeet the Pakistani kids learning Chinese.\u000a\u000aFollowing the ancient Silk Road that stretches from the Himalayas in Pakistan\u2019s northern border with China all the way down to the Arabian Sea, the corridor was announced with much fanfare in 2015 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad and announced a $46 billion investment plan, roughly 20% of Pakistan\u2019s economic output.\u000a\u000aWith the implementation of these projects and their promised riches, Pakistan has seen the influx of a large expat community, roughly 20,000, according to Mustafa Hyder, chief executive of the Pakistan-China Institute.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a community whose influence is slowly trickling into Pakistan\u2019s daily life.\u000a\u000aIn April, a commercial released by Shan Foods, a Pakistani company that sells spice mixes, showed Pakistani and Chinese neighbors bonding over a shared love for biryani, a popular rice and meat dish. The ad immediately went viral, with more than 59,000 shares on Facebook in the first week of its release.\u000a\u000aThe sleeping dragon has finally awoken\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the ad might not have initially been made with CPEC in mind, there\u2019s no doubt the foreigners Pakistanis interact with most on a daily basis are Chinese. \u201cThey\u2019re our best neighbor,\u201d says Humayun Farooq, marketing general manager for Shan Foods.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this ad has given CPEC a human face then I am glad for that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAcross town, Pakistanis discreetly sip cheap Chinese beer and wolf down dumplings made by Amber Shen, from China\u2019s Anhui province. Shen and other Chinese expats do their shopping from a handful of Chinese grocery stores that have sprung up in Islamabad. Popular American treats, like Chips Ahoy and Skittles, with Chinese packaging and even cans of stewed pork, a meat banned in Pakistan, are all available.\u000a\u000aLast year, a bilingual newspaper called Huashang Weekly launched with a staff of both Chinese and Pakistani journalists. It publishes and distributes 30,000 copies each week to Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi.\u000a\u000aPakistan movie theaters are showing \u201cChalay Thay Saath,\u201d which is about a Chinese man finding his roots in Pakistan.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot of curiosity amongst private Chinese investors about the potential in Pakistani markets, there's just the language barrier that I wanted to erase through Huashang Weekly so these investors can have an understanding of what's happening in Pakistan. These are very interesting times," says Derrick Wang, the paper's publisher who came to Pakistan five years ago.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile in cinemas, one of the latest movies \u201cChalay Thay Saath\u201d (Together We Went), stars a Chinese-Canadian lead actor and is about a Chinese man finding his roots in Pakistan.\u000a\u000aIn Islamabad, a city that has never really had a Chinatown, these developments are unusual. But China\u2019s embrace of Pakistan has risks attached. Analysts say Pakistan will owe China $90 billion if all the planned projects go ahead. But criticisms about Chinese investment aren\u2019t evident on the streets of Islamabad.\u000a\u000aTimes are changing and Pakistan must keep up, says Sabina Zakir, an administrator at the Roots millennium schools, an education system that has introduced compulsory Mandarin lessons for all students starting at age 8 and going all the way up to middle school.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sleeping dragon has finally awoken,\u201d she says about the country\u2019s northern neighbor. \u201cAnd our children, the custodians of our future, must be prepared to deal with this new roaring beast!\u201d

aVKate Maltby is a regular broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics and is a theater critic for The Times of London. She is also completing a Ph.D. in renaissance literature, having been awarded a collaborative doctoral degree between Yale University and University College London. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In 1980, at a political debate in Texas , a bleeding-heart liberal took it upon himself to attack America's tough immigration law.\u000a\u000a"We are creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family loving people that are in violation of the law," he told his audience. "I don't want to see ... six and eight-year-old kids being made .. totally uneducated and made to feel like they're living outside the law. These are good people, strong people."\u000a\u000aThat bleeding-heart liberal was George H.W. Bush. His debate opponent, who fell over himself to match Bush's compassion, was presidential rival Ronald Reagan\u000a\u000aYou've likely seen this video already. In the hours leading up to President Trump's long-telegraphed decision to scrap the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) protections for those who were brought to the US illegally as children, the clip went viral on social media, shared by those who felt it proved yet again Donald Trump's deep rupture with the best instincts of the Republican Party's history.\u000a\u000aThe Twitter commentariat are not wrong to point out that Trump has long broken with his party's traditions. Trump and his supporters like to compare him to Reagan -- the establishment looked down on Reagan too because he was a movie actor -- but Trumpism has little in common with the anti-statist doctrine at the heart of the Reagan White House.\u000a\u000aReagan was inherently skeptical of the efficacy of government bureaucracy to improve people's lives. If there is one quote that still sums up his political philosophy, it is the famous quip: "The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."\u000a\u000aBy contrast, Donald Trump built his successful campaign for the presidency on a promise to white Americans that their financial struggles could be mitigated by a strong, interventionist government.\u000a\u000aAfter signing the Disaster Proclamation last week, which released federal funds to help Houston, Trump told us: "I have signed the Disaster Proclamation, which unleashes the full force of government help."\u000a\u000aIt is natural, and praiseworthy, for a federal government leader to provide extra support for those affected by a Texan disaster. But one wonders if Reagan would have spoken quite so glowingly of the government's power to help.\u000a\u000aThe decision to scrap DACA, however, marks Trump's departure not from Reaganism, but from a different tradition of Republican thought.\u000a\u000aGeorge H. W. Bush may have decried the law's crackdown on "honorable, decent" illegal immigrants, but it was his son, President George W. Bush, who would firmly align the Bush family doctrine with a newly emergent form of late-20th century Republican thought: "compassionate conservatism."\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions gestured towards this doctrine even as he announced yesterday the administration's decision to end the DACA program: "We are people of compassion and we are people of law. There is nothing compassionate about the failure to enforce immigration laws."\u000a\u000aBut while doing so, he turned his back on the very core of what it once meant to be a compassionate conservative.\u000a\u000aCompassionate conservatism may sound like an oxymoron to liberals. It was by no means "conservatism lite." Adopted by hard right-wingers across Europe as justification for hacking away at the welfare state -- most notably by Britain's highly unpopular former work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith -- compassionate conservatism warns against dependence on state handouts and blames welfare for the decay of the traditional family.\u000a\u000aCompassionate conservatism shares with Reaganism a deep skeptism of the state. One familiar definition, by Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson, defines it as "the theory that the government should encourage the effective provision of social services without providing the service itself."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Late night hosts mock Trump's DACA decision Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Late night hosts mock Trump's DACA decision 00:51\u000a\u000aYet despite the rigor of this approach, the key part of "compassionate conservatism" is in the title -- compassionate. Compassionate conservatives would argue that they didn't defund child day-care centers because they wanted to put working women under pressure, but because they felt incentives for businesses and churches to provide them would be more effective.\u000a\u000aWhether you agree will depend on your economics. But compassionate conservatism only really worked for American Republicans as long as the populace saw positive effects in their communities.\u000a\u000aAs Doug Wead, the Republican figure who coined the phrase, wrote in his 1992 book, "It's Time For A Change," even measurably successful Republican economic policies have never been vote winners if the voters perceive them as lacking compassion. (Wead, in a surprising policy shift, is now a Trump acolyte, but most of his fellow travelers from the '90s are not.)\u000a\u000aFortunately for the Republican Party, there was one area of policy that allowed the Bush family to flex its compassionate muscles in the 1980s and '90s without ever abandoning its Reaganite commitment to the small state. That area was immigration.\u000a\u000aCompassion meant taking pity on the "six and eight year old kids" brought to America by their parents and doomed forever to live without official documentation.\u000a\u000aConservativism meant championing Hispanic immigrants as models of religious, family-focused self reliance. Reaganism meant reframing the presence of illegal migrants in the US as the result of failed federal policies -- at home and abroad -- and bowing to the pressure of big business to safeguard this source of cheap, legal labor.\u000a\u000aThe push towards immigration reform began under Reagan, with the amnesty of 1986 spearheaded by then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. It would be expanded under two Bush presidencies.\u000a\u000aIn scrapping DACA this week, Sessions reasonably argued that Obama's protocol represented executive overreach: It acted to force through the provisions of the DREAM Act after that bill was rejected by Congress. Yet that was also how Reagan and Bush Sr. operated to extend immigration rights.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Sessions announces end of DACA program (full) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sessions announces end of DACA program (full) 10:04\u000a\u000aIn 1987, Reagan used his executive power to define the terms of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to protect the minor children of parents covered previously by his 1986 act. In 1989, the first President Bush did the same to force through extensions that Congress had voted down.\u000a\u000aWhen municipal authorities across America act independently to issue ID cards to DREAMers, or businesses shield their illegal employees for no greater moral reason than the need for a cheap labor force, they are doing so in service of a true Bush ideal: that local authorities and businesses are the best people to step in when federal policies fail in the face of reality.\u000a\u000aThe Bush family were uniquely situated to celebrate the integration of immigrants: The lifelong teenage love story of Jeb Bush and his Mexican wife Columba has made its way into stump speeches by every member of the clan.\u000a\u000aBut the Bushes, like all patricians, were also keen to demonstrate their own charity. So were the proponents of immigration reform -- Democrat or Republican -- who came after them.\u000a\u000aThe individuals protected by DACA and who would have benefited from the aborted DREAM Act -- those who now face deportation under Trump -- could have stepped from the language of a dozen Bush speeches, as well as the Democrats who took up the cause across the aisle.\u000a\u000aTo fit the provisions of DACA, applicants had to have arrived under the age of 16 and lived in the US for five consecutive years. They had to be willing to serve in the US military in the case of conscription, to earn a GED, to be of "good moral character" with a "clean criminal record." They had to be almost perfect.\u000a\u000aThese are not ordinary flawed people so much as walking advertisements for the compassion of their political sponsors. That Trump has been so willing to reject them signals that compassion is simply not part of his political brand. He's interested in something else.\u000a\u000aWhat compassionate conservatives recognized at the end of the 1980s is that the era of the nation state is ending. The failure of nations around the world to protect their borders is as great a marker of that change as the rise of mega-corporations.\u000a\u000aTrump won the presidency by insisting that change could be reversed. Hence his obsession with a great wall against Mexico and his insistence on American military power.\u000a\u000aYet this isn't just Trump being Trump. This is a backlash against open borders, being felt across the world. The governments of Britain and other European countries -- with the notable exception of Germany -- have retrenched their border controls, even as increasing numbers of migrants flee unspeakable suffering in North Africa and the Middle East.\u000a\u000aIt's not clear that the Trump approach will survive economic inevitabilities, just as it's not clear the European Union will survive this most existential of crises.\u000a\u000aConservatism in Europe, as in the US, is no longer bothered about seeming compassionate. It wants to be strong.

aV"I was only 36 years old, and I was single," she said. "I just couldn't process anything he was saying."\u000a\u000aShe worked full-time as a special-education teacher in New Jersey, but her most important job was raising her 8-year-old son, Michael.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin dreaded the thought of telling people she had cancer.\u000a\u000a"I remember I was laying on my stomach saying to myself, 'You're never going to have to tell anyone, because you're going to die tonight,' " she said of the night she got the news.\u000a\u000aFor someone who was always in control of her life, the diagnosis felt like a fatal blow for McLaughlin. She went through the motions of treatment and had a lumpectomy in her left breast, followed by radiation.\u000a\u000a"I hated radiation. It felt like I was in a 'Star Wars' movie. You're in this machine, and then there's a sound that makes you think you're going to be disintegrated," McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000aBattling cancer, striving for normalcy\u000a\u000aTo most people, McLaughlin's life appeared normal. She continued working full-time and caring for Michael, who was in third grade, as if nothing had changed. The principal at her school set up a room with a cot so she could take naps during her off periods. She did it out of necessity but also because she didn't want Michael to be affected by her diagnosis.\u000a\u000a"He didn't understand that I could die," she said. "That never entered his mind, because I didn't look like I was sick; I didn't act like I was sick; I didn't sit around and cry. I kept doing the things that I was always doing."\u000a\u000aAfter a few months, McLaughlin was cancer-free. She returned to her normal routine, replacing weekly chemo and radiation treatments with a mammogram every six months.\u000a\u000aBut on the same date in April three years later, McLaughlin's doctors found cancer cells in her left breast again. A mastectomy was her only option this time. She had immediate breast reconstruction and repeated the rigorous treatment schedule.\u000a\u000aAgain, she shielded Michael from as much as possible. He was in sixth grade, seemingly unaware; school-wide prayer calls were the extent of his exposure. "He'd come home from school and say, 'Oh, Mommy! Sister Laura got on the PA system today and had the whole school say a prayer for you!' " McLaughlin recalled.\u000a\u000aUnlike with her first diagnosis, McLaughlin knew what to expect. The countless biopsies that followed were the greatest challenge. Her doctors were extra cautious, taking tissue samples at the first sign of a lump or mass in her remaining right breast.\u000a\u000a"I told my doctor, 'My breast looks like a scenic railroad! Every which way, scars, scars, scars.' And he said to me, 'You can have 10 benign biopsies, but the 11th could be the cancer that kills you.' "\u000a\u000aAnother diagnosis\u000a\u000aSeven years later, McLaughlin felt a lump in her right breast. The mammogram didn't reveal any inconsistencies. Her new doctor suggested that she wait a couple of months, but she insisted on getting a biopsy.\u000a\u000aShe remembered lying on the operating table as her doctor read the results. "Usually, I'd be told it looks clean. This time, I saw his face, and he didn't tell me anything. I knew at that moment I had cancer again."\u000a\u000aIt was her third diagnosis in a 10-year period.\u000a\u000aMichael was a senior in high school, old enough to understand her condition for the first time. "I was honest with him about having cancer, but I'd never say 'I'm going to die.' I'd just say 'I saved my life,' " McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000aMichael struggled with fear about his mother's condition but was eager to help. He drove her to the hospital for her second mastectomy and breast reconstruction. Leaving little time to sulk, McLaughlin went back to work immediately and enrolled in graduate school to earn her master's in education.\u000a\u000aCancer-free once again, McLaughlin's life stabilized. Neither her body nor her behavior evidenced the decade-long struggle she endured. She loved her reconstructed breasts and felt in control again. Throughout all of her diagnoses, "I never cried. I never got emotional about it," she said.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin's moment of weakness came years later.\u000a\u000aQuesting for confidence\u000a\u000aEight years after her last treatment, an unexpected staph infection forced doctors to remove her implants. "That's when I cried," she said. "They were so beautiful and life-like that I couldn't believe it was happening to me." Doctors removed the infected skin, expanded the remaining flesh on her chest, and inserted smaller implants.\u000a\u000aBut after six weeks, she was rushed to emergency surgery for a second staph infection and lost the option of reconstruction entirely. Flattened, misshapen lumps of fatty tissue and scars from 28 surgeries were all that remained.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin struggled with her appearance after losing her breasts. She removed all the full-length mirrors from her home, preferring not to see herself in them, and pined over the lumps on her chest when she caught glimpses of her torso in the bathroom. "Every time I looked in the mirror, you think I'd be mad about the scars; I'd say, 'Oh God, I hate that fat.' I hate it, you know, and I was obsessed with it."\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin didn't find solace until years later when Michael, then in his 30s, gave her a tablet computer. With his help, McLaughlin opened a Twitter account. She became fast Twitter friends with Friday Jones , a celebrity tattoo artist and cast member on Oxygen's "Tattoos After Dark."\u000a\u000aThrough Jones, McLaughlin discovered a community of breast cancer survivors and mastectomy tattoo enthusiasts. Jones introduced McLaughlin to P.ink Day, a nationwide event in which volunteers connect breast cancer survivors with experienced artists, providing complimentary tattoos to cover their scars during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\u000a\u000aP.ink Day founder Noel Franus said "most breast cancer survivors are told they have two options after a mastectomy: reconstruction or no reconstruction. We believe they deserve a third option that most aren't familiar with: tattoos."\u000a\u000aP.ink Day, now in its fifth year, has provided tattoos for more than 175 survivors in 25 cities. When a last-minute slot opened up at P.ink Day in New York, Jones recommended McLaughlin. "She tweeted me and said, 'This one's for you, Bern,' " McLaughlin said.\u000a\u000a'Life still goes on'\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin's first tattoo was a breeze. Having lost almost all feeling in her chest due to nerve damage from radiation, she never felt the needle puncture her skin. Wispy black vines and flowers reminiscent of lace spread from her left shoulder down to the center of her chest.\u000a\u000a"I became so obsessed with that tattoo, I forgot I had the lumps." One year later, she was ready for another tattoo to cover her right side. This time, her son would join her.\u000a\u000aShe continued the vine across her chest, embellishing it with yellow roses, symbolic of life and rebirth to show that, "even in the coldest winters where everything is dead, out of the worst possible things that can happen to you, there's still life. Life still goes on."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aMichael got a matching yellow rose on his forearm. "This tattoo will always remind me of not just her, not just this day, but of everything she's done for me," he said, recalling the years his mother silently endured breast cancer in order to preserve his childhood.\u000a\u000aMcLaughlin doesn't miss her breasts anymore. "People could look at (my chest) and say it's really ugly, and I looked at it that way too, until I got the tattoos."\u000a\u000aShe will celebrate 17 years cancer-free in April but still considers herself a patient. Three hard-fought battles taught her to never get too comfortable.\u000a\u000aTo women fighting similar battles, McLaughlin shares this life lesson: "You live with cancer, but you don't let cancer ruin your life."

aV(CNN) They became known as "the real 'Fault in Our Stars' couple" and soon became nearly as famous as the couple in the novel and movie.\u000a\u000aKatie Donovan and Dalton Prager -- like Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters, the teenagers in the 2014 film -- fell in love even though they knew the other could die at any time.\u000a\u000aThe real-life couple also shared a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Adding to their drama was the fact that Katie's doctors had directed her not to meet up with Dalton, because he had a highly contagious infection, and if she caught it, her life could be drastically shortened.\u000a\u000aShe defied her doctors and went on a date with Dalton, and two years later, they married when they were both 20.\u000a\u000aKatie did catch Dalton's infection. She died September 22. Dalton died on September 17.\u000a\u000aTheir love story captivated readers.\u000a\u000aBut their story was more than just a touching and tragic tale that went viral on the Internet. Katie and Dalton's story teaches us lessons about love and medicine.\u000a\u000aYou get to make a choice that might hasten your death\u000a\u000aFor the most part, online bystanders were supportive of Katie and Dalton, wishing them well and praying for them after they died. But there were also haters, because of Katie's choice to meet up with Dalton even though he had that infection.\u000a\u000aThe average life expectancy for a cystic fibrosis patient who reaches adulthood is 37, according to the National Library of Medicine . Katie died at 26.\u000a\u000a"There's bullies behind names on the Internet that are like, 'You're so stupid,' " she said.\u000a\u000aLess than a week before she died, Katie sat down for an interview with CNN at her home in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, and said she never regretted meeting up with Dalton.\u000a\u000a"I'd rather have five years of being in love and just really completely happy than 20 years of not having anybody and just having nothing," she said.\u000a\u000aDr. Chris Feudtner, an ethicist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the haters are wrong, and Katie had the right to make a decision that would probably shorten her life.\u000a\u000a"We honor people's ability to make decisions for themselves," he said.\u000a\u000aHe mentioned that his elderly mother, for example, wants to stay alone in her home instead of moving into assisted living, even though living at home increases the chances she could fall and no one would be immediately available to help her. He said his family is still working it out, but his mother might get her wish.\u000a\u000a"We let people make decisions about how they want to live even in the face of pretty substantial risk," he said.\u000a\u000aMedicaid sometimes fails the very sick\u000a\u000aCNN first brought Katie and Dalton's story to light in April 2015 because she was having trouble getting a lung transplant.\u000a\u000aDoctors in her home state of Kentucky were reluctant to give her the transplant. They wanted her to go to a larger program at the University of Pittsburgh that had more experience performing transplants for people with infections.\u000a\u000aKentucky Medicaid had refused to pay for her to have a lung transplant in another state. It agreed after CNN published its story.\u000a\u000aDr. Pam Shaw, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Kansas Medical Center, said Medicaid, which operates independently in each state, often won't pay for care in another state, even when it's clear the patient would be much better off.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, this is quite common," said Shaw, a member of the board of the directors of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\u000a\u000a"Our hospital is 1,000 feet from the Missouri state line, and we won't accept Missouri Medicaid, even though for some medical problems, we have the best services for children," she said. "It just breaks my heart to tell a family 'I can't take care of you because you live in Missouri.' "\u000a\u000aShaw suggested that the government change Medicaid so it's more like Medicare, the insurance program for the elderly that's run by the federal government, not state governments.\u000a\u000a"I know that's pie in the sky, but it would be a lot better for patients, their families and the physicians who care for them," she said.\u000a\u000aIt's a real phenomenon: Spouses often die close together\u000a\u000aKatie and Dalton died just five days apart, and several studies show this isn't unusual. Researchers call it "the widowhood effect."\u000a\u000aStudies have found that an elderly person's chance of dying increases by as much as 90% in the three months after his or her spouse dies, according to a 2008 study by researchers at Harvard and the University of Wisconsin.\u000a\u000aThe physiological reason for this -- what actually is happening inside someone's body -- is pretty much a mystery.\u000a\u000aBroken heart syndrome ," technically called stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is one explanation. It's the heart's reaction to a surge of stress hormones that can be caused by the loss of a loved one, a divorce, a betrayal or any similar traumatic event.\u000a\u000aBut not all spouses die of this particular problem. The 2008 study found that after losing a spouse, people die within just a few months of all sorts of diseases, including diabetes, infections and cancer.\u000a\u000aPart of it might be practical, said Dr. Eric DeJonge, director of Total Elder Care at Medstar Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Georgetown University Hospital.\u000a\u000a"Elderly couples often become 'co-dependent' on each other for cognitive or physical daily functions," he wrote in an email. "When that support gets knocked out, it can destabilize the survivor."\u000a\u000aDr. Christine Todd, an assistant professor of internal medicine and chairwoman of the department of medical humanities at Southern Illinois University, said she thinks it also has to do with the effect that emotions have on the immune system, especially on someone who's already in fragile health.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Grief plus depression has a very dynamic effect," she said. "Stress hormones and depression affect all your organs; it's enough to shut things down."\u000a\u000aThe tragic end of the Pragers' love story touched millions around the world.\u000a\u000aDalton was doing relatively well after his transplant in November 2014. But just as Katie's health was declining this fall, he caught pneumonia.\u000a\u000aStill, his family hoped he'd beat the infection and get out of the hospital in time to visit Katie at home before she died.\u000a\u000aFamily members never expected he would die before her, and when he did, Katie was "devasted," said her mother, Debra Donovan.\u000a\u000a"She's just in shock," Donovan said the day Dalton died. "And she hasn't felt well today."

"Working Stiff: Two Years, 267 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner" is available in bookstores worldwide and online. (The names of victims were changed in the book.)\u000a\u000a(CNN) "Remember: This can only end badly." That's what my husband says anytime I start a story. He's right.\u000a\u000aSo. This carpenter is sitting on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan with his buddies, half a dozen subcontractors in hard hats sipping their coffees before the morning shift gets started.\u000a\u000aThe remains of a hurricane blew over the city the day before, halting construction, but now it's back to business on the office tower they've been building for eight months.\u000a\u000aAs the sun comes up and the traffic din grows, a new noise punctures the hum of taxis and buses: a metallic creak, not immediately menacing.\u000a\u000aThe creak turns into a groan, and somebody yells.\u000a\u000aJudy Melinek\u000a\u000aThe workers can't hear too well over the diesel noise and gusting wind, but they can tell the voice is directed at them. The groan sharpens to a screech. The men look up -- then jump to their feet and sprint off, their coffee flying everywhere. The carpenter chooses the wrong direction.\u000a\u000aWith an earthshaking crash, the derrick of a 383-foot-tall construction crane slams down on James Friarson's head. I arrived at this gruesome scene two hours later with a team of MLIs, medicolegal investigators from the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner.\u000a\u000aThe crane had fallen directly across a busy intersection at rush hour and the police had shut it down, snarling traffic in all directions.\u000a\u000aThe MLI driving the morgue van cursed like a sailor as he inched us the last few blocks to the cordon line.

I'm a guileless, sunny optimist, in fact. When I first started training in death investigation, my husband, T.J., worried my new job would change the way I looked at the world.

More important, that dead body is not my only patient.\u000a\u000aThe survivors are the ones who really matter. I work for them too.\u000a\u000aFrom WORKING STIFF by Judy Melinek and T.J. Mitchell.

aVStephens, who has jumped more than 900 positions in the world rankings in a month, on Thursday reached her first major final, defeating No. 9 Venus Williams 6-1, 0-6, 7-5 at the US Open at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing, New York.\u000a\u000a"I have no words to describe what I'm feeling, what it took to get here, just the journey I've been on," Stephens said on court after the win. "I have no words."\u000a\u000aHer next opponent is No. 15 seed Madison Keys, who defeated No. 20 CoCo Vandeweghe in what turned out to be a thoroughly one-sided semifinal that lasted 66 minutes, 6-1, 6-2. It also will be Keys' first major final.\u000a\u000a"It still doesn't feel real," the 22-year-old Keys said. "I'm still shaking."\u000a\u000aThis year marked the first time four American women reached the semifinals at the US Open since 1981, when Tracy Austin, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova and Barbara Potter did it. The last time it happened in a major was at Wimbledon in 1985 (Evert, Zina Garrison, Navratilova and Kathy Rinaldi).\u000a\u000aIt's the first all-American US Open final since 2002, when Serena Williams defeated Venus Williams. Stephens and Keys have played each other just once, with Stephens winning that match.\u000a\u000aStephens' long road back\u000a\u000aStephens, who was sidelined for 11 months following a foot injury and surgery, made her comeback at Wimbledon and entered this summer's US Open Series ranked 957th. But she's been on a tear in the North American events, reaching the semifinals in Toronto and Cincinnati. Heading into Thursday's semifinal, Stephens had won 13 of her last 15 matches.\u000a\u000aStephens, 24, entered the US Open at No. 83 in the rankings. By reaching the final, she is projected to rise to No. 22. She's the fourth unseeded player to advance to a US Open final in the Open Era. Her previous best result in a major was reaching the Australian Open semifinal in 2013.\u000a\u000aAfter the handshake with Williams, Stephens applauded the seven-time major champion as she left the court.\u000a\u000a"When I started my comeback, if someone told me I was going to make two semis and a grand slam final, I just would have probably just passed out because that's what I'm ready to do now," Stephens said. "It's incredible. I don't know what to say. I don't know how I got here. Just hard work. That's it."\u000a\u000aWilliams, a seven-time major champion, was seeking her first grand slam title since 2008, and she has been achingly close this year. She lost in the Australian Open final to her sister, Serena Williams, and the Wimbledon final to Garbine Muguruza.\u000a\u000aAt 37, she was trying to become the oldest grand slam singles champion in the Open Era, taking the record from her sister.\u000a\u000aWhen Williams exited the court, Stephens stood up and applauded the champion, who won the US Open in 2000 and 2001.\u000a\u000a"I'm honestly just honored to be able to play at the same time as her, one of the greatest to play our game," Stephens said, who is now 2-0 against Williams.\u000a\u000aWhile Stephens remained steady early, the unforced errors piled on for Williams, finishing the first set with 17. The set took just 24 minutes.\u000a\u000a"I just wasn't playing well," Williams said. "Those are moments where you have to dig deep and figure out how to get the ball on the court and have a big game. I can't be tentative and try to figure out how to put that ball in.\u000a\u000a"I figured out a lot, but she played great defense. I haven't played her in a long time. Clearly she's seen me play many, many times. I haven't seen her play as much."\u000a\u000aBut the script was flipped in the second. After saving three break points in the opening game, Williams' level of play went up dramatically, with 11 winners and Stephens regressing.\u000a\u000aIt was a tighter third set, but the unforced errors kept rising for Williams as the two players traded breaks. At 5-5, Sloane hit the gas pedal, scrambling all over the court displaying terrific defense and breaking Williams at love.\u000a\u000aWilliams finished with 51 unforced errors, to Stephens' 27.\u000a\u000a"It required a lot of fight, a lot of grit," Stephens said of the final set. "I knew if I just stayed with it and hung tough, played my game as best as I could and didn't get too down on myself, I would have a few opportunities. That's just what I did. ... I just worked my tail off and ran every ball down and tried to get a racquet on every ball."\u000a\u000aKeys dominates\u000a\u000aFor Keys, this year's US Open was just her 10th tournament of 2017. During the off-season, Keys underwent surgery on her left wrist and missed the first two months of the year. She also, according to the WTA's website, had a second surgery on the wrist ahead of Wimbledon.\u000a\u000aKeys improves to 3-0 against the 25-year-old Vandeweghe, all of which happened this summer. Those first two wins -- at Cincinnati and in Stanford, California -- were close matches. This one was far from that, as Keys had 25 winners to Vandeweghe's 22 unforced errors.\u000a\u000aMadison Keys celebrates after defeating CoCo Vandeweghe in straight sets.\u000a\u000a"I knew I had to rise to the occasion, and I'm just happy to be in the final," said Keys, whose previous best major result was reaching the semifinal at the 2015 Australian Open.\u000a\u000aWhile Keys dominated on Thursday, there could be a question about her health. At 4-1 in the second set, she took a medical timeout and left the court. She emerged with heavy wrapping on her right thigh.\u000a\u000aKeys said she wanted treatment because she had "started to feel it" and "was afraid something more serious would happen" if she didn't. However, when she was asked how sound she was heading into Saturday's final, she answered with a huge smile.\u000a\u000a"I feel great right now," she replied. "I don't think I could feel better than I do right now."

aV(CNN) Yes, peanut butter can be a nutritious diet staple, but some varieties are healthier than others.\u000a\u000aPeanut butter is rich in heart-healthy fats and is a good source of protein, which can be helpful for vegetarians looking to include more protein in their diets. A 2-tablespoon serving of peanut butter contains up to 8 grams of protein and 2 to 3 grams of fiber. The nutty spread also offers vitamins and minerals including the B vitamin niacin, iron, potassium and vitamin E.\u000a\u000aThe healthiest peanut butter is made from just peanuts, while added salt, sugars and oils change its nutritional profile. For example, a peanut butter with salt added can have 100 to 150 milligrams of sodium, while an unsalted version is sodium-free. Sugars may be added too, especially in flavored varieties, and can contribute up to 7 grams, or 28 calories per serving.\u000a\u000aNuts, including peanuts (which are technically legumes), have been associated with lower risk of heart disease , cancer and premature death.\u000a\u000aConsumption of nuts and peanut butter has also been associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes . However, one study that tracked more than 120,000 men and women from 1986 to 1996 found that while consumption of nuts and peanuts was associated with lower mortality rates among individuals, no protective effect was found for peanut butter\u000a\u000a"In the past, it has been shown that peanut butter contains trans fatty acids and therefore the composition of peanut butter is different from peanuts. The adverse health effects of salt and trans fatty acids could inhibit the protective effects of peanuts," researchers wrote in a news release on the study.\u000a\u000aIn fact, a 2001 USDA report found that peanut butter does not contain any detectable levels of trans fats in any of the 11 brands of peanut butters that researchers tested , which included both major store brands and "natural brands," even though small amounts of hydrogenated vegetable oils are added to commercial peanut butters to prevent the peanut oil from separating out.\u000a\u000aThough it might seem that crunchy or chunky peanut butter might have an edge over the smooth kind, nutritionally speaking, they are pretty similar. Differences among peanut butters have more to do with a spread's ingredients, rather than its texture.\u000a\u000aLinda V. Van Horn, professor of preventive medicine and a registered dietitian at Northwestern University, stated that commercial peanut butter formulations have been improved because the food industry is aware of the trans fat issues and has responded by reformulating those products. "Just remember to check the label for '0' trans fats and preferably '0' added sugars," she said. Fortunately, "there is no concern with ground-up peanuts ... otherwise known as 'natural' peanut butter."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind that most of the calories in peanut butter come from fat. While it's mostly the heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated kind, it does make peanut butter a calorie-dense food. A 2-tablespoon serving has approximately 200 calories, so if you are carefully watching calories, you can cut that portion in half. And steer clear of flavored peanut butters with added sugars and cocoa butter, which morphs a healthy nut spread into dessert.

aV(CNN) In May 2017, a groundbreaking court ruling put Taiwan on course to become the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.\u000a\u000aA few months on, a Taiwanese art museum is set to achieve another milestone by hosting what it believes to be the first major exhibition dedicated to LGBTQ-themed art in Asia.\u000a\u000aTitled "Spectrosynthesis -- Asian LGBTQ Issues and Art Now," the upcoming show at Taipei's Museum of Contemporary Art will feature 50 works by 22 ethnically Chinese artists from around the world.\u000a\u000aThe exhibition is aimed at promoting a better understanding of the LGBTQ experience in Asia, according to curator Sean Hu.\u000a\u000a"The works relates to issues facing the Chinese LGBTQ community and our life stories," he said in a phone interview. "It symbolizes a slice of our history.\u000a\u000a"We hope the exhibition has a ripple effect across Asian society, and leads to people respecting different sexual orientations," said Hu, who is also an activist for LGBTQ and ethnic minority issues in Taiwan.\u000a\u000aDiverse perspectives\u000a\u000aExhibiting artwork from the last 50 years, the show encompasses a variety of mediums, from paintings to video art. The artists featured include Chinese-American filmmaker Wu Tsang, and Samson Young, who is representing Hong Kong at this year's Venice Biennale.\u000a\u000aHong Kong artist Samson Young's video piece strips away the music of a choral performance, leaving behind only the background sounds.\u000a\u000aSingaporean artist Jimmy Ong has contributed a collection of large-scale charcoal artworks addressing gender and sexual identity. Many of the images depict gay couples with their children, a theme often explored in Ong's art.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to grant a pictorial vocabulary for gay people to view their marital statuses, which are absent in regular Asian artworks," he said in a phone interview. "And they're definitely absent in family portraits."\u000a\u000aMany of Jimmy Ong's charcoal drawings depict gay parents with their children.\u000a\u000aTwo pieces from Ong's "Ancestors on the Beach" series also feature in the exhibition. The works reference a beach that was popular among Singapore's queer community in the 1990s, though it was subsequently targeted by plainclothes policemen masquerading as gay men.\u000a\u000a"It was a time when there were many people who were persecuted," Ong said. "Some were even publicized in the local newspaper."\u000a\u000aNot all of the exhibition addresses LGBTQ issues so directly, according to Patrick Sun, the founder of Sunpride Foundation, a not-for-profit art organization which helped organize the show. Young's "Muted Situation #5," for instance, was created by stripping the music away from a choral performance, leaving only the background sounds.\u000a\u000a"Samson (Young)'s work doesn't deal with sexuality," Sun said in a phone interview. "But if you put something like that in a LGBTQ exhibition, then people will understand [the message]."\u000a\u000a"You can pare these issues down to basic values that we can all talk about and respond to," agreed Young on the phone. "They aren't limited by your perceived proximity to them."\u000a\u000aA long road\u000a\u000aTaiwan's LGBTQ-themed exhibition appears to have been carefully timed. It coincides with both Art Taipei, Asia's oldest art fair, and Taiwan Pride, Asia's largest gay pride parade.\u000a\u000aBut while the show comes just months after the island's landmark court ruling, it has been in production for the past two years.\u000a\u000aTaiwan had always been the curators' first choice of host, as it has been widely regarded as one of Asia's most progressive places on LGBTQ issues.\u000a\u000a"The Room at the Top of the Stairs" by Ku Fu-sheng (1983). The exhibition will feature 50 works by 22 artists. It aims to highlight the richness and history of Asia's LGBTQ communities.\u000a\u000a"We wanted to (host) the show in an official government museum because we think the institution stands for the government's attitude towards LGBTQ issues," said Hu. "Being accepted by the government, we're more influential to the whole of society in promoting LGBTQ issues. We also wanted to push the government to further protect equal rights."\u000a\u000a"We want to reach not only the LGBTQ community or art circles -- we want a general public (audience)," added Sun. "That's why we launched the exhibition in a public institution."\u000a\u000aLooking to the future\u000a\u000aThe exhibition's organizers have high hopes for the show's future. Sun wants to bring the artworks to his home city of Hong Kong, while Hu wants to take the exhibition to Japan, Korea and less socially liberal Asian countries, like China and Thailand.\u000a\u000a"We hope that the public will have a better understanding for the LGBTQ community after seeing the show," said Sun," and that the LGBTQ community will feel less isolated and lonely -- more proud and confident to be who they are."\u000a\u000a"Spectrosynthesis -- Asian LGBTQ Issues and Art Now" is showing at the Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei (MOCA) from 9 September to 5 November 2017

aV(CNN) Congress is considering a more aggressive approach toward China as it struggles with North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile advances.\u000a\u000aSince Congress passed a new round of sanctions against Pyongyang in July, North Korea conducted its second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test and sixth nuclear test -- the latest believed to be a hydrogen bomb -- and made advances toward miniaturizing a nuclear weapon.\u000a\u000aThere's broad agreement on Capitol Hill and in the Trump administration that China is key to a diplomatic answer to the North Korean crisis, but getting China to play ball has long proved to be problematic.\u000a\u000aSome lawmakers say they should consider fresh sanctions targeting China to convince Beijing to do more, but there are concerns that going after China will also harm the US -- and it may not sway Kim Jong Un anyway.\u000a\u000a"Economic sanctions against China sounds great, but those will have an impact on the United States," said Virginia Rep. Rob Wittman, a senior Republican on the House armed services committee. "People have to be willing to say if we're going to do that, there's going to be some suffering here. So we have to be willing, if we're going to do that, to be all in, which makes it more of a challenge to convince folks here it needs to happen."\u000a\u000aCalifornia Rep. Ed Royce, the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, told CNN Tuesday that he's pressing the administration to put more economic pressure on North Korea.\u000a\u000aHouse Republicans added the House's North Korea sanctions bill to the sanctions package including Russia and Iran that President Donald Trump signed into law last month, which tightened sanctions on foreign companies doing business with North Korea.\u000a\u000aWhile Royce didn't mention China specifically, he said he now wants the administration to use the full weight of the new law for broader sanctions that would impact Beijing's trade with Pyongyang.\u000a\u000a"I think we can cut off the shipping, access to the ports, the sanctions on the entire financial system," Royce said. "It's always been done in fits and starts, it's never been done in consistent relentless way in which you shut down the billions of dollars they need in hard currency."\u000a\u000aUS Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Monday that the US is preparing a new Security Council resolution to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the President's national security team, including Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, is briefing the full House and Senate Tuesday on the North Korean situation.\u000a\u000aDemocrats say they have faith in Trump's national security team, but they worry that the President's tweets -- from criticizing South Korea's approach to the North to suggesting the US could cut off all trade with China -- raise troubling questions about the administration's approach.\u000a\u000a"I want to better understand how seriously I should take the tweets," Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz told CNN. "I want to personally get clear on what American policy is. When we get briefed, I am reassured that there are rational sane people working a strategy."\u000a\u000aAt the same time, some lawmakers are skeptical that China really can take action to stop North Korea's nuclear ambitions, because China wants to avoid creating a failed state in the North.\u000a\u000a"China can cut off all their energy tomorrow and North Korea would be on their knees," said Washington Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House armed services committee.\u000a\u000a"But I don't think North Korea's response would be to stop building missiles and stop building nuclear weapons. Their response would likely be to attack, or the regime would be thrown into chaos, and China doesn't want that."\u000a\u000aCongress is also looking at more immediate ways to bolster the defenses of South Korea and US territories from a potential North Korean missile attack.\u000a\u000aIn addition to boosting the Pentagon's budget for missile defense and nuclear modernization, Congress has largely endorsed selling additional weapons to South Korea -- which the White House touted in a readout of Trump's conversations with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\u000a\u000a"We need an all-hands push to make sure that China feels the pain of this and is engaged in putting more economic pressure on North Korea, and frankly, to escalate the preparations for our vital allies in the region to make sure that South Korea and Japan have the anti-missile defenses they are seeking," Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons told CNN's Erin Burnett.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea this week approved the installation of four additional launchers of the US-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. THAAD is a sore spot for China, which considers the system a threat in the region, though the US insists its purely to guard against the North Korean missile threat.\u000a\u000aChina and Russia have proposed a so-called "freeze-for-freeze" plan for North Korea to suspend its missile program in exchange for the US and South Korea to stop joint military exercises. But the US has rejected the notion -- Haley called it "insulting" on Monday to suggest that the US and its allies would lower their guard.\u000a\u000aBut Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, suggested that some kind of concession to China would be needed in order for Beijing to get North Korea to the negotiating table in a legitimate fashion.\u000a\u000a"If we want the cooperation of the Chinese on the issue of this 22% increase in trade between China and North Korea over the last year, in cutting off the oil to North Korea, and giving China assurances that our goal is not to decapitate the North Korean regime but just end the ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program -- then we are going to have to give to China, some of the concessions which are going to be sincere in order to wind up with them as our partner in helping to isolate the North Koreans," Markey said on CNN's "New Day."\u000a\u000aThis story has been updated.

aVWhile home prices in other parts of the country are still 20% below their housing boom peak, demand for large, luxury apartments has helped home prices in Manhattan almost fully recover from the housing bust.\u000a\u000aDuring the first quarter, the median sales price for a condo or co-op in Manhattan rose 18.5% year-over-year to $972,000, according to Douglas Elliman.\u000a\u000aThat's more than four times the median U.S. home price of $205,000. Yet, in most parts of the country $972,000 will typically buy you a sprawling three or four-bedroom with a backyard and a garage. Buyers in Manhattan, however, are willing to shell out that amount for one bedrooms with less than 1,000 square feet of living space.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, prices are expected to continue to climb. Manhattan's home sales are still below the $1.025 million peak set in the second quarter of 2008, said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who calculates the market data for Elliman. But he believes, "we'll probably get there in the second quarter of 2014."\u000a\u000aRelated: Hong Kong buyers send London real estate soaring\u000a\u000aElliman, along with brokers Halstead Property and Corcoran Group, have all reported that sales volume in Manhattan was up 25% or more in the first quarter. And inventory still remains very tight, with homes often being snapped up in bidding wars.\u000a\u000aMiller said 38% of all sales were either at or above asking price and that has caused a big spike in prices.\u000a\u000aAll three brokers reported that they saw high demand in luxury and high-end sales.\u000a\u000aWith little new residential construction happening, there's not enough homes available to handle all of this buyer demand. Only 367 newly built apartments were sold during the quarter. Many were in ultra-luxury buildings catering to an international clientele of Chinese industrialists, Russian oil billionaires and other foreign tycoons.\u000a\u000aAlso boosting prices: Families seeking large apartments of three bedrooms or more, said Diane Ramirez, the CEO of Halstead.\u000a\u000a"Manhattan was often for a segment of your life before you started a family or after you downsized in retirement," she said. "No longer. Now, it's where you want to raise your kids."\u000a\u000aCorcoran reported that 31% of new development closings during the first quarter were for units that had three bedrooms or more.\u000a\u000aRelated: Million dollar housing markets\u000a\u000aManhattan's housing shortage has sent many home seekers further afield to the outer boroughs, New Jersey and Long Island.\u000a\u000aBrooklyn is starting to become even hotter than Manhattan. Brooklyn's Kings County is the fastest growing county in the state, with the median price of homes rising 11.2% to $570,110 in the fourth quarter, according to Douglas Elliman, the last data available.

aVDanae Mercer, CNN \u2022 Published 6th September 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Luxury bedding and hot tubs are all well and good, but when did you last check into a hotel with real creature comforts -- provided by real creatures?\u000a\u000aFrom herons to horses, several properties around the planet provide encounters with animals for their guests alongside the regular room service.\u000a\u000aHere are 12 of the best hotels with their own critters in residence.\u000a\u000a1. Kimpton Hotels (throughout the United States)\u000a\u000aAlex greets guests arriving at Kimpton Hotel Monaco Seattle.\u000a\u000aPets are such a big part of Kimpton hotels that they've been given an official job title: director of pet relations.\u000a\u000aAt Kimpton Hotel Monaco Portland , the director of pet relations is Dakota, a golden retriever originally from Australia. The dog makes herself at home in this eccentric 1912 building.\u000a\u000a"Dakota once swam with dolphins and maintains her water-loving ways Stateside," says Allison Ferré, regional PR manager at Kimpton Hotels. Now the dog rides on her owner's paddle board or splashes in the waterfalls of the Columbia River Gorge.\u000a\u000aOver at the luxurious-meets-quirky Kimpton Hotel Monaco Seattle , dog Alex helps check guests in or runs down the carpeted hallways. Ice cubes are his favorite treat, explains Ferré -- often given for a job well done.\u000a\u000a"A little cold never bothered Alex," Ferré says of the Russia-born dog. "He's loving his new home and hopes for the chance to bury his nose in the snow this winter."\u000a\u000aAs for external animals? "Our pet policy is pretty simple," says Meredith Black, Kimpton's communications coordinator. "If the pet can fit through the hotel doors, they're welcome to stay."\u000a\u000aEach of the group's 60 hotels provides water bowls, treats, pet beds, toys and pooper-scooper bags.\u000a\u000a2. Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort, Lapland, Finland\u000a\u000aFancy a husky ride? This is the place for you.\u000a\u000aWith 400 husky dogs across three farms, 16 horses, two reindeer fences and three cats "belonging to Santa," there are plenty of animal-spotting opportunities at Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort.\u000a\u000aThrow in the possibility of viewing the Northern Lights from luxurious glass-top igloos, and it's easy to see why travelers flock to this remote destination in the dead of winter.\u000a\u000a"The animals live in our resort all year," says Joti Nalluri, sales and marketing manager for Kakslauttanen. "They have a busy working season from October to April. The other months, they have a summer holiday."\u000a\u000aKiilopääntie 9, 99830 Saariselkä, Finland; +358 16 667100\u000a\u000a3. Farm Sanctuary, New York\u000a\u000aGoing snout-to-snout at New York's Farm Sanctuary.\u000a\u000aWhile accommodation at this upstate New York property might be a bit rustic, its animal focus is incredible.\u000a\u000aMore than 500 rescued animals roam across Farm Sanctuary 's 175-acre shelter. These include cows, pigs, turkeys and other farm animals. At certain times of the year, guests can book cabins with external bathrooms or tiny houses with full kitchenettes.\u000a\u000a"The majority of animals in the food industry live in some angst, so to see them in a place where they finally feel safe allows us to really get to know the amazing individuals they are," says Susie Coston, Farm Sanctuary's national shelter director.\u000a\u000aComplimentary tours of the animal sanctuary are provided to overnight guests, while day visitors can book tours for $10.\u000a\u000a"Here animals are free to roam lush pastures, sleep securely in their barns, lie in the sun and just be the special beings they are," adds Coston.\u000a\u000aOut of respect to the animals, all food on the property is vegan.\u000a\u000aFarm Sanctuary, 3138 Aikens Rd, Watkins Glen, New York; +1 607-583-2225\u000a\u000a4. Manor Hill House, Worcestershire, England\u000a\u000aFriendly horse Jack is a welcome wedding guest at Manor Hill.\u000a\u000aTraditional countryside and winding, hedge-lined roads surround the family-owned Manor Hill House , nestled in the heart of central England's Worcestershire County.\u000a\u000aUpon arrival, Jack, the property's energetic horse, greets guests.\u000a\u000a"He's a real flirt with the guests," jokes Ros Hill, events and marketing manager for Manor Hill House. "He actually forms quite a bond with guests. You see them stop to say goodbye to Jack before they leave."\u000a\u000aThis intimate property is often rented out for events. Yet its four contemporary rooms -- each filled with family mementos, like photographs from the children's university days -- also suit overnight B&B guests.\u000a\u000a"Jack isn't available to ride," adds Hill. But when he's not snagging apples from the tree, he's perfect for photos.\u000a\u000aManor Hill House, Swan Hill, Upton Warren, Bromsgrove B61 9HE, England; +44 1527 861200\u000a\u000a5. Mandarin Oriental Boston, Boston, Massachusetts\u000a\u000aBonnie and Tara are a staple of the Mandarin Oriental Boston.\u000a\u000aBetween the Mandarin Oriental hotel's champagne bar and art displays, travelers might spot something a bit different: two cheerful golden retrievers.\u000a\u000aNamed Bonnie and Tara, the two retrievers belong to general manager Philipp Knuepfer. The jolly pups typically roam the hotel's exquisite lobby or wait in Knuepfer's office.\u000a\u000aGuests can ask at the front desk if Bonnie and Tara might come out and play.\u000a\u000a"They provide a warm tail-wagging welcome for all of our guests," says Knuepfer, pointing to the animals' boundless energy. It's something he enjoys sharing with all visitors.\u000a\u000aAfter saying hello to the pampered pooches, travelers can unwind in Boston's largest spa or dine at French bistro Bar Boulud.\u000a\u000aMandarin Oriental, 776 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts; +1 617-535-8888\u000a\u000a6. Giraffe Manor, Nairobi, Kenya\u000a\u000aShare your breakfast with giraffes at Giraffe Manor\u000a\u000aWith 12 acres of private forest, sun-dappled verandas and a luxurious Colonial-era vibe, Giraffe Manor is a high-end hotel with plenty to lure travelers. But most don't come for the massive fireplaces, the manicured gardens or the 12 themed rooms -- they come for the giraffes.\u000a\u000aTwice a day, over breakfast and afternoon tea, the resident herd of Rothschild giraffes wanders up to the manor's dining room. Guests are given grass pellets to share.\u000a\u000aAround five to 10 giraffes can be expected to visit during the day (although as the animals are wild, nothing is guaranteed). Only overnight guests are allowed.\u000a\u000aTravelers can also stop by Nairobi's Giraffe Centre , just a five-minute walk from Giraffe Manor. This popular tourist spot allows guests to feed giraffes at certain times under close supervision.\u000a\u000aInteraction is much more limited, but so's the price tag. Proceeds go into conservation work.\u000a\u000aGiraffe Manor, Gogo Falls Road, Nairobi, Kenya; +254 725 675830\u000a\u000a7. Jumeirah Vittaveli, Maldives\u000a\u000aHoliday with herons in the Maldives.\u000a\u000aThere's no shortage of amazing tropical fish in the Maldives, but Jumeirah Vittaveli is a high-end hotel that has taken things up a level: it has "pet" herons.\u000a\u000aThe property's team tagged several grey herons when they were born. They've since taken up residence on the private island.\u000a\u000a"They are frequent visitors," explains Tina Dotzauer, director of marketing and communications for Jumeirah Vittaveli. "And they always show up for the daily stingray feeding."\u000a\u000aEach of the venue's 89 villas and suites has a private pool and direct beach or lagoon access, meaning the herons might drop by at any time.\u000a\u000aThere's also a five-bedroom royal residence spanning 3,500 square meters of private ocean, two private pools and a private overwater bar -- ideal for waiting while animal watching.\u000a\u000aJumeirah Vittaveli, Male, Maldives; +960 664 2020\u000a\u000a8. Desert Palm Dubai, UAE\u000a\u000aDesert Palm is home to a Spanish-inspired riding school.\u000a\u000aNestled on a 160-acre estate around 20 minutes from the Dubai airport, Desert Palm is all about ponies. Around 70 horses populate the property's Spanish-inspired riding school.\u000a\u000aRooms face out toward polo courts while statues of horses dot the grounds. Staff in polo shirts roam between rooms decorated with polo accessories, and on-site stables means horses are only ever a short walk away.\u000a\u000aTravelers can feed the horses or book a 45-minute riding class. For those who prefer their ponies with a side of bubbles, polo matches are staged daily during the property's afternoon tea. Riders compete while guests sip champagne and nibble cakes from a three-tiered stand.\u000a\u000aDesert Palm, Dubai, +971 4 323 8888\u000a\u000a9. Moonfleet Manor, Dorset, England\u000a\u000aMeet Snoopy at Moonfleet Manor.\u000a\u000aPerched on a quiet spot on England's fossil-riddled Jurassic Coast, Moonfleet Manor is a family-friendly property that offers fresh ocean air and strolls around the nearby lagoon beach.\u000a\u000aIt also comes with one dog -- a cocker spaniel named Snoopy -- and eight lively chickens. Goldie is the biggest, Delilah the fastest and Matilda the most inclined for a cuddle.\u000a\u000aThe roaming animals give this 18th-century building a friendly vibe.\u000a\u000aWhen not chasing after chickens or snuggling Snoopy, travelers are offered Wellington boots, spades and buckets for a day on the beach. Creche facilities, a sandpit and a trampoline are handy for keeping children entertained. At night, the roaring fire is perfect for reclining with a copy of J. Meade Falkner's classic smuggling novel "Moonfleet."\u000a\u000aMoonfleet Manor, Fleet Rd, Weymouth, England; +44 1305 786948\u000a\u000a10. Anantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar Resort, Green Mountain, Oman\u000a\u000aEnjoy private yoga sessions in the mountains alongside donkey rides at this Middle East resort.\u000a\u000aOman's Al Hajar mountain range is known as the Grand Canyon of the Middle East, with sweeping views, deep gorges and dried river beds ideal for long hikes.\u000a\u000aLocated some 2,000 meters above sea level on the canyon of Green Mountain, the luxurious Anantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar Resort has private-pool villas, a hammam spa, a fort star-gazing platform and private yoga sessions done as the sun rises over distant peaks.\u000a\u000aIt also has a single donkey, available every Friday for children to ride.\u000a\u000aAdults can hop on the complimentary bikes to cycle around the tiny surrounding town, where chickens and goats roam freely.\u000a\u000aAnantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar Resort, No 110, Al Jabal Al Akhdar, Nizwa 621, Oman; +968 25 218000\u000a\u000a11. Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge, Florida\u000a\u000aExperience a slice of Africa in Florida.\u000a\u000aDisney's Animal Kingdom Lodge is a bit like going on safari without ever leaving the States. This family-friendly property is built on 46 acres of savanna. In the lobby, a 16-foot African mask looms tall. Rooms -- many decorated with Zimbabwe-built accents -- face out over the pool or the animal sanctuary.\u000a\u000aGuests can spot zebras, wildebeests, giraffes, impalas, storks and some 200 mammals and birds from the 24-hour viewing platform. For a more immersive experience, there's a three-hour sunset safari followed by dinner.\u000a\u000aThe lodge also has an 11,000-square-foot pool with a waterslide for the kids and wine tastings for the adults.\u000a\u000a2901 Osceola Pkwy, Orlando, Florida; +1 407-938-3000\u000a\u000a12. Four Seasons Hotel Hampshire, Hook, England\u000a\u000aThe regal Oliver Beckington has been featured in Tatler and Vanity Fair.\u000a\u000aFour Seasons Hotel Hampshire is a renovated Georgian manor house, set amid 500 acres of surrounding countryside, which comes with its own stables, horses and semi-famous dog: Oliver Beckington.\u000a\u000aThe four-legged hotel resident has appeared on the cover of a local magazine, as well as in Tatler and Vanity Fair. But when he's not stealing the limelight, Oliver enjoys countryside walks along the canal and strolls to his favorite part of the estate.\u000a\u000aFor guests' dogs, the hotel offers personal dog beds, dog dishes, a packet of food and fresh spring water on arrival. Dog sitting services are also available.

aVStory highlights Pruitt said he's focused on helping Florida after Irma\u000a\u000aHe said Congress needs to address climate change\u000a\u000aWashington (CNN) Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNN in an interview about Hurricane Irma on Thursday that the time to talk about climate change isn't now.\u000a\u000a"Here's the issue," Pruitt told CNN in a phone interview. "To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm; versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced."\u000a\u000aHe continued: "What we need to focus on is access to clean water, addressing these areas of superfund activities that may cause an attack on water, these issues of access to fuel. ... Those are things so important to citizens of Florida right now, and to discuss the cause and effect of these storms, there's the... place (and time) to do that, it's not now."\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump has previously called climate change a "hoax" and Pruitt has led a push to roll back EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aHurricane Irma is hammering a string of northeast Caribbean islands and making its way toward a possible hit on Florida over the weekend. As the Category 5 storm heads toward the Florida coast, experts have been clear about how global warming has contributed to the increased strength of hurricanes this season.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVOn and off for nearly two years, she lived on the streets of Boston. She slept on benches and survived on food she found in the garbage.\u000a\u000a"Being homeless as a teenager, you understand that nobody can protect you," she said. "You have to protect yourself."\u000a\u000aUltimately, Ben Yosef got her life on track. She moved back to Israel, where she had lived as a child, attended boarding school and later served in the military. When she became pregnant at 20, the prospect of motherhood brought her life into focus.\u000a\u000a"I didn't have a home or a family, and that was in my soul," she said. "I wanted to help other kids like me."\u000a\u000aShe started by serving weekly dinners to homeless youth. Before she knew it, she was giving them a place to stay.\u000a\u000a"I couldn't say no to the ones that didn't have anywhere to go after dinner," she said. "So, I opened my home for (them)."\u000a\u000aToday, her organization, the Shanti House, has grown into a sprawling two-campus facility -- with locations in Tel Aviv and the Negev region -- that has helped more than 46,000 young people.\u000a\u000aNamed for the Sanskrit word for peace and tranquility, the group provides temporary housing and long-term support for homeless and at-risk youth ages 14 to 21.\u000a\u000a"My goal is that every child that comes through this door will feel at home ... where they can finally let out a sigh of relief, feel secure, and most importantly, be happy," Ben Yosef said.\u000a\u000aCNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Ben Yosef about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: The young people you work with -- what's it like to be in their shoes?\u000a\u000aMariuma Ben Yosef: (They) don't have a home. They are children that are coming from juvenile court, some are referred to by social workers and others are coming from the streets of Israel. Many have experienced sex abuse, violence and neglect. A lot of the kids I work with have been victimized by their parents or other members of their family; the very people that are supposed to give them comfort are causing them to suffer.\u000a\u000aWhen you live in the streets, you're always on guard. You hear footsteps at night, and you don't know if it's someone who will want to rape you or harm you in some way. You are on survival mode all the time, and that is very hard. Not only do you have no roof over your head, no food, no bed, you really have nothing. It's always lonely; you feel that you have no roots and nowhere to go. These circumstances make you hate yourself and the world. You have to develop your own roots to survive; you have to be very strong because you have nobody.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Heroes: A Cosmic Family Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Heroes: A Cosmic Family 02:42\u000a\u000aCNN: How have your personal experiences shaped your approach to the work?\u000a\u000aBen Yosef: When I first started this work, a girl who came to live at the Shanti House told me about a brutal rape she went through. I am a rape survivor as well but had never spoken about it with anyone. There were many painful experiences I had growing up that I had blocked out of my mind. I just kept moving and moving. But in this situation with this girl, I knew that I could provide comfort by sharing my story with her, so I did.\u000a\u000aThat was the first time I expressed my pain to somebody else. That's when I understood that I survived all these difficult situations so that I could help others, and I realized that this is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.\u000a\u000aPeople say that I'm saving these children, but really, they're the ones saving me. They've saved my soul and helped me to feel whole again. I feel alive because of them.\u000a\u000aBen Yosef (center) hugs two participants who have received Shanti House's services.\u000a\u000aCNN: What's it like to work with such a diverse array of youth?\u000a\u000aBen Yosef: We serve children that come from all over Israel. We welcome everybody, regardless of religion, race or sexual orientation. We accept you as you are -- as a human being.\u000a\u000aWhat makes the Shanti House so unique is that regardless of where they came from, all the kids come together to help one another. It's amazing to see everyone in one room. You have Ethiopians, Jews, Russians, Arabs, all living together, co-existing peacefully. There are no politics here. We are a family.\u000a\u000aWe provide these children not only with a bed, food, therapies, medical care, and education, we also provide them with love, security and all the emotional needs of someone who is missing a family. We give them everything they need to survive and succeed.\u000a\u000aI'm so proud of each and every one of my kids because they chose life and not a path of self-destruction in the streets.

aVNic Robertson is CNN's international diplomatic editor. The opinions in this article are those of the author.\u000a\u000aSadly for Yukiya Amano -- the director general of the IAEA, whom I interviewed this week -- the diplomacy required to get his inspectors access to North Korea's nefarious nuclear sites has been in short supply.\u000a\u000aSadly perhaps for the rest of us, that shortage of diplomacy when it comes to dealing with North Korea isn't about to change. Worse, it might be driven into the dirt.\u000a\u000aIAEA inspectors have had their best -- albeit at times troubled -- access to North Korea when the world's global powers have been somewhat aligned.\u000a\u000aThe six parties that were once involved in talks -- comprising the US, China, Russia, South Korea, Japan and of course North Korea -- had a brief coming together of interests from early 2007 to late 2008, until Kim Jong Il, father of the current North Korea leader, balked and kicked the IAEA monitors out of the country.\u000a\u000aToday, Russia and China are teaming up against the US over North Korea, joining diplomatic forces and demanding a "freeze for freeze" on the Korean peninsula. This plan would have the US and South Korea halt their military exercises in exchange for Kim cutting his nuclear tests.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump's ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has declared this plan a non-starter, saying while Kim threatens the US, now is not the time to skimp on training with allies.\u000a\u000aBut the gulf between the US and both Russia and China has not been as vast as it is today in recent years.\u000a\u000aSince coming to power, President Trump has vacillated between open arms and outright hostility to both nations. Now, neither country -- both of which wield power to veto UN Security Council resolutions, don't forget -- knows what to expect from Washington, so it makes sense that they would plan for the worst.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED IAEA chief: North Korea now a global threat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH IAEA chief: North Korea now a global threat 02:57\u000a\u000aRussia's President, Vladimir Putin, is being particularly bellicose, characterizing the North Korea situation as another Iraq scenario, and implying that the US is a bully on the verge of a vain and disastrous invasion.\u000a\u000aChina fears Trump's warnings of a trade war. These fears could be amped up by his recent threats to cut trade with any country doing business with North Korea.\u000a\u000aNothing coming out of DC at the moment gives either China or Russia any confidence of diplomacy that could survive the first engagement inside the Oval Office.\u000a\u000aAnd just as China has its own agenda, so does Putin.\u000a\u000aHe wants center stage on all global issues these days: Russia is still smarting from the western sanctions imposed in response to its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea and its actions in Syria.\u000a\u000aHis eastern economic gathering in Vladivostock , with its sudden focus on the regional players in the North Korea crisis, automatically makes Putin a key power broker.\u000a\u000aHe openly called Haley's demand for a last gasp of diplomacy and more UN sanctions on North Korea "useless."\u000a\u000aOf course, for this situation, Trump has only himself to blame. Even his allies are becoming wary of him.\u000a\u000aThis past weekend, tweeting that South Korea's President Moon Jae-in had been "appeasing" Kim. A few weeks ago he threatened "fire and fury" on North Korea, then a few days later said even that wasn't enough.\u000a\u000aWhile Haley told the UN Security Council that Kim was "begging for a war," Britain's ambassador, an ally of Haley, struck a more subdued tone, reminding the gathered diplomats that "sanctions are working."\u000a\u000aOther US allies have been keeping a little distance too.\u000a\u000aGermany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron together issued joint statements about North Korea's massive nuclear bomb test, emphasizing not just UN sanctions, but separate European sanctions also.\u000a\u000aWhile Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin play the long game, Trump's Twitter followers feed his impulsive nature. They are doing little to further his or America's interests.\u000a\u000aHe is paying the bill for irascibility and both Russia and China will milk it for all its worth to them and their national interests.\u000a\u000aBoth countries fear an outcome that increases US influence in the region. Now is the ideal time to grind every grand and petty grievance they have against Trump.\u000a\u000aSuch animus makes the US President's hand at UN diplomacy weaker than any of his predecessors had over North Korea. Not just because Kim is so much closer to having the nuclear weapons he threatens, but because Trump's inclination to play every issue for the moment with little eye for the future is backfiring.\u000a\u000aSince coming to power seven months ago he has antagonized his adversaries and distanced his friends.\u000a\u000aEven so, Amano at the IAEA lives in hope of diplomacy.\u000a\u000aWhile Kim sprints to ready his deadly nuclear weapons arsenal, Amano is ratcheting up the IAEA's readiness, should sanctions bring Kim to talks and let him get his inspectors back inside the hermit kingdom.\u000a\u000aAmano can't say if North Korea's hydrogen bomb threat is already a reality, or what his inspectors can do if it is. But his rare conversation with this journalist and full-throated warning that Kim is now a global threat speak volumes to the dangers of Trump's diplomatic failings.

aV(CNN) Although the details are scarce, President Donald Trump's proposed budget, "America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again" (PDF) , paints a dramatic picture for the American science and medical communities that is facing huge potential budget cuts.\u000a\u000aIf it's been a while since you've had a civics class, the Constitution states that it's Congress that gets to decide how to spend the government's money and how to tax its citizens, so this proposal is not the final word on what goes and what stays. But a President essentially starts the conversation, and for many scientists, it's not a happy topic.\u000a\u000aThe National Institutes of Health budget would be cut by $5.8 billion, meaning it would lose about 20%. The Environmental Protection Agency would face $2.6 billion in cuts, that's 31% of the agency's budget. The Department of Energy would lose $900 million, or about 20% of its budget. Health and Human Services would see a $15.1 billion or 18% budget cut; as part of that, it shifts costs to industry from the Food and Drug Administration budget. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would face an 18% budget cut.\u000a\u000aIt's unclear what would happen to the National Science Foundation . That agency gives out more than $7 billion annually in research grants, accounting for about 20% of federal support to academic institutions for basic research, but didn't get a mention in the budget.\u000a\u000aNASA would see a smaller cut by comparison -- a 0.8% decrease from the 2017 budget -- but its Earth Sciences projects would lose about $200 million, and its Office of Education would be dropped.\u000a\u000aThe budget also would eliminate entire programs, such as $403 million in health professionals and nursing training programs. It would kill the Global Climate Change Initiative (PDF) and eliminate payments to the United Nations' efforts to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aIt also would eliminate the fund that is helping clean up Chesapeake Bay . That program was the largest restoration effort for a body of water in American history and is only halfway through.\u000a\u000aThe budget suggests that states should shoulder those costs.\u000a\u000aThe proposal doesn't give a specific funding figure for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it says it would reform the CDC to give states more control over public health by creating a $500 million block grant that would "increase state flexibility and focus on the leading public health challenges to each state." Experts say that could suggest that states would get the funding, as opposed to the federal agency.\u000a\u000aTrump's budget proposal spells out a plan to create a Federal Emergency Response Fund for a rapid response to public health threats like Zika. There's a $20 million increase for the mitigation of lead-based paint in low-income homes, although the budget eliminates the LIHEAP program , which provides heating and cooling assistance to homes in those same communities.\u000a\u000aThe proposal includes $500 million to expand opioid abuse prevention and treatment efforts, $900 million for the Department of the Interior's US Geological Survey to "focus investments in essential science programs" and a billion for water management efforts. There's a $4.4 billion request for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a 6% increase from its current funding. There's also a mention of an investment in "mental health activities" but no specifics.\u000a\u000aThe budget would include some money for international health efforts with a promise to support Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , which works to increase access all over the world. There's also funding for the fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS.\u000a\u000aCongress can accept or reject Trump's budget, and lawmakers have the ability to pick and choose what they like from it.\u000a\u000aAs far as budgets go, Trump's has been compared to President Ronald Reagan's in its conservatism, but Reagan's had a little more "carrot with its stick; this is all stick," budget expert David Wessel said.\u000a\u000aAnd this proposal is a little unusual.\u000a\u000a"It's an interesting first chapter, but I'm disappointed we don't have the rest of it," said Wessel , who is a senior fellow of economic studies with the independent Brookings Institution. The document doesn't come with the usual pages and pages of tables that Congress will use in its conversation on enacting the budget; that part is only 62 pages (PDF). Without detail on taxes and other plans, it's hard to know how the proposed budget would work. "This is more like a bumper sticker than a budget."\u000a\u000aWessel believes the proposal will have a hard time getting through Congress as it stands now because it cuts programs many constituents depend on and programs Congress has increased, like its effort to increase the National Institutes of Health budget last year.\u000a\u000aScience and medical professionals watching the Trump budget process closely had predicted that it could be a tough pill to swallow, but they said they didn't know it would be this hard.\u000a\u000a"I read it a few times again this morning and had to take a few pauses -- to bang my head on the table," said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy with the Union of Concerned Scientists.\u000a\u000a"As scientists, we make decisions based on evidence. What this budget does is ignore evidence and undermine our very ability to collect it across the board," he said.\u000a\u000aRosenberg disagrees with shifting the responsibility to do scientific research. States don't have the capacity, he said, and industry doesn't have the interest or financial incentive to do basic and even some of the applied research the government does. He thinks the proposed budget could hurt the government's mission as an international leader in science.\u000a\u000a"You are telling young, really talented scientists, scientists we need, that you shouldn't go into government, and you are signaling to the senior scientists who have the good experience and knowledge, we need to leave," Rosenberg said. "It sends a really chilling signal across the federal government, and while the public doesn't see a lot of what people in government do, they are doing public service that helps them and has a real impact on their lives."\u000a\u000aSeveral scientific and medical associations also criticized the budget. The American Chemical Society wrote that it "finds these potential cuts extremely concerning because robust, sustained and predictable investments in non-defense research have proven to be critical to the nation's innovation infrastructure, job creation and economic growth."\u000a\u000aThe Alliance for a Stronger FDA appreciated that the proposal "recognizes that FDA's process for reviewing medical products needs resources at least as great as the current level of funding." However, it suggested that the funding mechanism of cutting more than a third of the agency's appropriation and offsetting it with medical product industry user fees "is neither wise nor realistic."\u000a\u000aThe American Medical Association "has grave concerns with proposed deep cuts to the NIH and their impact on patient health. Patients across the country who benefit from NIH research and advancements can attest to its value," said Dr. Andrew W. Gurman, president of the association, in a statement. "NIH conducts vital research into cancer, chronic diseases, and other illnesses, all of which are major drivers of health care costs."\u000a\u000a"The proposed reduction in NIH funding of $5.8 billion would represent a significant setback for millions of American cancer patients, survivors and their families. It would also dramatically constrain the prospect for breakthrough American medical innovation -- an essential American economic driver," said a statement from Chris Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network. "We are at the cusp of tremendous breakthroughs in cancer research, making it exactly the wrong moment to turn back the clock on progress against a disease that continues to kill more than 1,650 people a day in this country."\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, this budget proposal fails to make those investments (in biomedical and health services research) and would make America less great by undermining our commitment to science, medical and health services research, medical education, and research on climate change," a statement from the American College of Physicians said.\u000a\u000aAmerica's Essential Hospitals, one of the professional associations that represents health systems and hospitals, was also critical. "The cumulative effect of this budget and the (GOP health care bill) could be to undermine the ability of essential hospitals to meet their commitment to patients and communities and weaken efforts to respond to existing and emerging threats to the public health," the statement said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aSome federal agencies sent out releases expressing support of the plan. "HHS is dedicated to fulfilling our department's mission to improve the health and well-being of the American people," a statement from Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price said. "This budget supports that mission and will help ensure we are delivering critical services to our fellow citizens in the most efficient and effective manner possible."\u000a\u000aNext, House and Senate committees will hold hearings on the budget proposal.

aVStory highlights RaVal Davis: "Insecure" and "Girls Trip" call out institutional barriers that women face\u000a\u000aBoth films are evening out the playing field by putting more naked men on our screens, writes Davis\u000a\u000aRaVal Davis is an entertainment writer, actress, and advocate for body positivity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) With nearly all-black, female-led casts, both HBO's "Insecure" and feature film "Girls Trip" are clearly breaking all types of color and gender barriers. But it's what's happening behind the scenes that is changing the game on a more interesting frontier. Female writers like "Insecure's" Issa Rae and Erica Rivinoja and Tracy Oliver of "Girls Trip," are leveling the playing field when it comes to male and female nudity, by putting more naked men on our screens. It's just what Hollywood needs.\u000a\u000aFor far too long, naked women have become such a staple in TV and film that it's hard to notice, much less quantify, the inequality unfolding right before our eyes. But a recent study from Mount Saint Mary's University did just that and found that actresses are almost three times as likely as their male counterparts to be required to strip to their unmentionables.\u000a\u000aRaVal Davis\u000a\u000aUndoubtedly, female nudity has become an accomplice to get viewers through bad plotlines and awkward acting. And sometimes it's just the cherry atop the box office sundae. But why is female nudity so much more ubiquitous than male nudity? And what does this say about the role of women in the world?\u000a\u000aAccording to a 2005 University of Pennsylvania study , 57% of US teenagers, ages 14 to 16, identified television, film and other media as the primary source of information about sex and gender. In a post-#ImWithHer era, are we really still OK with such widespread and normalized objectification of the female body?\u000a\u000aBut it's not only an issue for the viewer. It's an even larger issue for the actress being asked to display her body. As a new actress trying my best to break into episodic television, I have to admit I cringe every time I read those typical female character breakdowns. You know the ones: The waitress in the club who has no more than five lines but happens to have sex with the main male character. She's totally inconsequential to the plot but helps move the episode along somehow. And, of course, NUDITY REQUIRED or MUST BE OK WITH NUDITY is bolded at the bottom of the script. It's degrading but seemingly sometimes a necessary evil for actresses to make their way above the five-line mark.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Dutch designer Joris Laarman has built his career through emerging technologies like 3D printing and robotics.\u000a\u000aBut as a student 15 years ago, he didn't even own a computer.\u000a\u000a"After my graduation I got a computer, which changed everything," he said in a phone interview. "My generation was the first to know what it was like before computers, but who also grew up with them."\u000a\u000aNow the 37-year-old can't work without one. From open source furniture designs to a 3D-printed footbridge made from stainless steel, Laarman's work lies at the intersection of design and technology.\u000a\u000aHis company, Joris Laarman Lab , pushes at the experimental edges of an industry that has digitalized rapidly since he graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 2003.\u000a\u000a"We're trying to figure out what the design of the future will be -- what it could look like," he said.\u000a\u000aDigital toolbox\u000a\u000aOne of Laarman's best-known designs is the Bone Chair, which was created through algorithms that mimic bone growth. Using a large volume of computer-generated calculations, Laarman's program systematically adjusted and strengthened the chair's design.\u000a\u000a"Birds' bones have super-optimal construction -- they constantly adapt themselves by taking away material where it's not needed and adding material where it is, without losing strength," he explained.\u000a\u000aUsing a large volume of computer-generated calculations, Laarman's program systematically adjusted and strengthened the chair's design.\u000a\u000a"To me, an algorithm is just a new high-tech version of a saw or a pair of scissors -- it's just a tool. The designs that we make are never finished objects, they're more like programs that we can tweak into new forms and adapt themselves accordingly."\u000a\u000aTechnology is not only changing designers' methods, but also the type of products they can create. More than a simple efficiency measure, Laarman says that digitalization makes entirely new concepts possible.\u000a\u000a"(The shape of the Bone Chair) could never have been invented without the algorithm. You'd need really heavy calculations for such an evolutionary process.\u000a\u000a"If you were to do this manually, without a computer, you'd have to break the legs of the chair thousands of times to make it stronger and to know where to add or take away material."\u000a\u000aDesign to download\u000a\u000aThe Bone Chair is set to go on display at the New York's Cooper Hewitt, The Smithsonian Design Museum , alongside other highlights from Laarman's career, including a set of tables made from reprogrammable molecular building blocks called voxels.\u000a\u000aThe exhibition, titled " Joris Laarman Lab: Design in the Digital Age ," encourages visitors to interact with technologies that may soon become commonplace, said the show's curator Andrea Lipps.\u000a\u000aEach of the 12 chairs in the Maker series is digitally fabricated and assembled from small printed parts, like a 3D puzzle.\u000a\u000a"(Experimental) designers often end up creating things that are so completely foreign that they become almost indigestible," she said. "What's interesting about Joris' work is that there's a familiarity to it that makes it feel less threatening. These designers are the early adopters -- they're taking our hand and leading us into the future."\u000a\u000aWhile Lipps wants the exhibition to be an "interactive, participatory experience," visitors won't get a chance to sit on any of Laarman's chairs. They will, however, be able to download some of the design blueprints.\u000a\u000a"You can download one (of the chairs) for free and make it yourself -- or have it produced by your neighbor if they have a 3D printer," Laarman said. "There are now platforms that show where the 3D printers in your neighborhood are."\u000a\u000aThe 'next industrial revolution'\u000a\u000aThis tools used by Laarman are just some of the digital methods transforming the design industry. Robotics, 3D printing and virtual reality are all changing the way products are made -- from super-strong digitally fabricated materials to cars designed in thin air using VR goggles.\u000a\u000aAccording to research by the consulting firm McKinsey, the cost of 3D printing fell 60 percent between 1990 and 2014, while the price of industrial robots fell by 5 percent every year between 2000 and 2012.\u000a\u000aThis series of tables was made from reprogrammable building blocks called voxels. It was built using industrial robots.\u000a\u000aThis move from industrial to digital production represents a fundamental shift in the economy of design, said Laarman, comparing the transition to the industrial revolution.\u000a\u000a"Modernists in the early 20th century were developing new form languages for the dawn of a new industrial period. It was very much dependent on standardization and geometric shapes.\u000a\u000a"Right now, you can see digital fabrication is taking off and this leads to a completely new type of form language. It's still very early, but everybody sees the potential. Digital design, biotechnology, AI and robotics are going to completely change everything in the world, at every level of society. It's very important to start working on it."\u000a\u000a"Joris Laarman Lab: Design in the Digital Age" will be exhibited at Cooper Hewitt, The Smithsonian Design Museum from 27 September 2017 to 14 January 2018

aVRupert Murdoch is betting big on the future of cricket.\u000a\u000aHis media group has just agreed to pay $2.6 billion for the global TV and digital rights to India's Premier League for the next five years.\u000a\u000aStar India, owned by 21st Century Fox (FOX), beat out Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Sony (SNE) to clinch the deal on Monday.\u000a\u000aThe IPL competition runs for just two months a year but its value to media companies has soared as the global audience has exploded. Sony paid $1 billion for the rights for 10 years in a deal struck in 2008.\u000a\u000aThis time around, Sony offered $1.7 billion for the TV rights, while Facebook bid $600 million for the digital rights.\u000a\u000aCricket is by far the most popular sport in India. Almost 1.3 billion viewers watched the league over last season's 60 matches, according to Broadcast Audience Research Council India.\u000a\u000aRelated: Netflix steps up its battle with Amazon in India\u000a\u000aThe sport dominates commercially too. According to research last year by KPMG, cricket attracts 61% of all team sponsorship in India.\u000a\u000aThe IPL was launched in 2007. Eight teams representing major Indian cities play matches during April and May.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at the rights' auction, Star India CEO Uday Shanka described the league as "very powerful property."\u000a\u000a"We believe that Indian sports have barely scratched the surface of its potential," he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe new deal means each match will cost Star roughly $8.5 million, making the IPL one of the richest sports leagues in the world.\u000a\u000aBy comparison, a recent deal by CBS and NBC means the networks fork out about $45 million to show each Thursday night NFL game.\u000a\u000aIn the U.K., English Premier League soccer gets around £10.2 million ($13.2 million) per game.\u000a\u000aSky (SKYAY), in which Fox owns a 39% stake, has already spent billions on EPL rights. Fox is trying to buy the rest of Sky but is struggling to convince U.K. regulators.

aVBija Knowles, CNN \u2022 Updated 17th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Water, fire and ice have combined to make some of the most spectacular scenery in the world -- from giant crystal caves to mud volcanoes and rock formations that look like works of art.\u000a\u000aIf your office and daily commute aren't a fitting reminder of the extraordinary natural diversity of planet earth, get some inspiration from these incredible scenes.\u000a\u000a1. Pulpit Rock, Preikestolen, Norway\u000a\u000aIf there are any preachers here, they'll be telling you to get back.\u000a\u000aWith a 604-meter drop from a flat plateau down to Lysefjord with no safety railings, this is not a place for vertigo sufferers.\u000a\u000aKeep well back from the edge and you can still enjoy the fantastic scenery over Kjerag peak, which itself drops 984 meters.\u000a\u000aPreikestolen is south of Jorpeland. From the designated car park it's a 90-minute hike to the viewpoint.\u000a\u000a2. Gran Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia\u000a\u000aThe Gran Salar de Uyuni in southern Bolivia takes in more than 10 square kilometers of salt. It feels more like a desert than a lake.\u000a\u000aThe flat, white landscape causes optical illusions and reflects colors. There's even a hotel made almost entirely of salt and an island where giant cacti grow in the middle of the salt lake.\u000a\u000aGran Salar de Uyuni is 533 kilometers south of La Paz and 200 kilometers southwest of Potosi.\u000a\u000a3. Ngorogoro Crater, Tanzania\u000a\u000aMore than enough room to swing a very big cat.\u000a\u000aThe Ngorogoro Crater is Africa's Eden. Created when a huge volcano exploded 2-3 million years ago, the 300 square kilometer caldera now offers the best chances of seeing Africa's wild animals.\u000a\u000aLions, rhino, leopards, elephant and buffalo are the "big five" present among around 25,000 animals, and nearly every species present in East Africa, which call the area home.\u000a\u000aBesides that, the crater itself offers dramatic vistas, especially at sunrise.\u000a\u000aFrom Kilimanjaro International Airport you can fly or drive the 55 kilometers to Arusha, from where you can organize tours and accommodation inside and outside the crater.\u000a\u000a4. Paria Canyon, Arizona, United States\u000a\u000aNot all great waves can be surfed.\u000a\u000aThe Paria River in northern Arizona carved its own smaller version of the Grand Canyon. Some of the rock formations, including The Wave, are just as spectacular.\u000a\u000aVisitors need a permit from the Bureau of Land Management -- the permit for an overnight trek comes with a "human waste bag," so if you want to visit this natural wonder, you'll have to prepare to pack your waste.\u000a\u000aThe Paria Contact Station is 69 kilometers east of Kanab. You can hire a guide through the Bureau of Land Management\u000a\u000a5. Volcanic eruptions at Stromboli, Italy\u000a\u000aA fireworks show millions of years in the making.\u000a\u000aPart of the Aeolian Islands off the coast of Sicily, Stromboli is a small volcanic island with several hundred brave inhabitants.\u000a\u000aUnlike most volcanoes, Stromboli's is constantly spewing lava fountains, gas and ash. Fascinating for volcanologists, but also great for day-trippers who fancy seeing live lava action.\u000a\u000aFor natural fireworks, take a boat trip around the island at night.\u000a\u000aArrange boat tours from harbors on the north coast of Sicily (Messina, Cefalu, Palermo).\u000a\u000a6. Mud volcanoes of Gobustan, Azerbaijan\u000a\u000aOne of the few places you can bathe in a volcanic eruption.\u000a\u000aMud lovers trek to Gobustan's strangely Martian landscape, 65 kilometers south of Azerbaijan's capital Baku, where thick gray mud regularly spews from small volcanoes.\u000a\u000aThe mud is thought to have medicinal qualities, so don't be surprised if you see people stripping down and lathering themselves in the goo. Look out for the area's Roman inscriptions and the petroglyphic rock art.\u000a\u000aAbout 70 kilometers west of Baku.\u000a\u000a7. Jeita Grotto, Nahr al-Kalb Valley, Lebanon\u000a\u000aEighteen kilometers northeast of Beirut, Jeita Grotto is comprised of underground limestone caves were inhabited in prehistoric times and continue to attract human visitors with their vivid colors and stalactite formations. The biggest stalactite in the world is here.\u000a\u000aThe caves consist of a network of chambers -- with an upper and a lower gallery -- stretching out for nine kilometers and accessible by an underground river.\u000a\u000aThe nearest town is Juniyah, just a few kilometers away. Cave tours last two hours.\u000a\u000a8. Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail, Wales\u000a\u000aYou can almost hear the male choirs in the distance.\u000a\u000aThis path twists 300 kilometers from St. Dogmaels to Amroth in southwest Wales.\u000a\u000aIt's often wet and windy, but if you strike lucky on a sunny day this is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Scented gorse and crimson heather brighten the way.\u000a\u000aLook for seals in the waters below.\u000a\u000aPaths are signposted -- join the path on the coast between St. Dogmaels and Amroth. Details on guided walks and activities can be found on the National Trails website -- including self-guided walks with baggage transfer.\u000a\u000a9. Pangong Tso Lake, India-China\u000a\u000aBeautiful to look at. But swimming here is only for masochists.\u000a\u000aThis saltwater lake deep in the Himalayas at an altitude of 4,350 meters lies astride a disputed border area between India and China-governed Tibet.\u000a\u000aDon't let that put you off -- the rarefied air make the colors and clarity of the lake intense.\u000a\u000aPangong Tso is reached by a mountain road from the Indian town of Leh, but you'll need to get a permit via a registered tour guide.\u000a\u000aGet to Leh by road from Jammu, or by plane from Delhi. At Leh arrange a permit and travel by road 4-5 hours to the lake. Permits and tour guides can be arranged through reputable travel agents such as Kuoni\u000a\u000a10. Geirangerfjord and Naeroyfjord, Norway\u000a\u000aNot a Norwegian motor car.\u000a\u000aIf you only have time to visit two fjords in your lifetime, make it the Geirangerfjord and Naeroyfjord in southwest Norway.\u000a\u000aThese are among the world's longest and deepest fjords, with high vertical cliffs, deep waters and giddy waterfalls. Both are on the UNESCO World Heritage list\u000a\u000aTrips can be arranged from Bergen and Alesund.\u000a\u000a11. South Kaibab Trail, Grand Canyon, Arizona, United States\u000a\u000a"Ooh Ah Point" awaits the adventurous.\u000a\u000aMost visitors view the canyon from South Rim viewing stations. Considering that it has taken the Colorado River the past 17 million years to carve this wonder out of rock, it seems only fair to take a closer look.\u000a\u000aBuilt by the National Park Service in 1924, the South Kaibab Trail takes you to the wonderfully named "Ooh Ah Point" and, for the adventurous, further into the canyon's depths. Plan carefully, heat stroke is no fun.\u000a\u000aIn the northwest corner of Arizona, visitors usually head to South Rim Village (120 kilometers northwest of Flagstaff on route 180) or the North Rim Village. Free shuttle buses service the South Rim in summer months. Ranger-led day hikes and walks take place throughout the year.\u000a\u000a12. Mount Roraima, Guyana/Brazil/Venezuela\u000a\u000a1. Climb. 2. Catch breath. 3. Stand in awe.\u000a\u000aSouth America's answer to Uluru, this impressive sandstone plateau is surrounded on all sides by 400-meter cliffs, creating an isolated and unique ecosystem.\u000a\u000aIf you want to follow in David Attenborough's footsteps (he's filmed several times here), organize a trek from the Venezuelan side.\u000a\u000aHiking up Mount Roraima is best done from Venezuela. The Paratepui Route is the easiest for non-technical climbers and trips can be arranged from San Francisco de Yurani.\u000a\u000a13. Verdon Gorge, Provence, France\u000a\u000aUp a creek without a paddle? Not so bad.\u000a\u000aThe gorgeous turquoise waters of the Verdon River flow through one of Europe's most beautiful gorges for 25 kilometers.\u000a\u000aSwim in the translucent waters of Lac de St. Croix and stare in awe at the 700-meter walls of the Verdon Gorge. If you've got a head for heights, it's a popular destination for rock-climbing.\u000a\u000aThe Verdon Gorge is on the border of the departements of Var and the Alpes de Hautes Provence.\u000a\u000a14. Jiuzhaigou National Park, Sichuan Province, China\u000a\u000aAll the colors of nature in one park.\u000a\u000aThe three valleys that form this biosphere reserve contain a network of connected lakes, waterfalls and rivers -- the most spectacular of which are the Pearl Waterfalls.\u000a\u000aSpot the ancient tree trunks under the clear waters of Five Flower Lake. Wooden paths and shuttle buses help visitors get around.\u000a\u000aIn the north of Sichuan, the nearest town to Jiuzhaigou National Park is Songpan.\u000a\u000a15. Lake Nakuru, Kenya\u000a\u000aAnd you thought your city was crowded.\u000a\u000aA streak of blue (and pink) in Kenya's Great Rift Valley, Lake Nakuru is home to thousands of pink flamingoes that flock here to feed on the lake's algae.\u000a\u000aA UNESCO Heritage Site, Lake Nakuru National Park is also home to hippos, white and black rhino, giraffe and buffalo.\u000a\u000aTake a matatu 156 kilometers northwest of Nairobi, or a plane to the Naishi airstrip.\u000a\u000a16. Uluru/Ayers Rock, Australia\u000a\u000aBetter from afar.\u000a\u000aAustralia's favorite giant sandstone mass is 350 meters high and more than nine kilometers in circumference.\u000a\u000aIt's a sacred and spiritual site for its custodians, the aboriginal Anangu, so climbing the rock is considered disrespectful to them. It can also be dangerous.\u000a\u000aUluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is about 440 kilometers southwest of Alice Springs. Flights are available from most major cities to Ayers Rock airport.\u000a\u000a17. Siwa Oasis, Egypt\u000a\u000aYes, you can swim in the Sahara.\u000a\u000aThis isolated oasis has natural springs and fertile land, providing access to spectacular stretches of Sahara desert. It's a great spot for star gazing from your tent in the sand, but bring your bathing suit for a dip in its hot and cold natural pools.\u000a\u000aA 10-hour drive west of Cairo. Public buses take much longer. Desert safaris can be arranged in Siwa\u000a\u000a18. Seljalandsfoss Waterfall, Iceland\u000a\u000aA waterfall you can stand beneath without getting wet.\u000a\u000aWaterfall connoisseurs agree it's not size that counts. The biggest and the highest may be impressive, but when it comes to cascading water, Iceland's Seljalandsfoss has style.\u000a\u000aThe sight of the Seljalandsa River dropping 62 meters down the sheer cliff face has made it a must-see Iceland attraction. There's a path that goes behind the cascade, so bring your waterproof camera.\u000a\u000aOn Road 1, it's 125 kilometers southeast of Reykjavik.\u000a\u000a19. Perito Moreno Glacier, Patagonia, Argentina\u000a\u000aWe got ice, who brought the drinks?\u000a\u000aThis 30-kilometer glacier in Patagonia's Los Glaciares National Park (not to be confused with the Perito Moreno National Park) grows and contracts, often forming a natural ice dam on the "elbow" of Lago Argentino.\u000a\u000aThe force of the trapped water causes a spectacular rupture every four to five years. Even when the ice isn't exploding, the sight of the glacier's blue peaks is a lifetime attraction.\u000a\u000aFly from Buenos Aires to El Calafate in Patagonia. The alternative is a very long bus journey.\u000a\u000a20. Moraine Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada\u000a\u000aHow many natural features can you fit into one picture?\u000a\u000aDeep in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Moraine Lake -- together with its sister Lake Louise -- is one of the most photographed landscapes in Banff National Park.\u000a\u000aIt's known as the jewel of the Rockies for its deep crystalline waters that mirror pine forests, soaring mountains and endless sky.\u000a\u000aDrive or take a direct bus 128 kilometers west from Calgary to Banff.\u000a\u000a21. Cascate del Mulino, Saturnia, Tuscany, Italy\u000a\u000aSteaming hot spring water comes out of the ground at 37.5 C and cascades over a series of small waterfalls into dozens of pools on consecutive levels.\u000a\u000aNiagara Falls it ain't, but the cascading thermal springs at Saturnia are a lot of fun. Soak in the natural sulfurous mineral water and just maybe cure ailments from rheumatism to muscle ache.\u000a\u000aAbout 10 kilometers north of the small Tuscan town of Manciano, northeast of Orbetello.\u000a\u000a22. William Bay, Western Australia\u000a\u000aYes, these rocks do look a little like elephants.

Wadden Sea, Germany and the Netherlands\u000a\u000aNot much to look at, but still spectacular.\u000a\u000aUNESCO describes the Wadden Sea as "the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world." In other words, it's a surreal hinterland along the coast of Germany and the Netherlands that combines wide-open stretches of sand and shallow seas.\u000a\u000aIt's also home to migratory birds. Go there and you'll feel a million miles from anywhere else on earth and about as small as one of the clams at your feet.\u000a\u000aThis 600-kilometer stretch of coast lies between the towns of Den Helder in the Netherlands and Niebull in Germany.\u000a\u000a30. Puerto Princesa Subterranean River, Palawan, Philippines\u000a\u000aAfter trains and caves, here's another way to get underground.\u000a\u000aNominated as one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River runs for 8.2 kilometers underground and boasts limestone karst formations, stalactites and stalagmites.\u000a\u000aYou can cruise down the river in a canoe.

Finistere, France\u000a\u000aOne of Pointe du Raz's rare calm moods.\u000a\u000aThe remote headland in Brittany really does feel like the end of the world (its name is derived from the Latin finis terrae).\u000a\u000aIn front lies the Atlantic Ocean, while along the coast natural rocky harbors and inlets create a rugged landscape.\u000a\u000aTourists flock to Pointe du Raz, which points like a craggy finger at a lighthouse in often choppy waters, but on sunny days the abers are peaceful and protected from the elements.\u000a\u000aAccessible from Brest, Brittany.\u000a\u000a34. Fernando De Noronha, Brazil\u000a\u000aJoin turtles, dolphins and sharks for a look.\u000a\u000aFernando De Noronha is an archipelago of 21 tropical islands, 350 kilometers from mainland Brazil, is famed for its idyllic sandy beaches, marine life and hiking trails.\u000a\u000aIt's now a marine national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site, where hawksbill turtles, dolphins, sharks and endangered species are protected.\u000a\u000aThe island life wasn't always a paradise. Between the late 18th century and 1957 there was a prison on the main island.\u000a\u000a35. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia\u000a\u000aSwimming with the fishes, in a good way.\u000a\u000aMade up of nearly 3,000 individual reefs, the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland extends for 2,600 kilometers and is the world's largest structure made of living organisms. It's even visible from space.\u000a\u000aA favorite on UNESCO's World Heritage list, this delicate ecosystem is home to porpoises, green sea turtles, whales and dugongs. But the reef is threatened by climate change and coral bleaching that occurs when water temperatures rise.\u000a\u000aBase your visit from any of the towns on the east coast of Queensland between Gladstone and Thursday Island. Choose a tour operator approved by the Marine Park authority.\u000a\u000a36. Caves of Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst, Hungary and Slovakia\u000a\u000aFairy tale-feel underground.\u000a\u000aThis vast karst landscape of limestone plateaus and more than 700 caves is home to the world's highest stalagmite.\u000a\u000aThe 21-kilometer Baradla-Domica cave stretches over the Hungary-Slovakia border. The Gombasek cave is probably the more photographed, with its impressive rock formations giving it the feel of a fairy tale city.\u000a\u000aDrive 240 kilometers northeast of Budapest to the Aggteleki National Park.\u000a\u000a37. Mount Bromo, Indonesia\u000a\u000aWatch out for pickpockets and live-chicken throwers.\u000a\u000aThis smoking crater inside the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park sits in a sea of sand.\u000a\u000aIt's actually a small active volcano inside the much larger caldera of an ancient extinct volcano.\u000a\u000aWhile the volcano is still active and has recently been closed off to the public, it's still a point of pilgrimage for Javanese Hindus, who congregate every year in the Kasada festival, during which live chickens are thrown into the crater.\u000a\u000aTravel to Mount Bromo by train or bus from Surubaya, or hire a car and do the two-three hour drive.\u000a\u000a38. Freycinet National Park, Tasmania, Australia\u000a\u000aWorst thing about Wineglass Bay -- the water sports that make you feel lazy.\u000a\u000aFreycinet's white sand beach at Wineglass Bay, pink granite rock formations and Hazards peaks are among Tasmania's most stunning coastal scenery. The park is northeast of Hobart.\u000a\u000aHiking, snorkeling, kayaking and boating are popular pastimes, but so is lying on the beach and admiring the scenery.\u000a\u000aSpirit of Tasmania run a night ferry from Melbourne to Devonport.

The waterfalls are accessible from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.\u000a\u000aA walk through the national park will take you not only to the Devil's Throat and close to the curtain of water, it will also give you a chance to spot coral trees, butterflies, toucans and hummingbirds.\u000a\u000aBuses travel from most cities in the region to Puerto Iguazu, or you can fly to Iguazu International Airport.\u000a\u000a40. Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve, Madagascar\u000a\u000aNot easy to navigate, but worth it.\u000a\u000aSpiky limestone rock formations and mangrove forests are part of the tropical and otherworldly landscape of the Tsingy de Bemaraha nature reserve on the western side of Madagascar.\u000a\u000aThe reserve is home to chameleons, lemurs and endangered birds.\u000a\u000aAlso part of the landscape is the Manambolo River, which runs red with eroded sediment from the highlands of Madagascar.\u000a\u000aThe reserve is 400 kilometers west of Antananarivo.\u000a\u000a41. Cueva de los Cristales/Cave of Crystals, Mexico\u000a\u000aIn 2000, a group of miners tunneling in the Naica mine, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, found an underground cavern containing giant selenite crystals -- some as long as 11 meters.\u000a\u000aThe size and beauty of these gypsum crystals brought the Cave of Crystals instant fame.\u000a\u000aBut the future of the cave is uncertain. While access is currently possible for short periods, the cave may be closed and flooded in the future to stop the crystals from disintegrating.\u000a\u000aThe Naica mine is 135 kilometers southeast of the city of Chihuahua.\u000a\u000a42. The Bay of Fundy, Canada\u000a\u000aClimbs and falls more than the NYSE.\u000a\u000aOne of four places on earth with extreme tidal highs and lows, the Bay of Fundy sees a vertical rise in sea level of as much as 17 meters twice a day.\u000a\u000aMore than 100 billion tons of seawater rush in and out of the bay daily, sculpting unique basalt shapes out of the rocks along the coast.\u000a\u000aTravel between the bay's islands and coastal towns is possible by small car ferry.\u000a\u000a43. Halong Bay, Vietnam\u000a\u000aTurning every visitor into a photographer.\u000a\u000aThousands of small islands and standing stacks, or karsts, overgrown with green shrubbery, protrude from Halong Bay , a peaceful bay.\u000a\u000aThe popular way to explore is in a traditional Chinese trading ship -- the brown-paneled sails of the junks have become as much a part of the landscape as the towering rocks.\u000a\u000aMost visitors to Halong Bay come via Hanoi -- 170 kilometers away, or five to six hours on a public bus. Private cars can be hired. Even rented helicopters make the journey.\u000a\u000a44. Punkaharju Esker Nature Reserve, Finland\u000a\u000aThis seven-kilometer esker, or sand ridge, was formed during the Ice Age and has been an important trade route in eastern Finland for millennia.\u000a\u000aCalm lakes lie on either side and tall pines provide shade for moss, toadstools and blueberries -- easy to see how fairy tales are born. You expect a frog with a crown to hop off the nearest giant mushroom, or a mystical hand to reach out of the lake.\u000a\u000aTake a train from Helsinki to Punkaharju or drive the 350 kilometers northeast of Helsinki.\u000a\u000a45. Frozen Sea in Lulea, Sweden\u000a\u000aThis isn't the only place in the world where the sea freezes over, but the town's location -- jutting out into the sea -- makes the frozen water a welcome extension of the town's streets in the depths of winter.\u000a\u000aFrom December to February, locals skate, snow-trek and sled across the bay, while some roads -- across the sea -- are passable only in winter.\u000a\u000aSigns advise you to remove your seatbelt for a quicker exit should your car come across thin ice.\u000a\u000aThere are several daily flights to Lulea from Stockholm, which is easier than driving the 900 kilometers.\u000a\u000a46. Trango Towers, Pakistan\u000a\u000aWhen you leave a deposit for a chopper rescue you know it's serious climbing.\u000a\u000aSome of the highest cliffs in the world are in northeastern Pakistan in the Karakoram mountain range.\u000a\u000aTrango Tower, for instance, rises a kilometer above the other granite spires in its ridge and has an elevation of more than 6,200 meters above sea level. It's a sight that's just too tempting for intrepid climbers and base-jumpers.\u000a\u000aTake a local bus or taxi from Islamabad to Skardu.\u000a\u000a47. Fox Glacier, South Island, New Zealand\u000a\u000aA beautiful scene, but don't get too close.\u000a\u000aAlong with the 12-kilometer Franz Josef Glacier (a short distance up the coast), the 13-kilometer Fox Glacier on New Zealand's South Island is one of the most easily accessible ice masses in the world.\u000a\u000aFox Glacier reaches almost to the coast, just 250 meters above sea level. Large chucks of ice breaking off the face make it dangerous to get too close.\u000a\u000aFox Glacier is in Westland National Park, 200 kilometers west of Christchurch.

The Shilin Stone Forest, China\u000a\u000aThe historic Stone Forest.\u000a\u000aSpread over 350 square kilometers in Yunnan province, these stone needles look like an ancient petrified forest -- the rock formations stand tall and emerge vertically from the ground.\u000a\u000aThe karst rocks are more than 270 million years old. Local legend says the forest was created when a young woman was forbidden to marry her love -- she rebelled by turning herself into stone.\u000a\u000aShilin Stone Forest can be reached by road 96 kilometers southeast of Kunming in Yunnan province.\u000a\u000a49. Na Pali Coast, Kauai, Hawaii, United States\u000a\u000aThe best of a spectacular bunch.\u000a\u000aWhether sandy beaches, giant waves or volcanic craters, Hawaii has plenty of breathtaking landscapes.

aVWashington (CNN) Kushner Companies has explored a development plan for one of its key buildings with casino mogul Steve Wynn, according to three people with knowledge of the talks.\u000a\u000aThe two have discussed the possibility of one of Wynn's companies opening a hotel at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City -- a building that was supposed to be the Kushners' trophy property but has turned out to be a costly miscalculation.\u000a\u000aWynn's company's involvement in the project could provide a much-needed boost for Kushner Companies, which has been floundering in efforts to finance a lofty redevelopment plan for the building.\u000a\u000aThe status of discussions between Wynn and Kushner Companies is unclear. But a deal between the two for a standalone hotel in New York City would be unusual for Wynn because his company has never developed or branded a project without a casino attached to it.\u000a\u000aSpokespeople for both Wynn and Kushner Companies declined to comment about the discussions.\u000a\u000aJared Kushner stepped down as CEO of Kushner Companies to avoid conflicts of interest while working in the White House as an adviser to his father-in-law President Donald Trump. Laurent Morali runs Kushner Companies on a day-to-day basis as the company's president but Charles Kushner, Jared's father, makes major decisions, according to real estate industry executives who have done business with the company. Jared's sister Nicole Meyer also works at the firm.\u000a\u000aAccording to financial analysts, the Kushners severely miscalculated when they paid $1.8 billion for the building in 2007 and now face a big challenge. Today, the office tower shoulders more than $1.4 billion in debt, according to a March report by Vornado Realty Trust, which joined as a partner on the property in 2011. The loan comes due in early 2019. Kushner Companies has various options, including securing new partners, to avoid default or losing its remaining 50% ownership stake in the building, according to people familiar with the deal. The Kushners owned all the retail and office space when they bought the tower, but sold parts of it over time to make debt payments and extend the loan due date.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for the company said that Kushner Companies is and will remain current on its debt payments as it engages in discussions about how to reposition the building before February 2019, when its loans are due.\u000a\u000aThe discussions did not include Wynn's company providing financing for the hotel project, according to a person familiar with the talks. That means the Kushners would have to find the money elsewhere.\u000a\u000aWynn is a highly-respected hotelier and a top political donor who became Republican National Committee Finance Chairman in January.\u000a\u000aBut even a high-profile name such as Wynn's may not be enough to attract deep pocketed investors to the project because there's a glut of New York City hotel developments, according to Ben Carlos Thypin, co-founder of Quantierra, a quantitative real estate investment platform.\u000a\u000aOversupply in the city coupled with issues related to the property itself could make this a tough sell to lenders or partners.\u000a\u000a"Even if the brand or developer is the best of the best, it's not going to change the economics of the situation," Thypin said.\u000a\u000aThypin said data from Real Capital Analytics, a real estate database, showed the average value of Manhattan hotel rooms has decreased by more than a third since fall 2015.\u000a\u000aEven still, a Fifth Avenue hotel might be attractive to some partners, said Hans Nordby, managing director of CoStar Portfolio Strategy, which advises developers.\u000a\u000aThough Nordby forecasts a dip in the city's hotel occupancy rate over the short term, he says that shouldn't scare off investors with a 20-year time horizon.\u000a\u000aKushner Companies has been pitching investors on an ambitious proposal to transform the 41-story office building with retail shops into a complex that would house a shopping mall, luxury condominiums and a 94-room hotel that would have occupied 11 floors. After completion, the property could be worth as much as $12 billion, according to estimates Kushner Companies presented potential partners. But negotiations for that deal fell through earlier this year.\u000a\u000aWynn, an outspoken businessman who has previously supported Democrats, became the RNC's finance chairman in January after serving as finance vice chair for Trump's inaugural committee. Wynn's company Wynn Resorts donated $729,000 worth of entertainment to the committee, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\u000a\u000a"I look forward to helping President Trump and his Administration make America greater again for the people who work hard every day," Wynn said in a news release after being tapped for the RNC post.\u000a\u000aFEC filings show Wynn has donated to a range of candidates and political groups. In the 2016 federal election cycle, Wynn contributed more than $1 million to mostly Republican candidates and committees, including the presidential campaigns of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He also gave $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aThere are no records of any personal contributions from Wynn to Trump's campaign.\u000a\u000aIn an August 2016 interview with CNN, Wynn described both Trump and Clinton as friends but said he hadn't decided whom he would vote for because he was waiting for "someone to have a responsible conversation."\u000a\u000aWynn's relationship with Trump has been complicated. The two moguls feuded in the 1980s and 1990s over casino developments. Trump once told New York Magazine that he thought Wynn was "disturbed." And Wynn told The Wall Street Journal in 1996 that he thought Trump was "incompetent."\u000a\u000aWynn runs an international gambling empire. His company's assets include the Wynn casino and hotel in Las Vegas as well as resorts in the Chinese territory of Macau, where gambling is legal.

Tim Walberg said Thursday that President Donald Trump needs to "grow up" if he agreed to a deal with Democrats on the debt ceiling to get back at his detractors in the Republican Party.\u000a\u000aAsked if the deal with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, which ties relief for Hurricane Harvey to a three-month raise of the debt ceiling, was a way to hit back at his own party, Walberg said that he hoped it wasn't because most Republicans have been supportive of his agenda.\u000a\u000a"Grow up a bit," the Michigan congressman said on "The Steve Gruber Show" on 1240 WJIM Michigan radio . "Accept that. It's a tough sport up here. You've gotta work with your team. I won't go further than that but I can't believe that Trump has that thin skin."\u000a\u000a"I've supported him," Walberg said of Trump. "I've appreciated the policies that he's moved forward thus far. And I'm hoping that we will continue to work together and this is just a blip that today we'll find out another reason why. But I don't get it."\u000a\u000aTrump reportedly surprised Republican leaders as well as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by agreeing to the Democrats' plan on Wednesday in an Oval Office meeting with top Hill Republicans and Democrats.

aVBut there's a catch: how do you develop technology that can withstand the sea's harsh environment with minimum disruption to the ecosystem?\u000a\u000aOne Israeli-based company, Yam Pro Energy -- believes it can offer the ideal solution and is set to build a wave-energy plant on the coastline of Accra, Ghana's capital city.\u000a\u000aWave technology is an endeavor that has recently been trying to catch up with the likes of solar and wind energy.\u000a\u000aIt exploits a resource -- the oceans -- that covers 71 per cent of our planet, it's environmentally friendly, mostly cost-free once set up and it could be revolutionary to coastal countries.\u000a\u000a"There's so many wave power companies and as many different devices, so finding one that actually works best is trial and error," said Mark Jacobson, who is a Stanford University professor and director at The Solutions Project , a company which aims to help the world move to 100% renewable energy.\u000a\u000aHowever, Yam Pro Energy says its innovative technology is the "best choice in renewable energy systems."\u000a\u000aThe machinery will utilize the crashing waves to harvest hydraulic pressure and turn it into electricity.\u000a\u000a"It was easy," laughed Yam Pro Energy's CEO, Zeev Peretz. "We negotiated (with Ghana) for many years, but in the end we succeeded."\u000a\u000a"The demand (for energy) is very big and I think it will help people (improve) their life."\u000a\u000a"Floaters" will be connected to wave breakers on the coastline and will bob up and down as waves crash in.\u000a\u000aPeretz said their technology was much more efficient than other renewable energy sources because it can generate 65% of energy per year, compared to solar panels and wind turbines which generate between 22-24%.\u000a\u000a"The rest is heat and just waste," Peretz said.\u000a\u000aThe technology will be built on Ghana's coastline in Accra.\u000a\u000aThe advantages of wave power, the company argues, is that their machines do not emit pollution, waves are more predictable than other renewable sources and despite the original set up being costly, the running and maintenance costs are low.\u000a\u000a"If the waves are too high we are given forecasts days ahead which helps to analyze the situation," Peretz said.\u000a\u000aWhile construction in Accra won't begin until well into 2017, Yam Pro Energy has already secured the coastline to build its power station. It has also teamed up with local partners, secured its power purchase agreement (PPA) from the local electrical company and has been given space on the grid so it can sell the energy produced.\u000a\u000aPeretz said 10,000 households will benefit from the project.\u000a\u000aNo impact on wildlife?\u000a\u000aAccording to Emanuele Taibi, an island energy analyst from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the biggest challenge with wave power is proving it can withstand the sea's harsh environments.\u000a\u000a"There are quite a lot of prototypes and they're doing quite well, but (for an investor), the main point is over 20 years -- how will the machine perform?"\u000a\u000aPeretz said Yam Pro Energy had taken this into consideration and that it will conduct maintenance frequently.\u000a\u000aThe "floaters" can be pulled up out of the water if maintenance needs to be done or if the conditions are too rough.\u000a\u000aCompared to other devices -- like buoys -- which can become destroyed and sink in rough seas, Yam Pro Energy's patent is more efficient, it says.\u000a\u000a"We don't have to send scuba divers or boats out. All the maintenance is from the land, so we just put floaters up and you (can) do whatever you need to do (then) put them back down."\u000a\u000aThe company prides itself on providing renewable energy that's clean and affordable in an environmentally responsible way. But Greenpeace's UK Chief Scientist and Policy Director, Doug Parr told CNN that while it supported wave power, checks needed to be in place to ensure the technology doesn't impact wildlife.\u000a\u000a"No source of power has zero impact on the environment," he said, adding that assessments need to be made to "judge whether the clean energy benefits are justified."\u000a\u000aFuture predictions\u000a\u000aJacobson, from The Solutions Project, supported the development of wave technology in Ghana, but said that its growth won't be as rapid as solar and wind. "While there's a reasonable resource of wave power to exploit, if you're comparing it to other technologies it's just not going to be penetrating as much," he said.\u000a\u000aInstead, it will compliment other renewable energy technologies. "It's definitely worthwhile doing ... We should invest (in it) as much as we can."\u000a\u000aThe Solutions Project predicts that if Ghana can transition to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2050, wave energy will account for 1.4 per cent of it.\u000a\u000aAnd while that may seem small, Jacobson insisted it wasn't. "The amount of energy worldwide is enormous. So something that is large is actually small in comparison to the power demand worldwide."\u000a\u000aHe said there was "no downside" in transitioning into a world which only uses renewable energy.\u000a\u000a"These countries can become more energy independent. There's less risk of conflict, less terrorism because there's fewer centralized plants and you solve the climate problem simultaneously."\u000a\u000aIRENA's Taibi was more optimistic. He said that while the growth of wave power has been gradual, it was only "a matter of time" before it became the "sixth pillar" of renewable energy that will become commercialized.\u000a\u000a"The good news is there's quite a lot of innovation coming from different approaches to the same resource."

aV(CNN) Threats, bribes and stuffed ballot boxes may sound like a political drama, but these are all real issues that Africans face during national elections, a public opinion study has revealed.\u000a\u000aThe results, published by pan-African research institute Afrobarometer paint a dire picture of trust in the democratic process on the continent, where less than half (44%) of people across the 36 countries surveyed say they trust their national electoral commission only somewhat or a lot.\u000a\u000aPeople in countries with upcoming elections, or who have had elections recently, expressed some of the lowest levels of trust, says lead author Peter Penar, a researcher and lecturer in political science at Michigan State University.\u000a\u000a'Alarming numbers'\u000a\u000aTake Gabon for example, which has seen post election protests and unrest this month after opposition leader Jean Ping lost by less than 6,000 votes.\u000a\u000aThere, 51% have no trust at all in their election commission, and a mere 25% say they trust them a lot or somewhat.\u000a\u000a"Those are all very alarming numbers and, it shows an extreme lack of confidence," Penar says.\u000a\u000aThe survey was based on face-to-face interviews with between 1,200 and 2,400 people in each of the 36 countries.\u000a\u000aWhile individuals' responses are not published, the researchers have identified a number of key factors contributing to the lack of trust.\u000a\u000aA checkered history\u000a\u000aA history of vote manipulation entrenched in people's memories, lack of transparency of election monitoring bodies and corruption all influence people's trust in the system and many are afraid when casting their vote, the researchers found.\u000a\u000aBut what worries people the most is the counting of votes, Penar says, with 38% of Africans believing votes are only sometimes, or even never counted.\u000a\u000aVote counts can be tampered with in many ways, according to Penar.\u000a\u000a"[This happens] at the polling stations. Stuffing ballots, double voting, multiple voting."\u000a\u000aMethods for swaying voters may also include threats, actual violence and bribery.\u000a\u000aHow much for your vote?\u000a\u000aBribery is commonplace in some countries, the study showed.\u000a\u000aThe practice is illegal, and so rather than asking people whether they have accepted bribes, researchers posed the more indirect question of how often people in the country face bribery around election time.\u000a\u000aOn average, 43% of Africans said people are often or always bribed, with nearly 70% saying voters were bribed at least sometimes.\u000a\u000aSome countries returned startlingly high numbers. In Mali, 78% of people said voters were often or always bribed, and in Senegal the figure was 68%.\u000a\u000aThe bribes may range from giving a little money at the polling stations to being offered seeds or medicines during campaigns, Penar says.\u000a\u000aThreats of violence at the polls\u000a\u000aVoter intimidation is also key, the researchers found, with 44% of those surveyed saying they are sometimes, often or always threatened with violence when voting.\u000a\u000a"That's incredibly high," says Penar.\u000a\u000a"This makes people afraid of going to the polls and expressing an autonomous and personal choice of who they want to win."\u000a\u000aSurprising findings\u000a\u000aAmong the most surprising findings, according to Penar, was the lack of trust in Ghana, which goes to the polls in December this year.\u000a\u000a"We think of Ghana as a country that's really improved in terms of electoral competition and having alternation of power."\u000a\u000aStill, 37% of Ghanaians say they don't trust the national electoral commission at all.\u000a\u000aThe picture looks different across the Atlantic. A 2016 Pew study showed that 78% of US citizens are confident, or very confident, that their vote will be counted fairly in the upcoming election.\u000a\u000aIn Africa, the Afrobarometer study showed that an average 54% across the 36 countries believe that, votes are often or always counted fairly in their country.\u000a\u000aCan digital save the day?\u000a\u000aNew digital tools such as using fingerprints and digital imaging to identify voters is changing the way elections are run in Africa, which may improve the process in the future.\u000a\u000aSouth African voters having their ID checked digitally at a polling station\u000a\u000aIn Namibia, a new system appears to have boosted voters' trust, Penar says.\u000a\u000a"Namibia has invested in an electronic voting system. Interestingly one of the best countries in terms of trust in their election commission is Namibia, at 74%."\u000a\u000aBut while new digital tools can make it harder to tamper with votes, they can also create problems as they require electricity and technical know-how at the polling stations, something not to be taken for granted in rural areas, Penar adds.\u000a\u000aAnd while election processes could be improved by storing and counting votes digitally, issues with corruption may remain.\u000a\u000a"The servers on which the results data is stored may be owned by a friend of the president or a relative of an election commission. That happens."

aV(CNN) Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett, who is among prominent NFL players who protest the national anthem before games, said police in Las Vegas unfairly singled him out, threatened him with a gun and detained him briefly after he attended last month's prizefight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor.\u000a\u000aAs he was leaving a party at the casino and heading home, he said he heard what sounded like gunshots. While he and others ran for cover, Las Vegas police officers pointed guns at him "for doing nothing more than simply being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time," he wrote.\u000a\u000aOne pointed a gun at his head while another pinned him to the ground before they handcuffed him and placed him in a squad car, he said. They released him upon learning who he was, but left him feeling as though "the system had failed me," he wrote on Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe Las Vegas Police Department confirmed that officers detained Bennett for 10 minutes and released him. They were responding to a call of battery and assault with a gun that had turned into an active shooter situation, Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said Wednesday.\u000a\u000aBased on the information they had at the time, they believed Bennett may have been involved in the shooting and pursued him, McMahill said. Given the circumstances, McMahill said he saw "no evidence that race played a role in this incident."\u000a\u000a'Emotionally traumatic event,' lawyer says\u000a\u000aBennett has hired civil rights attorney John Burris, who on Wednesday called the officers' actions "outrageous, and exhibit A as to how every black man rich, famous or poor, unarmed and innocent can be falsely detained, arrested or even shot and killed by the police," according to a statement.\u000a\u000aBennett, a father of three, feared for his life when he was detained, Burris told CNN.\u000a\u000a"He was jumped, if you will, by these officers and told to get on the ground and, certainly, at gunpoint, it was uncalled for, it was an emotionally traumatic event," the attorney said. "You are placed in a position where your life can be in danger. If you make any sudden moves that could be misinterpreted by the police officers, you can lose your life."\u000a\u000aIn his account, Bennett said that as he lay on the ground, complying with his commands not to move, the officer placed his gun near his head and warned him that if he moved he would "blow my (expletive) head off."\u000a\u000aWhile he was "terrified and confused by what was taking place," a second officer came over and "forcefully jammed his knee into my back making it difficult for me to breathe," he wrote. "They then cinched the handcuffs on my wrists so tight that my fingers went numb," he continued.\u000a\u000a"The officers' excessive use of force was unbearable," Bennett continued. "I felt helpless as I lay there on the ground handcuffed facing the real-life threat of being killed. All I could think of was 'I'm going to die for no other reason than I am black and my skin color is somehow a threat.'"\u000a\u000aMcMahill said the officers were responding to the situation based on what they knew at the time. An individual later identified as Bennett was seen crouched down behind a gaming machine as the officers approached, he said. Once Bennett was in the officers' view, he quickly ran out of the south doors and jumped over a wall into traffic.\u000a\u000a"Due to Bennett's actions and and the information officers had at the time, they believed Bennett may have been involved in the shooting and they gave chase," he said. "Many folks today have called this an incident of racial bias policing, that police officers focused solely on the race of the individual that they were going to stop. I can tell you as I stand here today, I see no evidence of that. I see no evidence that race played a role in this incident."\u000a\u000aBennett is considering filing a federal civil rights lawsuit for "unlawful detention," for the use of a firearm against him, and for being aggressively kneed in the back and handcuffed roughly, Burris said.\u000a\u000a"Money cannot be the sole object for him because he makes a lot. I think he wants acknowledgment of what was wrong with what took place, and it's important from his point of view that when something like this happens, you stand up for yourself, you don't take the easy way out," Burris said.\u000a\u000aBennett expressed a similar perspective in his open letter: "Equality doesn't live in this country and no matter how much money you make, what job title you have, or how much you give, when you are seen as a 'Nigger,' you will be treated that way."\u000a\u000a'The call that night was a scary one'\u000a\u000a"The call that night was a scary one," Martellus Bennett wrote. "The emotion and the thought of almost losing you because of the way you look left me in one of the saddest places ever. I could hear the fear in your voice, the tears in your eyes as well your sprinting heart beat. I can't imagine how the people who lost their loved ones felt when they got the call."\u000a\u000aMartellus Bennett added later: "To me, you're much more than a nigger," a direct reference to the line in his brother's open letter.\u000a\u000aAlso responding to Bennett's letter Wednesday was Colin Kaepernick, the ex-San Francisco 49ers quarterback who became a lightning rod last year when he refused to stand during the national anthem to protest what he believes are racial injustices and ongoing police brutality in the US.\u000a\u000a"This violation that happened against my Brother Michael Bennett is disgusting and unjust. I stand with Michael and I stand with the people," Kaepernick tweeted\u000a\u000aIn an interview last month with CNN , Bennett said he won't stand for the national anthem at NFL games until he sees "equality and freedom."\u000a\u000a"At this point, I think if you're being silent, you're being dishonest," Bennett told CNN. "And we can be silenced no more because we're living in this reality where I can't hide behind the logo on my helmet. I can't hide behind the shield. I can't hide behind the glamor and glitz of the NFL."\u000a\u000aKaepernick, who last year said he didn't want to "show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," drew fierce criticism for refusing to stand during the national anthem but also inspired athletes -- from elementary schools to professional leagues -- to join his movement.\u000a\u000aKaepernick remains a free agent, as no NFL team has signed him.

aVStory highlights Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren: Women often face unjust conditions in prisons and are overlooked in policy discussions\u000a\u000aBooker and Warren: The Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act would make our criminal justice system more just\u000a\u000aCory Booker is a Democratic US senator from New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren is a Democratic US senator from Massachusetts. The opinions expressed are their own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In discussions of prison reform, one group is nearly always overlooked: women. Women are the fastest growing segment of America's prison population, but because they are typically not the first image that comes to mind when someone thinks of an incarcerated person, they are often afterthoughts in policy discussions about ways to fix our broken system.\u000a\u000aCory Booker\u000a\u000aElizabeth Warren\u000a\u000aIn July, we introduced the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, a bill that would help address the unjust conditions incarcerated women face. The bill would institute a number of reforms that strengthen family ties and support rehabilitation, including requiring the Federal Bureau of Prisons to consider the location of children when placing mothers behind bars, expanding visitation policies for primary caretakers, banning shackling and solitary confinement for pregnant women, and prohibiting prisons from charging for essential health care items, such as tampons and pads.\u000a\u000aBy treating incarcerated women with dignity and giving them basic support, we not only improve public safety and reduce recidivism, we live out our values, making our criminal justice system more just.\u000a\u000aThe mass incarceration wave that began in the 1980s had a devastating impact on women. Since 1980, the number of women serving time in prison has skyrocketed by over 700%, much faster than the rate of incarcerated men. The United States has less than 5% of the world's women, but it is now home to one-third of the world's incarcerated women. The vast majority of those women are black and brown, usually serving time for low-level, nonviolent offenses.\u000a\u000aRead More

They\u2019ve identified doctors and companies who they say are responsible.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaryland is one of hardest hit states in the country, and within Maryland, Anne Arundel County is among one of the hardest hit counties,\u201d said Anne Arundel County Executive Steve Schuh.\u000a\u000aThe County plans to file a lawsuit against the drug companies, distributors and so call \u201cPill Mill doctors\u201d over-prescribing the potent pills.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnne Arundel County is among the first jurisdictions in the country to file this kind of lawsuit,\u201d Schuh said.\u000a\u000aSchuh says the companies underplayed the danger of prescription opioids and says several local doctors are now on their radar.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know exactly who they are. We know who they are from their prescribing habits, and we\u2019re coming after them,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn the first three months of 2017, Maryland saw 550 overdose deaths. Anne Arundel County says they\u2019re on pace for 150 overdose deaths this year alone.\u000a\u000aCounty officials say it\u2019s costing them millions in taxpayer dollars to fight this battle. They\u2019re hoping with the lawsuit, they\u2019ll be able to get some of the money so they can continue fighting the war.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s draining us everyday. Everyday, job one for us is to fight the heroin and opioid crisis,\u201d said chief Tim Altomare of the Anne Arundel County police.\u000a\u000aOfficers on the front lines say they\u2019re dealing more calls for robberies, thefts and other crimes stemming from prescription drugs.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday\u2019s criminal, today\u2019s bad guy is very likely suffering from an addiction problem,\u201d Altomare said.\u000a\u000aCounty officials say they have been in talks with Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh to possibly include more counties on the lawsuit.\u000a\u000aThe firm taking on the case is doing so for free, and is currently litigating other opioid addiction cases in other parts of the country.\u000a\u000aFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook

aV(CNN) The House approved Friday a package of bills that ties emergency funding for hurricane relief with measures that would raise the debt ceiling and keep the government open for three months.\u000a\u000aThe bill, which passed 316-90 and was part of a deal struck between President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders, now goes to the White House for the President's signature. The 90 lawmakers who opposed the bill were all Republicans, who had just come out of a meeting with top administration officials urging them to support the package. T he Senate passed the legislation Thursday.\u000a\u000aTrump, in a surprising move, signed onto the package Wednesday , siding with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who proposed bundling the bills together but only with a three-month extension for the debt ceiling, essentially punting the issue until December.\u000a\u000aRepublican leaders had sought a debt limit increase for as long as 18 months.\u000a\u000aA White House official said "the President is pleased Congress acted quickly."\u000a\u000a"This bill will also provide funding for any necessary relief following Hurricane Irma," the official added. "By ensuring government funding for the next three months, it gives Americans the certainty they deserve and we look forward to finding a permanent solution in the months to come."\u000a\u000aDefense hawks oppose\u000a\u000aConservatives weren't the only group of Republicans opposed. Another wing of GOP opposition to the package was defense hawks, who were opposed due to the three-month continuing resolution. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry and 18 other Republicans on his committee voted no.\u000a\u000aThornberry, a Texas Republican, said after the vote that he's done voting for continuing resolutions because of their harm to the military, and that outweighed his support for the Harvey aid.\u000a\u000a"If you look roughly, we have lost about as many service members this year in non-combat accidents as people died in Harvey," Thornberry said. "It's clear readiness is degrading, we are losing our technological advantage, the troops are under stress \u2014 a CR not only does not solve those problems, it continues to make them worse."\u000a\u000aSeventeen senators -- all Republicans -- voted against the package Thursday, most of whom said they wanted to support emergency funds for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma but opposed the idea of raising the debt ceiling for only three months and without any spending cuts or reforms.\u000a\u000aAngry meeting over deal\u000a\u000aTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House Budget Chief Mick Mulvaney attended a Friday morning session with rank-and-file House GOP members to discuss the package.\u000a\u000aA leadership aide told CNN that it was incumbent on the President and other administration officials to advocate for the bill, given the resistance that many conservatives had about backing any debt hike, especially after GOP leaders pressed for a longer extension than the one the president agreed to accept from Democrats.\u000a\u000aMnuchin, according to two members in the meeting, inflamed House Republicans who opposed the bill by urging them to "do this for me"\u000a\u000aFor his part, Mulvaney is a founding member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus , and regularly voted against bills to increase the debt limit during his tenure in the House because he wanted spending reforms, but is now on board with the Trump administration's strategy.\u000a\u000aRep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina said there was an undertone of irony at the meeting due to Mulvaney asking members to vote for something he would never have voted for. Hudson said some members directly asked Mulvaney to explain statements and actions he made in the past.\u000a\u000aIf it wasn't such a serious matter, it would have been a comedy, joked Rep. Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy also worked to get Republicans on board for the package. "This isn't the worst day we've ever had, and we will come together," he told members, according to a source in the room.\u000a\u000aThis story has been updated.

aV(CNN) Horse racing and K-pop might not be traditional bedfellows but, then again, you don't often see an equine theme park in the center of a racecourse.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea is doing things differently and, one hundred years on from its first authorized thoroughbred race, the nation hopes to become a major player in the sport.\u000a\u000aA two-way process of "internationalization" is underway, with leading foreign jockeys and trainers employed domestically and Korean runners beginning to attend major race meetings overseas.\u000a\u000aWhat started with small, unstandardized pony races has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.\u000a\u000aThe grand plan\u000a\u000a"Right now thoroughbred racing is very popular," says Yang Tae Park, executive director of the Korea Racing Authority\u000a\u000a"If our process of internationalization succeeds, we can change the perception of horse racing from not just a means of gambling, but a sport."\u000a\u000aWith a new quarantine protocol, the Korea Racing Authority (KRA) plans to stage some of the biggest events on the horse racing calendar within five years.\u000a\u000aA long-term plan has been put in place to ensure the incremental development of both the Korea Cup and Korea Sprint, from International Grade Three races to Grade One.\u000a\u000aThe Korea Sprint and Cup are currently worth KRW 1 billion ($890k) and KRW 0.7 billion ($623K) respectively.\u000a\u000aBy April 2022, to mark the centenary of South Korean thoroughbred racing, their value is set to increase threefold to KRW 3 billion ($2.7m) and KRW 2 billion ($1.8m).\u000a\u000a'Well ahead of football'\u000a\u000aAs a former insurance worker who fell in love with Korean horse racing, started a website , became a race caller, and eventually a member of the Korea Racing Authority, Englishman Alastair Middleton brings a unique perspective.\u000a\u000a"In terms of attendance, horse racing is right up there with baseball and well ahead of the domestic football league," he says.\u000a\u000a"Internationalization is so important but also so challenging, because it is really difficult to measure progress or success.\u000a\u000a"It's more qualitative than quantitative but in the time I've been following Korean racing, I've seen significant development and yes, I would say the foreign influence has played a major part."\u000a\u000a'The world's top horses'\u000a\u000aThe KRA visited the United States for the Pan America Racing Conference this May.\u000a\u000aNo US-trained horse has ever raced in South Korea, but officials are confident such a breakthrough is imminent \u2014 approaching several trainers with a view to entering September's Korean Cup.\u000a\u000a"We are inviting high-quality horses from overseas so Korean-bred horses can compete with foreign horses," says Tae Park, contending the move will raise standards.\u000a\u000aThe infrastructure and interest are certainly there.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's three main venues \u2014 situated in the Seoul suburb of Gwacheon, Busan and Jeju \u2014 have seen total annual attendances exceed 15 million in recent years.\u000a\u000aTwo decades on from hosting equestrian events at the 1988 Olympics, LetsRun Park Seoul features towering grandstands, called Happy Ville and Lucky Ville, capable of accommodating 77,000 people.\u000a\u000aAccording to Tae Park, the domestic industry already boasts an annual turnover 6.4 billion dollars \u2014 the seventh largest in the world -- and it's only going to get bigger.\u000a\u000a"Right now, the racing surface is sand and that is off-putting to many of the world's top horses," says Middleton. "However, a turf track will soon be installed at Seoul Racecourse."\u000a\u000aA two-way process\u000a\u000aBut the KRA's plans aren't limited to luring the world's best racehorses to East Asia.\u000a\u000aReaping the rewards of internationalization, Korean-bred horses are increasingly racing in foreign lands and proving they can cut it at a high level.\u000a\u000aFive South Korean runners competed in this year's Dubai World Cup Carnival, three are set to line up at Singapore's Kranji Racecourse in July and two to three more are scheduled to run in Japan's Interaction Cup.\u000a\u000aThis year saw the first major international win by a horse born and trained in South Korea, as Main Stay romped to victory in January's Dubai World Cup Carnival 1200m dirt handicap.\u000a\u000aThe four-year-old bay gelding, trained by YK Kim, beat far more established competitors to earn the winning connections over $100,000.\u000a\u000a"Main Stay winning in Dubai gave us confidence to develop the racing quality," says Tae Park.\u000a\u000a"Main Stay made horse racing more attractive in Korea. Many media outlets carried news of his victory."\u000a\u000aTriple Nine, another South Korean runner, was second behind Hunting Ground in the 2000-meter handicap earlier in the night.\u000a\u000aThis, Tae Park contends, is just a sign of things to come.\u000a\u000aBy the year 2019, the KRA claims it will send its horses to all-weather track races in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aBy 2022, Tae Park foresees Korean runners competing in the best EU turf races and best dirt track races in the States.\u000a\u000aMiddleton admits Korea is starting from "a long way behind the leading countries" but says significant progress is already being made and compares the influence of international runners to that of stars in baseball and football.\u000a\u000a"Korean sports fans love seeing the likes of [LA Dodgers pitcher] Ryu Hyun-jin and [Tottenham Hotspur footballer] Son Heung-min performing well in overseas leagues," says Middleton. "Hopefully they will start to follow Korean horses too."\u000a\u000aWhinny World\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, the KRA is striving to reach new demographics in South Korea.\u000a\u000aIf race days have traditionally enticed an older, male audience -- with many regarding the sport as a medium for betting -- the KRA is "endeavoring to attract young people and ladies."\u000a\u000aTo that end, a horse theme park, situated in the center of the Seoul Racecourse, opened its doors in September 2016 -- playing host to a number of K-pop acts, including girl group I.O.I.\u000a\u000aThe attraction, named Whinny World, claims to offer guests an "interactive and inspirational experience," educating young families about Korea's horse racing tradition.\u000a\u000aWith pony riding, racing simulation machines and ice rinks in winter, there's hope it can persuade people who wouldn't ordinarily consider visiting the racecourse to attend.\u000a\u000a"Right now horse racing has a bad perception among some Korean people," says Tae park. "We are trying to change that perception."\u000a\u000aLetsRun Park Seoul's Whinny World: where you can meet different breeds of ponies!! \U0001f434\U0001f984 Cuteness overload\u2763 pic.twitter.com/2B1ATioEDu \u2014 JO Kim (@krbc_jo) September 29, 2016\u000a\u000aWhile the horses run, the young families are turning out in force.\u000a\u000aDon't bet against seeing a South Korean horse on a racetrack near you soon.

aVStory highlights Orlando mass killing fits grim pattern of homegrown terrorism, writes Peter Bergen\u000a\u000aSince 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes\u000a\u000aPeter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book "United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists."\u000a\u000a(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.\u000a\u000aBecause 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.\u000a\u000aBut Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aIn fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.\u000a\u000aIn other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Cypress Village, a senior living facility in Jacksonville, Florida, is Herbert Dreisbach's home -- and when Hurricane Irma hits, he doesn't plan to leave his home.\u000a\u000aThis will be the first hurricane that he and his wife, Joanne, will experience while living on the third floor at Cypress Village , with a view of a lake and surrounding pine and cypress trees, Dreisbach said.\u000a\u000aJoanne and Herbert Dreisbach plan to stay at their senior living community in Jacksonville, Florida, when Hurricane Irma hits.\u000a\u000a"We are perfectly safe here. This is a very nice, sturdy concrete building, and we feel very secure here, and they are taking very good care of us, so we're satisfied to stay here," the 94-year-old said.\u000a\u000aThe power might go out, "and I know some of these things might happen to us, but it's still better than being at a facility that would not be properly prepared to take care of us," he said just a few hours before a 3 p.m. meeting to inform residents of how to prepare for the hurricane.\u000a\u000a"We're all meeting downstairs for another series of instructions if need be," he said. "They keep very close tabs on us, because this is our life."\u000a\u000aLisa Brown says her father's facility is the safest place for him.\u000a\u000aAs Hurricane Irma barrels toward South Florida , Dreisbach's daughter Lisa Brown knows that staying in his assisted-living community is the safest option for her father, she said.\u000a\u000aYet all the way across the country in Palo Alto, California, she still worries.\u000a\u000a"Florida is, in my opinion, a gold standard state in that the Florida Health Care Association, state disaster planners and nursing home staff have been extremely proactive in making sure that facilities are ready for a hurricane," said Brown, a professor of psychology and director of the Trauma Program at Palo Alto University.\u000a\u000aOne benefit is that the association has been "reaching out prior to a hurricane to emergency operation center leadership so they're aware of ... the needs that residents have and there's no surprises that are taking place when the threat is imminent," she said.\u000a\u000aBrown, who is not involved with the health care association, has conducted research on how hurricane threats and evacuations affect nursing home residents\u000a\u000a"Not all residents, our research clearly showed, should be evacuated. Those who can safely shelter in place may fare much better than those who are physically evacuated," she said. "There's not a one-size-fits-all, is the main point."\u000a\u000a'We are right now sheltering in place'\u000a\u000aNursing homes and assisted-living facilities across South Florida are preparing for Hurricane Irma to strike, and they have emergency plans in place to help keep seniors safe.\u000a\u000aThe Florida Health Care Association , a federation representing 81% of the state's nursing centers, has been hosting daily disaster calls with nursing homes and assisted-living facilities to help them prepare for the storm, association spokeswoman Kristen Knapp said.\u000a\u000aFor now, most facilities are not requiring evacuation; staffers are monitoring the hurricane until they receive direction from local emergency management agencies that they are required to evacuate, she said. Mandatory evacuations have been issued in Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties, she said.\u000a\u000aHowever, in the case of mandatory evacuations, they are prepared with residents' medications and other needs.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Hospitals evacuate patients ahead of Irma Replay More Videos ...

The facility packages the medications, along with the current orders, and sends (them) with the resident in the case of an evacuation," Knapp wrote in an email.\u000a\u000a"Pharmacies are refilling medications to ensure that facilities can send an ample supply with the residents," she said. In other words, "if evacuation is instructed by local or state authorities, residents needing medication will be authorized for refills on any and all medications, regardless of last refill date."\u000a\u000aHoliday Retirement , which owns 30 assisted- and senior living communities across Florida, housing 3,900 seniors, has been working closely with the Florida Health Care Association in preparation, said Lori Colwell, the company's district vice president of operations for Florida.\u000a\u000aHoliday Retirement communities have buses on standby in case of evacuation, more than 400 cots and linens, three days' worth of nonperishable foods in addition to twice their normal supply of food, 300 gallons of spring water and generator backups in case the communities lose power, Colwell said.\u000a\u000aAs for residents' medications, the communities have been supplied with a one-week emergency medication supply on top of the 30-day supply they have for residents, Colwell said.\u000a\u000a"If we indeed need to evacuate, we do ask the residents to pack three to five days of clothing," she said.

Active tracking begins the moment any tropical storm is named," Schneider said.\u000a\u000aShell Point residents also are advised to pack personal evacuation kits that include a two-week supply of medications, a three-day supply of special dietary items and ample portable oxygen supplies, among other necessities, she said.\u000a\u000aHow the past helps prepare for the future\u000a\u000a"While Hurricane Charley directly hit Southwest Florida in 2004, Shell Point evacuated 1,750 residents into its hurricane shelter. Medical supplies, food supplies, water and equipment were set up and a special room was dedicated to keeping residents and employee's pets safe," Schneider said.\u000a\u000aOften, emergencies of the past help to inform preparation for the future, Knapp said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Hurricane Andrew in 1992 brought much attention to how we prepare for these massive storms, both as individuals and as communities. And then, in 2004 and 2005, eight named storms were the catalyst for new preparedness tools and resources for long term care centers," she wrote. "In 2016, Hurricanes Hermine in late September and Matthew in early October caused major power disruptions, evacuations and $1.59 billion in damages between the two storms, and lessons from these storms have been learned and applied."\u000a\u000aFor extreme weather events, Brown said, "I think that everybody benefits -- staff, administration, residents, and family members -- by having a discussion before this type of weather threat occurs, because once it starts to unfold, it's difficult to have that discussion then. ... Even if you just kind of step through what you would do and how things would unfold, I think you're ahead of the game."

"The key, though, is to make sure Washington's here for the long haul, for the long-term recovery of our state."\u000a\u000aThe intense hurricane season is all too familiar for Bush, who dealt with the catastrophic storm seasons of 2004 and 2005, in which eight hurricanes and four tropical storms slammed into Florida. He won accolades for his leadership at the time and it became a selling point he sought to highlight during his unsuccessful bid for president in 2016.\u000a\u000aAs Harvey pounded the Texas coast and as Irma has approached Florida, Bush has routinely been in touch with state and local officials, according to an aide to the former governor.

aVCopenhagen is a bustling city full of ambitious professionals and young families. Yet working long hours here is frowned upon.\u000a\u000aJust 2% of employees in Copenhagen work 40 hours a week or more, according to an OECD report, freeing them up to spend time with family, join organized sports, volunteer or participate in other community programs.\u000a\u000aThe cost to participate in those programs, which range from laughter yoga in the park to basket weaving? Free. This helps encourage residents to get involved.\u000a\u000aTheir ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down, it gives them a happiness boost. Studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed. That\u2019s one reason Denmark takes the top spot as the happiest nation in the annual World Happiness Report commissioned by the United Nations.\u000a\u000aOther things play into Copenhagen's relaxed atmosphere. Residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries. There are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city.\u000a\u000aMen cycle to work in their slim-fit suits, and women don\u2019t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels. The city has 249 miles of bike paths, which makes biking an easy and safe option. And people use them: Nearly half of commuters in Copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day.\u000a\u000aThough parks and bike paths are plentiful, the government is upping its efforts. By 2015, all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than 15 minutes, according to a new official municipal policy. Many of the new parks created will be \u201cpocket parks,\u201d or small green spaces for city residents. The hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for Denmark: Ninety-six percent of residents in Copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need.\u000a\u000aThis supportive society is just another reason Copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest (and happiest) cities.

aVFrom Fisher Price toys to the opening credits of "Saved by the Bell," the era's designers carved out a distinct day-glo look that is an unmistakable product of its time.\u000a\u000aBut they were all taking cues from one radical Italian designer and architect: Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aSottsass' short-lived collective, Memphis, was made up of about two dozen Italian creatives. As well as attracting the attention of high-profile collectors, including Karl Lagerfeld and David Bowie, the group's wildly stacked blocks and zig-zag patterns inspired the mainstream designers who defined the aesthetic of an optimistic age.\u000a\u000aA 'renaissance' figure\u000a\u000aBut while Sottsass is best known for his work with Memphis, he spent just six years of his seven-decade career in the collective. By the time he formed the group in 1981, the Austrian-born Italian (then aged 64) had already traveled Europe with Allen Ginsberg, photographed Picasso and Hemingway, built a postmodern New York flagship store for the fashion brand Fiorucci, and helped design some of Silicon Valley's earliest computers.\u000a\u000aHis influence touched the farthest reaches of the design world, inspiring generations of young designers from across many disciplines, according to Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of London's Serpentine Galleries, who describes Sottsass as a "renaissance figure."\u000a\u000a"He was not just an industrial designer or an architect. He worked in ceramics, paintings, jewelry and interior design, as well as photography and writing. He was also the editor and publisher of his own magazine," said Obrist, a friend of Sottsass' for more than 10 years before the designer's death in 2007.\u000a\u000a"It's common for people who make a great contribution in one field to go into different fields. But it's very rare for people to make amazing contributions to entirely different fields. He was unique."\u000a\u000aTo mark the 100th anniversary of Sottsass' birth, Le Stanze del Vetro museum in Venice exhibited more than 200 of his glass works earlier this year. A major retrospective of Sottsass' work -- from both before and after his time with Memphis -- will be on show until October at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's new design-focused sister venue, the Met Breuer\u000a\u000aHere, we hear about Sottsass' work and legacy from some of the design industry figures who knew -- and were inspired by -- the Italian designer and his collective.\u000a\u000aKarim Rashid\u000a\u000aKarim Rashid is one of the most prolific designers of his generation, responsible for well-known creations including the Bobble water bottle and the Garbo trash can.\u000a\u000aI studied with Ettore Sottsass for three months in 1983 and I remember his words: "Find what you can contribute that no one else can in this world."\u000a\u000aHe did really powerful, useful design work. But you can really see his soul within it. The whole premise of Memphis was almost Ikea-like: these things would be super cheap and built out of plastic laminate. They were made to reach a lot of people.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, it was so poetic, powerful and experiential. (His work) makes us look at the physical world in a different way. It teaches us that objects around us can still function perfectly, but they can imbue and provoke such positive energy and spirit. They can also be radical, in that all of a sudden you see a very banal thing in very different way.\u000a\u000aA "Valentine Portable Typewriter" (1968) by Ettore Sottsass, owned by David Bowie.\u000a\u000aHans Ulrich Obrist\u000a\u000aKnown for publishing hours' worth of interviews with the world's leading artists, Hans Ulrich Obrist is the artistic director of London's Serpentine Galleries.\u000a\u000a(Sottsass) was 63 when he founded his architecture practice, Sottsass Associati. So, in his sixties, seventies, eighties, he developed a whole life as an architect which could be (considered) a career in itself. He designed the interiors of Milan's Malpensa Airport, private homes and the famed early Esprit stores.\u000a\u000aIf somebody had just his architecture career, that person would be a very significant architect of their generation. But he is this renaissance figure (who practiced) industrial design, ceramics, glass and interior design, but also paintings, photography and writing.\u000a\u000aIt's almost like the super string theory in science, where the world has 11 dimensions -- he brought all the disciplines and all the fields together in one person. Every generation will find a different Sottsass to revisit.\u000a\u000aJack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez\u000a\u000aDesigners Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez founded New York-based womenswear and accessories brand Proenza Schouler in 2002. Their clothing has featured Memphis-inspired shapes and graphics.\u000a\u000aWe'd love to say that we first discovered the Memphis movement through the context of design history, but we, like many of our friends, really first encountered that particular aesthetic through things like "Saved by the Bell," "Pee-wee's Playhouse," and (skateboard brands) Vision and Santa Cruz. It wasn't until much later on, during our college years, that we realized that this poppy, nostalgic aesthetic that so many of us responded to was actually rooted in a serious design movement.\u000a\u000aIt kind of authenticated our moments of being seduced by things like neon colors, graphic shapes and plastics. It's a look that harks back to a simpler, more wide-eyed and carefree moment in our lives. It takes us back to a time when many of us were first discovering popular culture via things like MTV. As a result, it has a special place in our hearts.\u000a\u000a"Mizar Vase" (1982), by Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aDavid Kelley\u000a\u000aA Stanford professor and founder of global design firm IDEO, David Kelley invented the world's first computer mouse. He lives in a house designed by Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aWhen was I was living in Silicon Valley in 1974 to 1975, I was inspired by Ettore's designs on Olivetti's computers and office (products). His stuff looked quite different from everything else -- it just made me think "oh, you can think of these things differently." Sottsass only designed three houses in the United States, including the one in Woodside, California, that I live in.\u000a\u000aI put together a big book of all the things I'd wanted in the house, and what our lifestyle was like. He looked at the book for maybe 25 seconds and said: "This looks like you want a house for living in the past. Let's design you a house for living in the future." As a worldly Italian who enjoyed life, he was going to fix this nervous American's life by building him a house. I think he did build us a better life.\u000a\u000aDavid Kelley residence, designed by Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aCamille Walala\u000a\u000aWALALA x PLAY at NOW Gallery, Greenwich Peninsula\u000a\u000aCamille Walala is a London-based print, graphic and textile designer whose bright, playful installations mix Memphis influences and African design.\u000a\u000aI grew up in the 80s, and my dad was an architect. He gave me some plates with these amazing triangle designs.\u000a\u000aAt the time, I didn't really know who the Memphis movement or Ettore Sottsass were, but I loved them. We put (the plates) in boxes to keep them safe, and I completely forgot about them.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, I went to the university library and found some books about Sottsass. I was hysterical looking at them. The colors and the sense of humor in his work -- I just didn't know there was already something like Memphis in the design world. I love the architectural shape of the lamps, the toy-like hoovers and the Carlton book shelf. For London Design Festival in 2015, I made (the installation) "Walala in Da House" with Memphis patterns, plates, lamps and prints, which was a bit of an homage to them.\u000a\u000aRonan Bouroullec\u000a\u000aEttore Sottsass, Kachina 11, 2006, in the exhibition "Ettore Sottsass: The Glass," curated by Luca Massimo Barbero @ Le Stanze del Vetro, Venice through July 30. #ettoresottsass #lestanzedelvetro #veniceshows #fondazionegiorgiocini #pentagramstiftung A post shared by Artforum (@artforum) on May 14, 2017 at 6:02am PDT\u000a\u000aRonan Bouroullec is one half of French design team Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec, whose work ranges from vases to urban design\u000a\u000aSottsass invented a very specific formula which (allowed him) to play with heavy, geometric shapes. And yet, his works were always full of sensuality and vibration. He said that, for him, there is no hierarchy in objects: To design an ashtray or a house is the same problem. It is as complicated to do an ashtray. It was very interesting to learn from Sottsass that a good object is exactly like a beautiful person. It's a mix of different aspects that, in the end, chemically produce something bizarre and interesting. A good object is never a perfect answer.\u000a\u000aMisha Kahn\u000a\u000a"Carlton Room Divider" (1981), by Ettore Sottsass.\u000a\u000aMisha Kahn is a Brooklyn-based furniture designer who said that he wanted his latest collection "to do Memphis as if it was about Memphis, Tennessee."\u000a\u000aLavumisa (2015), by Misha Kahn in collaboration with Gone Rural.\u000a\u000aI remember discovering (Sottsass') work in college and being very influenced by its spirit. I think I was more inspired by his willingness to swim upstream against conventional taste than his visual language. I love the Carlton bookshelf -- it's sort of anthropomorphic and feels like a dance party, which isn't often something you'd say about a bookshelf.\u000a\u000aThe shapes and colors of my Lavumisa chandelier were really Sottsass-inspired. (I designed it) at the height of a Memphis revival, and I felt like I wanted to introduce some natural materials to the mix to see how it felt.

aV(CNN) We've had our fair share of dramatic elections recently - the UK, France, the US. And let's not forget Brexit. The German election on September 24 may be generating fewer headlines, but it's no less important.\u000a\u000aHere's why you should pay attention.\u000a\u000aWhy should you care?\u000a\u000aIf you're in the US:\u000a\u000aGermany is one of America's staunchest allies. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel is NOT a fan of US President Donald Trump (remember the tense no-handshake during her White House visit?). And it seems like her main challenger, Martin Schulz, likes Trump even less, and he's not shy about ripping into the American President. So it seems, no matter who wins this election, US-German relations are likely to be strained.\u000a\u000aIf you're in Europe:\u000a\u000aTo borrow a phrase, Germany's the big man on campus. It has the biggest and strongest economy in the European Union. It's widely seen, along with France, as a driver of EU policy and a powerful player in the Brexit negotiations. Speaking of which, both Merkel and Schulz (a former EU President) seem inclined to take more of a hard line with the UK over its impending exit from the trade bloc.\u000a\u000aIf you're anywhere else:\u000a\u000aObservers of politics everywhere want to see if populist passions will reignite. They burned bright last year in the Brexit vote and the US presidential election, but have dimmed in 2017 with the loss of far-right candidates in France and the Netherlands.\u000a\u000aThe parties led by Merkel or Schulz aren't populist movements by any stretch, but concerns over refugees and security could help propel the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) into parliament for the first time. And just like in France's presidential election earlier this year, anyone in a war-torn country in the Mideast or Africa looking to Germany as a place of refuge might wonder what kind of welcome they'll get there in the future.\u000a\u000aHow does this work?\u000a\u000aGermans will be voting to fill seats in the Bundestag, the country's 598-seat parliament. Whichever party wins the most seats will try to form a coalition government, and the leader of that party will then become chancellor (equivalent to the US President).\u000a\u000aOK, now stay with us, because from here it gets really complicated.\u000a\u000aGerman voters will cast two votes on election day.\u000a\u000aOn the first vote they will choose from a list of local candidates to represent their district. The candidate who gets the most votes in each district wins a seat in parliament. Half of the Bundestag's seats (299) are decided this way.\u000a\u000athey will choose from a list of local candidates to represent their district. The candidate who gets the most votes in each district wins a seat in parliament. Half of the Bundestag's seats (299) are decided this way. For their second vote , they choose from a list of the political parties. The remaining 299 seats are then distributed among the parties based on the percentage of votes received nationwide. Only parties that get more than 5% of the vote nationally can send representatives to the parliament.\u000a\u000aWhat's the point of this convoluted system? It allows voters to split their vote between parties. They can vote for a local candidate from one party and cast their second vote for a different party.\u000a\u000aMerkel's party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, and its sister party the Christian Social Union, currently have 309 seats in the Bundestag. They've spent the past four years in coalition with the center-left Social Democratic party, which has 193 seats.\u000a\u000aWho could be chancellor?\u000a\u000aAngela Merkel\u000a\u000aWho she is: Merkel, of course, is the Merkel, of course, is the current chancellor of Germany , an office she's held since 2005. She's the country's first female leader, and she's pretty popular right now (her approval rating stands at about 59% in one recent poll). If the 62-year-old Merkel wins, it'll be her fourth term in the post. And if she were to serve a full term, she would tie with Helmut Kohl as Germany's longest serving post-war chancellor (16 years). In her time in office, there have been three US presidents, four UK prime ministers and four French presidents. For those who aren't fans of current US President Donald Trump, she's now thought to be the most powerful person in the world.\u000a\u000aWhat she wants: Merkel has a fairly liberal policy on refugees. She's a big fan of the global economy. She wants to give Merkel has a fairly liberal policy on refugees. She's a big fan of the global economy. She wants to give Germans tax cuts (especially young families). She wants to lower unemployment, which would be a neat trick, since unemployment in the booming German economy is already at or near record lows. She also wants to hire thousands of new police officers at both the state and federal level.\u000a\u000aFun fact: She worked She worked as a physicist before getting into politics.\u000a\u000aTelling quote: "The times when we could "The times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent, over." (The "others" Merkel is referring to is the United States.)\u000a\u000aMartin Schulz\u000a\u000aWho he is: Schulz, 61, is a former president of the European Union (and, surprise, Schulz, 61, is a former president of the European Union (and, surprise, no fan of Brexit ), and he's relatively new to leadership in the center-left Social Democratic party. He was picked to lead his party back in January. He was elected mayor of his hometown of Wurselen in 1987 at age 31, but he's spent more of his political life dealing with EU matters in Brussels than he has holding office in Germany.\u000a\u000aWhat he wants: Schulz, dubbed by some as the Schulz, dubbed by some as the German Bernie Sanders , wants to raise taxes on the rich and give tax relief to middle income earners. He wants Germany to use some of its budget surplus for investments in infrastructure and to help boost the EU. He wants the US to get its nukes out of Germany.\u000a\u000aFun fact: He dreamed of becoming He dreamed of becoming a professional soccer player (a serious knee injury shattered that dream), and he once owned a bookstore.\u000a\u000aTelling quote: "You have the choice between a chancellor who avoids every debate about the future and somebody "You have the choice between a chancellor who avoids every debate about the future and somebody who tells you what he wants ."\u000a\u000aWhat are the big issues?\u000a\u000aImmigration:\u000a\u000aThis is the big one. It's been the top concern of German voters since 2015, when over one million migrants and refugees arrived. Merkel's popularity took a drubbing during that time, but it's rebounded . That's a shock to many of her critics, including the far-right AfD party, which has capitalized on concern among some Germans by promising to clamp down on immigration. Issues such as family reunification, deportations and integration as well as border controls and a possible cap on asylum seekers (both Merkel and Schulz are against that ) continue to make headlines.\u000a\u000aClimate change:\u000a\u000aEnvironmental issues always play a big role in German elections, but with Donald Trump pulling the US out of the Paris agreement, the topic is an especially hot one this time around. And despite Merkel's impassioned fight for the environment, Germany's greenhouse gas emissions haven't dropped much for close to a decade.\u000a\u000aSocial inequality:\u000a\u000aGermany is a prosperous country with a good welfare system, but it still has some issues. Yes, unemployment hit its lowest point since reunification this year, but the poverty rate is way up too. In fact, the poverty rate is breaking new records in Germany, even as GDP continues to grow. Schulz has put inequality at the center of his campaign.\u000a\u000aSecurity and terrorism:\u000a\u000aGermany's suffered a number of terror attacks the past couple of years -- including a horrific truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people back in December -- so security remains another high-ranking concern. Both Merkel and Schulz have promised to strengthen Germany's security forces and hire more police.\u000a\u000aSo who's going to win?\u000a\u000aMerkel and her party seem poised to cruise to victory. Her Christian Democrats are consistently polling at 35 to 40%, while Schulz's Social Democrats are at 20 to 25%. Germans seem to prefer the stability that Merkel's run as chancellor has provided -- especially with the rise of populist movements in other European countries and the increase in terrorism incidents on the continent. As one political commentator put it, Germans aren't looking for a political revolution , so they probably won't take the risk.\u000a\u000aWhat happens afterward?\u000a\u000aThere's the fun and games of coalition building. You see, to form a government a political party has to win more than 50% of the seats in parliament. This is highly unlikely, since there are 42 parties (42!) fielding candidates in this election. So the party that ends up with the most seats (and that, most likely, will be Merkel's Christian Democratic Union) will negotiate with others to form the government. Those negotiations start on September 25.

aVThe CNN Freedom Project wants to amplify the voices of the victims of modern-day slavery, highlight success stories and help unravel the tangle of criminal enterprises trading in human life.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When Kieu was 12, her mother asked her to take a job. But not just any job. Kieu was first examined by a doctor, who issued her a "certificate of virginity." She was then delivered to a hotel, where a man raped her for two days.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the Freedom Project went to Cambodia with Oscar-winning actress and UNODC Goodwill Ambassador against Human Trafficking, Mira Sorvino . The result was "Every Day in Cambodia: A CNN Freedom Project Documentary," which looked at child sex trafficking in the country.\u000a\u000aIn Svay Pak, a notorious child sex trafficking hub in Phnom Penh, Sorvino met Kieu, who was then around 14 years old. She had been rescued from sex trafficking by Agape International Missions (AIM), a non-profit for trafficked and at risk children and teenagers.\u000a\u000aKieu told of how she had been sold aged 12 by her mother to a Khmer man of "maybe more than 50" who had three children of his own, Sorvino explained in her Cambodia journal : "The price set in advance for her virginity: $1,500, though she was ultimately only given $1,000, of which she had to give $400 to the woman who brought her to the man. Her mother used the money to pay down a debt and for food for the fish they raise under their floating house -- their primary income source.\u000a\u000a"Beforehand, Kieu said, 'I did not know what the job was and whether it was good for me. I had no idea what to expect. But now I know the job was not good for me.' After she lost her virginity to the man, she felt 'very heartbroken.' Her mother supposedly felt bad too, but still sent her to work in a brothel. Kieu said she did not want to go, but had to. She said, 'They held me like I was in prison.'"\u000a\u000aShe was kept there for three days, raped by three to six men a day. When she returned home, her mother sent her away for stints in two other brothels, including one 400 kilometers away on the Thai border. When she learned her mother was planning to sell her again, this time for a six-month stretch, she realized she needed to flee her home.\u000a\u000aHer story is all too common in Svay Pak; she was just one of the girls whose stories were told in the film. Fast forward to 2015 and "Everyday in Cambodia" was named "outstanding documentary" by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation , winning a Gracie Allen award.\u000a\u000aSorvino says the film has raised awareness of the issue of child sex trafficking in Svay Pak and Cambodia, helping to raise funds for AIM to build a school that, when completed, will offer hope for more than 1,000 children in the region.\u000a\u000a"Primary and especially secondary education is extremely important in preventing trafficking," she says. "It allows children to develop critical thinking skills to be able to defend themselves from traffickers and to have the skills that will enable them to have gainful employment to be able to support their families in other ways than being sexually exploited."\u000a\u000aAIM also now works with an "incorruptible" police SWAT team to raid brothels where children are working.\u000a\u000aBut Sorvino adds that it's not just about helping the victims. "The demand side really needs to be addressed," she says. "If people weren't trying to buy child sex it wouldn't be being sold."

aV(CNN) When photographer Richard Ross wants to talk to a child at a juvenile detention center, he knocks on their cell door. He asks them if he can come inside.\u000a\u000aThe 67-year-old Californian is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes, so he does the same in a cell.\u000a\u000a"Most of the kids, they've never had that kind of respect," he said. "But I give it to them, I give them the power. I sit on the floor so they're looking down on me."\u000a\u000aRoss doesn't begin by hammering them with questions. He wants to have a conversation.\u000a\u000a"I say, 'What's gone on in your life?' "\u000a\u000aThe result of that tenderness and patience is Ross' latest collection of photos, "Girls in Justice."\u000a\u000aThe images are unflinching. They convey the ugliness of a young person's life behind bars. The pictures are replete with the unique loneliness, anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center. But the girls also tell their stories alongside the images.\u000a\u000aPhotographer Richard Ross\u000a\u000aOne photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit, hand on her head, sitting alone in a drab, cavernous room.\u000a\u000a"I've been here 17 times," one girl says.\u000a\u000aMany of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them.\u000a\u000a"Mom's a stripper. Dad was an alcoholic, drug addict, murdered last year," said one girl explaining her past. "They took my brother and I away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down. I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do."\u000a\u000aThe photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks, staring at the wall. Some struggle with mental illness. The girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera. That works to protect their identities, but it also evokes shame. Ross seems to be saying the shame isn't the girls' -- it's ours as a society for jailing children.\u000a\u000aHis images aren't always literal. A photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire. A straight-forward photo, of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors, turns the stomach after reading the caption -- the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself.\u000a\u000aSocial media Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\u000a\u000aRoss recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him, "I can't wait to get out of here so I can kill myself."\u000a\u000a"She was just a kid, but she was at that place where you have no hope," he said. "I feel all these stories, but that one just hit me hard. I was sobbing. You want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that."\u000a\u000aRoss, the son of a New York City police officer, had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means. He got into a decent amount of trouble growing up, and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system.\u000a\u000aBut times were different then, he said, and there's been a cultural turn in America toward criminalizing a child's bad behavior.\u000a\u000aHe recalls a detention-center director in Reno, Nevada, who asked him to visit and take photos. At intake, he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class.\u000a\u000aYou want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that. Richard Ross\u000a\u000a"This fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle," Ross recalled. "He was drinking warm milk, like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk. I can still smell that milk. That intake area smelled like elementary school."\u000a\u000aThe child's single mother couldn't pick him up for hours. She was holding down a job that wouldn't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m.\u000a\u000aThe detention-center director sent Ross' photo to every principal in the area to make a point: Children do not belong in lockup, so find another solution.\u000a\u000aRoss is adamant that he's making photographs to bring about "immediate change."\u000a\u000aHe speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates. His work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing.\u000a\u000a"I'm trying to wake people up, make them realize there are lives at stake," he said. "At the same time, I don't, I can't, position myself as the great hope. I might not be able to do much but listen. But I think I'm a good listener, and I think these kids deserve to tell their stories."

The deal keeps the government open and attaches hurricane relief money to a rise in the debt ceiling.\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan were "blindsided by this" turn of events , a Republican official told CNN.\u000a\u000aAnother senior GOP source described the two leaders as "shell-shocked."\u000a\u000aSo let me get this straight: GOP leaders are surprised because (a) the most unconventional Republican President in history, who (b) used to " identify as a Democrat ," who has (c) spent the last several weeks attacking GOP leaders on Twitter, has (d) cut a deal with the Democrats?\u000a\u000aHow, exactly, are you shocked by this, dear GOP leaders?\u000a\u000aLet's not forget (e): Americans are begging for more bipartisanship in Congress.\u000a\u000aBut Democrats, don't get too cocky.

And who knows? Maybe you're not really in the driver's seat this time like you think you are. Let's see: Can anyone think of a recent time when the Democrats thought they had something in the bag?

First, Mr. President, please take back the cruel idea of rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program . The overwhelming majority of voters s upport a pathway to citizenship or legal residency for immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.So let's "shell-shock" some more Republicans and reverse course on DACA.\u000a\u000aTo settle the issue of DACA's constitutionality, Trump can still urge Congress to pass a bill protecting the Dreamers. Meanwhile, he can prove he has "great heart" for these kids -- as he's said before -- and he can let DACA stay in place while Congress creates a permanent solution through bipartisan legislation.\u000a\u000aNext, Trump can shock the GOP by making a deal on health care. Again, Americans overwhelmingly want a bipartisan solution to our health care system's myriad problems. Even Fox News' polling shows that 74% of voters favor Republicans reaching out to Democrats on this issue.\u000a\u000aLet's not forget that Trump was elected by people who hoped he could short-circuit the partisan gridlock in Washington. Remember the night he flipped the entire industrial Midwest from blue to red? Yeah. Me too.\u000a\u000aSo let's do it, Donald! Let's keep shocking the GOP by cutting bipartisan deals. It might be the only way for your approval rating to rise above 37%.

aVWhen doctors talk about a new leukemia drug from Novartis, they ooze enthusiasm, using words like "breakthrough," "revolutionary" and "a watershed moment."\u000a\u000aBut when they think about how much the therapy is likely to cost, their tone turns alarmist.\u000a\u000a"It's going to cost a fortune," said Dr. Ivan Borrello at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center in Baltimore.\u000a\u000a"From what we're hearing, this will be a quantum leap more expensive than other cancer drugs," said Leonard Saltz, chief of gastrointestinal oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\u000a\u000aSwitzerland-based Novartis hasn't announced a price for the medicine, but British health authorities have said a price of $649,000 for a one-time treatment would be justified given the significant benefits.\u000a\u000aThe cancer therapy was unanimously approved by a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee in July, and its approval seems all but certain\u000a\u000aThe treatment, CTL019, belongs to a new class of medications called CAR T-cell therapies, which involve harvesting patients' immune cells and genetically altering them to kill cancer. It's been tested in patients whose leukemia has relapsed in spite of the best chemotherapy or a bone-marrow transplant.\u000a\u000aThe prognosis for these patients is normally bleak. But in a clinical trial , 83 percent of those treated with CAR T-cell therapy -- described as a "living drug" because it derives from a patient's own cells -- have gone into remission.\u000a\u000aCAR T cells have been successful only in a limited number of cancers, however, and are being suggested for use as a last resort when all else has failed. As a result, only a few hundred patients a year would be eligible for them, at least initially, said Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.\u000a\u000aThe FDA is scheduled to decide on approval by Oct. 3. The agency is also considering a CAR T-cell therapy from Kite Pharma.\u000a\u000aA third company, Juno Therapeutics, halted the development of one its CAR T-cell therapies after five patients died from complications of the treatment.\u000a\u000aRather than wait for Novartis to announce a price, an advocacy group called Patients for Affordable Drugs has launched a pre-emptive strike, asking to meet with company officials to discuss a "fair" price for the therapy. The Novartis drug has the potential to be one of the most expensive drugs ever sold, said David Mitchell, the patients group's president, who has been treated for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer, since 2010. (The Laura and John Arnold Foundation, which provides some funding for Kaiser Health News, supports Patients for Affordable Drugs.)\u000a\u000a"Many people with cancer look forward with great hope to the potential of your new drug," Mitchell wrote in a letter to Novartis . "But drugs don't work if patients can't afford them."\u000a\u000aCancer drugs today routinely cost more than $100,000 a year. A combination therapy for melanoma sells for $250,000. Such prices are particularly outrageous, given that taxpayers fund many drugs' early research, Mitchell said.\u000a\u000aThe federal government spent more than $200 million over two decades to support the basic research into CAR T-cell therapy, long before Novartis bought the rights.\u000a\u000aThe patients group urged Novartis to charge no more for the drug in the U.S. than in other developed countries.\u000a\u000aNovartis has agreed to meet with the patients group. In a statement, Novartis said the company is "carefully considering the appropriate price for CTL019, taking into consideration the value that this treatment represents for patients, society and the healthcare system, both near-term and long-term."\u000a\u000aNovartis made a significant investment in CAR T-cell therapy, according to the statement.\u000a\u000a"We employ hundreds of people around the world who work on CAR-Ts, we are conducting ongoing U.S. and global clinical trials, and have developed a sophisticated, FDA-validated manufacturing site and process for this personalized therapy."\u000a\u000aSoaring prices for cancer drugs have led many patients to cut back on treatment or skip pills, a recent Kaiser Health News analysis showed.\u000a\u000aThe effect of CAR T-cell therapies on overall health costs would initially be relatively small, because it would be used by relatively few people, Lichtenfeld said.\u000a\u000aHealth systems and insurers may struggle to pay for the treatment, however, if the FDA approves it for wider use, Lichtenfeld said. Researchers are studying CAR T-cells in a number of cancers. So far, the technology seems more effective in blood cancers, such as leukemias and lymphomas.\u000a\u000aHidden costs could further add to patients' financial burdens, Borrello said.\u000a\u000aBeyond the cost of the procedure, patients would need to pay for traditional chemotherapy, which is given before CAR T cell therapy to improve its odds of success. They would also have to foot the bill for travel and lodging to one of the 30 to 35 hospitals in the country equipped to provide the high-tech treatment, said Dr. Prakash Satwani, a pediatric hematologist at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, which plans to offer the therapy.\u000a\u000aBecause patients can develop life-threatening side effects weeks after the procedure, doctors will ask patients to stay within two hours of the hospital for up to a month. In New York, even budget hotels cost more than $200 a night \u2014 an expense not typically covered by insurance. Patients who develop a dangerous complication, in which the immune system overreacts and attacks vital organs, might need coverage for emergency room care, as well as lengthy stays in the intensive care unit, Satwani said.\u000a\u000aDoctors don't yet know what the full range of long-term side effects will be. CAR T-cell therapies can damage healthy immune cells, including the cells that produce the antibodies that fight disease. Some patients will need long-term treatments with a product called intravenous immunoglobulin, which provides the antibodies that patients need to prevent infection, Lichtenfeld said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aSaltz, an oncologist who has long spoken out about high drug prices, said he applauded the patients group's efforts. But he said he doubts their efforts will persuade Novartis to set a reasonably affordable price.\u000a\u000a"I'm not optimistic that this will have much effect on the company," said Saltz. "There's no market pressure for the company to respond to."\u000a\u000aHigh drug prices don't just hurt patients, Saltz said. They also drive up insurance premiums for everyone.\u000a\u000a"They affect each and every one of us," he said, "because these costs will be paid by anyone who has any kind of insurance coverage."

aV(CNN) The park bench is a familiar and often overlooked design that exists in cities across the world. Typically designed to have mass appeal, and manufactured from materials that can withstand frequent use, constant exposure to the elements and vandalism, these seats provide a valuable but perhaps unrecognized service.\u000a\u000aAs part of a development project aimed at revitalizing Stockholm's Järfälla suburb, 10 leading international designers were invited to create alternative benches for the neighborhood's neglected Kvarnbacken park. The outcomes of the Superbenches project challenge the conventional notion of public seating and vary drastically in their execution, ranging from playful outdoor lounge furniture to a curving mini amphitheater.\u000a\u000aSuperbenches forms part of a wider two-year research and communication initiative called Kalejdohill , which was launched by property developers HSB, Veidekke Bostad and Einar Mattsson to help reactivate Kvarnbacken park as an attractive meeting place for local residents.\u000a\u000aFollowing an announcement that several hundred new homes will be built in the area, the developers invited curators Andreas Angelidakis and Mia Lundstrom to oversee a series of events and interventions to foster a sense of pride in the neighborhood. The project also encourages current residents to contribute ideas and suggestions that will ultimately help to shape the planning process.\u000a\u000aA close-up of "Cushy" by Hagglund & Gripner\u000a\u000aNew York-based creative director and writer Felix Burrichter was brought in to select the designers for the Superbenches installation, and set a brief that urged them to break away from preconceived notions of what a park bench should look like.\u000a\u000a"I was hoping we would achieve a great variety of different benches and that's certainly the case," said Burrichter at the project's launch. "Some of them aren't even benches in the classic sense, but what many of them do is foster the community of the overall park, as well as creating moments of leisure and pleasure and different kinds of use."\u000a\u000aPhotos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of Photos: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops are in a tiny Austrian village you've never heard of\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere, the town's cultural association invited seven world-class architects, including Pritzker Prize winners Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu, to design shelters along the local bus route, offering nothing more than a week's free holiday in the region.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRemarkably, the architects accepted, and the construction was funded entirely through local community's donations, with no public money spent at all.

This inspiration is most evident in London-based designer Philippe Malouin' s brutalist-inflected cylindrical seating structure.\u000a\u000aDutch studio Scholten & Baijings and LA-based designer Jonathan Olivares both sought to improve the park's existing infrastructure, with the former applying colored gradients to the wooden seats and backs of five existing benches, and the latter placing a curving bench alongside a pair of renovated boules courts.\u000a\u000aAppropriately for a project aimed at engaging with the local community, the inhabitants of Järfälla will be asked in a year's time to decide which, if any, of the Superbenches they want to remain in the park. Feedback from residents at the opening event was predominantly positive, meaning these alternative benches might well become a permanent part of Kvarnbacken's future.

aVDean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program "The Dean Obeidallah Show" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @deanofcomedy . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) To Donald Trump, former sheriff Joe Arpaio is a "patriot" deserving of a pardon while transgender Americans who courageously risk their lives in the military to defend our nation are a "burden" and should be banned from our armed services. Both of these decisions share one thing: Trump is legitimizing discrimination against minorities.\u000a\u000aArpaio, who was pardoned by Trump Friday night, is the controversial former Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff who had a permanent injunction issued against him by a federal judge in 2013 for continuing to racially profile Latino drivers even after being ordered to stop years earlier. The court's order could not be more clear, instructing Arpaio to stop "detaining, holding, or arresting Latino occupants of vehicles in Maricopa County based on a reasonable belief, without more, that such persons were in country without authorization."\u000a\u000aBut the former sheriff, a man Trump praised in 2012 for joining him in peddling the racist birther campaign against President Barack Obama, intentionally ignored the court's order despite admitting that his officers had "violated the constitutional rights of Latinos during saturation patrols" -- a procedure in which officers flood a targeted geographic area.\u000a\u000aIn fact, after the 2013 court ruling, Arpaio proclaimed to a crowd of cheering supporters, "After [the Justice Department] went after me, we arrested 500 more just for spite." Consequently, after a trial last month, Arpaio was found to be in criminal contempt of court for "willfully disobeying the law after a court ordered him to stop singling out drivers based on ethnicity and detaining them without charges."\u000a\u000aDespite this, President Trump declared on Friday that Arpaio was a "worthy candidate" for this pardon. He couldn't be more wrong. Arpaio is a despicable man who has for years harassed, detained and imprisoned countless Latinos simply because of their ethnicity. Arpaio is neither a "patriot" nor "worthy" of special treatment; he's a criminal and a bigot.\u000a\u000aLet's be clear, Trump's pardon of Arpaio sends a message to the nation -- including law enforcement -- that profiling people based on their ethnicity and race is okay in Trump's America. And it's also a strong message to the "fine people," as Trump called them, in the white supremacist demonstrations, that people who aren't white deserve less constitutional protections.\u000a\u000aBut Trump wasn't done legitimizing discrimination on Friday -- he did more. He took a big step to legally sanctioning discrimination against the LGBT community by announcing a ban on transgender Americans who want to serve in our military. Transgender men and women currently serving can remain for the time being, but Trump's order would allow them to be discharged at any moment depending on the decision of military leaders. (Trump avoided military service during the Vietnam War because of "temporary" heel spurs that astoundingly were worse in his 20s than today when he's 71 years old.)\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Transgender ex-Navy surgeon on Trump's ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Transgender ex-Navy surgeon on Trump's ban 05:43\u000a\u000aIt was an unsurprising move. Trump first signaled, in a series of tweets , in late July his intention to ban transgender Americans from joining our military and even hinted at the immediate discharge of those now serving. He callously described these brave men and women as a burden, "Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."\u000a\u000aIn announcing this policy , Trump reiterated his view that transgender Americans in the military would be a burden. In reality, however, a 2016 RAND Corporation study commissioned by the Pentagon found the opposite, noting that 18 countries already allow transgender personnel to openly serve in their military and in "no case did the RAND team find evidence of an effect on operational effectiveness, operational readiness or cohesion."\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aBut as we all know, facts don't matter to Trump -- especially when demonizing minorities, be they Muslims, the disabled, Mexicans, etc. This ban by Trump will -- like Arpaio's pardon -- send a clear message that discrimination against a minority group is acceptable in Trump's America.\u000a\u000aTrump's latest actions prove that the lasting impact of his presidency will likely be less about legislative accomplishments and more about his emboldening of intolerance, discrimination and even hate.

aVThe news that, after 106 years, Captain Scott's fruitcake was found by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and "smelled edible", raises the question: are there other foods that have similar staying power? The answer is, yes, several.\u000a\u000a1. Honey\u000a\u000aIn 2015, archaeologists reported that they'd found 3,000-year-old honey while excavating tombs in Egypt, and it was perfectly edible. This durability is thanks to the unique features of honey: it is low in water and high in sugar, so bacteria cannot grow on it. Honey also contains small amounts of hydrogen peroxide, which inhibits growth of microbes. This is partly why bees produce it for the young in their hives -- it is both food and protection.\u000a\u000aProcessing honey also helps as the sugars in honey are hygroscopic and tend to draw in atmospheric water, which is not ideal. However, during processing and packaging, the heat treatment first removes water and then airtight lids keeps the water out, helping it keep for longer. Although honey can go cloudy and crystallise when opened as the sugars draw in water again, this physical change can be reversed by simply warming the honey.\u000a\u000a2. Dried legumes\u000a\u000aAs with honey, the key to a long shelf-life is processing and storage. Drying beans, lentils, and other legumes increases the sugar concentration and lowers their water content, which makes it hard for bacteria and moulds to grow on them. Also, any enzymes that would naturally break down the product after harvest are put into suspended animation. If the container is airtight, they will last for years and still be a great source of protein. If you allow water in, however, then they will only last a few months.\u000a\u000a3. Soy sauce\u000a\u000aSoy sauce has the potential to last at least three years . The combination of its salt content and being fermented means that, if it is unopened, it should have a very long shelf life . How long it will last depends on the type of soy sauce and, once opened, the temperature it is stored at. If it does go off, it is likely to be due to mould growing around the lid.\u000a\u000a4. Vinegar\u000a\u000aSome may argue vinegar is in fact already spoiled wine or cider. But its acidic nature, traditionally achieved using Acetobacter bacteria to ferment it, means other bacteria struggle to grow in it, and so it can last a very long time. While white vinegar will remain almost unchanged indefinitely, other vinegars may change colour or produce a sediment . Typically, this will not affect the safety of the product, just the appearance and perhaps flavour.\u000a\u000a5. White rice\u000a\u000aWhite rice has been eaten after being stored for 30 years in tins, with the parboiled rice then passing a tasting panel test . What appears to be key for rice is atmosphere and temperature. Studies have reported that a low temperature (about 3\u2103) and a lack of oxygen appear to be important for its longevity. Brown rice, although often considered to be healthier, has a shorter shelf life. Its fibrous bran contains unsaturated fats, which can turn rancid. So if your brown rice is oily and smells like old paint, it's best to throw it away.\u000a\u000a6. Dark chocolate\u000a\u000aThere is some debate about whether chocolate goes bad. The addition of milk to chocolate may reduce its shelf life. But dark chocolate appears to last better, despite not always looking like it has. This could be because, if it is not stored at a constant temperature, the fat can rise to the surface, leaving a bloom that looks a bit like mould . If stored at a constant temperature, however, chocolate can last for two years or more, with concentrations of the compounds which some link to health benefit s remaining throughout this time. For most people, though, chocolate does not tend to last this long before it is eaten.\u000a\u000a7 & 8. Sugar and salt\u000a\u000aMany of the foods that last for a long time are high in sugar and salt. In simple terms, they draw water out, so if bacteria try to grow on it, they will simply shrivel up. This is why we use salt to make ham, sugar to make jam, and both to make gravlax\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAs foods in their own right, if salt and sugar are stored away from moisture in airtight containers, they will last indefinitely. But additives, such as iodine added to salt, can reduce its shelf life to about five years\u000a\u000aOf course, most foods don't last very long. This is because they contain the things microbes love, such as nutrients and water, and not much of the stuff they don't love, such as salt and acid.

aVEditor's note: Former US Rep. Steve Israel, a Democrat from New York, is a political novelist and CNN contributor. His next book, "Big Guns," will be released in April. This is the first in a series of columns for CNN Opinion on life after Congress. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000aOn Capitol Hill, it marks something else.\u000a\u000aIt's the end of the August recess and the "soft opening" of the midterm elections. This week begins an unseen shift in the dynamics of upcoming campaigns, potential retirements, and the number of seats that will be in play.\u000a\u000aDemocrats need 24 seats to gain the majority in a historically negative environment for Republicans. President Trump will be on the 2018 midterm ballot even though his name won't.\u000a\u000aAnd in many respects, the race begins now.\u000a\u000aFor four years, I chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (two-thirds of the gray hair on my head sprouted in that period). Our job was to elect House Democrats and defeat Republicans. That meant recruiting candidates, targeting districts, building campaign infrastructure, raising money, developing message and mobilizing field operations.\u000a\u000aI considered Labor Day of the year before the election an important benchmark for several reasons.\u000a\u000aFirst: Incumbent House members were home for the August recess and could read the mood of their electorate. Town halls, Rotary Club visits, and constituent encounters were like canaries in the coal mine. Members returned to Washington either chirping about a favorable climate or gasping about how bad it was. I remember walking into Long Island diners in the politically miserable month of August 2010. It wasn't that my constituents were hostile to me; they just seemed to be staring sullenly at their plates. That's when I knew we had problems.\u000a\u000aSecond: A month at home sometimes stirs thoughts of retirement for incumbents, potentially creating open seat opportunities. They may wait until Christmas or New Year's to make final decisions, but for many, August is when those thoughts first materialize.\u000a\u000aThird: After Labor Day, candidate recruiting is practically over. There may be some stragglers, but most top tier candidates are on the hook and the initial battlefield of competitive districts is set. Today that battlefield looks more competitive for House Democrats than at any time since they lost the majority in 2010. Twenty-three Republican-held districts were carried by Hillary Clinton. These are the Democrats' sweet spots -- areas where Democrats and swing voters are rejecting any affiliation with President Trump, and where the lack of legislative accomplishments will suppress Republican turnout.\u000a\u000aHouse Republicans are not without their advantages headed into the 2018 midterm elections. While wins in high profile special elections are not necessarily indicative of a greater trend (many assumed in 2011 after Kathy Hochul won a special election in Upstate New York that Democrats would retake the House -- we didn't), the greatest handicap from which House Republicans benefit is a map that was rigged by gerrymandering. Despite this, several of my former Republican colleagues in the House have gloomily told me that they're bracing for a possible loss of their majority.\u000a\u000aThe next campaign filing deadline is September 30, which means that after a summer of leisure and travel by well-heeled donors, candidates have less than a month to collect their checks. These financial first impressions have a lasting effect into the fall. From my perspective as Chairman of the DCCC, a robust September filing by a candidate demonstrated early strength. Anemic resources showed me potential problems.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThe midterm congressional arena will shrink and expand over the next 14 months. Some candidates will rocket to success and some will flame out. There will be surprises for both Democrats and Republicans: that unwinnable district that's suddenly close or that "safe seat" that's suddenly going south.\u000a\u000aBut for most candidates, that work truly begins this week. Success later requires hard work now.

There have also been more flu-related hospitalizations this year: 1,429, versus 719 in last year's surveillance report\u000a\u000a"There's nothing really unusual about this year except that it's a high year in Australia, which is what you see every once in a while," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\u000a\u000aAustralia's curve is "clearly much higher than the curve of last year," he added, but that's not surprising because the US government's own webpage of five to six years' worth of influenza case curves shows clearly that they're all over the place: "There's a tremendous amount of variability," he said.\u000a\u000a"All the flu-ologists, myself included, say the only thing that you can predict about influenza is that it's going to be unpredictable," Fauci said.\u000a\u000aHitting hard in New South Wales\u000a\u000aAustralia's state breakdown reveals that New South Wales, the nation's most populous, is battling the most flu cases: 60,000 as of August 31. August has proved to be the worst month on record for New South Wales; government health data show 35,670 confirmed flu cases in that month, most of them in Sydney, the capital. Previously, the worst months for New South Wales had been July, with 16,686 cases; August 2016, with 13,602 cases; and August 2015, with 12,901 cases.\u000a\u000aDr. Vicky Sheppeard, director of communicable diseases, NSW Health, said in an email that year-to-year comparison of reported cases is "not a reliable way to judge the severity of a season unless other factors such as testing practices are taken into account." Since 2010, she said, NSW doctors and hospitals have been using more sensitive tests so flu cases that previously might have gone undiagnosed are now reported.\u000a\u000aStill, Sheppeard noted the high number of cases this year, particularly on the eastern seaboard where New South Wales is located.\u000a\u000aAn earlier onset this season contributed in part to the increase, the Australian Department of Health said in its surveillance report.\u000a\u000aInfluenza A (H3N2) is the predominant circulating influenza A virus nationally this year, and most of the deaths were due to this strain (81%).\u000a\u000a"There are the A group of viruses and the B groups," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. "The A groups are the ones that usually are responsible for large epidemics."\u000a\u000aThough these A strains change periodically, they're the ones that cause pandemics, "whereas the B flu strains usually smolder along. They always cause illness -- it can be just as severe as the A strains -- but they don't produce large outbreaks," he said.\u000a\u000aIn Northern Hemisphere flu seasons, A starts early, causes most of the cases and then usually abates. If we look at late season influenza, it's most often B strains, he added.\u000a\u000aEach year, a flu vaccine is made for the Southern Hemisphere and for the Northern Hemisphere from combinations of A and B strains. Committees of scientists consider which viruses are making people sick, where those viruses are spreading and how well the previous season's vaccine protected against them. Sometimes, each hemisphere's formulation is different, but sometimes, they are identical.\u000a\u000aIn Australia, the early data "indicates the four flu strains in the vaccine are well-matched to circulating viruses," said Sheppeard. "It is known that one of the strains in the vaccine [H3N2] is less effective in preventing infection, despite a good match."\u000a\u000aThe vaccine formulation to be used in the US this year is "essentially identical" to what Australia is using now, Fauci said.\u000a\u000aBoding ill for the Northern Hemisphere\u000a\u000aDoes Australia's bad flu season bode ill for Northern Hemisphere nations, including the US, Canada and across Europe?\u000a\u000a"In general, we get in our season what the Southern Hemisphere got in the season immediately preceding us," Fauci said. An "intelligent guess," therefore, is that the north will probably have a bad flu season.\u000a\u000a"With influenza, it is never 100%," he said.\u000a\u000aAdolfo García-Sastre, a professor and director of the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, said the important question is "what type of strain is causing the outbreak, whether it is one that is similar to ones that have been circulating before or not."\u000a\u000a"Now, If the strain has changed, that's a different story," he said. "The high incidence may have been due to changes in the antigenic makeup": the part of the virus that makes it easier to infect people who have been exposed to the strain or have been vaccinated. If the influenza vaccine is not matching the circulating strain, "that could explain larger incidence," García-Sastre said.\u000a\u000aHow many people were sick last year also matters, Fauci said.\u000a\u000aIf the circulating strains this year are the same as last year and relatively few people became ill last flu season, then there will be fewer people with natural immunity in Australia, so "they wound up getting hit now," he said.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, other countries may have had more people sick during the previous flu season, so they might have more naturally immune people and will not get hit as hard this year, he said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"So when you talk about influenza, almost nothing is absolutely precision," Fauci said. "In general, one can say we usually see here what they see there in their season."\u000a\u000aSchaffner agrees: "There's not a one-to-one correlation." Still, hearing about Australia's high number of flu cases, he said, "I started to tighten my belt."

aVChris Dwyer, CNN \u2022 Published 23rd August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 The Eternal City of Rome is unquestionably one of the world's greatest cultural treasures, a beguiling mix of history both ancient and recent, architecture -- and food.\u000a\u000aThe beauty is that all three elements are often combined in dining destinations that truly take the breath away.\u000a\u000aFrom humble, crumbling piazzas with easygoing charm to famous monuments that have stood for millennia, here are some of Rome's best table views for dining al fresco:\u000a\u000aIl Giardino, Eden Hotel\u000a\u000aSitting on a hilltop, Il Giardino boasts unrestricted views of the city.\u000a\u000aThe elegant Eden Hotel, part of the Dorchester Collection, recently reopened following an 18-month renovation. One of its biggest draws has always been its hilltop location by the Villa Borghese, affording it showstopping views across the city's hills to St Peter's and the Vatican.\u000a\u000aThe vistas don't come better than from rooftop restaurants La Terrazza and Il Giardino. In the former, contemporary Mediterranean dishes join innovative Italian classics under the watchful eye of chef Fabio Ciervo.\u000a\u000aAt the adjacent Il Giardino, wraparound windows open up to give unrestricted views, while the most sought-after seats are outside, flanked by a wall of scented jasmine flowers in a vertical garden.\u000a\u000aLa Terrazza and Il Giardino , Eden Hotel, Via Ludovisi, 49, 00187 Rome; +39 06 478121\u000a\u000aArlù\u000a\u000aIn a country whose cuisine is so closely linked to family, it doesn't get much more authentic than Arlù. Just steps from the Vatican and St Peter's Square, this place has been serving locals and visitors alike since 1959, with two young daughters now working alongside their parents.\u000a\u000aThe tables on the cobbled street outside are the most popular and make the perfect people-watching spot.\u000a\u000aDishes include an exemplary spaghetti carbonara: golden handmade pasta entwined with pancetta and egg yolk, a genuine Roman classic made from a recipe passed down the generations.\u000a\u000aArlù , Borgo Pio, 135, 00193, Rome; +39 06 686 8936\u000a\u000aVivi Bistrot\u000a\u000aVivi Bistrot's branch at Piazza Navona is arguably their finest.\u000a\u000aThe historic Palazzo Braschi is the setting for Vivi Bistrot, a relaxed dining spot with a number of locations across Rome.\u000a\u000aThis is arguably their finest, however, as it overlooks the beautiful and bustling Piazza Navona, complete with sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, or Fountain of the Four Rivers.\u000a\u000aVivi is open throughout the day from breakfast to lunch, afternoon tea, cocktails and dinner. They are proud of their organic cuisine and wines that touch on global influences.\u000a\u000aAs such you can order gazpacho, babaganoush or couscous alongside more familiar Italian dishes such as eggplant parmigiana or homemade lasagne.\u000a\u000aVivi Bistrot , Piazza Navona, 2, 00186, Rome; +39 06 683 3779\u000a\u000aHostaria Costanza\u000a\u000aTaking a food tour is a great way to experience some of Rome's lesser-known dining spots, and Italy4Real allows visitors to sample dishes from a number of restaurants, including well-kept secret Hostaria Costanza.\u000a\u000aThe historic restaurant lies under what remains of the Theater of Pompey, which dates back to 61 BCE.

"Del 1954" etched in glass above the door shows this is a stayer along with the constant waiting lines.\u000a\u000aOutside piazza tables allow you to take in the unique Trastevere vibe amidst mopeds and graffiti tags on ancient walls, while bargain carafes of Chianti and no-nonsense plates of perfect pasta or tripe make you wish you could stay all night.\u000a\u000aDa Augusto , Piazza dè Renzi, 15, 00153, Rome; +39 06 580 3798\u000a\u000aLa Pergola, Rome Cavalieri Hotel\u000a\u000aFrom local neighborhood feels to Rome's only three-Michelin-star restaurant, La Pergola lies atop the Rome Cavalieri hotel.

Tradition in Rome dictates that gnocchi are eaten on a Thursday, fish on Friday, tripe on Saturday and lasagne on Sunday, but the beauty of Zanzara is that you can order them any day of the week.\u000a\u000aElsewhere, salumi are a specialty, be they Spanish jamon or Italian prosciutto. Wines by the glass are a good deal and unsurprisingly are largely Italian in provenance.

aV(CNN) An Illinois state prosecutor who had been assigned to investigate police and prosecutorial misconduct arising from a wrongful murder conviction has himself been indicted on multiple misconduct charges.\u000a\u000aA grand jury in LaSalle County, Illinois, returned a 17-count indictment on Tuesday night accusing Brian Towne of official misconduct and misappropriating public funds while in office. Towne had been the state's attorney there for a decade until he lost a re-election bid in November.\u000a\u000aAfter losing the election, Towne quickly found a job as a special prosecutor at the Illinois Office of the State's Attorney Appellate Prosecutor. He had chaired the agency's board and taught classes at its continuing legal education conferences.\u000a\u000aOne of his first assignments was to investigate a perjury complaint arising from the wrongful conviction of Jack Daniel McCullough for the 1957 kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph. The case was featured in CNN's 2013 series "Taken," which raised doubts about whether McCullough had received a fair trial.\u000a\u000aTowne stepped aside from the perjury investigation in March after CNN reported he was under scrutiny for how money was spent from an asset forfeiture fund he created.\u000a\u000aThe fund was generated from property and cash seized by a drug interdiction unit of mostly retired Illinois state troopers authorized by Towne to stop and search "suspicious" vehicles with cannabis-sniffing dogs along Interstate 80. If marijuana was found, police confiscated the vehicle and its contents.\u000a\u000aTowne launched the unit and fund in 2011 during his tenure as the state's attorney. Court records indicate Towne's team, dubbed SAFE for State's Attorney's Felony Enforcement, brought in $1.2 million between 2011 and 2016.\u000a\u000aRead the original series on the case: 'Taken' Maria Ridulph's murder went unsolved for half a century. Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free. Ann O'Neill's 2013 series on the case, "Taken," raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided.\u000a\u000aNeither Towne nor his lawyer responded to requests this week for comment. But in an earlier conversation with CNN, Towne denied wrongdoing and expressed confidence he would prevail in court. He talked with a local newspaper on Tuesday evening, just after the indictment was filed.\u000a\u000aHe said the indictment was orchestrated by his political opponents.\u000a\u000a"This is clearly an abuse of power and dirty politics at its worst," he told the LaSalle News-Tribune , adding that the situation was "completely unacceptable."\u000a\u000a"I simply ask the people of La Salle County to reserve judgment until this case is resolved appropriately."\u000a\u000aAccording to the indictment, Towne allegedly used SAFE's asset forfeiture fund to fund local youth sports teams, school projects -- and his own lifestyle and re-election campaign. Other funds came from a drunken-driving awareness program.\u000a\u000aTowne has said he had no problem using confiscated drug money to support youth athletics teams and school trips because it keeps kids occupied and away from drugs.\u000a\u000aHe also stands accused of using forfeited money on personal expenses, including $21,265 to buy a used SUV and another $2,693 for Wi-Fi at home. The indictment alleges he campaigned from the state's attorney's office; some employees allegedly worked on campaign matters during office hours and used office supplies purchased by the county.\u000a\u000aThe indictment further alleges that Towne illegally accepted $50,000 in payments from the state of Illinois for teaching at legal conferences and seminars. He also allegedly dipped into forfeited funds to cover airfare, meals and hotel expenses for other conferences in Orlando and Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aSome of the 77 motorists who lost property to the SAFE unit have joined a federal class action lawsuit seeking damages for civil rights violations. For some, it was cheaper to just walk away, leaving their money and property in LaSalle County.\u000a\u000aStephen Komie, the attorney who filed the suit, said Wednesday that the charges show what can happen when police and prosecutors engage in what he called "contingent-fee law enforcement." He says money should never be tied to arrests, especially if there is little or no oversight on how it is spent.\u000a\u000aIn June, the Illinois Supreme Court decided 5-2 that SAFE was not a valid police agency. The court found that prosecutors overstep their authority when they create their own police squads, and that Towne hadn't shown that police weren't doing a good job at enforcing drug laws.\u000a\u000aTowne was not arrested; instead, prosecutors mailed him a notice to appear, said Assistant State's Attorney George Mueller, who declined to discuss the charges further. Towne has not entered a plea yet.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Twists and turns never end in kidnapping case Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Twists and turns never end in kidnapping case 02:20\u000a\u000aBefore his legal troubles, Towne had been tapped to review the actions of state police and DeKalb County prosecutors who put together the coldest murder case ever tried.\u000a\u000aThe 1957 kidnapping and murder of second-grader Maria Ridulph has haunted the small town of Sycamore, Illinois, for nearly 60 years. Hundreds of suspects were questioned and cleared over the years. And, in the days following the kidnapping, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and President Dwight D. Eisenhower took a personal interest in developments in the case.\u000a\u000aBut the feds came up empty and left the investigation in 1958 when Maria's body was found and it appeared she'd never crossed state lines. And then the case went stone cold.\u000a\u000aIn 2012, McCullough, a former neighbor, military veteran and ex-cop, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison following an investigation led by Illinois State Police. McCullough, who is 78 and lives in Seattle, was exonerated earlier this year and has filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court.\u000a\u000aHis son-in-law, Casey Porter, sought an investigation into police and prosecutorial misconduct . His public records request to Seattle police, which assisted in the arrest, uncovered a videotape of an interrogation that Illinois prosecutors had claimed in court did not exist. The tape contradicted the Seattle officer's courtroom testimony.\u000a\u000aPorter expressed disappointment.\u000a\u000a"Over a year later, no one has been charged or brought to trial," Porter said. "The only thing that has happened is further proof of the systemic corruption in the Illinois legal system related to prosecutors."\u000a\u000aAnother special prosecutor has taken over the perjury investigation.

aVHurricane Irma's impending landfall in Florida is forcing airlines serving some of the largest airports in America to shutter operations and get out of the way of the powerful storm.\u000a\u000aIrma has already trashed airports, buildings and roads in the Caribbean. St. Maarten, a major international destination for U.S. and European carriers, was in ruins after the storm. Photos from the Netherlands Ministry of Defense showed its runway covered in sand and widespread damage at its terminal building and jetways.\u000a\u000aBy late Saturday, Miami, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale - home to the 12th, 13th, 21st largest airports in the U.S., respectively - will be largely dormant as the extreme weather rolls in.\u000a\u000aBut the prospect of a direct hit from Irma represents another blow to U.S. air travel in one of the busiest air corridors on the planet for business and leisure travel.\u000a\u000aAmong Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, the three airports handled more than 115 million passengers in 2016.\u000a\u000aQuite congested in Miami. #irma pic.twitter.com/A5GQOZId6U \u2014 Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) September 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThe scramble was so acute that the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday evening said air traffic controllers were increasing the space between flights from Miami and nearby Fort Lauderdale to enable them to better manage the crowded skies. And American Airlines (AAL) was briefly under an FAA ground stop in Miami due to ATC rerouting outbound aircraft.\u000a\u000aThe airline had added 16 extra flights from Miami on Thursday, including 12 to Dallas, one to Philadelphia and three to New York, enough room for more than 3,600 passengers. The Fort Worth-based carrier said it has canceled more than 2,400 flights as of Thursday afternoon stretching through Sept. 11.\u000a\u000aRelated: Hurricanes Harvey and Irma may mess with the job market\u000a\u000aThe biggest single carrier in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale region is American, which accounts of 38% of the flying there, according to Morgan Stanley.

And, Haley argued, both UN resolutions and US law should be considered as well.\u000a\u000a"What I am saying is should he decide to decertify, he has grounds to stand on," Haley said. "It's very easy to just talk about compliance and the JCPOA," she said, referring to the deal's formal name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. "But there's so much more to the story that we need to be looking at," she added.\u000a\u000aThe deal, reached in July 2015 and implemented in January 2016, essentially eased nuclear related sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear program, some of which expire after a few years.

aVStory highlights Jill Filipovic: Joel Osteen criticized for not opening his church this week; situation spotlights "prosperity gospel" problems\u000a\u000aPromise of wealth means too many self-identified Christians are happy to leave the poor out in the cold, she writes\u000a\u000aJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and Nairobi, Kenya, and the author of the book "The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness." Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) As of Tuesday, Pastor Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church is opening its doors to flood victims in Houston, but only after a spate of public shaming on social media created a big PR problem. Welcome to the compassionate Christianity of this mega-rich megachurch and its prosperity gospel.\u000a\u000aLakewood maintained on Monday that it was inaccessible, but after receiving fierce criticism from those who pointed to other examples of locals -- from smaller churches to furniture stores -- opening their doors to those who need shelter in Houston, the church changed course. Osteen tweeted Tuesday that he and his wife "care deeply about our fellow Houstonians" and that Lakewood's doors were open to those in need.\u000a\u000aJill Filipovic\u000a\u000aThe hypocritical irony here seems obvious, because Osteen is one of America's leading proponents of prosperity theology , the so-called theory that God blesses good Christians with material wealth. He makes the case that the Lord has blessed him because of his piousness, and his bank account is proof. Osteen is worth some $50 million, lives in a $10.5 million home, and says "it's God's will for you to live in prosperity instead of poverty."\u000a\u000aThe problem isn't just that megachurch pastors like Osteen are getting filthy rich off parishioners, who are told to tithe as much as 10% of their monthly income to these already fabulously wealthy institutions, with the promise that they might strike it rich, too. It's also that prosperity gospel megachurches feed into income inequality with their specious claims that affluence is a reflection of God's approval (and on the flip side, that poverty must come from some absence of faith). That impacts both politics and policy. The promise of material wealth for the faithful means that too many self-identified Christians are happy to leave the poor and marginalized out in the cold; it's no coincidence that the most religious states in America also have some of the worst social services, spending little on welfare, health care and education, and as a result, letting high proportions of their populations languish in poverty and ill health.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVAleppo, Syria (CNN) There are few images from the Syrian war as haunting as that of Omran Daqneesh. Just over a year ago, the little boy was photographed \u2014 seemingly shell-shocked \u2014 in the back of an ambulance, covered in dust with blood on his face and clothing.\u000a\u000aThat photo and video footage of Omran, captured after his home was hit in a strike, were published around the world, making him the bloodied face of war-torn Aleppo's children. Since then, Bashar al-Assad's regime has recaptured the city, ousting the rebels from the eastern side.\u000a\u000aThis image of Omran Daqneesh was widely published after the August strike last year.\u000a\u000aWith his wounds and bruises healed, the little boy seems much like any other 4-year-old -- he likes to watch Tom and Jerry cartoons, and play with toy cars and building blocks with his brother and sister.\u000a\u000aCNN met with Omran and his family in their home in eastern Aleppo, in a visit facilitated by the Syrian government. They owned this apartment during the war, but had moved into a house to get away from the frontline.\u000a\u000aOmran likes the apartment better, he said. When asked what he remembers about his old home, all he could say was: "The house fell on top of us."\u000a\u000aOmran Daqneesh a year after his home partly collapse in a strike.\u000a\u000aOmran's father recounts the horror of that night. He pulled Omran from the rubble, he said, but another one of his sons, Ali, was killed as he took the rubbish outside. The strike flattened the home next door. Omran was introduced to the world -- as he sat dazed -- in the back of the ambulance, as the noise and fog of war engulfed his home and family.\u000a\u000aMohammed Kheir Daqneesh says he's angry, not only because he lost one son in the strike, but because another, Omran, has been used as a political pawn, in his eyes. At the time, President Assad, in a television interview with Swiss media, proclaimed the now famous photo a fake.\u000a\u000aBut Omran's father says he never wanted his son to become a media icon and changed the child's identity by shaving his head and changing his name when rebels still held part of Aleppo. He has in recent months, however, allowed Omran to be filmed in interviews by Syrian and Russian media , and on this occasion by CNN.\u000a\u000aDaqneesh said that after he saved Omran from the strike, members of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group took him to an ambulance.\u000a\u000aIt was there that activists from the Aleppo Media Center (AMC) filmed and photographed him, and posted the images online to highlight the dreadful toll of the war on Syria's children.\u000a\u000aMohammed Kheir Daqneesh with his three children.\u000a\u000a"They started to film him. They began to film him before they even treated him, even though they said his injuries were severe," Daqneesh said.\u000a\u000aThe White Helmets deny they waited for Omran to be filmed before treating him.\u000a\u000a"We provided first aid to all members of the family," White Helmets spokesman Ibrahim Abu Laith said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThankfully, the boy was only slightly wounded. An AMC spokesman says he was in extreme shock.\u000a\u000aBy the time of the strike on the home last year, the civil conflict had morphed into something of a proxy war, with international players, including Russia, Syria's most powerful ally, and the United States, backing different sides and a complex web of rebel groups fighting for different interests.\u000a\u000aSyrian and Russian forces pounded eastern Aleppo with regular airstrikes before the regime seized the enclave after more than four years of rebel rule. Much of the east has been destroyed, and rebels have caused destruction in the city's west as well.\u000a\u000aWith restricted access to Syria, international media has relied heavily on activist groups, like the AMC, to record the war.\u000a\u000aBut Daqneesh claims the details of what happened to Omran were grossly exaggerated. It was his own blood that had spilled onto Omran's face, and Omran and his sister, Rou'a, were only lightly wounded, Daqneesh said.\u000a\u000a"The truth is one thing and they used him in a way that was not truthful and this really bothered me. The armed militia and their media used him in a way that was excessive," he said.\u000a\u000aHe also complained that some media organizations reported that Omran and his siblings had died.\u000a\u000a"They keep killing them and bringing them back to life. Then make liars out of each other and then go back and deny it again. This matter bothered me very, very much."\u000a\u000aAleppo is now regime controlled, and the Syrian government is known to a keep tight grip on information within the country. It was unclear if Daqneesh was speaking freely or if he had been pressured by the government, or any other group.\u000a\u000aWho's to blame for the strike?\u000a\u000aDaqneesh did not say which rebel groups or media he was unhappy with, but he claimed "armed men" tried to coerce him into blaming a Russian airstrike for what happened. He told CNN that he did not know who was behind the strike.\u000a\u000aThe incident on August 17 last year was widely reported as an airstrike.\u000a\u000aThe AMC and the White Helmets maintain a Russian airstrike hit Omran's home, but they deny coercing the young boy's family to say that.\u000a\u000aThe Syrian and Russian governments each deny any responsibility for what happened.\u000a\u000aAMC executive director Hasan Kattan said that his group had a network connected, by walkie-talkies, to a military observation point and recorded warplanes leaving Russia's Hmeimim air base just before Omran's home was hit.\u000a\u000a"One of our reporters lives near Omran's house and he saw a warplane launching a missile," Kattan told CNN, adding that an AMC cameramen went directly to the strike site and filmed the video of the boy.\u000a\u000aThere may never be agreement on what happened that night, but Omran plans to get on with his life.\u000a\u000aWhen asked what he wants to be when he grows up, he said "a metal worker," just like his dad.

aVWe can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out.\u000a\u000aThis article is from the archive of our partner . We can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out. After the Times ran a column giving employers tips on how to deal with Millennials (for example, they need regular naps) (I didn't read the article; that's from my experience), Slate's Amanda Hess pointed out that the examples the Times used to demonstrate their points weren't actually Millennials. Some of the people quoted in the article were as old as 37, which was considered elderly only 5,000 short years ago. The age of employees of The Wire, the humble website you are currently reading, varies widely, meaning that we too have in the past wondered where the boundaries for the various generations were drawn. Is a 37-year-old who gets text-message condolences from her friends a Millennial by virtue of her behavior? Or is she some other generation, because she was born super long ago? (Sorry, 37-year-old Rebecca Soffer who is a friend of a friend of mine and who I met once! You're not actually that old!) Since The Wire is committed to Broadening Human Understanding\u2122, I decided to find out where generational boundaries are drawn.\u000a\u000aI started by calling the Census Bureau. A representative called me back, without much information. "We do not define the different generations," she told me. "The only generation we do define is Baby Boomers and that year bracket is from 1946 to 1964." Next, I spoke with Tom DiPrete, a sociology professor at Columbia University. And he agreed with the Census Bureau. "I think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media," DiPrete said, "and the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation." DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation. It "had specific characteristics," and occurred within an observable timeframe. World War II ended. You had the post-war rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family. Then societal changes disrupted those patterns, and the generation, for academic purposes, was over. His main point: "History isn't always so punctuated." I understood why Generation X, a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty, would be poorly defined. But what about Millennials? Doesn't their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers? "I actually haven't seen efforts to document [generations] rigorously, and I would be somewhat skeptical that they can be documented rigorously." DiPrete said. The things that have shaped Millennials \u2014 the rise of technology and social networks, for example \u2014 "affect people's lives differently."

aV(CNN) Seattle Seahawks star Michael Bennett couldn't contain his emotion as he recounted his treatment last month at the hands of Las Vegas police, abruptly ending a news conference after raising the specter of what a wrong move could have meant that night.\u000a\u000a"I'm just lucky to be here to be able to speak about it. At any moment, I could've made the wrong decision whether to move, or (if police) felt like I was resisting or doing something wrong, and the Seahawks would be wearing the patch with No. 72 on it," he said, referencing a common way NFL teams memorialize players they've lost.\u000a\u000a"I try to tell my daughters every single day that they matter," he continued late Wednesday, hanging his head for a few seconds before sighing and walking out of the news conference.\u000a\u000aThe 31-year-old Super Bowl champion addressed the media hours after he tweeted an open letter in which he alleged that police unfairly detained him, roughed him up and threatened to shoot him after he ran from what he thought were gunshots following the August 26 fight between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr.\u000a\u000aTurns out, there was no shooting: Police said the sound was velvet rope stands falling over, CNN affiliate KCPQ reported\u000a\u000aStill, authorities responding to Bennett's open letter stood by their treatment of the defensive end and tackle. Based on what they knew at the time, officers believed Bennett may have been involved in the shooting and pursued him, Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said, adding that he saw "no evidence that race played a role in this incident."\u000a\u000aWhat happened before Bennett was handcuffed remains unclear.

"I was here with friends. They told us to get out. Everybody ran. Can you answer my question, sir?"\u000a\u000aBrotherly love\u000a\u000aMichael, left, and Martellus Bennett, seen in 2015, are among the most outspoken players in the NFL.\u000a\u000aIn his letter , Bennett said his daughters, Peyton, Blake and Ollie, were on his mind as an officer allegedly put a gun near his head and threatened to shoot him if he moved.\u000a\u000a"All I could think was, 'I'm going to die for no other reason than I am black and my skin is somehow a threat.' My life flashed before my eyes as I thought of my girls. Would I ever play with them again? Or watch them have kids? Or be able to kiss my wife again and tell her I love her?" he wrote.\u000a\u000aHe wasn't the only one shaken at the notion of his demise. His younger brother, Martellus Bennett, a Green Bay Packers starter who played with Michael at Texas A&M, also got choked up discussing with reporters how things could've gone wrong.\u000a\u000aMartellus Bennett said he had to walk out of a team meeting "because I broke down crying just thinking about what could have happened," according to ESPN\u000a\u000aTowering over the reporters gathered at his locker, the 6-foot-6, 275-pound tight end further said, "I don't really have the answers. You just think, 'What if?' you know? Two seconds this way, two seconds that way, the whole thing is different."\u000a\u000a"So, for me, I'll just be happy to see my brother," he continued, his voice quavering, "because there's a chance that I couldn't see him."\u000a\u000aPolice: Bennett ran, jumped wall\u000a\u000aVideo from the incident shows Bennett telling an officer, "I wasn't doing nothing, man,"\u000a\u000aMichael Bennett said he's trying to focus on the Seahawks season opener Sunday against his brother's Packers. He hates that he's instead talking about the encounter with police, he said, adding that he doesn't cast blanket blame on law enforcement authorities.\u000a\u000a"It sucks that (in) the country that we live in now, sometimes you get profiled for the color of your skin, and it's a tough situation for me," Bennett said. "Do I think every police officer is bad? No, I don't believe that. Do I believe there are some people out there that judge people by the color of their skin? I do believe that."\u000a\u000aThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed it detained Bennett for about 10 minutes that night before releasing him, said McMahill, the undersheriff.\u000a\u000aPolice responded to a call of battery and assault with a gun that turned into an active-shooter situation, he said. Officers believed Bennett may have been involved in the shooting and gave chase, McMahill said.\u000a\u000aThey first saw Bennett crouched behind a gaming machine, then watched him run out the doors of a casino, jump over a wall and run into traffic, McMahill alleged.\u000a\u000a"Many folks today have called this an incident of racial-bias policing, that police officers focused solely on the race of the individual that they were going to stop. I can tell you as I stand here today, I see no evidence of that," he said.\u000a\u000aDetective Steve Grammas, president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association, called on the NFL to investigate Bennett over his "obvious false allegations against our officers," saying the player has yet to file an internal affairs complaint against the officers, who are both minorities.\u000a\u000a"I believe a fair and impartial investigation will show officers detained somebody that ran away from the scene and that was hiding and when they had reason to believe he wasn't involved he was let go. It's being blown up more than it should be, I believe," he wrote.\u000a\u000aBennett's account differs\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED NFL stars sit during national anthem Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NFL stars sit during national anthem 01:04\u000a\u000aThe police account stands in contrast to the version of events Bennett outlined in his letter. Bennett said he was leaving a party when he heard what he thought were gunshots and ran for cover.\u000a\u000aPolice ordered him to the ground at gunpoint and as he lay there, complying with commands not to move, an officer placed a gun near Bennett's head and warned him that if he moved, he would "blow my f***ing head off." A second officer "forcefully jammed his knee into my back making it difficult for me to breathe," he wrote.\u000a\u000a"They then cinched the handcuffs on my wrists so tight that my fingers went numb," the letter states.\u000a\u000a"The officers' excessive use of force was unbearable," Bennett wrote. "I felt helpless as I lay there on the ground handcuffed facing the real-life threat of being killed."\u000a\u000aBennett is considering a federal civil rights lawsuit against the officers, attorney John Burris said, calling the incident "Exhibit A as to how every black man rich, famous or poor, unarmed and innocent, can be falsely detained, arrested or even shot and killed by the police."\u000a\u000aWrote Bennett in his open letter: "Equality doesn't live in this country and no matter how much money you make, what job title you have, or how much you give, when you are seen as a 'Nigger,' you will be treated that way."\u000a\u000aBennett gets support\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED NFLer: I'll protest anthem until we're equal Replay More Videos ...

aV(CNN) A glossy women's magazine has hit virtual newsstands, its front cover splashed with the image of a woman, veiled from head to toe, walking off into a yellow-hued desert.\u000a\u000aBut, unlike other fashion or beauty publications, this one has a niche audience in mind: would-be female jihadists.\u000a\u000aThe English-language magazine -- which debuted online but in a print-style format -- was published by the Pakistani Taliban, Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), earlier this month without much fanfare.\u000a\u000aThe first edition of Sunnat E Khaula, which harks back to a seventh-century female Muslim warrior named Khaula, calls on "like-minded jihadi sisters" to organize "secret gatherings at home," arrange "physical training classes" and "prepare for martyrdom operations."\u000a\u000a"We want to provoke women of Islam to come forward and join the ranks of mujahideen [holy warriors] of Islam," an opening editorial reads.\u000a\u000aThey [the TTP] are trying to replicate efforts by Islamic State, particularly now that the caliphate is in decline.\u000a\u000aThe TTP's women's magazine -- the first of its kind -- takes a page out of the ISIS propaganda playbook to target women. And the timing of its release isn't accidental. As ISIS' self-proclaimed caliphate crumbles in Syria and Iraq, the Taliban has seized on an opportunity -- offering an alternative for radicalized women willing to shift their loyalties.\u000a\u000a"The first thing I would think of with a piece of propaganda like this coming out is that they [the TTP] are trying to replicate efforts by Islamic State, particularly now that the caliphate is in decline," Nikita Malik, a senior research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told CNN.\u000a\u000aMalik, who has studied women and radicalization extensively, says that while the Taliban has used women before, the magazine signals a change in strategy. Despite the group's historically violent subjugation of women -- whom they have killed, barred from attending schools and forced into marriages -- it seems they're trying to attract a new audience.\u000a\u000a"It is definitely an attempt, especially as it's the first one, to reach out to a different audience, to reach out to different recruits," Malik said, adding that it's unusual for the TTP to actively seek out women to take up arms.\u000a\u000aThe 45-page magazine features a lengthy article, entitled "Time of martyrdom has come," that looks at ways women can assist the TTP in waging jihad. Among various action points outlined, the piece calls on women to "train yourself in weapon handling, self-defense." The text is overlaid on photos of women dressed in niqabs, carrying assault rifles.\u000a\u000aPhoto illustration by CNN.\u000a\u000a"I ask you sisters to prepare yourself for martyrdom operations. There are lots of mujahideen working in Pakistan, please help them in achieving their aim," the article reads.\u000a\u000aLast week, in a speech announcing plans to expand US military intervention in Afghanistan, President Donald Trump blasted Pakistan for being a terrorist hotbed.\u000a\u000aGeorgia State professor Mia Bloom, whose 2011 study, Bombshell: Women and Terrorism, explores women's roles in terrorist movements, said she's seen a progression over time in how groups like the TTP reach out to women -- whether it's with al Qaeda's Al-Shamikha magazine (dubbed 'Jihad Cosmo') or its Al-Khansaa women's webzine.\u000a\u000a"It's really a strategic logic that these terrorists are using," Bloom told CNN. "For them, women are a tool or an instrument, to be exploited for whatever purposes necessary, and their objectives are ultimately longevity, survival and to flourish."\u000a\u000aBloom explained that both the Taliban and ISIS have increasingly used women as a tool to recruit other women, reward militants, retain their base and produce the next generation of fighters.\u000a\u000a"When you start to look at the progression over time, all of these publications attracting women are trying to cast a wide net and create the broadest possible appeal," Bloom said.\u000a\u000aThey're treating this as a window of opportunity...this is the perfect moment for another organization to enter the playing field and try to attract that group of women. Louisa Tarras-Wahlberg\u000a\u000aISIS has been particularly adept at attracting women to suit these needs, according to Bloom, who tracks the group's propaganda output.\u000a\u000aAs women begin to flee what ISIS claims as the caliphate , Bloom said she sees small signs that the militant group's message to female recruits is changing. A video released by ISIS earlier this month showed young girls for the first time, reciting passages from the Quran in a classroom.\u000a\u000a"Here you have ISIS saying, 'We're educating our girls; we're not like Boko Haram; we're not like the Taliban.'"\u000a\u000aThe Taliban banned girls from schools in Pakistan's Swat Valley in 2009. Three years later, militants shot Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl turned women's rights advocate, for defying them. But with its new publication, the group appears to be specifically targeting educated, upper-middle class, English-speaking women.\u000a\u000aIn an article titled, "My journey from ignorance to guidance," a Pakistani woman, who the magazine says studied overseas and received her PhD, tells how she contemplated traveling to Saudi Arabia and Syria before joining the TTP.\u000a\u000aLouisa Tarras-Wahlberg, who has researched ISIS' propaganda targeting women, explained that this personal story -- among others in the magazine -- is aimed at engaging women who are already actively seeking to "wage jihad."\u000a\u000a"They're treating this as a window of opportunity. They're seeing that ISIS is struggling and people are fleeing from Syria and Iraq," Tarras-Wahlberg told CNN. "This is the perfect moment for another organization to enter the playing field and try to attract that group of women ... women who are already highly engaged."

aVDavid Pescovitz is a research director at the Institute for the Future , editor/partner at Boing Boing , and co-founder of Ozma Records . The Voyager Golden Record is now available as a vinyl box set and a book/CD package from Ozma Records. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Forty years ago this week, NASA launched the second of two Voyager spacecraft on a grand tour of the solar system and into the mysteries of interstellar space. It was an audacious mission that continues to this day -- as the probes launched in 1977 still call home with new data about the cosmos.\u000a\u000aAttached to each of these spacecraft is a beautiful golden phonograph record containing a message for any extraterrestrial intelligence that might encounter it, perhaps billions of years from now. This enchanting artifact, officially called the Voyager Interstellar Record, may be the last vestige of our civilization after we are gone forever.\u000a\u000aCompiled in just a few months by a dynamic committee led by Carl Sagan, the golden record is both an inspired scientific effort and a compelling piece of conceptual art.\u000a\u000a"The launching of this 'bottle' into the cosmic 'ocean' says something very hopeful about life on this planet," Sagan wrote in "Pale Blue Dot."\u000a\u000aIndeed, the Voyager Golden Record is a reminder of what we can achieve when we are at our best, and that our future really is up to all of us.\u000a\u000aIt's a story of our planet expressed in sounds, images, and science : Earth's greatest music from myriad peoples and eras, from Bach and Blind Willie Johnson to Benin percussion to Solomon Island panpipes. Natural sounds \u2014 birds, a train, a baby's cry, a kiss \u2014 are collaged into a lovely audio poem called "Sounds of Earth." There are spoken greetings in dozens of human languages\u2014 and one whale language \u2014 and more than 100 images encoded in analog that depict who, and what, we are. A diagram on the aluminum cover of the record explains how to play it and where it came from.\u000a\u000aA technician attaches a gold record to a Voyager space probe, USA, circa 1977.\u000a\u000aAs an objet d'art and design, the Voyager Record represents deep insights about communication, context, and the power of media. In the realm of science, it raises fundamental questions about our place in the universe.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, my friends Timothy Daly, Lawrence Azerrad, and I embarked on a journey t o release the Voyager Record to the public on vinyl for the first time. We launched a Kickstarter to crowdfund our effort through pre-orders of a lavish box set containing three translucent gold LPs, a book, and an art print. The response was astounding. More than 10,000 people pledged their support, including many who told us they don't even own a record player. The "Voyager Golden Record: 40th Anniversary Edition" became the most funded music project in Kickstarter's history. We donated 20% of the net profits from that limited Kickstarter edition to the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University.\u000a\u000aIt isn't that the Voyager Record seduces us with a nostalgia trip to an era of wide-eyed optimism. In fact, the record is perhaps more relevant now than when the two spacecraft launched back in 1977. As the original golden record's producer, Timothy Ferris, wrote in the liner notes for our project, the Voyagers are on a journey not just through space but also through time. The record is a time capsule but it is also timeless. It sparks the imagination. It provokes us to think about the future and our civilization's place in it. It exudes a sense of hope for a better tomorrow.\u000a\u000aListen here to an audio sampler of the Voyager Golden Record\u000a\u000aWhen astronomer and technical director Frank Drake, designer Jon Lomberg, and their colleagues set about curating the images to encode in the record's grooves, they agreed from the outset to avoid depictions of war, crime, poverty and disease. It was a conscious decision that the interstellar message could reflect only positively on our planet. The golden record's photo sequence is a visual time capsule of Earth. It's a snapshot of life on our planet, and an aspirational one at that. Similarly, the greetings in Earth's most widely spoken languages are words of peace and goodwill.\u000a\u000a"There were two audiences for whom this message was being prepared \u2014t hose of us who inhabit Earth, and those who exist on the planets of distant stars," wrote Linda Salzman Sagan (then Sagan's wife), who assembled the greetings , in the book "Murmurs of Earth."\u000a\u000aIn terms of the musical selections, two criteria guided Ferris, creative director Ann Druyan (now Sagan's widow), and the others as they selected the recordings: "That we include a variety of music representing many cultures rather than just the one that had built and launched the spacecraft, and that we strive to make a 'good' record," Ferris wrote.\u000a\u000aLate last year, Tim Daly and I sat with Ferris around a pristine vintage tape deck in New York's historic Battery Mastering Studios to hear the Voyager Golden Record master tapes, stored for 40 years in an underground bunker until Sony Music's intrepid archivist Matt Kelly located and retrieved them for our project. Beethoven, bagpipes, Chuck Berry, gamelan music, and the blues washed over us. The greetings in 55 languages sounded as if the individuals behind those voices were in the room with us. It was awe inspiring. As the interstellar message's outro of Beethoven's String Quartet No. 13 in B flat faded out, Ferris looked over at us: "It's a good record, right?" he said with a smile. Yes. It most certainly is.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aFor me, the Voyager Record lies at the intersection of my lifelong love of art, music and science with my career as a professional futurist. I'm a researcher at the Institute for the Future, a 50-year-old nonprofit organization in Silicon Valley that helps companies, civic organizations and the public systematically consider the future to make better decisions in the present. And the first law of futures thinking is that there are no facts about the future. The future is a place where anything is possible, even if not probable. Futures thinking is fueled by wonder and curiosity. Most importantly, thinking about the future is an inherently hopeful practice. It connects us to our humanity just as the Voyager golden record does.\u000a\u000aWe'll probably never know whether an extraterrestrial civilization ever listens to the golden record. And ultimately, it doesn't really matter. The Voyager Record is a gift from humanity to the cosmos. But it is also a gift to humanity. It's a stunning manifestation of what our civilization can accomplish through creativity, passion and science.\u000a\u000aAn earlier version of this piece misnamed the spacecraft launched on September 5, 1977. Voyager 2 was launched before Voyager 1.

aVNairobi, Kenya (CNN) "It was a terrible night of shooting," says Jane Anyango, hands outstretched showing the spent bullet casings that were a reminder of the violence that erupted after the Kenyan election results were announced last month.\u000a\u000aAnyango was at home in the evening when she heard "careless, non-stop shooting," she says.\u000a\u000aTerrified, she huddled with her 13-year-old son as the bullets rained down around their home.\u000a\u000a"I have spent cartridges in my home and a crack in my roof. Body bags were also found inside the lake. We still don't know how many people were killed," she tells CNN.\u000a\u000aTensions have remained high since Kenya's Supreme Court annulled the results of the contentious presidential election Friday and ordered a new election within 60 days.\u000a\u000aAfter initially appearing to accept the decision, President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday went on the offensive, stating there was a problem with the judiciary and he was going to fix it.\u000a\u000a"We shall revisit this thing. We clearly have a problem," he said.\u000a\u000a"Who even elected you? ... We have a problem and we must fix it," he said, speaking on live television at the State House in Nairobi.\u000a\u000aFears of violence\u000a\u000aMany are fearful that the Supreme Court's ruling and the new, hardened stance from the President could spark a new wave of violence.\u000a\u000aBullet holes are seen outside Olympic Primary School in the Kibera slum.\u000a\u000aOne of the potential flashpoints, and an area that is being closely watched, is the Kibera slum.\u000a\u000aIn the midst of Kibera is the government-run Olympic Primary School. Locals say security forces fired indiscriminately at people living in Kibera after the initial election results and many of them were forced to shelter inside the school.\u000a\u000a"The police intimidate people," entrepreneur Erick Okothendo told CNN. "If you go for peaceful demonstration, you get killed. We saw people put in body bags. At the gate of Olympic Primary school in Kibera you can see bullets.\u000a\u000a"Why were they shooting at a school?"\u000a\u000aErick Okothendo, an entrepreneur in Kibera.\u000a\u000aPolice helicopters hover over the dense and impoverished district, which is home to around 250,000 slum dwellers, according to the Kibera facts website\u000a\u000aKibera is the biggest slum in Africa and a tinderbox mix of different tribes and ethnicities, ranging from the Luo to the predominantly Muslim Nubians who were the original settlers.\u000a\u000aToday, the sprawling landscape is dotted with corrugated iron roof shacks amid mounds of rubbish and some brightly colored buildings.\u000a\u000a'Rekindling of hope'\u000a\u000aFriday's ruling was the first time any court in Africa has annulled election results. And it is notable in a continent where government typically leans heavily on the judicial system to do its bidding.\u000a\u000a"If we don't have faith in our independent institutions, it means that the country is dead, so it was not just about the elections but it was about this country," Anyango said.\u000a\u000aAnyango says she knows well the devastating effects of post-election violence after one of her mentees, a 15-year-old girl, was hit by a stray bullet in the aftermath of the 2007/2008 elections -- one of the bloodiest in Kenya's history. The election violence left 1,300 people dead and more than 500,000 people were displaced.\u000a\u000aSince then, she says, she has gathered groups of women to protest peacefully and to become peace ambassadors in areas of heightened post-election tension.\u000a\u000aAnyango is now a global peace ambassador working with international NGOs.\u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court's ruling was a "rekindling of hope" in Kenya, she said.\u000a\u000aHowever, she had scathing words for the team of international election observers, which included former US Secretary of State John Kerry.\u000a\u000aKenyans linger near a wall with graffiti reading, "Peace wanted alive" in Nairobi's Kibera slum August 13, 2017.\u000a\u000a"We are very disappointed in the international community. They came out and unanimously agreed that the elections were free and fair. The international community has desperately failed Kenyans," Anyango said.\u000a\u000a"They didn't listen to what the opposition was bringing out. What this has shown me is that that Kenyans should be left to deal with their issues. They should not depend on anyone else to tell them what is good for them," she added.\u000a\u000aThe annulment of the election result was a rare win for supporters of the veteran opposition candidate Raila Odinga, who brought the case against Kenyatta's win to the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000aRevered in Kibera\u000a\u000aThis year's election bid was the fourth attempt for the 72-year-old, whose father was Kenya's first vice president.\u000a\u000aJane Iskah Oyora and her 9-year-old daughter, Gift.\u000a\u000aJane Iskah Oyora, who runs a dressmaking business in Kibera while caring for her children Gift, 9, and Jeremy, 2 months, told CNN she "danced and danced" after she found out the court's decision.\u000a\u000a"I just love Raila Odinga. The way he speaks, he's intelligent," she said. "He has been successful four times but because of the rigging, that's why he's not managed it."\u000a\u000aOdinga attracts staunch support in parts of the Kibera slum, where he is revered as a man of the people who will make life better for the poor.\u000a\u000a"He promised that our children will go to school without paying school fees," Oyora said. "My biggest hope is that when he comes into power he will reduce the cost of living and my business will pick up.\u000a\u000a"Life is very expensive. I want to move from here but I can't afford the rent anywhere else."\u000a\u000aSome, like Okothendo, echo the sentiment that Odinga has been denied power because of cheating: "For the first time since I started voting, we got the justice," he said, referring to the court ruling..\u000a\u000a"In Kenya, people have been saying he (Odinga) is always complaining of stolen elections. The reality was that elections in Kenya had always been stolen."\u000a\u000aSome also see Odinga as a persecuted political figure in the mold of former South African President Nelson Mandela. Odinga has been imprisoned and had his wife and children targeted, and is Kenya's longest serving detainee.\u000a\u000aPeace ambassador Anyango said: "We support him because he's the hope of so many Kenyans. We love his forgiving spirit and he brings everyone together.\u000a\u000a"We want positive politics and he's the person that can unite this country."

aVBOULDER, Colo. (CBS4) \u2013 Researchers at the University of Colorado have developed a new way to cover more ground with fewer resources \u2014 swarming drones.\u000a\u000aThe technology allows for a single operator to control a number of drones at the same time. It could be used for many scenarios, including searching for lost hikers.\u000a\u000aThe team from CU spent three weeks in the Pawnee National Grasslands testing the technology after their program testing plan was approved by the FAA.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe idea is to make technology that allows drones, or unmanned aircraft as we call them, to work together,\u201d said Associate Professor Eric Frew.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we were doing recently is flying some of the technology to show how three drones could work together to find \u2014 in this case \u2014 a lost radio beacon.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe idea is intriguing for people like Grand County Search and Rescue spokesman Chris Ziegler.\u000a\u000a\u201cManpower and time. I usually don\u2019t have much of either one. And the use of drones, to run 30 drones at once with a central monitoring station? Quite impressive,\u201d Ziegler said.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, searchers used a drone to find missing hikers in the Pike National Forest.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you think safety \u2014 that I can put a drone into a position instead of a teammate? Yeah, we\u2019d be all about that,\u201d said Ziegler.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no timetable so far for when rescue crews in Colorado might be able to use the technology.

aV(CNN) When Phil Southerland was 7 months old, he had symptoms of the flu, was urinating frequently and had an unquenchable thirst.\u000a\u000a"My mom took me to one doctor who said, 'Your kid has got the flu. Come back in one week,'" he said.\u000a\u000aWithin days, Southerland's weight plummeted. His mom rushed him to the hospital.\u000a\u000a"They said, 'Ma'am, we've got good news, and we've got bad news. The good news is your son's gonna live for now. The bad news is, he's got diabetes. He's got to take shots of insulin, and most likely he'll be dead by 25. If not, he'll either be blind or have renal failure,'" he said.\u000a\u000aRacing uphill\u000a\u000aAs he grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, Southerland was determined not to let this death sentence stop him. At 6, he was already managing his Type 1 diabetes on his own.\u000a\u000a"For me, it was all I ever knew. I knew I had to breathe, I knew I had to eat and I knew I had to check my blood sugar and give myself insulin shots."\u000a\u000aHis parents stored only healthy food in the house to keep him from making bad choices. But at 12, Southerland disobeyed the rules and ate a candy bar. That decision would change his life.\u000a\u000a"I figured OK, I don't want to wait two hours for my insulin to kick in. I do want to eat these candy bars. How can I do it?" he recalled.\u000a\u000aSo he hopped on his bike and rode through the neighborhood until his legs got tired.\u000a\u000a"That was my journey to start riding," he said. "The bike for me was freedom."\u000a\u000aThe more he exercised, the less insulin he needed, and the easier it was to manage the disease.\u000a\u000a"The bike gave me the discipline and motivation I needed to control my diabetes," he added.\u000a\u000aSoutherland started competing and won a lot of cycling races. In college, he got the idea to start a nonprofit called Team Type 1 Foundation , based in Atlanta, to empower other athletes with the disease.\u000a\u000aThe first sporting goal of the organization was to have a team of athletes compete in the Race Across America, a 3,000-mile bike trek through 12 states.\u000a\u000aSoutherland leads his first all-diabetic cycling team for Team Type 1.\u000a\u000a"We lost the race by three minutes," Southerland said. "So we came back the next year a little smarter in how we manage diabetes, a little more experienced in the race, and we set a world record of 5 days, 15 hours and 43 minutes."\u000a\u000aTo ensure safety, the organization provides a medical team to support riders during a race. Cyclists undergo a stringent testing regime in the three hours leading up to a race. They also use continuous glucose monitoring, which will sound an alarm if their levels get too high or too low.\u000a\u000aCheating death\u000a\u000aIn 2008, Southerland created a professional team of diabetic cyclists.\u000a\u000a"I was supposed to be dead when we started Team Type 1 as a professional cycling team," he said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aBut he was far from it. Southerland competed as a professional cyclist for two years until some injuries took him out of the sport.\u000a\u000aNow 35, Southerland's goal is to field the first all-diabetic team in the Tour de France by 2021.\u000a\u000a"I believe sport can be the unifying point for people with diabetes," he said.\u000a\u000aSoutherland's other passion is helping diabetic kids in Rwanda get much-needed medical supplies.\u000a\u000a"I nearly put our company out of business in 2010 ... because I bought 400 blood glucose monitors, and I took about 40,000 test strips in bike boxes to the Tour of Rwanda," he said.\u000a\u000aSoutherland is dedicated to helping kids with diabetes in Rwanda.\u000a\u000a"We gave them out to the kids there. Their parents were all in tears because their kids have this tool, which is gonna help them live," he added. "It ripped my heart out."\u000a\u000aEvery year since then, the organization has continued to send supplies to Rwanda.\u000a\u000a"I want every kid with diabetes to know that they are the hero. Every person with diabetes to know that their dreams can come true."

aVSydney, Australia (CNN) A monument to a British explorer that's stood in Sydney's Hyde Park for 138 years is at the center of a debate that's becoming louder and more divisive about how the country remembers its past.\u000a\u000aJust one week after a vandal scrawled the words "no pride in genocide" and "change the date" on the statue of Captain James Cook in late August, a far-right group marched through the park to condemn the act.\u000a\u000a"I take the vandalism as a personal attack on me and Australia's colonial heritage," Party for Freedom Chairman Nick Folkes told CNN.\u000a\u000aThe Party for Freedom opposes immigration and multiculturalism and its website appropriates the campaign slogan of US President Trump's to urge Australians to "Make Australia Great Again."\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, members of the party stormed a council meeting in Yarra, Melbourne, waving flags and shouting "shame" and "nationalism is healthy, nationalism is good."\u000a\u000aYarra was targeted because it's one of two councils which have voted not to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day, January 26, out of respect for the Indigenous community.\u000a\u000aAustralia Day is celebrated with a national holiday on January 26 each year, typically with barbecues and Australian flags.\u000a\u000aIt marks the day when, in 1788, the Union Jack was hoisted at Sydney Cove to establish a British penal colony. However, since as early as 1938, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have opposed honoring a day they call Invasion Day or Survival Day.\u000a\u000aCalls to change the date of Australia's national holiday are not new, but the vandalism of Captain Cook's statue has renewed the debate about the day and how the country remembers its colonial past.\u000a\u000aThousands of protesters marched through Melbourne on January 26, 2017, proclaiming the day "Invasion Day."\u000a\u000aAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull denounced the vandalism on a statement on his Facebook page that likened it to Stalinism. He said it was "part of a deeply disturbing and totalitarian campaign to not just challenge our history but to deny it and obliterate it."\u000a\u000aIndependent curator and historian Nicola Teffer disagrees.\u000a\u000a"History is always under review," she told CNN.\u000a\u000a"The recent statue de-facings are a protest about who, and what, has been left out of our history, not an erasure of that history."\u000a\u000aChildren display an Australian flag at Bathers Beach on Australia Day, 2017.\u000a\u000aA controversial plaque\u000a\u000aThe current furor over Captain Cook's statue is as much about the man as the plaque's inscription.\u000a\u000aIt states the explorer "discovered this territory," which prominent indigenous journalist Stan Grant described in a recent article as a "damaging myth."\u000a\u000aCaptain Cook's statue in Hyde Park is etched with the words "discovered this country 1770."\u000a\u000a"Today the idea of discovery, the doctrine of terra nullius -- empty land -- that underpinned the British claim on this land and extinguished the rights of indigenous people no longer stands," he told CNN.\u000a\u000a"It's been repudiated by our high court. The law is not trapped in an era of racial discrimination, nor should history be."\u000a\u000aHowever the prime minister says the context of Captain Cook's "discovery" was obvious to him "when as a schoolboy I first read the inscription."\u000a\u000aConservative social and political commentator Andrew Bolt agrees, telling CNN: "(Captain Cook) discovered (Australia) in the way most adults reading the inscription would understand it: (he) discovered something unknown to the wider world, which in turn had not been discovered by Aborigines."\u000a\u000a'We are not the United States'\u000a\u000aGrant said it was the recent tearing down of Confederate leader statues in the United States that prompted him to reflect on his own country's monuments.\u000a\u000aHowever, he isn't calling for the statues or plaques to be removed. He welcomes "creative suggestions for new statues and plaques that would enlarge the idea of who we are as a nation."\u000a\u000aHe also isn't concerned that Australia is about to witness the deadly riots seen in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000a"Let's be clear -- that act of vandalism was disgraceful and unacceptable. But we are not the United States. The issue of confederate statues and the legacy of the civil war is not specifically analogous to the Australian experience. We do however have our own history of racism that we confront in our own way."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 'My people die young in this country' speech goes viral Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'My people die young in this country' speech goes viral 08:34\u000a\u000aHis views about the statue are echoed by Professor Mick Dodson, a prominent indigenous rights activist and the Director of the National Center for Indigenous Studies at Australian National University.\u000a\u000a"The word 'discovery' in the colonial sense is such a hugely arrogant use of the language," he told CNN.\u000a\u000a"You plant a flag on someone else's country and somehow it becomes yours? But I don't mind the plaque being there -- it reminds us that the job of dealing with unfinished business hasn't been done."\u000a\u000aA City of Sydney spokesperson told CNN that while concerns about the statues have been referred to the council's Indigenous Advisory Panel, there are no plans to remove the monuments.\u000a\u000a"In other cities such as Melbourne and Perth, additional plaques have been added to historical statues to give context to the original wording or to balance history," the spokesperson said.\u000a\u000aIn other parts of Australia, there seems a growing willingness to revisit aspects of history that have become unpalatable. Last week the Queensland Government announced it will change the names of 10 locations with racially insensitive names\u000a\u000aCalls to 'change the date'\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, the government stripped two local councils -- Yarra and Darebin -- of their powers to hold citizenship ceremonies after they voted not to hold them on January 26. There are murmurs that other councils want to hold their own votes.\u000a\u000aCitizenship ceremonies are the final step in the process of becoming a naturalized Australian citizen -- and typically see participants make a formal public pledge to uphold the values of Australia.\u000a\u000a#Yarra Council has tonight voted unanimously to change the way it marks January 26, from 2018 onwards: https://t.co/6Hw2nyE9U4 \u2014 Yarra Council (@YarraCouncil) August 15, 2017\u000a\u000a"I think it's an over-reaction," said Professor Dodson of the government.\u000a\u000a"They are backing themselves into a corner because they're not even prepared to have a debate about it. What is the government afraid of? Obviously the two councils concerned have had a discussion and have come to a conclusion."\u000a\u000aYarra Council said it had commissioned an independent survey of 300 non-Indigenous people in the area which showed almost 79% supported a smaller, culturally-sensitive event.\u000a\u000a"The overwhelming sentiment from our Aboriginal community is that January 26 is a date of sadness, trauma and distress. They have told us that this is not a day of celebration, but a day of mourning," said Mayor Amanda Stone.\u000a\u000aDarebin Mayor Kim Le Cerf said she was disappointed in the government's decision to revoke its right to hold ceremonies but said the council would continue to support the "change the date" campaign.\u000a\u000a"It's ironic that the Prime Minister has said changing the date is a national debate we need to have, yet his Government appears to be working to silence it by punishing councils for taking a stand in support of their Indigenous communities," Le Cerf said.\u000a\u000aBolt maintains the overall level of angst over Australia Day isn't high.\u000a\u000a"Most Australians are not getting worked up at all. Some activists are, claiming that January 26 is distressing in reminding them of the arrival of the First Fleet, which they claim was the start of an alleged genocide, rather than of Western civilization."\u000a\u000aHe cited a McNair yellowSquares poll conducted in January that found just 15% of the 1,156 respondents support changing the date.\u000a\u000a"Most seem the kind of people who will not accept a democratic decision," Bolt said.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Australian Greens party, which unlike both major parties supports the #ChangeTheDate movement, believes momentum is building.\u000a\u000a"As more and more people become aware of the distress the current date causes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the more people will support the concept of change," said Senator Rachel Siewert, the party's spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues.\u000a\u000aDebate for another time?\u000a\u000aAdvocates of changing the date have proposed a variety of alternatives and point out that the tradition of Australia Day isn't a longstanding one. It wasn't until 1935 that every Australian state and territory adopted the term "Australia Day."\u000a\u000a"January 26 was a proclamation of the penal colony of New South Wales, which doesn't include half the country," said Professor Dodson.\u000a\u000a"Parts of the Northern Territory, parts of South Australia and all of Western Australia -- where I come from -- weren't included in it. And anyway, there were people here for tens of thousands of years."\u000a\u000aProfessor Dodson suggests the best way forward for Australia Day is to wipe the slate clean.\u000a\u000a"I think we should wait until the day we choose to become a republic," he said.

aVPrevention of these and other adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) should be society's primary goal. However, these experiences continue to be pervasive and are often left unresolved for adult survivors.\u000a\u000aThe time has come for all systems engaged with the care of children to tackle this problem head-on. By building children's resilience early in their lives, we can better prepare them to handle past and future trauma and grow into healthy adults.\u000a\u000aHealthy attachment starts early in life\u000a\u000aFor children, building resilience means learning skills that can increase their ability to manage and regulate their emotions and response to stress.\u000a\u000aOne key way to build resilience is to strengthen families. This can include teaching caregivers about child development, providing concrete help in times of need and bolstering their abilities to manage stress and develop positive social connections.\u000a\u000aThese are just some of the ways to provide a safe and supportive environment where children can develop a strong bond with their caregivers. Research shows that healthy, securely attached children are less likely to show separation anxiety. Meanwhile, insecurely attached children tend to be avoidant and struggle to express negative feelings.\u000a\u000aThe quality of caregiver-child attachment can be affected by everything from facial expressions to the type of touch caregivers provide.\u000a\u000aDeveloping healthy attachment early in life helps children learn to better self-regulate (PDF). These children will display an ability to express their feelings openly and exhibit less fear and avoidance of the parent. In addition, adults' attachment style with their own children is highly influenced by the quality of the relationship they once had with their caregivers.\u000a\u000aACEs disrupt the development of healthy caregiver-child attachment. For example, parents with depression or substance use problems may be unavailable to care for their children and provide the support they need. In fact, in a recent study, ACEs were found to be associated with unresolved attachment style in adulthood. These early life events can increase the risk of substance use, which is often used as a coping mechanism.\u000a\u000aHelping children cope\u000a\u000aThe home is not the only place where children can experience trauma. Trauma can be experienced in multiple ways and contexts -- from problems at school to natural disasters that hit the community.\u000a\u000aFor example, when teachers observe a child having behavioral difficulties, they must be prepared to respond in a calm and nonreactive manner. Adults must be aware of their own stresses and triggers in order to avoid potentially retraumatizing the children they care for. Children need to be reassured they are in a safe, supportive and caring environment.\u000a\u000aAdults can help children physiologically relax by providing sensory inputs that calm the stress response. For example, listening to sounds that are calming, breathing deeply and taking a walk can help individuals bring the nervous system back to a balanced state. Yoga, creative arts and journaling can also help children relax and process negative emotions.\u000a\u000aIncreasing awareness\u000a\u000aOnce a traumatic event occurs, it cannot be undone. But early intervention can help children recover quickly and more successfully. Therefore, the better informed we are about the signs and symptoms of trauma, the better we will be able to recognize them.\u000a\u000aTrauma-informed care (PDF) takes adverse experiences into account. This approach emphasizes safety and encourages empowerment throughout the recovery process. Ultimately, it's about changing the culture of how we work with children and adults.\u000a\u000aTo fully embrace trauma-informed care, we must first build awareness that childhood stress and trauma is widespread across the population. Second, anyone who works with child or adult survivors must learn to recognize the symptoms of trauma and stress. Some of these include (PDF) anxiety, depression, problems with emotional regulation, hyperactivity, substance abuse and eating disorders.\u000a\u000aCurrently, there is controversy in the public health and medical community over whether we should ever assess for ACEs in adults and children. Some worry that asking about childhood experiences may open Pandora's box. "What do we do when we find out about trauma?" This is a natural response for individuals working in systems that do not have knowledge, skills or experiences about evidence-based approaches to trauma healing and recovery.\u000a\u000aHowever, if we want to provide trauma-informed care, we need assessments (PDF) to have a better understanding of the population overall for treatment and recovery. Assessment should only be conducted if there are appropriate programs and treatments to refer individuals or families.\u000a\u000aWhile more institutions, such as schools, are now starting to assess childhood trauma, we must be cautious in reading too much into what that trauma means. Assessment is not a means to diagnose, judge or label individuals. It is a tool that informs us about who we are working with and helps us foster understanding and compassion.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIf organizations want to provide trauma-informed care, they will need commitment from leadership and staff to change their organization's culture. This means implementing policies that focus on safe, supportive and collaborative environments. It means accepting that our society has experienced historical, cultural and gender-related trauma. There must be recognition by everyone that we all come from different backgrounds and experiences, which make us who we are.\u000a\u000aAll of this may be difficult to embrace. But we must equip our children -- the future of society -- with the skills for their physiological and psychological resilience so that they can lead healthy, productive lives.

aVParis (CNN) Photographs of Britain's Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing topless on vacation in 2012 were an invasion of privacy, a French court ruled on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe court in Nanterre, in the western suburbs of Paris, awarded 100,000 euros in damages to the duchess and her husband, Prince William.

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 31st August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 If there's one destination on every Hong Kong itinerary, it's likely Victoria Peak.\u000a\u000aThe highest point on Hong Kong Island at 1,811 feet tall, this historic mountain provides 360-degree views of the city's impenetrable skyline. But " The Peak " has much more to offer than just Instagrammable scenes.\u000a\u000aFrom gorgeous hiking trails to heritage restaurants, here's how to make the most of this famous summit on your next trip to Hong Kong:\u000a\u000aA little history\u000a\u000aThe Hong Kong skyline from the Peak.\u000a\u000aDuring Hong Kong's stint as a British colony, from 1841 to 1997, The Peak was the city's most exclusive neighborhood. Quite literally. Until 1947, the neighborhood was reserved for European expatriates -- meaning Hong Kong Chinese citizens could not live in the area.\u000a\u000aThere were no roads during the 19th century, so the well-heeled residents would be carried up the mountain in sedan chairs.\u000a\u000aToday, The Peak still has a reputation as the city's most elite neighborhood. This is where the city's tycoons rest their heads in glamorous mansions, which fetch millions of US dollars on the real estate market.\u000a\u000aRiding the tram\u000a\u000aHong Kong's famous Peak Tram.\u000a\u000aOpened in 1888, the bright red Peak Tram is among the world's oldest funiculars -- and easily the best known in Asia.On a clear day, the steep route to the top can be pleasant, however it's best to plan ahead.\u000a\u000aThe line at the entrance (the Garden Road Peak Tram Lower Terminus) is known to wrap around the corner, offering no shade on hot days. If you're set on taking the ride, we recommend getting there early -- before 10 a.m.\u000a\u000aLine too long? A taxi ride rewards with excellent views as it winds around the mountainside.\u000a\u000aFor history lovers, there's an appropriately named Peak Tram Historical Gallery near the lower terminus. The free exhibitions chronicle the funicular's journey from the 19th century onward.\u000a\u000aPeak Tram Historical Gallery , Peak Tram Lower Terminus, 33 Garden Rd, Central, Hong Kong; +852 2849 7654\u000a\u000aLookout points\u000a\u000aThe Peak is home to several different lookout points -- some paid and some free. There's the Sky Terrace 428, atop The Peak Tower , which claims to be the highest viewing platform in Hong Kong. Entry here costs roughly $6.50.\u000a\u000aBut you can experience similar views from the top of the Peak Galleria (yes, there is a giant mall atop the mountain) without paying a cent. By following the escalators up to the rooftop, visitors can admire both the city and the southern side of Hong Kong Island.\u000a\u000aBeautiful hikes\u000a\u000aInstead of taking the tram up the mountain, walk up the scenic Morning Trail, which starts at Hatton Road. Stumped by the mega mall on top, most travelers tend to think The Peak is nothing but a tacky commercial zone. But if they keep strolling, visitors will find the natural scenery they came for.\u000a\u000aThe Circle Walk is the easiest path to access as it loops around the Peak's commercial area.\u000a\u000aThe pathway weaves under the thick vines of banyan trees and passes by a few waterfalls for good measure, but the view is the best part -- Hong Kong's harbor and skyscrapers take center stage.\u000a\u000aA few hundred feet uphill, Victoria Peak Garden is hidden away from the crowds on the site of a former governor's summer home. It can be reached via a stone stairwell off Mount Austin Road (right across from the Mount Austin Playground). At the top of the stairs and through the trees, a lush green space opens into a secret garden.\u000a\u000aA little dining\u000a\u000aThe Peak isn't known as an epicenter of culinary creativity, but there are a few spots worth a stop if all the walking has worked up an appetite.\u000a\u000aThe Peak Lookout Restaurant has the most history. This eatery was first built in 1901, when it began life as a stable for the sedan chairs. It opened in 1947 as the Peak Cafe, which later evolved into the Peak Lookout\u000a\u000aToday, the restaurant is home to a spacious outdoor terrace with views of Hong Kong's south side, inviting wood interiors, historic photos and an international menu that skips from oysters to quesadillas.\u000a\u000aThe Peak Lookout built inside a renovated Grade II historic building.\u000a\u000aFor something quick, Wildfire Pizzabar & Grill serves up excellent city views and decent pizza, as well as seafood risotto and grilled meats.\u000a\u000aTraditional Hong Kong cuisine can be found at Hong Kong Day (+852 2849 7855).\u000a\u000aModeled after a retro " cha chaan teng " diner -- which became popular in the 1950s -- this restaurant serves quintessential treats, such as Hong Kong milk tea, salted lemon Sprite and Hong Kong French toast (two fried slices of buttery bread, a layer of peanut butter in the middle and golden syrup on top).\u000a\u000aWith faux heritage interiors, Lú F\u0113ng also channels old-world Hong Kong. The all-day dim sum restaurant is among the better choices in the area.\u000a\u000aWax on\u000a\u000aMadame Tussauds is, of course, not for every traveler. But if you get caught in the rain (which is known to happen in this subtropical city), you're traveling with children, or happen to be a sucker for celebrity encounters -- the option is there.\u000a\u000aInside, visitors will find more than 100 eerily realistic waxen personalities, from Brad Pitt to Barack Obama, alongside dozens of Cantonese stars, such as Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.

aV(CNN) China is no stranger to contemporary architecture that boggles the mind or appears to side-step common sense, from an LED-lit horseshoe in Huzhou to a glowing teapot in Wuxi. But in 2016, China's State Council released guidelines forbidding the construction of "bizarre" and "odd-shaped" buildings lacking character or cultural heritage, shifting their focus to the "economic, green and beautiful."\u000a\u000aNewly unveiled plans for Liuzhou Forest City, designed by the Italian firm Stefano Boeri Architetti to be built in southern China, certainly seem to fit the bill. The 342-acre, self-contained neighborhood will comprise more than 70 buildings -- including homes, hospitals, hotels, schools and offices -- all of which will be covered with 40,000 trees and almost a million plants. Eventually, up to 30,000 people could call the Forest City home.\u000a\u000a"(This is) the first experiment of the urban environment that's really trying to find a balance with nature," firm principal Stefano Boeri said on the phone from Milan.\u000a\u000aThe plant life is expected to absorb almost 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide and 57 tons of pollutants per year, and produce 900 tons of oxygen a year, while also decreasing the air temperature and providing a new habitat for displaced wildlife. Solar panels on the roofs will collect renewable energy to power the buildings, while geothermal energy will power air-conditioning, adding to the project's green appeal.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVStephanie Coontz is director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families , which is hosted by the University of Texas at Austin. She is the author, most recently, of The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap . The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In 1973, when President Richard Nixon proclaimed August 26 Women's Equality Day -- commemorating the day in 1920 that women won the right to vote -- a woman could still be denied housing by a real estate broker or credit by a bank, simply because of her gender.\u000a\u000aEmployers could fire a woman who became pregnant. Many states had "head and master" laws giving husbands final authority in the family, and in no state was marital rape a crime. As late as 1977, two-thirds of all Americans still believed that men should earn the money and women should take care of the home.\u000a\u000aSo it was something of an understatement when Nixon noted that "much remains to be done" to attain "full and equal participation of women" in society. Indeed, the events of the last year and a half -- from the "Access Hollywood" video in which the man who is now president uses vulgar words about women's genitals, to challenges to women's reproductive rights, to the routine, vicious online attacks on women by what sometimes seems to be an army of trolls -- suggest that, 44 years later, much still remains to be done.\u000a\u000aBut a review of the changes in gender relationships since the 1970s suggests good reason for confidence in our ability to move forward, though certainly not for us to become complacent.\u000a\u000aToday the blatant discrimination described above, for example, is illegal, and Americans overwhelmingly support, at least in principle, the ideal of gender equality. In one recent survey, 93% of adults said women should have equal rights.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Condoleezza Rice on women's rights in the U.S Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Condoleezza Rice on women's rights in the U.S 02:24\u000a\u000aBut the very popularity of the ideal of gender equality, combined with the fact that inequalities are now perpetuated in more subtle ways than in the past, has led some people to conclude that there is nothing more to strive for. The same poll above found that fully 20% of respondents believed gender equality has already been achieved and no more work is needed.\u000a\u000aThis view ignores the minority of Americans who deeply resent the women's movement, falsely claiming that women's gains have come at men's expense. And it overlooks some serious recent setbacks for women.\u000a\u000aStill, it's worth emphasizing the good news\u000a\u000aSome of the most dramatic improvements for women have been in personal relationships. Rates of i ntimate partner violence have fallen steadily since the early 1970s, a decline that has accelerated since the early 1990s. Rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment are still too widespread, but women have new options to expose the perpetrators and fight for justice.\u000a\u000aMarriages are more equal. In the 1970s, a woman with more years of formal education or higher earnings than her husband faced an increased chance of divorce. Today, the extra divorce risk associated with women's higher achievements has disappeared.\u000a\u000aFathers have doubled the time they spend interacting with their children, and tripled the routine physical care, such as changing diapers, that many men used to shun. That carries a bonus for both sexes: Couples who share housework and childcare equally now report the highest levels of marital and sexual satisfaction.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Paul Ryan opposes mandating paid leave Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Paul Ryan opposes mandating paid leave 01:29\u000a\u000aMore remains to be done\u000a\u000aIvanka Trump has proposed a paid parental leave policy, but it is nowhere near as comprehensive as the work-family policies that are standard in most advanced nations and include flex time, universal health care, and affordable, quality child care. In the absence of such support systems, it's no accident that American parents report much lower happiness compared with non-parents than in any other of 22 countries recently studied.\u000a\u000aSimilar limits exist to the very impressive gains American women have made in education and earnings. In 1973, women earned just 57 cents for every dollar earned by men -- a gap of 46 cents. By 2015, the gap had fallen to 17 cents -- even lower for childless women , who earn 96 cents for every man's dollar.\u000a\u000aNot yet equal\u000a\u000aIndeed, women have "caught up" in their earnings largely because of their high rates of college completion, which allow them to pull ahead of less-educated men and women. But they still lag behind men with the same education.\u000a\u000aToday, according to sociologist Philip Cohen , the average female with a BA makes much more than a male high school graduate, but 28% less than the average man with a BA.\u000a\u000aThis reversal is confusing to many men who grew up seeing their low- or middle-earning fathers making more money than almost any woman. As a result, some men blame their economic plight on the increase in gender equality rather than on the real culprit -- t he acceleration of wage inequalit y.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Is there pay inequality in sports?

MUST WATCH Is there pay inequality in sports? 03:35\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, although women on the higher rungs of the pay ladder are doing much better than middle and low wage-earners of both sexes, they actually face a wider gender wage gap in comparison to their male counterparts than in the past. In consequence, some high-powered women focus on the glass ceiling rather than the sinking floor that holds back so many men and women alike.\u000a\u000aRacial disparities add more complexities to the gender equality picture. Despite the rise of an affluent African-American and Hispanic middle class, minorities continue to fare worse than their white counterparts, even as white low wage workers also lose ground.\u000a\u000aBetween 1980 and 2015, white women narrowed the gap in hourly wages with white men by 22 cents, but black and Hispanic women narrowed the gap with white men by only 9 and 5 cents respectively.\u000a\u000aAnd the wage gap between white men and black and Hispanic men didn't budge at all.\u000a\u000aNixon called it\u000a\u000aThere's no question that women's lives and options are better than when Women's Equality Day was first proclaimed. But progress has been slow on the earnings equality front, and there have been some recent big setbacks in politics and culture.\u000a\u000aIn 1964, two former presidents, Dwight Eisenhower and Harry Truman, were proud to co-chair a fund-raising committee for Planned Parenthood. Today, the very existence of Planned Parenthood is under attack. And even though two-thirds of voting age adults support wide access to reproductive health care and pregnancy prevention, the Trump administration plans to defund a national teen pregnancy prevention program, returning to abstinence-only sex education.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED The fight for paid family leave Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The fight for paid family leave 02:46\u000a\u000aIn 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that the right to privacy included a woman's right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. Yet over the last six years, states have passed 369 laws aimed at restricting women's access to abortion.\u000a\u000aThe new administration has seemed singularly uninterested in recruiting and promoting women, and it r ecently repealed the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order, scrapping two rules that are essential protections for women workers.\u000a\u000aThe Fair Pay order required wage transparency, so people can actually see if they are being paid less for the same job than a colleague. The Safe Workplaces order prohibited forced arbitration for sexual-harassment cases, which often protect perpetrators by keeping proceedings out of the public eye.\u000a\u000aAnd our President has used "the bully pulpit" more to encourage than to stop bullying. On top of this comes the surfacing of a newly-invigorated white supremacy movement, which is also a male supremacy movement that claims the "only real duty" of a white woman is to reproduce, while black and Hispanic women should be discouraged from doing so.\u000a\u000aThe good news here is that this retrograde movement is small and, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll, most Americans (64%) realize it poses a threat to the US. Unfortunately, more than a third (34%) believe it does not -- representing yet another way in which it is abundantly clear that, as Nixon said, much remains to be done for women's equality.

By following the escalators up to the rooftop, visitors can admire both the city and the southern side of Hong Kong Island.\u000a\u000aBeautiful hikes\u000a\u000aInstead of taking the tram up the mountain, walk up the scenic Morning Trail, which starts at Hatton Road. Stumped by the mega mall on top, most travelers tend to think The Peak is nothing but a tacky commercial zone. But if they keep strolling, visitors will find the natural scenery they came for.\u000a\u000aThe Circle Walk is the easiest path to access as it loops around the Peak's commercial area.\u000a\u000aThe pathway weaves under the thick vines of banyan trees and passes by a few waterfalls for good measure, but the view is the best part -- Hong Kong's harbor and skyscrapers take center stage.\u000a\u000aA few hundred feet uphill, Victoria Peak Garden is hidden away from the crowds on the site of a former governor's summer home. It can be reached via a stone stairwell off Mount Austin Road (right across from the Mount Austin Playground). At the top of the stairs and through the trees, a lush green space opens into a secret garden.\u000a\u000aA little dining\u000a\u000aThe Peak isn't known as an epicenter of culinary creativity, but there are a few spots worth a stop if all the walking has worked up an appetite.\u000a\u000aThe Peak Lookout Restaurant has the most history. This eatery was first built in 1901, when it began life as a stable for the sedan chairs. It opened in 1947 as the Peak Cafe, which later evolved into the Peak Lookout\u000a\u000aToday, the restaurant is home to a spacious outdoor terrace with views of Hong Kong's south side, inviting wood interiors, historic photos and an international menu that skips from oysters to quesadillas.\u000a\u000aThe Peak Lookout built inside a renovated Grade II historic building.\u000a\u000aFor something quick, Wildfire Pizzabar & Grill serves up excellent city views and decent pizza, as well as seafood risotto and grilled meats.\u000a\u000aTraditional Hong Kong cuisine can be found at Hong Kong Day (+852 2849 7855).\u000a\u000aModeled after a retro " cha chaan teng " diner -- which became popular in the 1950s -- this restaurant serves quintessential treats, such as Hong Kong milk tea, salted lemon Sprite and Hong Kong French toast (two fried slices of buttery bread, a layer of peanut butter in the middle and golden syrup on top).\u000a\u000aWith faux heritage interiors, Lú F\u0113ng also channels old-world Hong Kong. The all-day dim sum restaurant is among the better choices in the area.\u000a\u000aWax on\u000a\u000aMadame Tussauds is, of course, not for every traveler. But if you get caught in the rain (which is known to happen in this subtropical city), you're traveling with children, or happen to be a sucker for celebrity encounters -- the option is there.\u000a\u000aInside, visitors will find more than 100 eerily realistic waxen personalities, from Brad Pitt to Barack Obama, alongside dozens of Cantonese stars, such as Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.

aVJoseph Sakran is a trauma surgeon and director of emergency general surgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Follow him @JosephSakran . The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) A high school football game: a scene common in many of our memories. But for one young man, in his senior year, it was different. After watching a football game from the stands on a Friday night, a fight broke out as he was standing nearby. The sounds of gunfire punctured the night, and an errant bullet punctured his throat. As he lay on the ground with his blood pooling beneath him, veering toward losing consciousness, he could vaguely hear people shouting and sirens blaring.\u000a\u000aI am a trauma surgeon at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, a city struggling with more than 200 homicides this year so far -- on pace for the most annual murders in the city. But this is not a story about one of my patients. I was that 17-year-old with a hole in my throat and the fear of death in my mind. And it isn't just Baltimore's problem: over 30,000 people die from firearms annually. What are we going to do about it?\u000a\u000aEvery time I have to walk to the waiting room and speak with a family of a gunshot victim, I think of my own family and what must have been going through their minds at that time. By far the worst moment for me is when I see those faces of mothers and fathers anxiously waiting for an update on a loved one who has died. I approach them knowing the news I'm about to share with them will turn their world upside down. Often, I leave numb, with the image of their faces chiseled into my memory.\u000a\u000aToday, I am on a mission to help others impacted by gun violence. As a former patient, and a surgeon who continually witnesses firsthand the effects of gun violence on victims and their families, I have a great deal of experience to draw from.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, I attended a hearing about gun violence at the Baltimore City Council. The hearing was controversial because many citizens felt the bill would not reduce gun violence and simply lend to unconstitutional policing. The room was packed. On the table was a proposal that would create one-year mandatory minimum jail sentence for anyone found to be in possession of an illegal gun, throughout the majority of the city.\u000a\u000aBaltimore police commanders in white uniforms and suits, who have been working to curb the violence, sat on one side. Members of the public, including many activists fighting for fairness in a city beleaguered by a history of racial injustice, sat all around. A City Council realized the challenge that lay ahead that morning as they looked back at the scene of a divided room searching for answers.\u000a\u000aThe proposal comes after an era of legislators across the country repealing mandatory minimum sentences that many say unfairly filled our prisons with African-American men, often facing drug charges. At the same time, Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis believes that a major source of the epidemic of violence in the city is the light sentencing of people who've been arrested previously for carrying illegal guns but have returned to Baltimore streets, and taken their illegal guns with them.\u000a\u000aI was there neither to support nor to oppose the bill, but as a doctor, to discuss gun violence for what it is: the public health crisis that communities all across my great city and this nation face.\u000a\u000aAs the period for public testimony opened, City Councilman Eric Costello called me up to deliver my thoughts. It wasn't my first foray into a political arena. During this last presidential election, I created "Doctors for Hillary," a grass-roots organization of doctors and allied health professionals that backed the former secretary of state because she had made health issues -- including gun violence -- an integral part of her campaign platform.\u000a\u000aI was surprised when, as I approached the podium, an uproar rang out. People were yelling. The podium right in front of me was overturned. A crowd began shouting, "No Justice No Peace."\u000a\u000aI hadn't yet opened my mouth, and I was completely blindsided by how chaotic the situation quickly became. I heard people yelling about "this white Hopkins surgeon," that he is "not one of our people." My heart sank.\u000a\u000aThis reaction exemplifies what is wrong in our country today: We are not talking to each other. We're allowing assumptions based simply on appearance to prevent real dialogue -- the kind of dialogue that can solve problems. The kind of dialogue that, based on what I have seen as a trauma surgeon, I know can save lives.\u000a\u000aHow could they know based on my skin color that I am the son of immigrant parents? How could they know I bear the physical scars of bullets? How can we know anything about each other if we don't give each other a chance? A chance to speak, a chance to be heard, a chance to learn, a chance to compromise -- a chance to make ourselves and our communities better.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aI stood before the Baltimore City Council to be part of the conversation, and even though unfortunately, certain actions precluded this conversation, I won't stop trying. As a surgeon, I strongly believe this conversation has to be centered on our nation's health -- not race, not politics, not money -- simply health. At the end of the day, we all bleed red. I'm still here at the table ready to talk, and eager to listen. What about you?

aVA new Senate bill to repeal Obamacare would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 than under current law, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe Republicans' latest attempt to fulfill their years-long pledge would effectively repeal Obamacare in 2020, giving lawmakers until then to come up with a replacement plan.\u000a\u000aThe ramifications of not replacing the law immediately would be severe. Three-quarters of the nation would live in areas with no insurers participating in the individual market by 2026 -- leaving many without an option if they do not have employer-provided or government health insurance, such as Medicare or Medicaid.\u000a\u000aAlso, premiums would about double by 2026, compared to current law, the CBO found.\u000a\u000aIt's unlikely GOP lawmakers will approve this bill, though these frightening figures will make it even harder for them to proceed down this path. House Republican leaders cast aside an attempt to swiftly and simply repeal Obamacare earlier this year after encountering stiff opposition from fellow lawmakers and others, who said it was critical to come up with a replacement bill at the same time.\u000a\u000aThe idea unexpectedly resurfaced earlier this week after Republicans' effort to repeal and replace Obamacare ran aground in the Senate on Monday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would call a vote on a repeal bill modeled on 2015 legislation that was passed by both chambers before being vetoed by then-President Obama.\u000a\u000aThis bill, unveiled Wednesday afternoon, is meant to be a wake-up call for Republican senators, to serve as a reminder that most of them voted for it just two years ago. McConnell is essentially daring Republicans to reverse their vote and support the status quo they've been campaigning against for seven years.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump to GOP senators: 'Inaction is not an option'\u000a\u000aThe CBO score could also pressure Republicans to consider going back to the negotiating table to find a path forward on their more comprehensive health care bill, which would leave 22 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade. That is what President Trump asked them to do on Wednesday during their lunch at the White House, though earlier in the week he called for lawmakers to repeal the Obamacare now and replace it later.\u000a\u000aThe administration pushed back on the report.\u000a\u000a"We continue to believe that CBO's methodology is flawed, and this score fails to take into account the president's full plan, which includes a replacement for Obamacare and administrative actions to reduce costs and expand access to quality, affordable care," a White House official said.\u000a\u000aHere's what the new bill would do:\u000a\u000a-- Get rid of the individual and employer mandates, two of the least favorite provisions of the law, by reducing the penalty to $0. This provision would be retroactive to 2016.\u000a\u000a-- Effectively end Obamacare in 2020 by eliminating the federal subsidies that help people afford individual coverage.\u000a\u000a-- Eliminate Medicaid expansion starting in 2020.\u000a\u000a-- Repeal taxes on the wealthy, health insurers, medical device makers and others.\u000a\u000a-- Defund Planned Parenthood for one year.\u000a\u000a-- Increase funding for substance abuse and mental health needs by $1.5 billion over two years.\u000a\u000aEnacting the legislation would decrease deficits by $473 billion over the next decade, however this doesn't take into account the cost of a replacement plan.\u000a\u000aRelated: Will Obamacare really fail?\u000a\u000aIn some important ways, however, this bill repeals less of Obamacare than the legislation that passed the House and the version that was under consideration in the Senate until this week. It doesn't touch Obamacare's insurance provisions, including the immensely popular protections for those with pre-existing conditions. That will make it more likely to comply with Senate rules that will allow it to be passed with a simple majority.\u000a\u000aAlso, it would not curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program as the House and Senate health care bills would have.\u000a\u000aStill, repealing Obamacare without replacing it would throw the individual market into chaos, prompting insurers to start exiting swiftly. Lawmakers wouldn't have a lot of time to come up with a replacement, said Cynthia Cox, associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u000a\u000aInsurers are mid-negotiation for participating next year. Repeal without a replacement will destabilize the market in 2018. \u2014 Cynthia Cox (@cynthiaccox) July 19, 2017\u000a\u000aSome 17 million fewer people would be insured next year, leaving only an estimated 84% of Americans covered, compared to 90% under current law, the CBO found. Premiums would be roughly 25% higher mainly because many younger and healthier people would drop their coverage since they would no longer be penalized for being uninsured.\u000a\u000aBy 2026, a total of some 59 million people would lack coverage under this bill, compared to 28 million under current law, the agency estimated.\u000a\u000aCNN's Lauren Fox and Dan Merica contributed to this report.

aV(CNN) Maegan Sheiman and her husband, Josh, just wanted to have a baby. But it was never going to be that simple.\u000a\u000aThe quest to grow their family has been a roller coaster ride of exciting ups and terrifying downs. "Every good thing that happened, something bad would happen," she said.\u000a\u000aBut with an amazing amount of love and care, their hope has a reason to thrive.\u000a\u000aDefying the odds\u000a\u000aSheiman, 33, has two rare diseases: medullary sponge kidney disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The kidney disease causes her body to create and pass a multitude of kidney stones. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare genetic disease that affects connective tissue and blood vessels.\u000a\u000aNeither was confirmed until she encountered complications during her first pregnancy in 2005, during a previous marriage. She gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Isabella, in 2006, but had a hysterectomy that year.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans searched for an egg donor as well as a surrogate in 2015, two years after getting married. They found a donor with a strong resemblance and similar background. They were also excited to locate a surrogate, LaToya, in their hometown of Humble, Texas. LaToya had had a healthy child of her own and was eager to help other families bring children into the world.\u000a\u000a"I anticipated whoever would be carrying our baby would end up being part of our family forever," Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aMaegan Sheiman with LaToya and her daughter while LaToya was pregnant with Beckham.\u000a\u000aSheiman and LaToya bonded quickly and easily. LaToya agreed to change to an all-organic diet and was happy to have Sheiman accompany her to every appointment. They texted every day.\u000a\u000aSheiman's daughter, Isabella, was hoping for a baby brother. She received her wish when a faint line showed up on LaToya's pregnancy test and the Sheimans threw a gender reveal party at the end of 2015. The baby was due on May 5, Cinco de Mayo. They joked that he was destined to be a party baby.\u000a\u000aBut Sheiman knew that something was wrong when she received a scared phone call from LaToya late one night, not long after Josh's birthday in January 2016. LaToya was being rushed to the hospital with bleeding.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans rushed to the hospital. Only one person was allowed into the cramped room in the maternity ward, so Maegan went in. LaToya was screaming, in excruciating pain.\u000a\u000a"I knew something bad was happening," Sheiman recalled. "I didn't think that he would be born alive."\u000a\u000aDoctors told her the baby was coming, and there wouldn't even be time to give LaToya medication.\u000a\u000aForty-five minutes later, on January 19, Beckham came into the world at 24 weeks gestation, weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces. The nurses rushed him into an incubator and kept him warm to ensure that he would survive. Doctors still aren't sure what caused the early birth.\u000a\u000a"I got a glimpse of him and have never seen anything so small in my life," Sheiman said. "I did not know that a human could be that small and look like a human. He had a strong heartbeat, and he came out kicking like crazy. I'll never forget it. It was ironic, because his name is Beckham," like the soccer star.\u000a\u000aBaby Beckham in the neonatal intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aSheiman was told that Beckham would be rushed to Texas Children's Hospital, an hour away through rush-hour traffic in Houston. That's when she realized her husband had been in the waiting room the entire time, unaware of what was happening.\u000a\u000aWhen he saw Beckham, he asked in shock, "Is that the baby?"\u000a\u000aNew normal at the NICU\u000a\u000aDr. Mona Khan, a neonatologist at Texas Children's, greeted the stunned Sheimans when they arrived. Beckham had been placed in an incubator and was connected through tubes and IVs to numerous machines and devices.\u000a\u000aKhan could tell how nervous they were. Together, they pulled stools together around Beckham's incubator and talked about what to expect. Sheiman had plenty of questions.\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans were told not to be too hopeful the first week, considered the "honeymoon phase" in which things can initially go well before going horribly wrong.\u000a\u000aA family advocacy group at the hospital gave Sheiman a notebook and told her to document everything. She wrote down every stat, every oxygen measurement, every discussion with every doctor and the trends tracking her son's improvements and declines. It helped her understand and feel in control of things.\u000a\u000aThe hospital staff impressed upon Sheiman how important her presence would be, not just to make critical decisions but to bond with a baby she couldn't even touch.\u000a\u000aA physical therapist holds Beckham in the NICU.\u000a\u000aShe was able to take time off from her consulting work as a project manager thanks to the generosity of her co-workers, who contributed their time off to carry her to August 1. This was vital for the family breadwinner.\u000a\u000a"We treat the family as part of the medical team," Khan said. "Every piece of information has to be discussed with them, and they have to feel that they are part of the decision-making process. We are all advocates for these babies, but they are their baby's strongest advocates."\u000a\u000aThe Sheimans moved into the Ronald McDonald House to be close to Beckham and see him every day for the first two months.\u000a\u000aBeckham was tiny, his head the size of a kiwi. An incubator monitored heat and humidity to keep his frail, bright pink, almost translucent skin from drying out. A bit of sticky fabric used with an instrument to detect oxygen ripped the skin off his foot.\u000a\u000aAnd then, a succession of issues arose: bowel perforation and surgery to repair it, a hernia, brain bleeds, heart defects and issues, a blood clot, a staph infection, pulmonary hypertension and even the threat of blindness. Those are just the big ones, Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aBeckham going into one of his many surgeries.\u000a\u000aKhan and the entire medical team became invested in taking care of Beckham. On nights when things looked bad, the attending physician would pull up a cot and sleep next to him. Even nurses who weren't assigned to him would ask Khan how he was doing each day.\u000a\u000a"You get really invested," Khan said. "This is your patient. You are taking care of them, and there is so much that is happening. Anytime there is a bad outcome, there is a slice of your soul that is taken away. With us, it's definitely emotional. Health care professionals, respiratory therapists, nurses, physical therapists -- everyone was very invested and involved. He has a special place in a lot of people's hearts."\u000a\u000aSheiman holds Beckham for the first time.\u000a\u000aIn addition to providing around-the-clock care, the doctors talked with Sheiman about "kangaroo care," in which mothers are encouraged to hold their babies with skin-to-skin contact.\u000a\u000aSheiman held Beckham for the first time two weeks after he was born. It took four people at the hospital, as well as her husband, to help tape all the boy's tubes and wires to her shoulder so she could hold him without doing any damage.\u000a\u000a"He was so small, I didn't feel like I was holding anything," Sheiman said. "But I was so excited to finally hold him and have that bonding time I had been craving."\u000a\u000aEvery time she held him through the kangaroo care method, his oxygen levels would improve. "If you had not been there every day, he would've ended up with a breathing tube surgically implanted in his neck," the doctors told her.\u000a\u000a"It gives such a good feeling to parents to be doing something to help their baby," Khan said. "What greater feeling is that?"\u000a\u000aA poem of gratitude\u000a\u000aMaegan, Josh, Isabella and Beckham Sheiman.\u000a\u000aIn April, Beckham finally got to meet his sister. Isabella was so happy she cried while smiling her biggest smile, Sheiman said. It laid the groundwork for a deep bond. If Beckham doesn't feel like smiling, he needs only to see his sister to start laughing again.\u000a\u000aLaToya recovered but faces long-term consequences. Any future children will be at risk of being born prematurely. The single mother putting herself through law school is an inspiring superhero, Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aAlthough LaToya felt guilty about what happened to Beckham, Sheiman insisted it wasn't her fault and urged her to come see Beckham. Now, they visit regularly.\u000a\u000aAfter 185 days in the NICU, Beckham went home for the first time in July. He's still on oxygen and can't be around other children because of the dangers of flu season, but the Sheimans are hopeful for the future.\u000a\u000aEven when he's having blood drawn every month or enduring painful procedures, he remains "the happiest baby," Sheiman said.\u000a\u000aBeckham celebrates his first birthday.\u000a\u000aIn January, Beckham turned 1 year old. All of his doctors and nurses were invited to his birthday party. Sheiman wanted to deliver a speech to thank everyone who cared for Beckham. It turned into a poem.\u000a\u000a"Everyone put their heart and soul into saving his life," Sheiman said. "They needed to know how much it meant to us. While we were there for 185 days, we won't forget it. They're practically raising our kids."\u000a\u000aShe shared the poem at the party but also created cards and had them sent to the hospital. The poem was also included in a hospital-wide newsletter two weeks ago.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"It was beautiful," Khan said. "Everybody was just really overwhelmed. It's a tear-jerker, full of emotions and very raw.\u000a\u000a"We love happy endings.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Hold your pinky nail out in front of you. Now divide your nail into quarters. This is the size of one of the most remarkable animals in the world -- the coral polyp. The life of this tiny creature represents a biological process that helps produce geological fact in the form of coral reefs. These minute organisms are the building blocks of The Great Barrier Reef, which at 1,400 miles long is the largest living structure on Earth -- visible even from space.\u000a\u000aDavid Doubilet\u000a\u000aSome of my most memorable moments in the sea have occurred in this remarkable ocean ecosystem. One mid-October night in the Australian spring our team, led by Dr. Peter Harrison, sank beneath the surface off Heron Island into a dark world that that resembled a galaxy of stars created by many different species of reef-building corals that release their eggs and sperm into a warm sea with precision timing in a single night. These bundles of eggs and sperm combine to eventually produce coral larvae. The morning sea is coated with oily pink coral spawn, and a tangy coralline odor, unlike any other smell in the world, hangs in the humid air, evidence of millions of years of evolution and one of the most intricate mass spawning events in the world.\u000a\u000aToday, this living structure is facing an uncertain future in a warming sea.\u000a\u000aAcropora millepora release egg and sperm bundles that rise to the surface, creating a sea that resembles a starry night in the waters off Heron Island.\u000a\u000aSequential coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 have affected nearly 900 miles of the reef. Thermal stress causes the coral polyp to lose its symbiotic algae, which provides valuable nutrients and gives coral its color. If temperatures return to normal quickly, coral can recover with time. But these unprecedented back-to-back bleaching events give the already stressed coral little time to recover. The reef is literally in hot water, living under the Damoclean sword of ocean acidification and rising sea levels.\u000a\u000aThe Great Barrier Reef may be located in Queensland, Australia, but it really belongs to the world as the most well-known of all corals reefs on our planet. I am confident that even the most landlocked of Americans in the heartland know what it is and vaguely where it is.\u000a\u000aRead More

That's what the primaries proved.\u000a\u000aI remember a young Republican operative telling me in anguished tones before the convention, "But he's not a real conservative!"

Krill\u000a\u000aAs is now customary with the passing of public figures, social media exploded with condolences for the family of the late Mayor Rob Ford on Tuesday, making it clear that a man once the subject of merciless ridicule was now being afforded a level of sympathy and kindness unfathomable just a few short years ago.\u000a\u000aAcross the Internet and media, punchlines have largely been replaced by dignified tributes, and crude caricatures by staid, objective reporting.

aVJoshua A. Douglas is a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law. He is the co-editor of " Election Law Stories ." Follow him on Twitter @JoshuaADouglas . The opinions expressed are his own.\u000a\u000aIn the past few weeks, in a series of separate rulings, federal courts have found that the state intentionally discriminated against minority voters by enacting a strict voter ID law, unfair redistricting plans, and unlawful rules on language assistance at the polls. It's important that the Supreme Court affirm these rulings.\u000a\u000aVoter discrimination, for any reason, should never occur, yet Texas' experience should serve as a wake-up call to other states considering new election laws. It should also prompt courts and policymakers to stand up for minority rights.\u000a\u000aIndeed, the federal courts have painted a poor picture of Texas' actions on voting rights: The Republican-controlled Legislature has systematically discriminated against minority voters in an effort to retain its majority status in the state.\u000a\u000aThis pattern may well cause federal judges to place Texas back under federal supervision under the Voting Rights Act, which would require the state to seek preapproval from the federal government or the courts before enacting new voting laws. After the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder , gutting a major provision of the Voting Rights Act, this option is available only if a court finds intentional discrimination -- which, say the courts, has now occurred in Texas several times.\u000a\u000aTo review: First, late last month a federal district judge held that Texas purposefully discriminated against minority voters through its strict voter ID law, knowing that minorities would have a harder time complying with the requirement. The court found that various aspects of the law -- such as the type of ID it required, obstacles to obtaining an acceptable ID, and inadequate education on the measure -- were intended to discriminate against African-American and Hispanic voters.\u000a\u000aThe case bounced around the federal court system, with judges consistently ruling against Texas' law. Texas has now brazenly asked the court of appeals to allow it to keep using the law, barely acknowledging that several federal judges have found it discriminatory. The battle is likely to reach the Supreme Court in the coming years.\u000a\u000aSecond, a three-judge federal district court panel issued a series of rulings holding that Texas' redistricting plans were unlawful racial gerrymanders. The latest decision , handed down just after the voter ID ruling, held that the state's 2013 redrawing of the map for its state House districts intentionally discriminated against minority voters in four of those districts. The court required Texas to redraw them ahead of the 2018 election.\u000a\u000aJust a week earlier, the same three-judge district court panel invalidated two of Texas' congressional districts for the same reason, finding intentional discrimination. The court was set to hold a hearing the following week on a remedy to this gerrymander, with the potential that the judges would draw a new map for the 2018 election, but Justice Samuel Alito put the lower court's decision on hold as the full Supreme Court considers the appeal.\u000a\u000aThird, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled agains t a Texas law requiring voters in need of language assistance to receive it only from a registered voter from the same county. The court found that this limitation violated the Voting Rights Act, which allows individuals to choose whomever they want to help, so long as that person is not their employer or union leader. This ruling will have a tangible impact on many Latino voters in the state, making it easier for them to receive the language assistance they need.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aOne or more of these cases is sure to reach the Supreme Court. The justices will then have an opportunity to rule against these discriminatory actions and send a clear message that politicians should not be able to rig election results by manipulating who may vote and how representation occurs. If Texas is allowed to continue its shenanigans, however, then all bets are off on any meaningful limits to partisan manipulation in the future.\u000a\u000aTexas' experience should also sound a caution bell to other states, like North Carolina, that are considering new election rules. North Carolina is engaged in a divisive redistricting debate and the courts have previously invalidated its voter ID law , citing its discriminatory purpose and effect.\u000a\u000aThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found last year that the state's new election laws targeted "African-Americans with almost surgical precision." Given this history, North Carolina legislators, and lawmakers from other states, should pause before they enact new rules with a partisan and discriminatory purpose that hamper the fundamental right to vote.\u000a\u000aFinally, Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Department of Justice must rethink its position on voting rights. Under President Barack Obama, the DOJ had joined the plaintiffs against Texas' voter ID law; the new administration reversed course and told the court that it no longer believes Texas' law had a discriminatory purpose.\u000a\u000aBut this should not be a partisan issue: Discrimination is discrimination, regardless of which political party is in the White House. If the Trump administration truly wants to demonstrate a commitment to democracy and racial equality, it should recognize the clear implication of these judicial rulings and support plaintiffs who challenge discriminatory voting laws.\u000a\u000aIn the end, we can celebrate the independent federal judiciary serving as a stopgap to the worst abuses in the voting process. Voting discrimination may be bigger in Texas, but as the past few weeks have shown, so is Texas federal judges' ability to stop it.

aV(CNN) French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi SA paused development of a Zika virus vaccine candidate in response to funding cuts by the US government, the company said in a statement on its website last week.\u000a\u000aThe Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services, informed Sanofi's vaccine unit that it had "decided to focus on a more limited set of goals and deliverables" based on its review of all Zika-related projects after a decline in new infections.\u000a\u000a"BARDA has informed us they intend to continue to fund activities required to advance vaccine development to a point where development would be indefinitely paused but could be restarted if the epidemic re-emerges," Ashleigh Koss, a spokeswoman for Sanofi, wrote in an email.\u000a\u000aGranted $43 million from BARDA last year, Sanofi announced a research contract in July 2016 with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research to help study the human safety and effectiveness of an inactivated virus vaccine originally developed by the institute.\u000a\u000aThe institute's inactivated virus vaccine technology, data and biologic samples had been shared with Sanofi at that time with the hope that the company could produce an effective vaccine against the mosquito-borne disease, which can also be sexually transmitted and passed from mother to baby in utero.\u000a\u000a"We are currently working with BARDA to identify which of the ongoing initiatives should continue ... as well as which initiatives should be terminated," Koss explained.\u000a\u000aShe added that there are approximately 32 Zika vaccines in early development around the world. She said that estimate is based on comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\u000a\u000aFauci said he is not sure and has never mentioned an exact number of Zika vaccine candidates "in play," but he said authors of a recent article in the Journal of Virus Eradication say there are 38 candidates at various stages of development.\u000a\u000aOn February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika, which can cause birth defects and other neurological deficits, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u000a\u000aHowever, in November, the WHO stated that it was no longer an emergency of international concern and in March stated that no countries, territories or global areas had reported new infections over the past month.\u000a\u000aZika remains a concern to pregnant women and those hoping to become pregnant because the consequences for babies of women who are infected while pregnant can be devastating. In the United States, one in 10 Zika-infected mothers had babies with related birth defects last year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u000a\u000aSanofi will be "completing, with partial BARDA support," an ongoing study intended to provide guidance on Zika epidemiology and diagnosis "that can be applicable to any vaccine subsequently developed," Koss wrote. The study, which is being conducted in Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Puerto Rico, is seeking enrollment of 2,400 volunteers, the company said.\u000a\u000aAs Sanofi places its Zika vaccine on hold, others, including its research partner, forge forward.\u000a\u000aThe Walter Reed Army Institute of Research said studies of the are vaccine ongoing, with results under review at a scientific journal. Additionally, the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is evaluating soldiers' and families' risk of Zika infection, resource allocation and other matters, including possible new business partners, before deciding the most appropriate next steps in regard to development of the vaccine.\u000a\u000a"Right now, there's no indication that Sanofi is anything other than just sort of an individual situation that doesn't necessarily impact other companies," Fauci said.\u000a\u000aHis institute is working on a number of vaccine candidates based on several approaches.\u000a\u000a"Nothing has changed with regard to our vaccine approach," Fauci said. "We have a number of candidates at various stages of development."\u000a\u000aThe vaccine candidate that is furthest along is the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' DNA candidate, which is in phase 2A/2B trials -- safety and effectiveness studies in which testing is done on humans -- in Puerto Rico, Texas and South America.\u000a\u000aFauci said the institute has a strong collaboration with BARDA, which provides some funding, though "mostly, BARDA funds the companies that we work with," he said. "Currently, BARDA is not funding any aspect of our DNA trial."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aInovio Pharmaceuticals is also continuing separate efforts to develop a DNA-based vaccine candidate to protect against Zika, according to Jeff Richardson, a spokesman for the company.\u000a\u000aThis Pennsylvania-based company recently completed a public offering of common stock to support various projects, including publication in the final quarter of this year of its vaccine clinical study\u000a\u000a"We are moving forward on a (clinical) trial in Puerto Rico," Richardson said. "It's not an efficiacy trial, but because of how we set it up -- with 80 people getting the vaccine and 80 not -- we feel we may get efficacy data from this trial." He added that the company is also seeking funders for ongoing research of the experimental Zika vaccine.

aV(CNN) Syrian troops broke ISIS' three-year siege of Deir Ezzor -- a strategic city in the eastern part of the country -- on Tuesday, marking the latest in a series of setbacks for the terror group.\u000a\u000aIn recent weeks, ISIS has been driven from one refuge to the next as its territory in Iraq and Syria continues to shrivel.\u000a\u000aIn late August, Iraqi security forces surrounded the town of Tal Afar , some 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Mosul. Despite official predictions of a long, difficult slog, the town was cleared of ISIS fighters within a week -- with militants literally dragged from sewers.\u000a\u000aIn northern Syria, US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have pushed forward into the Old City of Raqqa. The SDF now controls two-thirds of ISIS' de-facto capital, which, not so long ago, served as the group's administrative headquarters and ground-zero for plotting overseas attacks.\u000a\u000aA picture taken on March 2, 2017, shows a sign displaying the routes to Palmyra-Deir Ezzor and Damascus-Iraq as Syrian regime fighters advanced.\u000a\u000aAnd this week, the Syrian army reached the western front of Deir Ezzor -- ending ISIS' siege of the 137th Brigade Base, a garrison that has long relied on airdrops to survive. Ceasefires arranged elsewhere in Syria, under Russian auspices, freed up the Syrian army to advance east -- allowing them to race across 200 kilometers of desert to Deir Ezzor in just a few weeks.\u000a\u000aThe swift breakthrough by Assad's forces there has surprised many observers.\u000a\u000aDeir Ezzor is arguably more important than either Tal Afar or Raqqa. It sits at the heart of Syria's oilfields, once an essential source of income to ISIS, and is Syria's main gateway to Iraq. It's also one of the most crucial in a string of towns along the Euphrates River, where ISIS is expected to make its last stand.\u000a\u000aISIS still holds much of the city, thought to be home to a remaining 90,000 civilians (though many more have fled), and controls territory to the south of the Euphrates. But it is quickly running out of fighters, supplies and escape routes.\u000a\u000aThat's in no small measure due to Russian airpower. Deployed at first against other rebel groups in the northwest of Syria, it has more recently been trained on ISIS. Nearly three weeks ago, the Russian Defense Ministry released aerial footage purportedly showing the destruction of an ISIS convoy near the city, destroying heavy weapons and killing more than 200 militants.\u000a\u000aThis week Russian warships in the Mediterranean fired cruise missiles at ISIS positions and weapons depots.\u000a\u000aBut if the caliphate is on the verge of extinction, ISIS is not. And its many enemies may soon turn their guns on each other.\u000a\u000aRussian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Syrian forces on their advance on Deir Ezzor, but said on Tuesday: "Can we say that we have done away with ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra [the former al Qaeda affiliate] and other terrorist groups forever? It is probably too early to say so, but it is obvious that the situation is changing drastically in Syria."\u000a\u000aISIS morale crumbles\u000a\u000aISIS is certainly beginning to suffer a loss of morale after a series of defeats.\u000a\u000aUS Brigadier General Andrew Croft, chief of coalition air operations over Iraq, says ISIS' leadership is "more fractured, less robust, and sort of flimsy ... it is sporadic."\u000a\u000aLast week, some 300 of its fighters in western Syria -- near the Lebanese border -- cut a deal with their arch-enemy Hezbollah (the Lebanese Shia militia) and with the Syrian regime to be allowed to leave, unarmed, for ISIS sanctuaries in eastern Syria. A week later their buses remain stranded in the desert, and their destination is under attack.\u000a\u000aThere are also reports of dissent in ISIS' ranks. According to some accounts, this has led to armed clashes, with the group's "ultra" hardliners accusing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of being too lax in targeting "apostates." It speaks volumes about ISIS that amid disastrous battlefield setbacks it can still be consumed by an arcane ideological dispute.\u000a\u000aSyrians celebrating a break in ISIS' siege on Deir Ezzor wave their national flag and hold posters of President Bashar al-Assad.\u000a\u000aSources in Syria say that the remaining leadership, plus ISIS communications infrastructure and any chemical weapons capability, began moving to the Euphrates River valley earlier this year -- specifically to an area linking Mayadin and Abu Kamal in Syria with Qa'im across the border in Iraq.\u000a\u000aBoth US and Russian airpower have been active in this area in the last few months. The US says it has killed several important ISIS leaders in and around Mayadin since April.\u000a\u000aBut the battlefield in eastern Syria has become very crowded, complicating Syria's future even as the threat from ISIS recedes. Concentrated in an area scarcely 100-kilometers wide are the Syrian army, its allies, including Hezbollah and Iranian Shia militia, as well as Kurdish and Arab tribal groups. Just across the border is the Iraqi army and more (Iraqi) Shia militia, supplied by Iran. In the skies above are US, Russian, Syrian and Iraqi jets.\u000a\u000aISIS mutates\u000a\u000aAmid immense pressure, ISIS is mutating rather than dying.\u000a\u000aThe group is returning to its roots as an insurgency -- grounded in expertise, experience and cash. ISIS rose out of an underground movement, organized in cells across Sunni parts of Iraq, and will try to revert to life as such.\u000a\u000aIn the view of the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank that has closely followed the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, "Russia's punitive strikes against vulnerable Sunni populations will exacerbate local grievances, increase sectarian tension, and pave the way for the resurgence of ISIS, al Qaeda, and other jihadist groups in areas recently seized from ISIS ..."\u000a\u000aISIS thinks in millennial terms. Even if the physical caliphate evaporates, its spirit will persist. Suffering and defeat is part of a centuries-old campaign.\u000a\u000aThere is a saying attributed to the Prophet that is often quoted by ISIS ideologues and followers: "A victorious band of warriors from my followers shall continue to fight for the truth. Despite being deserted and abandoned, they will be at the gates of Jerusalem and its surroundings, they will be at the gates of Damascus and its surroundings."\u000a\u000aIt is this millennial belief that sustains what remains of ISIS. Its organizational talent allows it to probe for weaknesses among its enemies.\u000a\u000aA member of the SDF watches as smoke billows over the embattled city of Raqqa on September 3, 2017.\u000a\u000aISIS has cultivated deep roots in Sunni parts of Iraq (less so in Syria where many jihadists regard it as an interloper). Over the past decade, it has developed networks skilled at raising money and obtaining weapons across a wide swathe of Iraq -- from Diyala in the east to the Jordanian border.\u000a\u000aIt has shown that it can penetrate security in Baghdad to detonate devastating car bombs. In some ways, it is returning to what it does best -- agile attacks, mobility and surprise.\u000a\u000aISIS may yet benefit from the mutual distrust among its enemies.\u000a\u000aDeir Ezzor is an important link in Iran's dream of connecting Tehran, Baghdad and Beirut in a land corridor for regional (for which read Shia) influence.\u000a\u000aThe US has supported moderate Syrian rebels along the Syria-Iraq border in an effort to stymie Tehran's ambition. Kurds have carved out a wide slice of northern Syria as their own. Some Arab tribes in the region support the Assad regime; others oppose it.\u000a\u000aRight now, the regime and its Iranian and Russian backers are in the ascendant, but it's a landscape ripe for further bloodletting.\u000a\u000aFrom Raqqa to Mosul, the ISIS flag is being torn down. But its ability to inflict terror, to take advantage of ungoverned spaces and exploit sectarian hatred is far from extinguished.

aVMichael D'Antonio is the author of the new book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Given a straighforward opportunity to disavow the most dangerous brand of hatred in American history, the man who has declared, "I'm, like, a really smart person" couldn't do it.\u000a\u000a"I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists," said Donald Trump in a response to CNN's Jake Tapper. "So I don't know. I don't know -- did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists."\u000a\u000aThe statement was classic Trump: a chopped salad made out of words. But the two parts were clear. "I know nothing about David Duke," he said. "I know nothing about white supremacists." (Trump later tweeted a disavowal.)\u000a\u000aEvery literate American adult, and certainly anyone running for president, must know that Duke is the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and that white supremacists promote a violently racist ideology that plagues America.\u000a\u000aThe 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, including 21 kids in a daycare center, was associated with if not inspired by white supremacy.\u000a\u000aSince 9/11 white supremacists and other domestic terrorists have carried out more deadly attacks on American soil than Muslim extremists. It was a white supremacist who killed nine people at a Bible study at a Charleston, South Carolina, church last summer.\u000a\u000aConcern about racist support for Trump arose last week when David Duke said on Facebook that he liked Trump's stands on certain issues and the way the candidate exposed "lies" perpetrated by the press and believed he will ensure "that White-Americans are allowed to preserve and promote their heritage and interests just as all other groups are allowed to do."\u000a\u000aWhen first informed of Duke's support on Friday, Trump didn't have any trouble recognizing the name. "David Duke endorsed me?" he said. "OK, all right. I disavow, OK?" This makes sense, given the fact that Duke is notorious for hate-mongering and Trump named him years ago when he explained why he dropped out of the old Reform Party. Back then, and again on Friday, he knew who Duke was and seemed to recognize that he's political poison.\u000a\u000aTrump's tune changed 48 hours before polls would open for Super Tuesday primaries, many of them in Southern states. Suddenly he was unable to place Duke's name and he didn't know a thing about the movement that keeps white racist extremism alive in America.\u000a\u000aThis from a fellow who is famous for recalling every detail of every deal he ever made and who never forgets those who offend him. If Duke was so bad that his presence drove Trump out of the Reform Party, it's unlikely he's forgotten him.\u000a\u000aWhat's going on here? As someone who has spent many hours with Trump and devoted two years to piecing together the story of his life, I can tell you that Trump is not speaking out of ignorance. He is, as he says, "very smart," and he understands the effects of what he says. And he has been signaling where he stands when it comes to race for many years.\u000a\u000aBefore declaring for president, Trump spent much of the Obama presidency as the loudest voice of the "birthers" who repeatedly claimed that Barack Obama was born, not in Hawaii, as documents prove, but abroad. And therefore he was not a U.S. citizen, and not a legitimate president, in Trump's eyes.\u000a\u000aBirtherism was a barely disguised effort to paint the first black president as an un-American other and was energized by racial animus. Trump played the game long after others disavowed it and went further, suggesting the President might not be a Christian, as he says, but perhaps instead a Muslim.\u000a\u000aThe insinuation, like Trump's suggestion that the truth about Obama's college years was somehow clouded, was a divisive kind of gutter politics.\u000a\u000aAlways comfortable going further than others, Trump was the man who responded to the arrest of five minority youths in the 1989 assault of a jogger in New York's Central Park with newspaper ads that said, "Bring Back The Death Penalty, Bring Back the Police."\u000a\u000aWhen Trump and I discussed the five -- who were coerced into false confessions but eventually cleared of the crime -- he wasn't interested in discussing any part of it except for his belief that they were bad characters who deserved no consideration for the years they spent in prison.\u000a\u000aThe Trump record on race also includes the ridiculous assertion, made in a TV interview with Bryant Gumbel, that "A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market."\u000a\u000aTrump also appeared as a witness at a congressional hearing on Indian casinos -- they were his competitors -- and said, "Organized crime is rampant on Indian reservations." He then offered his belief that Native Americans at the hearing where he spoke "don't look like Indians to me, and they don't look like Indians to Indians."\u000a\u000aTrump's tendency to play with racial fire is a longstanding element of his style and personality. When he was a marginal political figure, no one dwelled much on this problem. But as he lurches toward the Republican nomination for president, it's important to understand that he always knows what he is saying and always acts with an intention in mind. He is, after all, a really smart person.

aV(CNN) Lewis Hamilton held off a spirited challenge from Sebastian Vettel to cut the German's lead at the top of the Drivers' Championship to just seven points.\u000a\u000aOn the 25th anniversary of Michael Schumacher's first Grand Prix win, Hamilton set about emulating the racing legend in style.\u000a\u000aTo mark the occasion, Schumacher's son, Mick, drove his father's 1994 title-winning car around the track at Spa before the drivers battled it out around the famous circuit.\u000a\u000aJust as Schumacher did in his 200th race, Hamilton put in an imperious performance to reach the checkered flag first.\u000a\u000aThe Brit has now won 58 of the 200 Grand Prix he has competed in, including three in Spa.\u000a\u000a"It's been a strong weekend for myself and the team," Hamilton told Mark Webber after stepping off the top step of podium. "The team have done a great job and I'm really grateful for all the hard work.\u000a\u000a"Sebastian put a great fight on but this is what I said I was coming to do, so I did it."\u000a\u000aAfter Force India teammates Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon collided on lap 30, the safety car was called out for debris on the track, a move which blew the race wide open.\u000a\u000aJust five seconds separated the top five drivers, before Hamilton and Vettel pulled away from the pack.\u000a\u000aThe German then began to put the pressure on Hamilton, but a faultless drive meant a real challenge for first place never really materialized.\u000a\u000a"It was really intense. I was waiting for Lewis to make a mistake but he didn't," Vettel said after the race.

"For a top team, this can't happen. At the beginning you can say bad luck, these things happen.\u000a\u000a"But if it's happening again for the sixth time this year, you can't call it bad luck any more. The fans buy very expensive tickets to come and watch the race and then after eight laps it's finished.\u000a\u000a"Also it's just really demotivating because you work hard all weekend, you have a great qualifying and you're looking forward to the race but then you retire after eight laps. I don't know what to say - it's just a very tough year."\u000a\u000aHowever, it was a different story for Verstappen's Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo, who made a scintillating restart after the safety car to leap from fifth place to third and take the final podium place.\u000a\u000aBeaming from ear to ear, the Aussie orchestrated the fans watching below, leading the crowd in a series of Mexican waves.\u000a\u000a"I knew we'd been given a bit of an opportunity so it was good to take advantage of that with Valtteri on the restart," he said.

aV(CNN) Holding a pack of plastic bags, Jonathan Mwagangi maneuvers through a crowd of shoppers in Eastleigh, Nairobi's busy shopping market, looking for his next customer.\u000a\u000aFor 15 years, the 56-year-old has been selling plastic bags here, but his business will come to an abrupt end thanks to a new law from the Kenyan government.\u000a\u000aStarting on August 28 it will become illegal to use, manufacture and import plastic bags for commercial and household packaging.\u000a\u000aJonathan Mwagangi, 56, has been selling plastic bags for the past 15 years. Photo/Yunis Dekow\u000a\u000a"The purpose of the government ban (on) the use of plastic bags is to avoid health and environmental effects resulting from the use of plastic bags," the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), a state agency that enforces environmental policies and laws, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIf found selling a plastic bag, suppliers like Mwagangi risk a jail term of up to four years or a fine of $38,000 or both. Dealers were given six months to clear their existing stock; that period is now over, and so is Mwagangi's business.\u000a\u000a"I sell plastic bags because it's my only source of income," Mwagangi tells CNN. "I will not have anything to sell unless manufacturers give alternative bags for people like me to continue working."\u000a\u000aThird time lucky?\u000a\u000aThis isn't the first time the country has tried to tackle the issue of plastic bags.\u000a\u000aIn 2007, Kenya tried to discourage their use by limiting the thickness of plastic bags, ordering manufacturers and importers to only sell bags with more than 30 microns. Four years later, they tried again by banning plastic bags less than 60 microns, which were considered more recycle- friendly.\u000a\u000aBoth plans failed.\u000a\u000a"This fell into technical hitches as it was hard for common citizens to differentiate the papers in terms of microns contained in a given plastic paper bags. As a result, the enforcement was hard to sustain," says Evans Nyabuto, a NEMA spokesman.\u000a\u000aNyabuto says it will be effective this time because plastic bags have been banned completely. He says the government has sufficiently educated the public about it, and support from major supermarkets like Nakumatt will provide a boost.\u000a\u000a'Kenya should be commended'\u000a\u000aThe ban has been praised by The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which estimates that Kenya uses about 24 million bags every month. Most of them find their way into the Indian Ocean, contributing to the eight million tonnes of plastic dumped in the sea every year.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Can we save our oceans from plastic?

"It's a great example that I hope will inspire others, and help drive further commitments to the Clean Seas campaign."\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, UNEP launched the "Clean Seas Initiative" in a bid to urge governments around the world to get rid of plastics entirely.\u000a\u000aUNEP predicts that by 2050, the fish in the oceans will be outnumbered by pieces of plastic, threatening marine ecosystems, wildlife and tourism.\u000a\u000a'1.2 million jobs at stake'\u000a\u000aBut the ban has been met with some opposition.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Kenyan Association of Manufacturers, there are 176 plastic bag manufacturers in the country. "The direct employment created by the plastic sector is over 2.89% Kenyan employees," says Phyllis Wakiaga, KAM CEO. "Indirect employment and dependents through retailers, wholesalers, recyclers, packers and outlets is over 1.2 million personnel nationwide."\u000a\u000aNyabuto counters this argument by saying that the government has tried to engage with manufacturers on how to resolve "the menace of plastic bags in the environment," to no avail.\u000a\u000a"On a positive note, the ban will create more employment" he says. "Industries manufacturing plastic bags will switch to manufacturing of the required bags."\u000a\u000aDr. Leah Oyake-Ombise, an environment specialist in Nairobi, thinks that the government should invest in technologies that would help put a plastic waste management system in place.\u000a\u000a"We have failed to address (the) solid waste management system. Nobody is talking about it. That's where we need to invest," she said, adding that the government should look for "resources required and source for them to manage this sector."\u000a\u000aA change across the continent?\u000a\u000aKenya joins more than a dozen African countries that have either banned or proposed the prohibition of plastic bags. They include Rwanda, Mauritania, Eritrea, Cameroon, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Malawi.\u000a\u000aSo far, Rwanda's effort to do away with non-biodegradable plastic is seen as the most successful among the African countries, and the country has maintained its stand.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED How can I save the ocean from plastic?

Later he moved to Australia, but a thirst for adventure and the desire to journey to other secluded spots never left him.\u000a\u000aOne day, he packed up his belongings to become a full-time explorer -- and he's been traveling the world ever since.\u000a\u000aThe inspiration for "The World in Faces" came several years into his travels.\u000a\u000aKhimushin's photographs, including this one of a Wakhi woman in Afghanistan, capture his subjects' personalities.\u000a\u000a"From the first day of travel, my constant companion was a camera," remembers Khimushin. "Later, digging through my photo archives, I decided to put together a series of photo portraits. When the work was completed, about 200 [photographs] of people from different parts of the world appeared before me."\u000a\u000aKhimushin was struck by the effect of the portraits. The inspiration for his project began to form.\u000a\u000a"Glancing at their faces, bright unforgettable moments of our meetings began to emerge," he said.\u000a\u000a"That inner transformation that took place in me, through meetings with these people, evolved into a desire to continue to take photos of people around the world, to acquaint people with the beauty and diversity of people in the remotest corners of our planet."\u000a\u000aPhotographing the world\u000a\u000aAn Ifugao woman in the Philippines.\u000a\u000aKhimushin's striking, engaging portraits not only document traditional dress, customs and culture but capture the unique personality of the subject.\u000a\u000aSometimes the person will be on the brink of laughter -- other times they appear more solemn, captivating the viewer with their eyes.\u000a\u000aTheir full backstory remains unknown, but the photographs are steeped in character.\u000a\u000aKhimushin says he prefers photographing people in remote locations.\u000a\u000a"Local people are always genuinely welcoming in these places," he says.\u000a\u000a"Still untouched by globalization, they're happy to meet a stranger, invite me into their house...[they are] interested in who I am and where I came from. When I explain the meaning behind my visit, many are willing to help, invite friends and relatives to take a photo."\u000a\u000aThe photographer also strives to showcase cultures and ways of life that might be unfamiliar to his audience.\u000a\u000a"Indigenous peoples are proud of their culture, which is often not well known or neglected," he says.

aVPhnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) The Cambodian government is coming under widespread criticism after the leader of the political opposition was arrested and accused of treason.\u000a\u000a"Kem Sokha, president of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), has been accused of involving foreigners in secret plans against the Kingdom of Cambodia" the Phnom Penh Municipal Court said in a statement. "This is considered treason."\u000a\u000aSokha's lawyer Chann Chen confirmed to CNN Wednesday that his client had been officially charged with treason. He said he hadn't been able to meet him since the charge was laid.\u000a\u000a"(We) are currently trying to meet with him. We expect legal proceedings to continue in the typical way," he said.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Hun Sen's government has accused the opposition leader of plotting with the United States to topple the government. Sokha was arrested at his home in the capital of Phnom Penh in the early hours of Sunday morning and taken to Correctional Center 3 over 100 miles away, according to Mu Sochua, CNRP deputy president.\u000a\u000a"It's not necessary to take him to such a remote prison," said Sochua. "It's difficult for his lawyers, for his colleagues and his family to visit him." Sochua also denied there was any plot. "Kem Sokha has committed no crime. His only crime is to promote democracy and wish for the rule of law within democratic principles."\u000a\u000a#KemSokha lawyers are now allowed to see him in CC3 prison. #Cambodia pic.twitter.com/e5ynf34rkw \u2014 Monovithya Kem (@MNVKem) September 4, 2017\u000a\u000aAnalysts note that his arrest comes soon after his party made significant gains in the local elections in June.

In a statement, the US State Department said the arrest seems "politically motivated" and casts doubt on Cambodia's ability to "organize credible national elections in 2018 which produce an outcome that enjoys democratic legitimacy."\u000a\u000aThe statement did not address accusations of trying to topple the Cambodian government. However, US embassy deputy spokesman David Josar directed CNN to a statement he gave The Phnom Penh Post -- an English-language daily -- on August 30 that said, "any suggestion that the United States is supporting or has supported revolution is categorically false."\u000a\u000aIn a September 3 statement, the European Union termed the arrest "a dangerous political escalation." It also said, "This arrest suggests a further effort to restrict the democratic space in Cambodia and the space for independent reporting, comment and criticism."\u000a\u000aSokha's predecessor, former CNRP leader Sam Rainsy, also issued a statement from his current home in France, where he is in exile. He called the Cambodian government's allegations of treason "senseless."\u000a\u000a"Is it 'treachery' to want a democratic change for one's country and to work peacefully to achieve it?" Rainsy said.\u000a\u000aWhen asked about the opposition in an interview earlier this year, spokesman for the Cambodian government's Council of Ministers, Phay Siphan, was defiant. "I don't care about critics because they are not Cambodian and they are biased already," he said. "Who does Cambodia belong to? Kem Sokha or the rule of law?"\u000a\u000a"Sam Rainsy ran away from his obligations and Kem Sokha has [conspired against us]; this is a problem with the opposition party, not Cambodia," he said. He dismissed comments from CNRP leaders as "purely propaganda and not factual."\u000a\u000aIn a September 3 speech to a gathering of garment workers , Prime Minister Hun Sen -- who has led Cambodia for 32 years -- said he had to arrest Sokha due to the seriousness of the situation.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Hun Sen has been in power for more than three decades.\u000a\u000aInternational condemnation of the move was not unanimous. At a press conference on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang, when asked about Sokha's arrest, said, "As a good neighbor, friend, partner and brother of Cambodia ... [We support] the Cambodian government's effort to uphold national security and stability."\u000a\u000aNews outlets closed\u000a\u000aThe US State Department, in its statement, added that Sokha's arrest "follows a number of troubling recent steps, including the imposition of unprecedented restrictions on independent media and civil society."\u000a\u000aRadio Free Asia (RFA) reported that several Cambodian radio stations airing programming from RFA and Voice of America -- both funded by the US -- were closed in recent weeks. RFA reported the Ministry of Information had cited violations, including airing "outside programs without requesting authorization."\u000a\u000aNone of this will be reported any more in The Cambodia Daily -- an independent newspaper founded by American reporter Bernard Krisher in 1993. Its last edition came out Monday after it was slapped with a $6.3 million tax bill.\u000a\u000aCambodia Daily staff take part in an editorial meeting. The newspaper closed its doors after receiving a $6.3 million tax bill.\u000a\u000a"The Daily has been targeted for an astronomical tax assessment, leaks and false statements by the tax department and public vilification by the head of government," said Editor-in-Chief Jodie DeJonge via email.

aVIn a recent feature in The Outline, Adrianne Jeffries took on millennial-oriented website Mic.com, which she said "exploited social justice for clicks" before laying off part of its staff and "pivoting to video."\u000a\u000aJeffries singled out headlines like "In a Single Tweet, One Man Beautifully Destroys the Hypocrisy of Anti-Muslim Bigotry," or "This Brave Woman's Horrifying Photo Has Become a Viral Rallying Cry Against Sexual Harassment" -- the kinds of stories we have all seen our friends share on Facebook, often in conjunction with an outraged comment.\u000a\u000aBut when liberal media outlets cover the social justice beat by creating click-friendly narratives steeped in so-called identity politics, is that coverage actually illuminating the real issues at play? Mark Lilla, a professor of humanities at Columbia University, and the author of "The Once and Future Liberal," thinks that's not the case.\u000a\u000aLilla was Brian Stelter's guest in this week's Reliable Sources podcast. He drew a connection between some of the liberal media's coverage of diverse identities and a larger issue that affects progressives in America today: lack of vision.\u000a\u000a"A sum-total of stories about social injustices doesn't add up to a picture of the kind of country we want to create," Lilla told Stelter.\u000a\u000aListen to the whole podcast here:\u000a\u000aLilla, who identifies as a liberal, thinks "identity liberalism" is hindering the Democratic Party's ability to win elections. He analyzes these issues in his new book.\u000a\u000aBy being "constantly focused on differences," liberals have "slowly been losing parts of the country" because "we haven't had a unified vision of what country we want to build," Lilla said.\u000a\u000aHe added that, in recent times, the message of American liberals has been: "We're not a nation, we are nothing but [...] a collection of different groups that have different identities, that can't understand each other's experiences, because who are you to speak of my experience?"\u000a\u000aThis tension, Lilla thinks, is a departure from what inspired the fight for civil rights and equality in the 1950s and 1960s, asking for various groups to be incorporated in "the great democratic 'We' of this country." Now, liberals are doing without that concept, in ways Lilla believes are detrimental to their cause.\u000a\u000aRelated: Meet the Habermans, a journalism family\u000a\u000aIdentity politics is also trickling into the conservative media sphere. In fact, there is evidence that "white identity" is becoming more salient among white voters, as described by Thomas Edsall in a recent New York Times column.\u000a\u000aHas there been a change in the experience of white Americans? Lilla doesn't think so, but established conservative outlets like Fox News, and "bottom feeders" like Breitbart, are stoking the flame to the benefit of the Republican Party.\u000a\u000aWhat's more -- the Republican Party that has invested considerable resources in expanding its State and local footprint, something Lilla thinks the Democrats should start focusing on as well.\u000a\u000a"On our side, what we've done is we've captured the university, a lot of the media, we've captured elite opinion, but that doesn't translate into real political power in our system -- you need to build from the bottom up," Lilla told Stelter.\u000a\u000aListen to the full podcast here and subscribe on iTunes here.

aVBeing able to consistently contribute enough to your retirement savings accounts is the single most important aspect of any retirement plan, but it's also by far the most challenging. So finding a way to make regular, adequate contributions easier is really the key to a successful retirement. And the best way to accomplish this is by having a written financial plan.\u000a\u000aWhy does a written plan help?\u000a\u000aSelf-help gurus uniformly urge their clients to write down their goals, plans, and dreams for a reason. Writing something down has a significant psychological impact on the writer: It makes that written declaration more "real" to us and gives us accountability. Once it's in writing, we feel more compelled to follow through on it.\u000a\u000aFor a task like saving for retirement, that feeling of accountability can make all the difference in sticking to a contribution plan versus having a plan but only contributing "when it's convenient." A written plan also motivates us by reminding us what we stand to gain tomorrow by sacrificing today.\u000a\u000aThe power of written financial plans\u000a\u000aA recent study by Charles Schwab Corporation highlighted the impact that written financial plans have on retirement savings. The study compared various financial attributes of Americans with a written financial plan to those who did not have one. For many important financial tasks, the difference between the two groups was startlingly high.\u000a\u000aFor example, 27% of savers with written financial plans maxed out their contributions to their retirement savings accounts, compared to 11% of savers without plans. Thirty-four percent of savers with written financial plans had investments in addition to their retirement investments, versus only 16% of those without written plans. And 49% of savers with written financial plans felt very confident in their ability to reach their financial goals, as opposed to just 13% of those without written plans.\u000a\u000aStarting your financial plan\u000a\u000aFinancial plans come in many forms -- debt payment plans, down payment savings plans, investing plans, and so on. And while the idea of creating a financial plan may sound daunting, in reality such a plan can be extremely simple.\u000a\u000aFirst, your plan needs a goal. For a retirement savings plan, the goal will typically be to save enough during your working years so that when you reach your planned retirement date, you will have enough money to live comfortably for the rest of your life. Because different savers have very different ideas of what "living comfortably" entails during retirement, the exact number you end up with as a savings goal will depend largely on your own preferences and situation.\u000a\u000aIn order to know how much money you'll need to save for retirement, you first need to figure out how much you'll be spending during that time. Ideally, you'll write up a list of the expenses that you expect to carry during retirement and add them up. If that sounds like too much work, you can get a pretty fair estimate based on your current income.\u000a\u000aIf you anticipate a fairly sedate retirement without a lot of fancy, expensive activities, you can assume for planning purposes that 80% to 90% of your current income will suffice as annual income during retirement. Aim for the low end of this range if you're sure you'll be debt free by the time you retire (that includes owning a home that's completely paid off). Otherwise, aim for at least 90% of your current income. On the other hand, if you dream of an adventurous retirement touring the capitals of the world, aim for at least 100% of your current income (or possibly even more, if you have really expensive plans).\u000a\u000aMaking it official\u000a\u000aOnce you have a goal for your retirement income, you can plug that number into a retirement calculator to find out how much you need to save in order to hit your target by your planned retirement date. Let's say that your goal is to save $1 million by age 65 and the retirement calculator tells you that in order to reach your goal, you need to save $1,000 per month. Write this down in a form that will inspire you to follow through. For example, you might write "Millionaire by age 65: $1,000 every month into the 401(k)." Then post a copy of this document somewhere you'll see it on a regular basis, such as next to your bathroom mirror, on the front of the refrigerator, or attached to the side of your computer monitor.\u000a\u000aRelated links:\u000a\u000a\u2022 Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\u000a\u000a\u2022 This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\u000a\u000a\u2022 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\u000a\u000aJust having the plan in writing, staring you in the face on a regular basis, can work wonders to improve your follow-through.

aVJerusalem (CNN) A group of local Israeli leaders have warned Israel and the United States that the sewage crisis in Gaza could lead to the spread of disease and cause long-term environmental damage.\u000a\u000aGaza lacks the power to run a new sewage facility in the north of the region for more than a few hours a day because of the ongoing electricity crisis. The facility was introduced as a stopgap measure to relieve the burden on the existing plant.\u000a\u000aAs a result, raw sewage piles up on the beaches of Gaza and southern Israel, contaminating the groundwater in the process. The sewage problem has forced beach closures in Gaza and Israel, as well as the stoppage of groundwater pumping stations.\u000a\u000aCalling on Israeli and American leaders to provide Gaza with electricity to run the plants, the group warned the entire region is "on the verge of a health crisis that does not take into account political borders."\u000a\u000aSewage flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Al-Shati Camp in Gaza in July.\u000a\u000aIn a letter written to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and handed to US Special Envoy for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt during during his recent visit, the group added that it is "an absurd situation" in which Israel tries to curb the effects of the untreated sewage instead of providing the power to treat the sewage before it harms the environment.\u000a\u000aRead More

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000aAtlanta (CNN) Before I launch into the argument for making all restrooms in the United States gender neutral -- that is, removing "men's" and "women's" labels -- I want to show you a photo.\u000a\u000aThis is James Parker Sheffield.\u000a\u000aNow a truly ridiculous question: Which restroom do you think he should use?\u000a\u000aMen's or women's?\u000a\u000aIn the United States at the moment, the legal answer depends on location. If Sheffield is in North Carolina, it's illegal for him to use a public men's restroom. Since he's a transgender man -- his birth certificate has an "F" on it -- he has to use the women's.\u000a\u000aIf he's at home in Atlanta, he can use the men's.\u000a\u000a"It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife," Sheffield wrote on Twitter along with his selfie. He posted that message in March, only hours after North Carolina passed a law making it illegal for transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond with their true gender identities.\u000a\u000aAs it's written, Sheffield would have to use the lady's room or break the law.\u000a\u000aThat's absurd, as the selfie and tweet make clear. Sheffield is a 36-year-old man who lives in Decatur, Georgia. He has a scruffy beard and a receding hairline, which he jokingly calls a "reverse fade." If he walked into a lady's restroom he'd likely be met with stares or screams or worse.\u000a\u000aBut you know what else is absurd? The idea that Sheffield -- or anyone else -- should have to choose a male or female restroom at all. And, beyond that, that any of us would feel entitled to decide someone else's gender for them -- and, consequently, where they can and can't pee.\u000a\u000aThis isn't a binary gender world. People don't fit neatly into the "M" and "F" boxes. It's time our public restrooms reflected that. The fairest way to do so is to desegregate restrooms by sex, and that means eliminating the men's and women's rooms in favor of "all gender" restrooms.\u000a\u000aThink that's an overreaction? Take a quick look at the history of bathroom politics in the United States. We've tried time and again to control who we sit and stand next to at the toilet.\u000a\u000aIn the 1960s, black civil rights activists were killed for trying to use "whites only" bathrooms. In the 1980s, gay men were harassed because the public wrongly assumed they could catch HIV-AIDS from a toilet. (AIDS was viewed then as a gay man's disease). Restrooms weren't required to be accessible to people with wheelchairs until the Americans with Disabilities act of 1990. And now, some cities and states are trying to keep transgender people out.\u000a\u000aThe only justification is bigotry and ignorance.\u000a\u000aYou might think that allowing a transgender person to use the restroom of their choice is a workable solution. It's a first step. But Sheffield and others who don't conform to gender norms face discrimination even when they're legally allowed to choose which restroom to use.\u000a\u000aSeventy percent of transgender people surveyed in Washington, for example, a city with progressive laws allowing people to use either restroom, reported "verbal harassment, assault and being denied access to public restrooms" because of their identities, according to a report from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles . Further, 54% reported medical problems "like dehydration, urinary tract infections, kidney infections and other kidney problems" because they avoided using restrooms entirely.\u000a\u000a@PatMcCroryNC It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife. #HB2 #trans #NorthCarolina #shameonNC pic.twitter.com/4b4OdmfmeN \u2014 James P Sheffield (@JayShef) March 24, 2016\u000a\u000aSheffield told me he plans his days around where he can and can't pee.\u000a\u000a"I almost never go to the restroom in a place I haven't been at least once before," he told me. He cuts appointments short and avoids going out simply to avoid peeing in public. Sometimes he'll find the one stall in a men's room is occupied, or out of order. Other times he sits on the toilet for longer than necessary because he worries it's suspicious a man would sit down to urinate.\u000a\u000a"It's not a good feeling to be a grown-up and wondering, 'Am I going to make it to a restroom on time -- and how do you explain it if you don't,'" he said.\u000a\u000aSuch fears apply not only to transgender people but also those who don't meet our rigid gender norms. In 2013, I met a female middle school student in Mississippi , for example, who told me her teachers wouldn't let her use the girl's restroom because she had short hair and wore hoodies. She looked too boyish.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Young and out in Mississippi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Young and out in Mississippi 03:15\u000a\u000aGendered restrooms support these biases.\u000a\u000a"We need a restroom revolution in this country," said Kathryn Anthony, an architecture professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\u000a\u000aI agree. And there are simple places to start. Restaurants and small businesses with two single-unit restrooms simply can paint over the "M" and "W" on their doors and -- ba-da-bing! -- they're gender inclusive. No one's harmed as long as we men stop peeing on the toilet seat.\u000a\u000aPhiladelphia recently made that concept law for single-stall bathrooms. Other governments and businesses should follow. (And if you're a business that is considering this sort of move, please send me a tweet ).\u000a\u000aThen, bigger leaps: The International Building Code should suggest all-gender restrooms become the norm, or at least be included, in larger businesses and public establishments. (That idea comes from Terry Kogan, a law professor at the University of Utah.)\u000a\u000aCity, state and federal governments also could legislate these restrooms into existence, too.\u000a\u000aIt won't happen immediately, but new construction and renovations could be subject to our updated understanding of which types of bathrooms are safest for everyone. That's the precedent set by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Kogan said.\u000a\u000aHarvey Molotch, a professor of sociology at New York University and co-editor of the book "Toilet: public restrooms and the politics of sharing," outlined for me what he considers to be the Holy Grail of restrooms. Walk in and you'd see a long line of private toilet stalls, with floor-to-ceiling doors. On the other side would be a row of communal sinks. Anyone is free to use any stall -- and there might be a row of urinals tucked away somewhere to the side.\u000a\u000aThe urinals could be left out of some restrooms, but they should be kept when possible, Molotch said, because they're much more water-efficient than sit-down toilets.\u000a\u000aAll this sounds wildly inoffensive to me.\u000a\u000aAnd it's already happening.\u000a\u000aThe Cooper Union, a college in New York, announced on March 18 that it is removing gender identification from restrooms on campus and opening single-occupancy toilets up for anyone's use. "We have always been ahead of our time and we must continue being leaders on issues of social justice," Bill Mea, acting president, wrote in an email to the campus\u000a\u000aThe Urban Justice Center, also in New York, made a similar move a decade ago.\u000a\u000a"I'm delighted to be able to share that our experiences have been wholly positive," the center's executive director, Doug Lasdon, and a development associate, Hugh Ryan, wrote in a recent op-ed in the Washington Post . "To this day, we have not received a single complaint. Not one in a decade. Nor have any incidents of violence or harassment been reported."\u000a\u000aThere's little counterargument other that bias and squeamishness.\u000a\u000aSheffield, the transgender man in Georgia, doesn't expect the all-gender restroom revolution to occur anytime soon. "If we could go to sleep tonight and wake up and all the bathrooms were gender neutral -- great! But it's not practical," he said. "It's not going to happen that way."\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, he said, a little courteousness would help.\u000a\u000a"We can't hold it," he said. "Trans people have to pee multiple times a day, just like everyone else."\u000a\u000aCurrently, there are only two places Sheffield feels comfortable peeing.\u000a\u000aOne's at home.\u000a\u000aThe other's at work.\u000a\u000aAnd that's because it's labeled "all gender restroom."

aVVladivostok, Russia (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin told an economic forum Thursday that the United States could be playing into North Korea 's hands by trying to ramp up pressure on Pyongyang.\u000a\u000a"It's counterproductive to inflate this military hysteria. This leads nowhere," Putin said, speaking alongside South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mongolian President Khaltmaa Battulga at the Eastern Economic Forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok.\u000a\u000aThe Russian leader has been unusually outspoken about North Korea and how the global community should respond in the wake of that country's sixth nuclear test on Sunday.\u000a\u000aMost countries have condemned North Korea, with the United States, Japan and South Korea pushing for strong sanctions to punish North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's minister of external economic relations, who is at the forum, said his country will "respond to barbaric attempts to exert pressure by the US by our strong countermeasures," according to the Russian state-run news agency Tass.\u000a\u000a"Attempts to use unprecedented aggressive sanctions and pressure to intimidate us and make us reverse our course are a huge mistake," said the minister, Kim Yong Jae.

"They count on a specific reaction from the partners and they get it. Why are you playing along with it? Have ever you thought about it?"\u000a\u000aPutin and Abe held a bilateral meeting Thursday, after which both leaders reiterated their countries shared a common understanding of the threat that North Korea poses.\u000a\u000aUS push for more UN action\u000a\u000aPutin's warnings haven't stopped the United States from trying to pursue a tough global response to the nuclear test, especially at the United Nations.\u000a\u000aWashington has proposed a new UN Security Council resolution, according to a UN diplomat, to punish North Korea by freezing the assets of Kim Jong Un and members of the ruling Worker's Party of Korea, fully banning exports of oil to North Korea, banning all textile imports from North Korea and banning North Korean laborers from generating earnings overseas.\u000a\u000a"The time for half-measures in the Security Council is over. The time has come to exhaust all of our diplomatic means before it's too late. We must now adopt the strongest possible measures," Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said earlier this week.\u000a\u000aHaley may have trouble getting other Security Council members -- especially Russia and China, which each hold veto power -- to sign onto the draft sanctions as they're currently written.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED China grapples with North Korea challenge Replay More Videos ...

Pyongyang looks at states such as Iraq -- where Saddam Hussein was overthrown by the United States, and Libya -- its late leader, Moammar Gadhafi, gave up his nuclear ambitions for sanctions relief and aid, only to be toppled and killed after the United States intervened in his country's civil unrest -- and believes that only being able to threaten the US mainland with a retaliatory nuclear strike can stop American military intervention. Many experts say they believe North Korea would not use the weapons first. Kim values his regime's survival above all else and knows the use of a nuclear weapon would start a war he could not win, analysts say.\u000a\u000a"They know it and they see nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction as the only way for them to protect themselves," Putin said Thursday.\u000a\u000aMoscow exports about 40,000 tons of oil to Pyonyang, a tiny percentage of Russia's overall trade, Putin said, according to Yoon.\u000a\u000aWhen asked about the new US proposal, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a news conference that China and the Security Council need to "take necessary measures."\u000a\u000a"China will make close communication with relevant parties with an objective, fair and responsible attitude," Wang said without commenting if China would agree to curb oil exports to North Korea.\u000a\u000a"We believe that sanctions as pressure are only half of the key to resolving the nuclear issue. The other half is dialogue and negotiation," he said. "Only when the two are put together can it unlock the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula."\u000a\u000aAnother missile test?\u000a\u000aSouth Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said his country expects its northern neighbor to test-fire the type of long-range missile designed to deliver a nuclear warhead to far-off places such as the United States on Saturday, an important North Korean holiday.\u000a\u000a"The situation is very grave. It doesn't seem much time is left before North Korea achieves its complete nuclear armament," Lee told a meeting of defense ministers Thursday in Seoul.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea has carried out military drills since Sunday's nuclear test. Also, the final parts of a controversial US-built missile defense system arrived at a base in Seongju, south of Seoul, greeted by throngs of protesters.\u000a\u000aRussia and China opposed the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system, saying it has the potential of fueling an arms race.\u000a\u000aAnalysts said the two are also concerned the system's advanced radar could be used to look inside their own countries or potentially even limit their deterrent capabilities.

aV(CNN) Apple cider vinegar is one of the most popular natural health products around, with claims for everything from sanitizing toothbrushes to whittling waistlines.\u000a\u000aBut how much of its popularity is based on hype? Could you be wasting your time or -- even worse -- harming your health?\u000a\u000aHere are 10 of the top ways people are using apple cider vinegar and what the science says.\u000a\u000aDiabetes\u000a\u000aWhat's the most popular use for apple cider vinegar? If a simple internet search is any measure, it involves diabetes.\u000a\u000aDietitian Carol Johnston has been studying the effects of the main component of any vinegar, acetic acid, on diabetic blood glucose levels since 2004. She's conducted 10 small randomly controlled studies and published six papers on the subject.\u000a\u000aHer studies indicate vinegar can help lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes; in those who are prediabetic, also called insulin-resistant; and even in healthy control subjects. The improvement was slight for all but those at risk for diabetes, she says.\u000a\u000a"In pre-diabetics, it was too good to be true," says Johnston, who is also associate director of the Arizona State University's School of Nutrition and Health. "It fell a good bit and stayed that way. It may be this is the group that could benefit the most."\u000a\u000aBut this antiglycemic response can be induced by any sort of vinegar, she says: red and white wine vinegars, pomegranate vinegar or even white distilled vinegar. She suggests adding it to salads, as in the Mediterranean diet, or diluting it in water and drinking it before a meal.\u000a\u000a"Basically, what acetic acid is doing is blocking the absorption of starch," Johnston says. "If my study subjects eat a starch and add vinegar, glucose will go down. But if they drink sugar water and add vinegar, nothing happens. So if you're having bacon and eggs, don't bother. It only helps if you are consuming a starch."\u000a\u000aIf you choose to use apple cider vinegar, be sure to tell your doctor, says nutritionist Lisa Drayer.\u000a\u000a"If you're taking a diabetes drug, the vinegar could amplify the effects of your meds," she warns, "and your doctor might want to adjust your dosage."\u000a\u000aMost important, if you're expecting vinegar to significantly alter or prevent diabetes, science suggests you reconsider.\u000a\u000aJohnston notes that there is no evidence, in her studies or others, to establish that connection.\u000a\u000a"I simply determine if your glucose level goes up and down," she says. "If I was to show that vinegar slows progression to diabetes, then I would need hundreds of people and millions of dollars to do the studies, because diabetes has a lot of causes, including genetics."\u000a\u000aWeight loss\u000a\u000aThe most cited study was done with 175 heavy but otherwise healthy Japanese subjects. The 12-week treatment produced lower body weight, body mass index, visceral fat, waist measurements and triglyceride levels. Sounds great, right?\u000a\u000a"People didn't really lose that much weight," Drayer says. "Only 2 to 4 pounds in three months over a placebo. That's only a third of a pound a week."\u000a\u000aJohnston agrees the study showed "a very, very modest weight loss.'\u000a\u000a"In fact, I would say most people who are on a diet for 12 weeks and only lose a couple of pounds aren't going to be very happy," she adds.\u000a\u000aIf you are using apple cider or other vinegars as one part of an overall plan, combining it with a healthy diet, portion control and exercise, it might help, Drayer says. She suggested using balsamic vinegar on salads, in a 4:1 ratio with oil, or adding it to sauces for poultry and fish.\u000a\u000aThe best way to consume apple cider vinegar is on your salad, experts say.\u000a\u000a"If you were doing all the other things to lose weight, it might give you a slight edge," Drayer says. "Also, if you're drinking it in water, that's good, as water makes you feel full."\u000a\u000a"Sometimes, people get really excited to try something new, and then their other behaviors change, too," she adds. "So if this helps people be more careful overall, that's a good thing."\u000a\u000aTeeth cleaning and whitening\u000a\u000a"Some people like to use it to remove stains and whiten their teeth," according to one of many online articles touting apple cider vinegar for this purpose: "To try this, rub a small amount of apple cider vinegar onto your teeth with a cotton swab."\u000a\u000a"I let out an audible gasp when I read about this!" says Chicago dentist and American Dental Association spokeswoman Alice Boghosian. "It made me cringe, to be honest with you. What are people doing?"\u000a\u000a"You're putting acid on your teeth," Boghosian continues, "the last thing you'd want to do to promote oral health. What would be a healthier option is to brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes, with a whitening toothpaste with the ADA seal. That shows it's been tested to do what it's supposed to do."\u000a\u000aOther articles promote rinsing your mouth with apple cider vinegar, soaking dentures with a diluted mixture or using it to clean a toothbrush.\u000a\u000a"You just have to rinse off your toothbrush, get all the toothpaste out, and let it air out. That's all you have to do," Boghosian says. "Cleaning dentures or rinsing with vinegar is not a good idea. It too could put your teeth at risk. And just think how it might affect the metal on partial dentures."\u000a\u000aA pH of 7 is neutral, explains Boghosian; anything less is acid. She said many of today's popular apple cider vinegars are in the 2 to 3 range -- about the same as stomach acid.\u000a\u000a"Anything acidic which contacts your teeth will wear out the enamel, the protective coating, and that will cause cavities," Boghosian adds. "So, this is totally, completely wrong, unless you want to be paying more visits to your dentist."\u000a\u000aSkin, hair and nails\u000a\u000aCommonly suggested uses for apple cider vinegar across the internet include it's use as a treatment for skin infections and acne, fighting lice and dandruff, as a natural wart remover and as an anti-aging treatment.\u000a\u000a"It will dry out a pimple, but it's not an anti-aging method," says dermatologist Dr. Marie Jhin, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Dermatology. "It might fade dark spots, or maybe you could use it as a skin toner, if you dilute it a great deal. But I wouldn't recommend it. We have much more effective and safe methods today than this."\u000a\u000aOne use she can agree with: "I do love it for bites, especially mosquito bites. It's a very underutilized home remedy. If you have a lot of bites, put two cups in a full tub of water and soak. It will help with itching," she says.\u000a\u000a"It can also help with sunburn, although there are so many other good remedies," Jhin adds. "We don't usually suggest that to patients."\u000a\u000aApple cider vinegar might help with dandruff, says Jihn, because the acidity could increase the sloughing of the skin on the scalp, and it does have some antifungal properties.\u000a\u000aBut don't turn to it to get rid of head lice. One study found the use of vinegar to be the least effective method among several natural solutions; only petroleum jelly killed adult louse, but it did next to nothing to fight the eggs.\u000a\u000a"I love vinegar for Another use Jhin recommends:"I love vinegar for paronychia , an infection under the cuticle that a lot of people get," Jhin says. She suggests mixing one-fourth cup of vinegar with three-fourths cup of water and soaking nails.\u000a\u000aBut what about warts and other home uses?\u000a\u000a"Warts are caused by a virus, so there's no cure," Jihn explains. "You can dab a diluted version of apple cider vinegar on a wart with a Q-tip, and it's going to help remove dead skin, which is what we do in the office by paring it down, cutting it out or burning it with liquid nitrogen. But it's not going to be as fast or effective as what we do in the office."\u000a\u000aAmerican Academy of Dermatology spokesman Dr. Michael Lin, director of the Advanced Dermatology and Skin Cancer Institute in Beverly Hills, has a more negative perspective on home use.\u000a\u000a"I've had quite a few patients harmed by apple cider vinegar," Lin explains. "One terrible example was a man trying to treat genital warts. When he came into the office, the entire area was raw, burned by the vinegar.\u000a\u000a"I don't know if he was using it full-strength, but whatever he was doing it was too strong," he continues. "He probably has permanent scarring from that natural home treatment."\u000a\u000aLin says he feels more comfortable recommending distilled white vinegar, as it is created to a standardized formulation of 5% acidity.\u000a\u000a"With apple cider vinegar, you don't know what strength you're getting," Lin says. "It's depends on the brand, and even among batches within a brand, you could get different concentrations of acidity."\u000a\u000a"If you do choose to use apple cider vinegar, try to buy a name brand that clearly labels the acidity level. And whatever you do, don't use it full-strength."\u000a\u000aHe suggests a 1:10 ratio.\u000a\u000aAll-purpose cleaner\u000a\u000aBecause of apple cider vinegar's antimicrobial properties, it is often suggested as a natural cleanser for the home.\u000a\u000aThe acid is effective against mold, but according to the Pesticide Research Institute , an environmental consulting firm, so are salt, lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide, tea tree oil and baking soda.\u000a\u000aMany of those also smell better.\u000a\u000aApple cider vinegar is biodegradable, and because of its low pH, it's great against alkaline grime such as hard water and mineral deposits, as well as soap scum.\u000a\u000aBut it won't cut grease. Why not? Just think of a simple oil and vinegar salad dressing. After mixing, the oil and vinegar quickly separate because oil is nonpolar, while vinegar and water are polar, meaning they are not attracted to each other.\u000a\u000aWill apple cider or other vinegars sanitize or disinfect your home? Probably not enough to make you feel germ-free.\u000a\u000a2000 study also showed vinegars to be quite effective against the waterborne bacteria That2000 study also showed vinegars to be quite effective against the waterborne bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa , mostly found in hospitals and untreated hot tubs. It was also effective against Salmonella choleraesuis, a rare pig-borne version of salmonella.\u000a\u000aIf you do choose to use a vinegar to clean your home, never mix it with bleach or ammonia, because it will create toxic chlorine or chloramine gases.\u000a\u000aFood preservatives\u000a\u000aUsed for centuries to preserve everything from pickles to pig's feet, vinegar is now becoming popular as a natural preservative in processed meat and poultry items as well.\u000a\u000aMost home pickling uses 5% distilled white vinegar because it doesn't affect the color of the vegetables or fruits, but apple cider vinegar is a popular choice due to its mellow, fruity flavor. Do know, however, that it will turn most fruits and veggies dark.\u000a\u000aAnother popular use for apple cider, and other vinegars, is as a food wash to reduce bacteria or viruses on the surface of fruits and vegetables. Studies have had varying results, often depending on the type of fruit or vegetable and the amount of time spent in the vinegar solution.\u000a\u000aApple cider and other vinegars is used by some as a food wash to reduce the number of bacteria or virus on fruits or vegetables.\u000a\u000aAfter listing a number of studies and results, the US Food and Drug Administration sums it up: "Vinegar and lemon juice have potential as inexpensive, simple household sanitizers; however, possible negative sensory effects [color, odor] when used on produce would be a disadvantage."\u000a\u000aCough and sore throat\u000a\u000aThe use of vinegar medicinally starts with the father of modern medicine, Hippocrates. He would mix it with honey and use it for chronic coughs and sore throats, and the suggestion continues today across the internet.\u000a\u000aMany parents might think this is a natural and safe option for their children. The American Academy of Pediatrics doesn't have an official stance on the use of apple cider or other vinegars as a health aid, but spokeswoman Dr. Jennifer Shu urges caution.\u000a\u000a"I would just think that the vinegar would irritate the throat even more," says Shu, an Atlanta pediatrician and author of "Food Fights". "But diluting it and mixing it with other ingredients such as salt or honey might decrease any pain that the vinegar might cause."\u000a\u000aThe University of Arizona's Johnston cautions against trying any vinegar straight, due to the risk of inhaling the liquid and damaging the lungs.\u000a\u000a"Vinegar has that strong smell and puckering taste, so if you take a breath, you could inhale it into your lungs as you swallow," she says. "It can burn the lungs a little, because it is an acid."\u000a\u000a"It can also burn your esophagus," says Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado. "And if you're predisposed to reflux, ulcers or stomach problems, it could certainly make those worse."\u000a\u000aHeart disease and cancer\u000a\u000aIf you're a rat worried about heart disease, put apple cider and other vinegars on your shopping list.\u000a\u000aStudies show the vinegar can reduce blood pressure triglycerides and total cholesterol in rodents fed a high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet. But similar studies have not been conducted in humans.\u000a\u000aFreeman, who serves on the American College of Cardiology's prevention board, says there could be some benefit due to its antioxidant properties, like other heart-healthy fruits and vegetables, such as broccoli and blueberries.\u000a\u000a"The data is not particularly strong or overwhelming, but vascular health may be enhanced," Freeman says. "What's best to avoid heart disease is to exercise and eat a low-fat, plant-based diet."\u000a\u000aFreeman further recommends using apple cider or other vinegars on salads, to maximize the benefits and reduce any reactions to the acidity.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aStudies in humans are nonexistent.\u000a\u000aSo, does apple cider vinegar measure up to its positive internet reputation?

aV(CNN) "American Horror Story: Cult" clearly intends to be provocative, using the toxic partisan political divide -- beginning with the 2016 presidential election -- as its jumping-off point. But producer Ryan Murphy's anthology series is too blunt an instrument to effectively probe that terrain, using the equivalent of an axe where a scalpel is required.\u000a\u000aAs a consequence, the opening chapters of the program's seventh edition feel as if they're exploiting the current climate as much as commenting upon it. And while the characteristically acerbic writing includes witty barbs and observations -- from those sporting MAGA hats to latte-sipping liberals -- the finer points are lost in lurid imagery and cheap scares, masquerading as smart TV.\u000a\u000a"Horror Story" regulars Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters again anchor the show, which opens with 90 seconds of news footage building toward election night. Peters' Kai sits alone exulting in Trump's victory, while Paulson's Ally melts into tears, aghast at what this political turn means for the nation as well as her wife Ivy (Alison Pill) and their young son.\u000a\u000aThe outcome, however, doesn't just unsettle Ally, but also unleashes a series of dormant phobias, including her fear of (sigh) homicidal clowns. She and her wife also retain a nanny, Winter (Billie Lourd, last seen in Murphy's "Scream Queens"), who might be the creepiest domestic since "Young Frankenstein's" Frau Blucher.\u000a\u000aAs noted, there are some clever asides scattered throughout, starting with a progressive's complaint about CNN not providing a "trigger warning" before announcing that Trump had won. Everything about the show, moreover, has been constructed to highlight partisan rifts, setting the story in Michigan (a state Trump narrowly won) and flitting around to topics like gun rights, race relations and immigration.\u000a\u000aRead More

She is the love and relationship ambassador for AARP and writes the Naked Truth column for AARP.org. She is also a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit organization that gathers research on American families. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) -- Some revolutions happen in a single day; others over decades. The rise of the voluntarily single woman has been happening in Western societies slowly, over time, concomitant with well-paying jobs, legal protection from economic or physical abuse, reliable birth control and the possibility of fulfilling careers and adventures.\u000a\u000aWomen are marrying at a later age these days, cohabiting with their partners or going in and out of short-term relationships without ever walking down the aisle.\u000a\u000aCurrently, 53% of women over 18 are in the singles column. Put another way, women now have choices that allow them to customize the arc of their lives and some of them find that it is best for them to put marriage aside.\u000a\u000aIs this natural? Is this bad? Is this cause for alarm?\u000a\u000aWe have long counted on women's sacrifices and the compromises they've made to lift societies all over the world. We are worried that if women delay or forgo marriage, the all-important family unit will suffer.\u000a\u000aAs much as I admire happy couples and families, I think this may be one of the few times in history when so many women could choose from such a full range of life choices without penalty or stigma. Since few people "have it all," why not choose being single if that's the best option?\u000a\u000aWhat it comes down to is people get married when it's a good deal. The question is why isn't marriage a good deal anymore? Here are some considerations.\u000a\u000a1. A useless husband\u000a\u000aIf a woman is poor and only meets equally poor or poorer men, she's in a tough spot. It is no secret that many women do not choose to marry if the available partners will make their economic situation worse.\u000a\u000aIn some of these cases, even if a woman has a child, she may be better off with government help than a nonworking, noninvolved husband.\u000a\u000a2. Success changes everything\u000a\u000aWhen a woman is very privileged or highly successful, marriage could come very easily -- or not. Think of the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times. Or Oprah Winfrey, who for personal or professional reasons, is not married.\u000a\u000aMoreover, a woman doesn't need a husband who is a high-powered corporate attorney if she is a high-powered corporate attorney. Taking advantage of economic and professional opportunities could be undermined by committing to a partner with an equally ambitious, or different, life agenda. This kind of woman may wake up every day to new and exciting challenges and think, "best to wait."\u000a\u000a3. Unwilling to make traditional compromises\u000a\u000aA woman who doesn't want to settle for cooking and cleaning and being the primary parent that society prefers. She is not meeting guys who want the kind of woman she is.\u000a\u000a4. The marriage penalty tax\u000a\u000aSome women are in an income bracket where marriage inflicts economic costs. She would have to pay more taxes if she marries someone who earns approximately what she makes or more.\u000a\u000a5. Avoiding cheating men\u000a\u000aA few years ago when I was in China, I had a conversation with some very beautiful female Chinese TV personalities about their personal life. I asked them why they were single and if they wanted to get married.\u000a\u000aThe three women all said they didn't want to marry because "the men of our class will all expect to have mistresses, and it is better not to marry than have to put up with that." I have no idea if this was an exaggeration or not -- but they believed it.\u000a\u000a6. Waiting for the "one"\u000a\u000aThese women wait for the perfect guy, or the guy who they would fall in love with and love them back just as much. If that man doesn't come along, they prefer to go alone. As women get pickier, more factors enter into the marriage equation.\u000a\u000aThey may find someone who doesn't quite go the distance even after years of dating. They cohabit with someone and it doesn't work out. Singlehood, never intentional, becomes a fact. But they will not marry just to marry as their mothers or grandmothers might have.\u000a\u000aIn social psychology, there is a classic theory called "exchange theory." It is a bit cold-blooded, but it predicts that a person's actions will be based on trying to find a balance of give and get. Each person's resources -- of all kinds, including money, looks, background -- are traded back and forth for a "good deal." For example, a "good deal" scenario could be a woman who makes an excellent living pairing up with a man who is a writer and is willing to work at home and be the primary child care person.\u000a\u000aWhen women's life choices were highly constrained, they had little negotiating power. They had to marry or were seen as damaged. A few got away with being "free spirits" but usually they were exceptional in wealth or lineage -- and even so, it wasn't easy.\u000a\u000aIt's different now. While most women still want marriage, they don't want it at just any price. They don't want it if it scuttles their dreams. Marriage is not dead -- not by a long shot. It is still, to most of us, the house we wish to build for our love, our lover and our children.\u000a\u000aBut women want to craft a life instead of having it pressed upon them. And that means some of us will be single for a long time, and some of us will be single for life.\u000a\u000aRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine\u000a\u000aFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\u000a\u000aJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion

aV(CNN) There have been times even Roger Federer has thought of walking away from it all.\u000a\u000aA stage before his name was immortalized and the records fell; a period in his glittering career when defeat was more common than victory.\u000a\u000a"It was tough," Federer tells CNN Sport, reflecting on his early years on the ATP Tour.\u000a\u000a"When I traveled internationally I would get beat up very often in the first round 6-2, 6-3. You go home and realize: 'Okay, you're good in Basel but you're not very good in the world.'"\u000a\u000aFederer knew he had a bright future \u2014 a junior Wimbledon title at the age of 16 proved that \u2014 but it took him three years to win his first ATP final.\u000a\u000aAs a boy he would often cry if he lost a match, hiding behind the umpire's chair. As he entered his adolescence, that sensitivity occasionally took the form of petulance.\u000a\u000a"When I was 12 years old, I was just horrible," Federer admitted in a 2003 interview with the Telegraph.\u000a\u000aOnlooking parents were banished and told to "go and have a drink." Rackets, on more than one occasion, were smashed.\u000a\u000aFederer, urbane idol to millions around the world, even walked away from one professional tournament on the Swiss circuit having made a financial loss, after the referee deemed he had violated the "best effort" ruling.\u000a\u000aIt took time to master his emotions and reach the state of tranquility he emanates on court today. It also required sacrifice, with Federer having to decide between football and tennis as a teen.\u000a\u000aAsked by CNN Sport earlier this year what separates the great from the good, he takes a second to consider.\u000a\u000a"His aura, his longevity," Federer replies. "What did he bring to his sport? Did he change the sport forever? What was his impact?\u000a\u000a"Popularity, style ... Was he a good role model? I think all of these things matter."\u000a\u000aBoy to man\u000a\u000aHis talent has never been in doubt.\u000a\u000aAfter emerging victorious in both the singles and the doubles on the 1998 junior circuit at the All England Club, Federer reached the final of the junior US Open and won Florida's Orange Bowl Championship \u2014 joining a prestigious group of former champions including Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Björn Borg.\u000a\u000a"I went from boy to man a little bit," he says. "My body grew ... I realized I could serve big [and] all of a sudden hang with tour players.\u000a\u000a"I knew there was nobody better than the tour players; that's when the dream became a reality.\u000a\u000aA teenage Federer is pictured relaxing on a beach in Key Biscayne, Florida.\u000a\u000a"Who knows," the young man thought, "maybe I could become top 100 in the world at one point?"\u000a\u000aFittingly enough the Bernese Alps were the scene of his first ever ATP tournament, with Federer traveling to the clay-court Swiss Open in Gstaad.\u000a\u000aThe No. 702 bowed out in the first round in straight sets, but he wouldn't have to wait long before his first breakthrough.\u000a\u000aSeptember 30, 1998: The day the best male tennis player of all time secured the first of over 1,000 career match victories on the ATP tour, beating world No. 45 Guillame Raoux at the Toulouse Open.\u000a\u000aFederer went on to reach the quarterfinals in what was just his second ever ATP tournament, losing to the eventual winner, Jan Siemerink.\u000a\u000aIt moved him up over 400 places in the world rankings, and secured a wildcard spot at the upcoming Swiss Indoors \u2014 a tournament he'd been a ballboy at just four years before.\u000a\u000aThere he faced none other than eight-time grand slam winner Andre Agassi in the first round \u2014 a brush with the big boys that lasted less than an hour.\u000a\u000aThe Federer decade\u000a\u000aAt the turn of the millennium, Federer was the youngest man in the top 100 and the tennis world was sitting up and taking notice.\u000a\u000a"I was nervous," Federer says, admitting it was still a novelty trading shots with established stars.\u000a\u000a"I'd always wanted to be in that position ... playing against the guys you knew from TV, it was super cool."\u000a\u000aThe carpets of the Milan Indoors were the scene of Federer's first ever ATP trophy in February 2001, but the watershed moment of his early career occurred five months later at Wimbledon.\u000a\u000aThe king of Wimbledon, Pete Sampras, is dethroned.\u000a\u000aPete Sampras vs. Federer. The king vs. the young pretender. The first and only time the boy from Basel would ever play against his idol. A changing of the guard.\u000a\u000aComing into the fourth round clash, Sampras had more grand slam singles titles than any man in history, and hadn't lost a single match at the All England Club for five years -- only failing to win the prestigious tournament once between 1993 and 2000.\u000a\u000aHe left quietly, dethroned by a teenager.\u000a\u000a"There are a lot of young guys coming up," Sampras reflected , "but Roger is a bit extra special."\u000a\u000aFederer himself puts his success down to "drive" as much as transcendental talent.\u000a\u000aFor while the young Swiss was knocked out by home favorite Tim Henman in the 2001 quarterfinal, and stung by Croatian grand slam debutant Mario Ancic in the Wimbledon first round a year later, he's been returning to Centre Court ever since like he owned the place.\u000a\u000a"When you're young, it's very important to have that drive \u2014 even when you're defeated \u2014 to go back and hit up against a wall or a cupboard like I did," Federer says.\u000a\u000a"You do maybe take the hammer and the nail and put the racket up against a wall and say I'm going to walk away from it all ... but five minutes later you're going to pick it up again and you're going to play again. Hard work is key. Probably more than 50% of success at that point."\u000a\u000aAfter that shock defeat to Ancic, ranked No. 158 at the time, Federer didn't lose again on grass for six years.\u000a\u000aFrom July 2003 to September 2007, the game's undisputed star won 12 of the 18 Grand Slam titles on offer, sweeping aside all before him in Melbourne, London and New York.\u000a\u000aAn Olympic gold medal followed in Beijing, but one final frontier still eluded him: Roland Garros.\u000a\u000aThe career grand slam\u000a\u000aClay was the domain of another man, Rafa Nadal, and between 2006 and 2008 Federer had fallen to the Spaniard in three consecutive finals.\u000a\u000aJune 7, 2009: The day Federer finally lifted La Coupe des Mousquetaires, beating Sweden's Robin Soderling to equal Sampras's major record (14) and complete the coveted career grand slam.\u000a\u000aFederer called it his "greatest victory," breaking down in tears before a packed crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, telling them "now I can play in peace for the rest of my career."\u000a\u000aRoger Federer kisses the French Open trophy, having beaten Sweden's Robin Söderling (6-1, 7-6, 6-4) to complete the career grand slam.\u000a\u000aDetractors had questioned his desire, asking whether this elegant artisan was really up for the long slog on clay.\u000a\u000aBut Federer sat down with CNN Sport that day with the proof in his hands.\u000a\u000a"I always believed that I was good enough to get it," he said, "but actually holding this trophy after all that I've been through is an unbelievable feeling."\u000a\u000a"This victory comes at the right time because I've proved many people wrong."\u000a\u000aAsked what was left to motivate him after reaching the pinnacle of his sport, Federer alluded to his first ever Wimbledon victory.\u000a\u000a"It was all I ever wanted," he smiled. "But I kept coming back and won it again and again and again."\u000a\u000a"That's what champions want to do: they want to come back and prove themselves over and again.\u000a\u000a"I love the game too much to walk away from it; it's given me all I ever wanted."\u000a\u000aA rivalry revisited\u000a\u000aIf Martina Navratilova had echoed the prevailing sentiment in 2009 when she said the newly-crowned French Open champion could now "just go on and sip Margaritas for the rest of his life," Federer himself had no intention of letting up.\u000a\u000aHis 2017 Australian Open final win against Rafa Nadal was a triumph of longevity \u2014 his first major title for five years and one that and that made him the oldest male grand slam winner since Roy Emerson in 1967.\u000a\u000a"It's really strange to me," the 35-year-old told CNN Sport in January, having expected to reach "a fourth round or a quarterfinal" at best.\u000a\u000a"The first time I actually believed I could win the title was maybe Saturday or Sunday morning; I just started seeing flashes of me with the trophy."\u000a\u000aHad Federer not fought back from 3-1 down in the fifth set \u2014 beating his friend and long-time nemesis in a major final for the first time in ten years \u2014 Nadal could have closed the all-time gap between them to just two grand slams with his favored French Open to follow.\u000a\u000aNow though Federer's tally of 18 looks unlikely to be beaten.

aVWashington (CNN) Shortly before Sen. John McCain entered the Senate chamber in the wee hours of Friday morning, reporters wanted to know how he'd vote.\u000a\u000aHe instructed them to "watch the show."\u000a\u000aMcCain killed his party's narrowly-crafted Obamacare repeal bill Friday not because he was opposed to dismantling the Affordable Care Act, but because he fundamentally believed the process -- the lack of hearings, the one-party, closed-door negotiations, the fact that in the end all that Republican senators could agree upon was a shell of the plan they'd promised -- was flawed.\u000a\u000aIt was a result that may have been hinted at earlier in the week.\u000a\u000aLess than two weeks after surgery to remove a blood clot revealed McCain had brain cancer, the Arizona Republican -- still with a visible scar above his eye -- traveled 2,000 miles from Phoenix and returned to a hero's welcome Tuesday in the Senate, where he delivered an epic 15-minute speech that rattled the conscience of the body.\u000a\u000a"We're getting nothing done, my friends," McCain told his colleagues. "We're getting nothing done."\u000a\u000aIt was a fiery and intense lecture on the shortcomings of bypassing "regular order" and turning your back on compromise. But moments earlier, McCain had delivered a decisive vote to advance a health care bill that was still an uncertain product at that point, a kind of blessing for the type of secretive negotiations he'd just decried.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The life and career of Sen.

In the end, the senator voted against a bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act's individual and employer mandates, despised by Republicans, and against his party's seven-year campaign promise to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. Instead, McCain took a vote that very well may re-chart the course of Trump's own legislative agenda.\u000a\u000aTrump, of course, had insulted McCain back in 2015.

aV(CNN) There was a time when Barcelona fans did not expect success. To wallow in pessimism was the accepted norm. Trophies? Titles? They were for others, usually the reserve of the grandiose club of the capital, Real Madrid.\u000a\u000aThe European Cup was as elusive as the unicorn: talked about, looked at with wonder, pictured with others but never seen in this Catalonian city by the Mediterranean sea.\u000a\u000aA club like Barcelona, the nihilistic fans would say, would never reach the zenith of European club football. There was no bombast, no peacocking, just fatalism.\u000a\u000aThe ironhanded years of General Francisco Franco, whose dictatorial regime had crushed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy, had ruined the spirit.\u000a\u000aTrue, Barcelona had been able to sign football greats such as Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona, but two European Cup finals -- in 1961 and 1986 -- had ended in defeat and between 1961 and 1990, the club won just two league titles in Spain's top flight, finishing runners up 13 times.\u000a\u000aBut all changed on May 20, 1992.\u000a\u000aThat was the day Barcelona won its first European Cup. That was the day the club, its city, and football was transformed.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Xavi hails Barca's 1992 Dream Team Replay More Videos ...

His battle cry as he sends his men out onto the Wembley turf? "Go out there and enjoy it."\u000a\u000a"It was more than a thorn in their side. It was something that was almost mythical, to get to that final and win it."\u000a\u000aFull-time turns into extra-time and the score remains goalless. Knees are knocking, in the stands and in the dugout. Penalties are looming. Fear.\u000a\u000aBut with less than 10 minutes remaining Barcelona is awarded a free-kick. Koeman, the sweeper with a sniper's eye for long-range goals, steps forward.\u000a\u000aWatching on television in Barcelona is a teenaged Xavi, an academy player who would go on to become one of the club's greats.\u000a\u000a"It was truly an extraordinary experience," the former Spain and Barcelona midfielder tells CNN as he remembers the match unfolding.\u000a\u000aTwenty-five yards from goal, Koeman shoots. He aims low towards the bottom corner. Defenders rush forwards, breaking from the defensive wall. The goalkeeper stretches and dives to his right. But they're all too late. They are beaten.\u000a\u000aKoeman scored 102 goals in 354 games during his career\u000a\u000aThe goalscorer sprints towards the sidelines and his teammates follow, swallowing him up in a jubilant wave of orange shirts when he is caught.\u000a\u000aWhen the blond Dutchman emerges from the celebratory mass, he is hiding his face in his hands, using his fingertips to hold back tears.\u000a\u000aHis is the winning goal, a strike which unshackles his club from the heavy weight of history. "It was the beginning of big changes," Koeman, who pulled on Barca's blue and garnet shirt over his orange top before lifting the European Cup, would later say.\u000a\u000aCruyff's Dream Team won four successive league titles between 1990 and 1994\u000a\u000aThe genius from Amsterdam\u000a\u000aCruyff had made an impact at the Camp Nou as a player, winning the title in his first season following a world-record move in 1973, but it was the Dutchman's appointment as coach in 1988 that changed the club's DNA.\u000a\u000aOn May 4, when Cruyff is announced as Barcelona's coach, the team is experiencing its worst season since 1941-42. The club is in debt and in crisis. They go on to finish sixth in the league, two points off 10th place, while Real Madrid celebrate a fifth straight La Liga title. Ignominy.\u000a\u000aHe had, Cruyff said, inherited players who "wanted to have fights about the past."\u000a\u000aCruyff died, aged 68, in 2016\u000a\u000aIn planning for the future a manic period of departures and arrivals follows -- 15 players are sold and 12 are bought. Cruyff, one of the greatest players of all time, took risks but rewards followed.\u000a\u000aAmong the newcomers are the young and eager Txiki Begiristain, Jose Mari Bakero, Julio Salinas and Eusebio Sacristan, a quartet which would become crucial cogs in the manager's Dream Team.\u000a\u000a"They were conditioned to coming second," says Hunter of the Barcelona squad Cruyff inherited.\u000a\u000a"He felt there was a losing mentality around Catalonia itself and that this was a product of years of oppression under the Franco dictatorship. Commenting on another tragic day had become a habit."\u000a\u000aTo accompany the change of personnel, came a shift in style. Naturally, Cruyff -- a three-time European Cup winner with Ajax -- wanted to win, but there was a way of winning. A philosophy, an identity.\u000a\u000aIn the era of 4-4-2, the young manager introduced the 3-4-3 formation -- an adaptation of the 4-3-3 system Cruyff had played under the coaching pioneer Rinus Michels for the Netherlands and Ajax in the 1970s.\u000a\u000aCruyff reached the 1974 World Cup final with the Netherlands, who were lauded for their 'Total Football' style, but were beaten 2-1 by West Germany\u000a\u000a"We couldn't believe how many attackers were in the team," Eusebio, who made more than 250 appearances under Cruyff, said of the day the boss first drew three defenders, four midfielders, two out-and-out wingers and a center-forward on the blackboard.\u000a\u000aThis radical change would require players to be comfortable interchanging positions. They would have to press, they would have to pass swiftly. Possession would reign supreme, which was not an easy task in a club where defenders were usually jeered for passing the ball back to the goalkeeper.\u000a\u000aFor Cruyff to implement this cerebral approach, he needed a production line to supply him with possession-hungry players. Cue the overhauling of La Masia, the club's academy. Barcelona would never be the same again.\u000a\u000aDifferentiating Barcelona from the rest\u000a\u000aEvery team, from the under-eights to Barcelona's B team, were ordered to play the revolutionary 3-4-3, with an emphasis on technique rather than physique, another volte-face for a club which, as recently as 1986, selected young players based on whether they would be taller than 1.80m.\u000a\u000aFirst off the conveyor belt were Albert Ferrer, Guillermo Amor and Guardiola, the 1992 history-makers.\u000a\u000aFor Carlos Hugo Garcia Bayon, a former assistant coach at Barcelona B, winning the European Cup with academy graduates in the side was confirmation that Cruyff's methods worked.\u000a\u000aBayon tells CNN: "It was that victory which changed the culture and mentality of the club. They won the European Cup, but won it playing a specific style and with a lot of players from La Masia.\u000a\u000a"It was something unique, something that differentiated us from others.\u000a\u000a"Without a doubt, if you have a methodology and that methodology doesn't win, you are going to lose confidence to play players from the academy."\u000a\u000aCesc Fabregas, one of La Masia's graduates, holds aloft the World Cup trophy after Spain won the 2010 final\u000a\u000aFrom that famous Wembley win, other world class seedlings blossomed at the La Masia hothouse: Xavi, Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas, to name but a few.\u000a\u000aAll of them, bar Messi, integral to not only Barcelona's success but that of the Spain team which won the World Cup in 2010 and two consecutive European Championships in 2008 and 2012.\u000a\u000a"They were the generation who paved the way for us," says Xavi of the European Cup-winning Dream Team. "They gave Barcelona a winning mentality. It was an example for all of us."\u000a\u000aHunter says academy players grew up "thinking anything was possible" after seeing the likes of Guardiola succeed on the biggest stage of all.\u000a\u000a"The brand of football we saw from 2003-12, the unbroken stretch of success, those types of players, the promotion from the youth system, the attitude, the winning mentality, all of these have geneses in the Wembley victory over Sampdoria," he says.\u000a\u000a'Now you have it here'\u000a\u000aFrom Wembley to Barcelona and a dizzying week of celebrations for the club's European pioneers.\u000a\u000aOn the balcony of Placa de Sant Jaume, stood Cruyff's men, soaking up the adulation of their fans, holding aloft the European Cup. Fantasy had become reality.\u000a\u000aA 21-year-old Guardiola, the Catalan symbol, shouted: "Citizens of Catalonia -- now you have it here."\u000a\u000aThe midfielder, says Hunter, had prepared in advance, modifying a phrase used by Josep Tarradellas, named "President in absentia" by his people in 1954 during the Franco dictatorship, when on the same balcony in the city's gothic quarter 15 years earlier.\u000a\u000aThe Dream Team's European success, combined with the Olympic Games which was held in the city later that summer, transformed Barcelona and its people.\u000a\u000aHunter describes the summer of 92 as the "one of the most important summers in the history of Barcelona and Catalonia."\u000a\u000aThe football club, whose slogan is 'more than a club' for its defense of the Catalan culture and language, became Catalonia's most important institution. The radical shift was not solely on the pitch.\u000a\u000aSpreading the Cruyff gospel\u000a\u000aNovember 25, 2012, the day the teachings of Cruyff, his vision for a team full of La Masia pass masters becomes reality.\u000a\u000aBarcelona is playing Levante in a league game. In the 14th minute Martin Montoya replaces Brazilian full-back Dani Alves. It is the first time in Barcelona's history that the entire first team comprises of players who graduated through the club's now famed academy. It is the legacy of Cruyff and the 1992 European Cup win.\u000a\u000a"La Masia is a football school but also a school of values, a school of life," explains Xavi.\u000a\u000a"It is something to feel proud about. We now have 20 to 25 years of harvesting titles for Barcelona and playing an attractive style of football for the fans."\u000a\u000aGuardiola won 14 trophies from a possible 19 in his four years as Barcelona coach\u000a\u000aGuardiola, the great player who became the club's most successful coach, has often said that he and other Barcelona managers have simply been restoring, or improving, the chapel that Cruyff painted.\u000a\u000aThe Catalan himself created a football masterpiece, winning 14 trophies in four golden seasons between 2008 and 2012 with one of the greatest teams in history, the heart of which were other wordly academy talents.\u000a\u000aFor Bayon, currently academy director at Celta Vigo, the transformation of the Dream Team from playing greats to high-class managers is another lasting legacy of that 1992 win, with Cruyff's former players spreading his gospel in various leagues around the world.\u000a\u000aIn England there is Guardiola at Manchester City and Koeman at Everton, while Eusebio is in La Liga. The latter two are being linked with succeeding Luis Enrique as Barca boss when he leaves at the end of this season.\u000a\u000aThere are others too: Michael Laudrup managing in Qatar, Txiki Begiristain, an unused substitute at Wembley, as sporting director at Manchester City and Andoni Zubizarreta in Marseille as the French club's sporting director.\u000a\u000a"They have become great managers, that's one of the most important thing from that victory. It generated a culture of coaching. It is not only to generate great players, but great coaches," says Bayon.\u000a\u000aAn identity changed\u000a\u000aAnd so, to the future. What about the Barcelona of today?\u000a\u000aUnder Enrique, who will depart at the end of the season having won the Champions League and two Spanish titles, does the legacy of Wembley 1992 still run through the side like letters in a stick of rock?\u000a\u000aOf the title-chasing Barcelona team which started in the 4-1 victory over Las Palmas on May 14, only four players -- Sergio Busquets, Messi, Iniesta and Jordi Alba -- had played for the academy. Alba, released by the club in 2005, was repatriated seven years later at a cost of 14 million euros ($15.49m) from Valencia.\u000a\u000aPossession has not always been king for Enrique's Barcelona, although there have been significant departures during the Spaniard's reign.\u000a\u000aAged 35, Xavi left in 2015 to play in Qatar, following another academy great, Carles Puyol, who retired in 2014, out of the Camp Nou.\u000a\u000aSuarez, Messi and Neymar have been lethal goalscorers for Luis Garcia's Barcelona\u000a\u000a"No youth system will be able to produce that generation repeatedly on demand," says Hunter. "It's just not feasible, but the tail-off has been pretty dramatic and has inevitably changed the football Barcelona play.\u000a\u000a"When you sign from outside they don't have the same aptitude, they don't speak the same football language.\u000a\u000a"There are fewer youth products available to Enrique than there were to (Frank) Riijkard and Guardiola and it's also been a strategic idea that the front three -- Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez -- need to be given the ball more quickly and with less elaboration because they're different strikers to any in the club's history.\u000a\u000a"They need less work, they're able to score on their own so the midfield is sometimes bypassed.\u000a\u000a"The identity of the first-team football in the last two-and-a-half years has significantly changed, but the actual existence of the youth system in unchallenged, it's part of their identity."\u000a\u000aIfs, buts, maybes\u000a\u000aGuardiola has already said he would vote for Pique should his former run for president at Barcelona.\u000a\u000aIs this the closing chapter of a glorious Cruyff-inspired quarter of a century of success? Not quite.\u000a\u000aIn Xavi, Pique, Busquets and Puyol, Barcelona could have former pupils as zealous off the pitch for their brilliance on it.\u000a\u000aXavi has already said he dreams of one day managing his former club and has divulged a plan which would have the club run exclusively by former La Masia graduates, with Pique as president, Puyol as sporting director and Busquets as his assistant.\u000a\u000a"If we talk in 10 years' time, I imagine some president will have attempted, and succeed, in appointing Xavi as first-team coach, with Busquets as his assistant," says Hunter.\u000a\u000a"It's Pique's declared intent to run for presidency at one stage of his life. That would be the most dramatic induction of Cruyff and Guardiola values into the club."\u000a\u000aAcademy graduate Messi is Barcelona's all-time leading goalscorer, netting over 500 times for the club\u000a\u000aHow different would Barcelona's history be had they not won in 1992?\u000a\u000aThe trophy cabinet tells a story: Three league titles in the 25 years leading up to the Dream Team's European Cup success, 13 thereafter and four nights of Champions League glory -- a total of 44 trophies in 25 years and their status as one of the sport's dominant forces fixed.\u000a\u000aPessimism replaced with confidence, fatalism defeated, and the club's global status only reinforced by the style -- dubbed tiki-taka -- that accompanied that success.\u000a\u000aHad Barcelona not won in 1992, they may have had greater motivation, Hunter argues, in the 1994 Champions League final against AC Milan, which they lost 4-0.\u000a\u000a"They were complacent, they believed they would win for sure," he says.\u000a\u000aBut without European success under Cruyff there is less glue to hold his system in place.\u000a\u000a"You can't say whether they would have won other Champions Leagues because each of the Champions Leagues subsequently won after 1992 have direct lineage to Cruyff and his beliefs," says Hunter.\u000a\u000a"With no trophy under Cruyff then Barcelona's history is subsequently going to be much poorer and the trophy cabinet is going to be more barren.\u000a\u000a"No European Cup win under Cruyff and the subsequent history, which we've become so used to -- the signing of Messi, the recruitment of Iniesta -- probably wouldn't have happened."

aV(CNN) There's a common saying in Catholic charity circles: We don't help people because they're Catholic, we help them because we are.\u000a\u000aTo understand that sentiment is to understand why so many Catholics were incensed by accusations from a former Trump administration official on Thursday that the church has an ulterior motive in advocating on behalf of undocumented immigrants to the United States.\u000a\u000a"The bishops have been terrible on this," Steve Bannon, who until recently was President Donald Trump's chief strategist, said in an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes." "You know why? Because, unable to come to grips with the problems in the church, they need illegal aliens. They need illegal aliens to fill the churches. ... They have an economic interest."\u000a\u000a"Boy, that's a tough thing to say about your church," answered the interviewer, Charlie Rose, noting that Bannon himself is Catholic.\u000a\u000aBannon responded that on doctrinal issues, he respects Catholic leaders, naming Pope Francis and Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York.\u000a\u000aBut immigration policy is "not about doctrine," Bannon said. "It's about the sovereignty of a nation. And in that regard, they're just another guy with an opinion."\u000a\u000aBannon's comments larded insult on top of injury, Catholic leaders said. On Tuesday, Trump announced the end of a program known as DACA that had protected from deportation nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. Many Catholic bishops strongly opposed the move, calling it "heartless" and "reprehensible"\u000a\u000aTheir reaction to Bannon's comments was just as unequivocal.\u000a\u000aCatholic bishops, and particularly their American umbrella group, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, like to position themselves above the partisan fray, rarely responding to political jabs. But in this case, they quickly counter-punched.\u000a\u000aJames Rogers, the USCCB's chief spokesman, called Bannon's comments "preposterous" and accused the conservative agitator of presenting a false choice between compassion and security.\u000a\u000a"Our pro-immigration stance is based on fidelity to God's word and honors the American dream. For anyone to suggest that it is out of sordid motives of statistics or financial gain is outrageous and insulting."\u000a\u000aIn an interview on Sirius Radio, Dolan responded in kind. "I don't really care to go into what I think is a preposterous and rather insulting statement that the only reason we bishops care for immigrants is for the economic because we want to fill our churches and get more money."\u000a\u000aBut in one regard, Bannon is correct, Dolan said. Immigration is not necessarily a matter of Catholic doctrine. In some ways, it's deeper than that. It comes from the Bible and Jesus himself.\u000a\u000a"And the Bible is so clear, so clear, that to treat the immigrant with dignity and respect, to make sure that society is just in its treatment of the immigrant is Biblical mandate," Dolan said.\u000a\u000a"It's clear in the Old Testament -- my Jewish neighbors remind me of that all the time -- and it's clear from the lips of Jesus when he said, 'Whatever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me. When I was a stranger -- meaning an immigrant or a refugee -- you welcomed me.'"\u000a\u000aWhat Bannon got right\u000a\u000aBannon was right about one thing: Latino immigrants are providing a lifeline to the Catholic Church in the United States.\u000a\u000aAs non-Latino white Catholics have left the church in droves during recent decades, Latino immigrants have flooded in to take their place. The turnover has produced tension in some parishes , but on the whole, Catholics have taken pains to welcome Latinos into their new, American congregations.\u000a\u000aAccording to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, more than a quarter of American Catholics (27%) were born outside the country, mostly from the Americas; and one out of three American Catholics now identify as Latino or Hispanic.\u000a\u000aThat number is expected to grow: Christians are by far the majority of documented and undocumented immigrants to the United States, Pew has found. Of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in 2011, for example, 82% were Christian, mostly from Latin America.\u000a\u000aBut Catholic bishops have never argued that Latino Catholics -- or any Christians -- should get special treatment from US immigration authorities. In fact, they've said the opposite.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump announced in January that Christian refugees would be given priority under his administration, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops strongly disagreed.\u000a\u000a"We believe in assisting all those who are vulnerable and freeing persecution, regardless of their religion. This includes Christians, as well as Yazidis and Shia Muslims from Syria, Rohingyas from Burma, and other religious minorities," said Bishop Joe S. Vásquez, chairman of the bishops' Committee on Migration.\u000a\u000a"We need to protect all our brothers and sisters of all faiths, including Muslims, who have lost family, home, and country. They are children of God and are entitled to be treated with human dignity."\u000a\u000aImmigrants' anxiety increasing\u000a\u000aMonsignor Kevin Sullivan runs the New York branch of Catholic Charities USA, the church's large social service agency. The charity has offices that service Harlem, a predominantly black neighborhood where the majority of residents are likely not Catholic, he said, and Washington Heights, a largely Latino area where they likely are.\u000a\u000a"If no immigrant ever entered the door of a church or ever gave us a dollar, our policies and our doctrine would be the same as ever: We believe in the core dignity of every human being, regardless of religion."\u000a\u000aAfter he heard Bannon's comments on Thursday, Sullivan scampered down to the church's immigration office in lower Manhattan, where caseworkers help immigrants and refugees with interpreting English, legal issues, job training and placement, emergency assistance, counseling and childcare.\u000a\u000aA few months ago, the monsignor said, an immigrant mother familiar to Catholic Charities caseworkers came into the office with a dramatically different appearance. She had dyed her hair blonde and altered her makeup, hoping to look less like an "immigrant."\u000a\u000a"Among the people we work with, the anxiety is ratcheting up every day," Sullivan said.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Sullivan said, caseworkers have been upset by the "non-reality based" rhetoric surrounding immigration and immigrants. On Thursday, the tried to boost staff morale by encouraging them to focus on two things: protecting young immigrants from deportation and lobbying Congress to finally pass immigration reform.\u000a\u000aIn the end, Sullivan is willing to cede Bannon's argument that, when it comes to immigration, Dolan and Pope Francis are just "another guy with an opinion."\u000a\u000a"We're all just borrowing our opinions from another guy," Sullivan said. "And that guy is Jesus."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Thirty-five years ago, alert physicians in the United States spotted a new disease, caused by a virus that had been in circulation, unnoticed, for decades in people, and millennia in monkeys.\u000a\u000aThe virus had hit pay dirt, racing through the gay sexual revolution where one man might have sex with 30 other men a year, giving the virus exponential rates of infection\u000a\u000aOver time, the virus' transmission shifted, especially in Africa, from rare cases of monkey-to-human transmission to general heterosexual spread, with women today five times more likely to be newly infected compared to men, thanks to sexual cultures that favor male promiscuity.\u000a\u000aThat was HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which currently infects more than 37 million people living all over the world.\u000a\u000aA key lesson of AIDS is that a virus\u2014in HIV's case, infecting African monkeys\u2014might pass rarely, but repeatedly, to human beings for decades before arriving in a context of epidemic potential.\u000a\u000aAdapting to new modes of transmission and targeting novel species, the microbe can exist for thousands of years before beginning to achieve previously unimaginable feats, with devastating impact.\u000a\u000aNow the world is facing a virus that seems poised to make a similar leap: the Zika virus.\u000a\u000aLike HIV, Zika originated in central Africa, very rarely infecting human beings, and circulating among rainforest primates. Unlike HIV, Zika had the ability to fly, carried by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from one monkey or human, to another.\u000a\u000aSince reaching Brazil in 2013, where it has spread explosively over the last 12 months, Zika has demonstrated capabilities not seen, or extremely rarely noted, with any other insect-carried microbes.\u000a\u000aMost worrying, Zika has shed its mosquito transport dependency, becoming an efficient resident of human semen , and spread from male-to-female (and male-to-male) via sexual intercourse.\u000a\u000aThis week researchers reported finding Zika in a woman's vagina, noting that, "the very presence in the female genital tract [implies] that sexual transmission from women to men could occur." And barely had the ink dried on that report when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced today that a woman who traveled in a Zika-hit country, who got infected through a mosquito bite, has passed the virus onto her male sexual partner in New York City, marking the first documented case of female to male sexual transmission in the U.S. (and the 14th documented sexual transmission in the U.S. overall).\u000a\u000aIf Zika finds its way into an especially sexually active community, it could well become a threat not only in America's southern, mosquito-infested states, but anywhere in the world.\u000a\u000aLike HIV, the Zika virus would likely find its way into populations that feel discriminated against by the general population, and take its toll disproportionately among teenage girls and young women.\u000a\u000aAnd while politicians play partisan games with funding on Capitol Hill, government and philanthropic donors ignore the World Health Organization's pleas for a measly $122 million to fight it, and state health agencies scramble to find anti-mosquito resources, the virus is spreading in new ways , causing an ever-widening range of dangerous birth defects and human illnesses.\u000a\u000a"I am concerned that the goose is cooked. This funding is done. It's not coming to us," Dr. Umair Shah, a public health official in Harris Country, Texas told NBC News . "We cannot spray our way out of this situation," Shah added, saying pesticides won't be enough to stop Zika at this late date in the American South.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What twins can tell us about Zika Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What twins can tell us about Zika 03:14\u000a\u000aThe lingering Ebola epidemic in West Africa offers lessons on the difficulty of stopping a virus that takes on sexual transmission and can abide in semen for weeks after a man has recovered from the disease. Several times in 2015 and 2016, Ebola seemed to have been eradicated from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia, only to reemerge via sexual transmission\u000a\u000aThe statistics on Zika as a sexually transmitted disease are sobering. According to the World Health Organization , the Zika virus has emerged in 48 countries since Brazil sounded the alarm in October 2015.\u000a\u000aFour of those countries have active mosquito-borne spread of the virus underway now, and eleven of them\u2014including the United States\u2014have documented sexual transmission of the virus. Two Americans have died of Zika , one in Puerto Rico and the other in Utah. They were among the 1,132 travel-related Zika cases documented in the United States. Among the 50 states, Florida has been hardest hit to date, with 263 confirmed cases, 43 of them pregnant women, followed by Texas.\u000a\u000aPolitics should not trump biology\u000a\u000a"No pregnant women should have to worry that her baby will develop brain damage because she was bitten once by a mosquito," a petition to Congress from the March of Dimes states. "It's an outrage that Congress has failed to give states and localities the resources they need to protect pregnant women and babies from Zika virus."\u000a\u000aThe Zika funding stalemate on Capitol Hill might well result in an increase in the numbers of abortions in the United States this year\u2014an ironic and tragic outcome of a political squabble that features, among other disputes, Democrats' objection to House Republicans' inclusion of anti-Planned Parenthood language in the GOP's Zika bill\u000a\u000aIn Latin American countries hard hit by the virus, abortion rates have soared this year by as much as 108%, which research suggests is due largely to women who feared carrying a "Zika baby" but had no access to tests that could confirm the healthy viability of their fetus. Such tests don't exist: American women have no special advantage in the Zika fight, despite the greater wealth of the United States.\u000a\u000aIn a few days, the Republican Party will gather for its national convention in Cleveland, Ohio\u2014a metropolis that last year ranked in the top twenty most mosquito-infested cities in the United States. At the end of this week, Congress will shut down for the summer, and the politicians will not return to hammer out new agreements until September 6.\u000a\u000aBarring a remarkable compromise, the politicians will exit Washington on Friday, leaving funding for Zika prevention and research in the lurch , with the White House, Senate, and House each offering radically different funding proposals, none of which will materialize as money for research.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in all tiers of public health across America, scientists and officials are scrambling to rob other budgets in order to finance research and mosquito control measures. At local levels, this ironically means things like sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) programs are losing money, so that counties can hire mosquito abatement experts.\u000a\u000aAt the federal level, the remaining Ebola programs are seeing their budgets pilfered to provide temporary Zika funds, and a range of basic science research initiatives at the National Institutes of Health are on hold , their funds diverted to efforts to understand, diagnose, treat and vaccinate against Zika.\u000a\u000aVital questions about Zika, especially as a sexually transmitted disease linked to birth defects, are going unanswered, thanks to the research funding gap.\u000a\u000aCan the world's blood supply be cleansed of Zika risk with transfusion?\u000a\u000aHow likely is it that sexual transmission could dominate spread of Zika in the United States?\u000a\u000aHow long can Zika survive in semen and cause infections?\u000a\u000aHow does the virus get through the placenta to infect the developing fetus?\u000a\u000aIs it possible to create a 100% reliable fetal test for Zika infection and brain damage that can be used to guide decisions regarding pregnancy termination?\u000a\u000aAre the risks greater in a particular stage of pregnancy?\u000a\u000aWhy aren't sonograms reliably identifying microcephaly babies in utero?\u000a\u000aCan a mother give birth to Zika-damaged babies if she never had symptoms of the disease?\u000a\u000aAre there ways that women can protect themselves and carry babies to term, short of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to delay pregnancies altogether?\u000a\u000aHow can a potential Zika vaccine be safely tested on pregnant women and their babies\u000a\u000aIn the absence of answers to these and other Zika questions, women are compelled to make dire decisions, including opting for abortions\u000a\u000aIs Zika becoming a sexually transmitted disease?\u000a\u000aWhile HIV and Ebola offer potential roadmaps for how this might happen, it's still an open question. Researchers in Brazil took a deep dive into the country's data for dengue, a virus spread by the same Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as carry Zika, analyzing of the disease's diagnoses in 2013, 2015, and early 2016.\u000a\u000aThey paid special attention to the distribution of dengue by age and gender. And they did the same for Zika cases in the country over 2015 and 2016. If all Zika cases were due to mosquito bites, the demographic distribution of dengue and Zika should match. But that's not what they found\u000a\u000aInstead, 90% more Zika cases were registered among women, compared to the female rates for dengue.\u000a\u000aNeighboring Colombia has also seen far more Zika in females, with young women accounting for two-thirds of the 65,726 cases diagnosed by mid-April 2016.\u000a\u000aResearchers note that though the infection rate was similar in very young children of both genders, "the incidence was significantly higher among female patients than among male patients in all other age groups."\u000a\u000aCritics charge that both the Brazilian and Colombian studies may simply reflect the greater fear women have about exposure to Zika during pregnancy, prompting more of them to seek medical care. The researchers disagree, insisting that the higher rates of diagnosed Zika are seen in young women, whether or not they are pregnant or are trying to conceive.\u000a\u000aOne reason young women may be at higher risk is that they are having more sex with male partners whose semen may remain Zika-contaminated and infectious for months\u000a\u000aSuch a pronounced gender difference wasn't seen in the Zika outbreaks in Pacific Island nations between 1990 and 2013, but there have been subtle genetic changes in the virus since its arrival in the Americas. Are these mutations relevant to sexual transmission? That is another research question scientists would like to answer, if Congress ever provides funding.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Mothers of Zika babies shunned by society Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mothers of Zika babies shunned by society 02:13\u000a\u000aAt the end of June, frustrated scientists at the NIH decided to charge ahead with pregnancy and sexual research, despite congressional gridlock, by putting numerous other disease studies on temporary hold.\u000a\u000aA large study, tracking women over time in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, has begun enrolling volunteers. "We are going out on a limb, but we have to," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters . "We can't say we're going to wait until we get all the money."\u000a\u000aWhen microbes gain capacity to be sexually transmitted, they rarely disappear from the human population group in which they emerged.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, for instance, physicians in San Francisco noticed that drug-resistant Staphylococcus, MRSA, was far more prevalent among gay men compared to any other demographic group; the bacterial disease had become a STD , soon surfacing among gay men in Boston and New York.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, European researchers discovered that a virulent form of the bacterium that causes meningitis was spreading sexually among gay men. By 2015, gay men were dying from the new STD, and this year, public health officials all over the United States are begging gay men to get vaccinated as meningitis outbreaks surface nationwide.\u000a\u000aHow to prevent a sexually transmitted Zika catastrophe?\u000a\u000aSo what can we do to stave off a similarly catastrophic turn of events with the Zika virus? According to the CDC , 287 pregnant women living in the United States were diagnosed as Zika-infected by June 23, and another 250 in U.S. territories. There is no reliable test that can tell these 537 women whether or not the virus has passed to their fetus, gnawing away at their tiny, developing brains. In the United States and beyond, women especially are in desperate need of such a test.\u000a\u000aA recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans have heard of Zika, which means an alarming third of the population knows nothing about the disease, and is unlikely to take precautions against infection.\u000a\u000aFewer still\u2014less than half\u2014were aware that Zika could be passed sexually. In the absence of such knowledge, sexually active Americans are unlikely to use condoms.\u000a\u000aAround the world, intriguing puzzles abound. Jacqueline Silva de Oliveira lives in Santos, Brazil, where she contracted Zika during her pregnancy\u2014either via a mosquito or sexually, it is not known\u2014and gave birth to twins in February.\u000a\u000aToday, Lucas is a healthy, happy infant, but his twin sister, Laura, suffers in agonizing pain thanks to Zika microcephaly -- which slaughters brain cells and results in complete remodeling of the brain in development.\u000a\u000aThe Brazilian government is monitoring six such sets of twins , discordant for Zika microcephaly, in hopes of learning how the virus infects (or doesn't infect) fetuses.\u000a\u000aIn France , a healthy couple trying to have children sought in vitro fertilization. The clinic assisting them tested their blood and his semen for various infections, including Zika: they were fine.\u000a\u000aThe couple took a holiday in the Caribbean nation of Martinique, returned to France, and underwent more tests. The man's blood was free of Zika, but about a month after they were back in France, the woman became infected. Examination of her partner's semen revealed Zika. Neither of them ever had symptoms of illness, nor felt any reason to avoid sex or use condoms, as they were a married couple trying to have a baby.\u000a\u000aHere at home, time is running out. Researchers desperately need funding to provide the tools required to forestall a sexually transmitted Zika epidemic in the United States.\u000a\u000aIn the absence of those tools, women will make difficult choices, deferring pregnancies for months, perhaps years, and seeking abortions.\u000a\u000aThe stalemate on Capitol Hill may actually increase the likelihood that more American babies will be born with terrible malformations and neurological deficits. And, equally horribly, that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of couples will seek abortions based on suspicion of Zika infection, possibly terminating some healthy pregnancies.

I had just begun a personal project of challenging my lifelong assumption that God exists.\u000a\u000aYou see, I had been a Seventh-day Adventist pastor for 19 years. I resigned from my pastoral position the year before , but now I stepped away from my faith altogether. It was a gut-wrenching decision but I couldn't see any other way to find peace and clarity. I encountered major theological differences with my denomination and evangelical Christianity in general, including the way it marginalizes women and LGBT people.\u000a\u000aRyan Bell\u000a\u000aI questioned the problem of evils and God's general silence and inactivity.

aV(CNN) As Republicans hash out the details of their health plans, dental associations around the country are looking nervously at the future. It has been little talked about, but the dental coverage that children receive and the coverage some adults get through their state's Medicaid plans and those offered on exchanges could soon disappear.\u000a\u000aThat's because the bills in the House eliminate the requirement that all plans, including Medicaid, carry the 10 essential health benefits that were written into law in Obamacare. One of those benefits is pediatric dental care. Instead, Congress would leave it up to states to decide which benefits policies must contain.\u000a\u000aThe bills also make Medicaid a block grant . Block-granting the health care coverage program for low-income Americans would cap spending and give states direct control over the program. It's a policy change conservatives have long had on their wish list and the White House has said it supports that change. If the bills go through, it could also mean that states will have less money to spend on coverage and may force them to make tough choices on what plans would cover.\u000a\u000aReimbursement rates to dentists would also likely drop, meaning the list of providers would likely shrink. With a smaller budget and without a requirement that states cover dental, experts in the dental community worry the coverage may be some of the first to go.\u000a\u000a"We have seen a lot of innovation in states in terms of coverage of oral health as of late, we don't want to see that progress rolled back," said Libby Mullin , a consultant on government affairs issues for the Children's Dental Health Project, who was instrumental in negotiating pediatric dental as a benefit under the Affordable Care Act. "Oral disease really starts with the pregnant mother who can transmit the disease to her child; so, by age 2, children can have progressive and chronic problems. The longer we wait, because of the progressive nature of oral disease, the more expensive the problems become."\u000a\u000aThe policies aren't extensive, but the Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment benefit does, at minimum, cover the costs of maintenance of a child's dental health, restoration of teeth and relief from dental pain.\u000a\u000aFor adults, the states that choose to offer coverage typically give limited coverage, mostly restricted to extractions and emergency services. Typically, there is a cap on how much can be spent on an adult's care and the benefits vary by state.\u000a\u000aHistorically, when budgets get tight, adult dental is one of the first benefits to go, although the benefits will change from year to year. For example, Illinois eliminated coverage for non-emergency services for adults in 2012, but in 2014 expanded services again to include basic procedures such as root canals, fillings, dentures and oral surgery.\u000a\u000a"Coverage translates into care," said Mike Graham, senior vice president of government and public affairs with the American Dental Association A study in February showed that a growing number of children have been covered since 1997, and the unmet dental needs in this group decreased as well. That means parents have been using this benefit to help keep their kids' teeth healthy.\u000a\u000aThe ADA has been lobbying Congress to keep coverage. It is also lobbying to encourage more transparency about plans offered through the exchanges. That way, when people purchase insurance, they can clearly see if dental is one of the options and also make sure there is an adequate number of in-network providers.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHealthy teeth are vital to overall health. Oral health problems are linked to heart and lung disease, stroke, diabetes and poor birth outcomes. Americans also miss more than 164 million hours a year of work due to oral health problems or dental visits, one study showed . Damaged teeth can keep people from getting a job or from having healthy social relationships. And when dental coverage declines, studies show this costs everyone. Emergency room visits for tooth problems go up, for instance, when there is no coverage.\u000a\u000a"We don't want anyone to lose their coverage," Graham said. "Coverage for this group truly benefits everyone."

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 8th September 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Dinosaurs, laser lights, cabaret and robots... lots of robots.\u000a\u000aOne of Tokyo's top tourist attractions, Robot Restaurant , in the Shinjuku nightlife district, is one of the wildest shows on earth.\u000a\u000aThe fantastical performance venue opened in July 2012, quickly garnering an international reputation.\u000a\u000aBlaring pop music fills the room, warrior princesses fight 10-foot-tall transformer robots and sequined bikinis ricochet laser beams into every corner.\u000a\u000aBut how does this carefully orchestrated chaos come together? We took a behind-the-scenes tour.\u000a\u000aBehind the scenes\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 7 Robot Restaurant: A dancer rides a robot into battle at Robot Restaurant, located in Tokyo's Shinjuku nightlife district. The cabaret-style shows include bikini clad futuristic dancers, performers dressed as robots and a host of large scale robots -- all in a laser-lit room.\u000a\u000aAs you descend the technicolor stairwell into Robot Restaurant, it's like stepping into an alternate realty.\u000a\u000aIt only gets wackier from there.\u000a\u000aThe robot show might seems like total chaos, but the high-voltage performance is actually a carefully planned routine that requires weeks of preparation.\u000a\u000aBehind it all? A professional dance troupe who rehearse around the clock to perfect the complicated routine. They master everything from dancing to drumming, pole dancing and robot riding.\u000a\u000a"As a performer, I try to convey a routine in a way everyone can understand its youthful emotion," says Namie Osawa, show director of Robot Restaurant.\u000a\u000aThough the storyline might be hard to follow, Osawa usually separates the 90-minute show into several acts with breaks in between.\u000a\u000aIt all culminates in an epic battle between warring robot armies -- pop music blasts, lasers strobe, and dancers flying every which way.\u000a\u000a"I think it's great how people smile during the show and even during breaks, or when we look at each other and really feel the enthusiasm from one another, says performer Kumin Hankokkou.\u000a\u000a"The rehearsals are difficult but I enjoy that we work together to achieve the next level."\u000a\u000aWhat's for dinner\u000a\u000aDancers perform on large scale "female" robots.\u000a\u000aThe name Robot Restaurant is a bit misleading.\u000a\u000aWhile there's popcorn as well as three dinner items up for grabs -- think sushi bento boxes and marinated beef -- the food is not as captivating as the performances.\u000a\u000aSince Tokyo is inundated with amazing restaurants, we'd recommend saving your appetite for a feast elsewhere.\u000a\u000aAfter all, trying to navigate a box of sushi while a giant shark is attacking a robotic horse that's wrestling a kung-fu panda on a Segway isn't exactly the easiest feat.\u000a\u000aA few quick tips\u000a\u000aInside the men's bathroom at Robot Restaurant.\u000a\u000aYou'll probably want to capture every moment of the fantastical experience -- and we don't blame you.\u000a\u000aBut travelers will need to leave professional equipment at home. Smart phones and smaller devices are totally fine but large cameras are prohibited.\u000a\u000aAs for booking, we'd advise planning ahead.\u000a\u000aThere are only three performances a day and tickets often sell out.\u000a\u000aTo secure seats, travelers can buy tickets online for about $73 each or ask their hotel concierge to make a reservation.\u000a\u000aEven with a ticket, you can't waltz right in. There's an office across the street where you'll need to pick up the physical tickets.\u000a\u000aAnd after the show? Guests will have a chance to roam around the stage and pose for photos with the robot stars.

aV(CNN) Away from the cameras, President Donald Trump quietly signed a bill Thursday that allows states to withhold federal funds from organizations that provide abortion services.\u000a\u000aThis is not the end to federal funds for Planned Parenthood, as many Republicans have been calling for, but it is what experts characterize as a first step.\u000a\u000aThe move may embolden states to make additional moves to restrict women's access to abortion, they say, and caught in the middle may be millions of Americans who use Planned Parenthood or other health clinics for other family planning services such as contraceptives, for breast cancer screenings and for sexually transmitted disease screenings.\u000a\u000aMore than 20 million American women rely on publicly funded family planning care, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive policy group. It provides infrastructure support to a network of about 4,000 clinics (PDF) across the country.\u000a\u000a"We are talking about restricting access to care for the most underserved and vulnerable populations who rely on these family planning safety net services," said Kinsey Hasstedt , senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute.\u000a\u000aThe new law rolls back a rule that went into effect two days before Trump's inauguration in January.\u000a\u000ahave tried, to pass laws that stopped federal funds from going to any clinic that provides abortions. The rule clarified that this was illegal. The Obama administration rule essentially said that the only way states and local governments could withhold federal funds from providers is if the facility was unable to provide family planning services. Over the past several years, more than a dozen Republican-controlled legislatureshave tried,to pass laws that stopped federal funds from going to any clinic that provides abortions. The rule clarified that this was illegal.\u000a\u000aThose federal funds, called Title X, are competitive grants that go to affordable family planning providers. The initiative started in 1970 and is the only federal grant program dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services. Federal law does not allow the money to pay for abortions, although it is not legal for a state to withhold funds from a provider applying for a grant solely because abortion is one of the services it offers.\u000a\u000aNot all Planned Parenthood facilities or health clinics take Title X money, but some agencies use it to offset the cost of providing free or low-cost services to patients who would not otherwise be able to afford such care. about 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from Title X funds, according to the group.\u000a\u000aRepublicans tried to defund all of Planned Parenthood with the health care bill that failed to pass last month. The new law passed only after Vice President Mike Pence stepped in to break a tie vote.\u000a\u000aAlthough the law does not go as far as some conservatives would like, Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health , said it is far from trivial.\u000a\u000a"Those who will be possibly impacted by this are often the sole providers of health care for these patients. They provide Pap smears and breast cancer screening and many other preventative services, and it is not so easy to find other providers to take up the slack if these providers don't receive the funding," he said. Training staffers to offer the kind of services and counseling these centers offer may be a real challenge in some areas of the country that rely on the clinics, he said.\u000a\u000aWomen can often obtain quicker and more convenient care from Planned Parenthood facilities than from other clinics. The majority offer same-day appointments, while only 42% of health departments do, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute . The average wait time for initial contraceptive care at Planned Parenthood is 1.2 days, but it is 4.1 days for health departments and 2.5 days at federally qualified health centers. And 78% of Planned Parenthood centers offer extended hours in which women could get care after work or on the weekend, whereas only 57% federally qualified health centers and just 18% of health departments do .\u000a\u000a"I'm concerned without these preventative health services for women, it could increase unintended pregnancy and possibly increase the number of abortions women may need If they won't be able to access contraceptive methods that they want to use," Grossman said.\u000a\u000aPlanned Parenthood condemned the new law.\u000a\u000a"People are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access health care, and this bill is just the latest example. Planned Parenthood strongly opposes President Trump's willingness to undermine millions of women's access to birth control through the Title X family planning program," the organization said in a statement.\u000a\u000aMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List , who attended Trump's closed-door signing ceremony, was pleased with the "victory" in giving states options.\u000a\u000a"We expect to see Congress continue its efforts to redirect additional taxpayer funding away from Planned Parenthood through pro-life health care reform after the spring recess," she said in a statement.\u000a\u000aStates that have found ways to restrict funding to these facilities, like Texas, have seen an impact on access to care overall, studies show.\u000a\u000aIn 2011, Texas cut its family planning budget from $111 million to $38 million. Afterward, one in every four clinics in the state closed or stopped providing family planning help altogether. The clinics that remained didn't often provide all forms of contraceptives such as IUDs, and many organizations that had provided free or low-cost care had to start charging, a study showed. Surveys found that women had less access to preventive care, and the childbirth rate for women covered by Medicaid went up.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe new law does not take the country to that point, the experts said. But some who study family planning services think it is a hint at the future, at least in states that have tried to impose restrictions.

aVStory highlights A judge recently ruled in favor of Maine truckers because of a missing Oxford comma\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter: Oxford commas ward off ambiguity, but need not be used all the time\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "Words on the Move." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) A recent court case seems like a victory for fans of the grand old Oxford comma. To many, it feels natural to write "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cleveland." But just as one may feel lazy saying "My brother and me went home" rather than "My brother and I," there is a sense that it is more proper to write "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland," inserting a comma after the item before the last one.\u000a\u000aAnd people advocating for the Oxford comma have a point now and then. If you were a trucker reading that union rules deny you overtime pay for "the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of agricultural produce," would you consider yourself due overtime payment nevertheless for distribution? That is, as opposed to packing things for shipping and distribution?\u000a\u000aJohn McWhorter\u000a\u000aTruckers for Oakhurst Dairy in Maine have been granted back overtime pay for having distributed product as opposed to packing it, because though the writers of the contract meant that overtime would not be granted for distribution either, this is not clear when there is no comma after shipment. The drivers' lawyer has successfully argued that the contract appears to stipulate that overtime won't be granted for, only, the packing of things for future shipping and distribution.\u000a\u000aBut it's premature to read this as demonstrating that everybody should always use the Oxford comma. What happened here shows, just as defensibly, that the Oxford comma should be used in cases of potential ambiguity. The people who wrote the union contract made a mistake, but not in way that means all of us should feel bad about writing "hamburgers, hot dogs and French fries."\u000a\u000aWe might feel slovenly, however, for writing "I had toast, bacon and eggs and coffee" where one could argue that it's unclear whether the bacon and eggs went together or eggs and coffee did, or "My parents, Mother Teresa and the Pope," which implies a rather stunning parental history in casting those two people as your parents, as opposed to persons in sequence with your parents.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) In the nutritional world, conventional wisdom suggests that the more often you eat, the more likely you are to burn off those calories and control hunger pangs. And so the notion of eating six or more "mini-meals" each day, just enough to fuel your body and tide you over until your next bites, has often been recommended as a more waistline-friendly dieting approach than eating three larger meals. But science evolves, and the answer to whether you should eat many mini-meals or three bigger meals is no longer a straightforward one.\u000a\u000a"Years ago, we all believed that you needed to eat multiple times a day to keep your metabolism stoked. ... You had to keep feeding the fire and keep the furnace burning. But that theory goes back and forth, and newer research is showing that it really doesn't slow metabolism if you're not eating multiple times a day," said Martha McKittrick, a registered dietitian in New York City who has provided weight-loss counseling for over 20 years.\u000a\u000aSmall frequent meals vs. fewer big meals\u000a\u000aBut while eating small frequent meals can discourage large swings in blood sugar, decrease hunger and prevent impulsive snacking throughout the day, other studies suggest that eating more often may not be optimal.\u000a\u000aAnd despite the notion that eating more often means more opportunities to burn calories, thanks to the energy involved in digesting, absorbing and metabolizing food's nutrients, research suggests that doing so does not appear to significantly enhance metabolism or total calories burned.\u000a\u000a"In the '80s, grazing was thought to be an optimal way of losing weight ... but human studies did not support this at all," said David Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has researched the topic of meal frequency and its effects on calorie intake. "It was thought that if you ate more frequently, the amount of calories you retain would go down, and more calories would be burned. But controlled experiments in humans show that there is no metabolic advantage to eating 12 smaller meals versus eating three or four meals per day, with the same total number of calories."\u000a\u000aOther experts agree. "Meal frequency does not affect metabolic rate and thus has no direct effect on weight loss," said Carla Wolper, a registered dietitian and nutrition consultant at the ColumbiaDoctors Executive Health assessment program who spent 25 years on the nutrition faculty at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center.\u000a\u000aIn fact, some research suggests that eating even fewer than three meals may be best in terms of controlling calories: In one study , when individuals skipped breakfast, they consumed about 400 fewer calories for the entire day compared to when they ate breakfast.\u000a\u000a"If you decrease the number of occasions to eat, your total calorie intake goes down," said Levitsky, who authored the study. "People think if you skip breakfast, you will overeat later ... and that doesn't happen. Your intake goes up, but not nearly as much as the amount that you skipped."\u000a\u000aAn eating pattern for every body\u000a\u000aSo should you give up on a diet plan of six or more mini-meals, spaced a few hours apart? Not necessarily. The optimal timing of eating may depend on various factors unique to each individual.\u000a\u000a"Some folks are grazers by nature, so six small meals might be more in line with their natural inclinations. Other folks eat by the clock, at 7 a.m., 12 p.m. and 6 p.m., for example. The real issue regarding temptation at mealtime is planning. If people have a great food plan, they will probably do well," Wolper said.\u000a\u000aMcKittrick agrees. "Some are grazers; some are meal-eaters. ... It's fine if they graze, but make sure calories are controlled so it's not an ongoing graze-fest."\u000a\u000aThe case for small, frequent meals\u000a\u000aWhile some may enjoy sitting down to three meals each day, others may find that it's just too much food at once.\u000a\u000a"Some people don't have huge appetites. ... If they have a 600-calorie sandwich, they may have half at noon and eat the other half at 3 p.m.," McKittrick said. "Eating large meals may also make them tired ... so they're better off with small frequent feedings because it promotes more stable blood sugar and they get more energized."\u000a\u000aOne's daily routine may not allow for the opportunity to take a big lunch break -- and so a grazing style of eating is a better fit.\u000a\u000aFor a new mom, eating three meals a day can be particularly challenging. "Lots of mothers spend so much time with their kids that they can't sit down and have a full lunch ... so eating more frequently better suits their lifestyle," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aHealth issues may also dictate which style of eating is best. For example, people who have diabetes or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can feel shaky, tired and weak if they go too long without eating, so six small meals may be best. Those who have other health conditions including gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome and acid reflux may feel better by eating small meals spaced three or four hours apart. The same may be true for seniors.\u000a\u000a"A lot of seniors can only have a piece of toast and an egg, and then they get full. As you get older, you just don't have as much of an appetite, and you feel full more quickly," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aThe case for three bigger meals\u000a\u000aExperts say that eating more frequently may be problematic for those who have trouble with portion control or something known as stimulus-bound eating, when the sight of a specific food prompts you to eat it, which can lead to weight gain.\u000a\u000a"The bulk of the evidence suggests that humans are opportunistic eaters ... and if we are given more chances to eat, the more we will eat," Levitsky said. "If people did nothing other than eliminate snacks, their total calorie intake will go down."\u000a\u000aA 500-calorie smoothie, for example, will defeat the strategy's purpose. "If you want to eat small frequent meals, take a look at your calories and really divide them up. If you're on 1,500-calorie diet, are you really having five 300-calorie mini-meals?" McKittrick asked.\u000a\u000aAn "all or nothing person" may be better off with three meals per day if a small snack quickly turns into a bigger one, as in the case of nuts. "Nuts are super healthy, but some people can't stop once they start eating nuts, and that can be a problem," McKittrick said.\u000a\u000aThe environment plays a role, too. If your office has a kitchen full of free snacks, it's a lot easier to go in and grab something like chips or cookies instead of planning your own healthy meals and bringing them in. Working from home, with constant access to the kitchen, can present similar challenges.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAnd then there are others who just don't want to be bothered with making eating an all-day affair. "Some just want to eat and get it done with, so they don't do well with small snacks. ... They're really busy, and they just don't have the time to deal with it, and so those people may be better off with three meals per day."\u000a\u000aThe bottom line is that either style of eating can offer health and weight-loss benefits. But what matters most is what will work for you.\u000a\u000a"Maybe, down the line, we'll be able to test people to determine which eating frequency is optimal, but in the meantime, it's probably best to go by how you feel," McKittrick said.

aVRepublicans are trying to diminish the Congressional Budget Office's importance even before it issues its review of their Obamacare repeal bill.\u000a\u000aLawmakers are calling out that the agency repeatedly overestimated how many people would gain coverage on the Obamacare exchanges. Republicans want to downplay the score of their bill, which is expected to show that millions could wind up uninsured.\u000a\u000aThe CBO's report is expected Monday.\u000a\u000aRelated: GOP tries to discredit agency reviewing its health care bill\u000a\u000aIt's true that CBO thought more people would flock to the Obamacare exchanges.\u000a\u000aWhen the law originally passed in 2010, it estimated 21 million would gain coverage through them in 2016. Three years later, just before the exchanges opened, the agency upped the figure to 22 million.\u000a\u000aThat didn't happen. About 10.4 million were actually enrolled last year, according to the Department of Health & Human Services data.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, the exchanges did not turn out to be as vibrant as expected. But their enrollment was also dampened because fewer employers stopped offering coverage than the CBO originally thought, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. This would have sent more people looking for policies on the exchanges.\u000a\u000aAnd, more Americans turned out to be eligible for Medicaid, further reducing the number of folks buying policies on the exchanges.\u000a\u000aHowever, the agency was much closer to the mark on Obamacare's overall impact on coverage. In its original 2010 estimate, CBO thought the insured rate for non-elderly adults would rise to 92% in 2016. It tempered that view somewhat in 2013, after the Supreme Court ruled that expanding Medicaid was optional for states. The revised forecast was that 89% would have coverage in 2016.\u000a\u000aIt turns out that 89.7% of Americans under age 65 had insurance last year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. That's up from 83.4% in 2013, before the exchanges opened and Medicaid expansion officially began. (A few states launched the program earlier.)\u000a\u000aRelated: Millions could lose insurance under GOP Obamacare repeal bill, S&P reports\u000a\u000a"Where people get coverage matters, but what's most important is that they are covered at all," said Matt Fiedler, a Brookings Institution fellow who served as chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration.\u000a\u000aBecause there are fewer people on the exchanges, CBO overestimated how much the law's coverage provisions would cost overall. Originally, it expected the net cost would be $132 billion in 2016. However, it lowered that estimate to $110 billion in the estimate it released last year.\u000a\u000aThe agency's review of the Republican bill's impact on coverage is expected to be ugly. But it's impossible to expect the CBO to hit the number exactly, Goldwein said. Its projection is in the center of a range of potential outcomes.\u000a\u000aMostly importantly, the agency has a long history of credibility and neutrality, he said.\u000a\u000a"It's not novel to beat up on the refs," Goldwein said. "We can feel confident that whatever they put forward will represent their best, unbiased estimate."

aVHurricane Irma's impending landfall in Florida is forcing airlines serving some of the largest airports in America to shutter operations and get out of the way of the powerful storm.\u000a\u000aIrma has already trashed airports, buildings and roads in the Caribbean. St. Maarten, a major international destination for U.S. and European carriers, was in ruins after the storm. Photos from the Netherlands Ministry of Defense showed its runway covered in sand and widespread damage at its terminal building and jetways.\u000a\u000aBy late Saturday, Miami, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale - home to the 12th, 13th, 21st largest airports in the U.S., respectively - will be largely dormant as the extreme weather rolls in.\u000a\u000aBut the prospect of a direct hit from Irma represents another blow to U.S. air travel in one of the busiest air corridors on the planet for business and leisure travel.\u000a\u000aAmong Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, the three airports handled more than 115 million passengers in 2016.\u000a\u000aQuite congested in Miami. #irma pic.twitter.com/A5GQOZId6U \u2014 Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) September 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThe scramble was so acute that the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday evening said air traffic controllers were increasing the space between flights from Miami and nearby Fort Lauderdale to enable them to better manage the crowded skies.

aVStory highlights Poor flexibility can hamper athletic performance and increase the risk of injuries\u000a\u000aBeing overly flexible won't necessarily confer any additional health benefits\u000a\u000aThe following is adapted from "Fitter Faster: The Smart Way to Get in Shape in Just Minutes a Day" by Robert J. Davis with Brad Kolowich Jr.\u000a\u000a(CNN) We often hear about the importance of stretching, especially after exercise, to improve flexibility. Indeed, studies have found that regular stretching can increase flexibility in as little as four weeks. But getting results requires commitment: You need to stretch at least three days a week, ideally every day. Activities such as yoga and Pilates can improve flexibility, as well.\u000a\u000aHow flexible you are and how flexible you can become are also influenced by factors that you can't control, such as genetics and gender. As anyone who has ever observed a co-ed yoga class can attest, women tend to be more flexible than men. Injuries and certain conditions like arthritis can also limit flexibility.\u000a\u000aAge plays a role, as well. Starting around age 30 or 40, flexibility continuously decreases, with men losing flexibility more quickly than women. But this decline doesn't occur uniformly throughout the body.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that the shoulders and trunk tend to lose flexibility more quickly than the elbows and knees, for example. At any age, you may be relatively flexible in one part of your body and have limited range of motion in another. Flexibility can also vary from one side to another.\u000a\u000aAs for how much flexibility is optimal, there's no definitive answer. We know that having poor range of motion can hamper athletic performance, increase the risk of injuries and make tasks of daily living more difficult. It's also true that a high level of flexibility can be beneficial if you do activities such as gymnastics, swimming or ballet. But this doesn't mean we should all strive to become human pretzels.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Hurricane Irma began battering parts of Cuba and the central Bahamas on Friday afternoon after leaving a trail of devastation in the Caribbean, while an anxious South Florida and Miami prepared for what could be a major hit by the weekend.\u000a\u000aIrma, now a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 155 mph, slammed the Turks and Caicos and southeastern Bahamas early Friday before its powerful core headed between northern Cuba and central Bahamas.\u000a\u000aAt least 24 people were killed this week as Irma pummeled northern Caribbean islands such as Barbudaand the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico , hundreds of thousands of people -- nearly 70% of the US territory's utility customers -- were left without power, the governor's office said.\u000a\u000aIrma is expected be near the Florida Kets and South Florida by early Sunday as at least a Category 4 hurricane, and many residents there are moving inland or to shelters. Some counties are under evacuation orders, but "all Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon," Gov. Rick Scott said Friday.\u000a\u000a"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family. Get inland for safety," Scott said at a news conference.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Hurricane Irma tears through Caribbean Damage from Hurricane Irma is seen in Orient Bay, on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, on Thursday, September 7.

The Red Cross estimates 1.2 million people have already been battered by the storm.\u000a\u000aHere are the latest developments\u000a\u000a-- Around 2 p.m. ET, Irma's center was about 225 miles east of Caibarien, Cuba, moving west with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph. Hurricane-force winds could be felt as far as 70 miles from the center.\u000a\u000a-- Irma's bands whipped the Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday night and Friday morning, and is forecast to move between the north coast of Cuba and the central Bahamas through Saturday.\u000a\u000a-- Irma led to at least 24 deaths in the Caribbean, including nine in unspecified French territories, one on Barbuda, one at the British overseas territory of Anguilla, two on Dutch-administered St. Maarten, four in the British Virgin Islands, four on the US Virgin Islands, and three in Puerto Rico. Officials didn't specify which French Caribbean territories had nine deaths but earlier indicated some had been on the island of St. Martin.\u000a\u000a-- The three deaths in Puerto Rico were at least loosely linked to Irma. One person died from a fall while being taken to a shelter; another was killed in a car crash; a third died of electrocution, the governor said.\u000a\u000a-- In the British Virgin Islands, "roads are impassable, and there is currently no access to some areas," Gov. Gus Jaspert said.\u000a\u000a-- Hurricane warnings are in effect for parts of central Cuba, and the southeastern, central and northwestern Bahamas. Hurricane warnings also are in effect for South Florida, from Jupiter Inlet on the east coast, southward around the Florida Peninsula to Bonita Beach on the west. The warning includes the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee and Florida Bay.\u000a\u000aA home flattened by Hurricane Irma lies in a pile Thursday in Nagua, Dominican Republic.\u000a\u000a-- The Red Cross said as many as 26 million people could be exposed to destructive winds and torrential rain just in the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.\u000a\u000a-- Both the French and Dutch portions of the island of St. Martin are suffering looting in the wake of Irma, authorities said.\u000a\u000a-- Irma could overwhelm parts of the Bahamas, a nation of about 390,000, with storm surges of up to 20 feet -- well above the islands' elevation, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.\u000a\u000aPeople secure their belongings Thursday ahead of Hurricane Irma in Caibarien, Cuba.\u000a\u000a-- Tourists and hundreds of thousands of residents have also been evacuated from parts of Cuba. Usually busy hotels on the northern coast were empty Friday, CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Caibarien. Some have been evacuated to bomb shelters built during the Cuban missile crisis of the 1960s.\u000a\u000aFlorida and the Southeast prepare for Irma\u000a\u000aThe National Hurricane Center has warned Irma could "make landfall in southern Florida as a dangerous major hurricane, and bring life-threatening storm surge and wind impacts to much of the state."\u000a\u000aThere could be storm surges up to 12 feet in coastal areas, which could "inundate so many low-level houses, especially on the Keys," Myers said.\u000a\u000aUS and European forecast models predict the eye could strike the Keys and then the Everglades, west of Miami, on Saturday night into Sunday morning.\u000a\u000a"It's not a question of whether Florida is going to be impacted -- it's a question of how bad Florida is going to be impacted," Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long said Friday, urging people to heed evacuation orders.\u000a\u000aThough the core has the most power, Irma is huge, winds of at least tropical-storm force cover 70,000 square miles -- larger than the area of Florida (65,000 square miles). At some point late Saturday into Tuesday, the entire state could see at least hurricane-force gusts of 74 mph and above, CNN's Myers said.\u000a\u000aIn Miami-Dade County alone, about 660,000 of its 2.6 million population have been asked to evacuate, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said.\u000a\u000aAt Daytona Beach on mid-Florida's Atlantic coast, Michael Hanna was boarding up his beach apparel store late Friday morning, but was itching to leave.\u000a\u000a"I stayed a little longer than anybody else so I can cover up my business," he said. "My kids are panicking; my wife, she's panicking. ... (Saturday) morning by 6 a.m., 7 a.m., we're going to be on the road, heading to Georgia."\u000a\u000aIrma could cause power outages for weeks in parts of South Florida, and more than 4.1 million customers -- or 9 million people -- could be affected by outages at some point, Florida Power and Light Co. said. "Our crews will likely have to rebuild parts of the system," the utility said.\u000a\u000aDrivers wait in line for gas Thursday in Miami as they prepare for Hurricane Irma.\u000a\u000aEvacuees stocked up on supplies, waited for hours at gas stations and sat through massive traffic jams.\u000a\u000aPeople also flocked to South Florida airports, but schedules were in flux. More than half of Friday's flights were canceled at Miami International Airport, and "most of the airlines will suspend flights after (Friday) through Monday, depending on the condition of the airport," spokesman Greg Chin said.\u000a\u000aFlorida is not the only state preparing for possible impact. Long, the FEMA administrator, said people from Alabama to North Carolina should watch the storm.\u000a\u000aGeorgia's Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 30 counties and has ordered evacuations for coastal areas east of Interstate 95, including Savannah, starting Saturday. The governors of North and South Carolina also declared states of emergency.\u000a\u000aDevastation to islands\u000a\u000aIrma brought heavy rain and powerful winds Thursday night and Friday morning to the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands.\u000a\u000aResidents of the islands, a British overseas territory with about 35,000 people, were told to stay put.\u000a\u000aDesmond Piccolo Henry took shelter in his concrete home with his wife and a friend on one of the islands, Providenciales, as the storm rocked the area early Friday.\u000a\u000a"It's a concrete house, but trust me, it was shaking. My friend was saying, 'Oh my God, I think God is coming, why are we going through this?' "\u000a\u000aHenry's home survived with just a few shingles lost, but people have told him that roofs were torn off nearby and debris crushed some cars. Video he posted to Facebook showed downed tree limbs and other destruction.\u000a\u000aThe capital island of Grand Turk suffered "quite a bit of damage" Thursday night, including to part of a hospital's roof, Gov. John Freeman told CNN.\u000a\u000aHigh winds leave downed trees Thursday in the Santurce neighborhood of San Juan, Puerto Rico.\u000a\u000aIn Puerto Rico, about 56,680 customers were without water, with the island's northeast hit the hardest, according to Jesus Poupart of the emergency operations center.\u000a\u000aAfter Irma, Hurricane Jose looms\u000a\u000aThe Caribbean islands already pummeled by Irma have begun assessing the damage, finding shredded buildings, battered cars and streets submerged in water.\u000a\u000aBarbuda, one of two major islands in the nation of Antigua and Barbuda, is barely habitable, with about 95% of its buildings damaged, Prime Minister Gaston Browne.\u000a\u000aBrowne estimated the damage will cost $100 million to fix on the island of 1,800 residents.\u000a\u000a"It looks like (a) garbage disposal," Marlon Carr, a photographer who toured the island with Browne, told CNN on Thursday. "There was rubble and roof galvanized all over the island. It looked like some of the houses ... were imploded on."\u000a\u000aAn aerial image over Barbuda on Thursday shows the devastation from Hurricane Irma.\u000a\u000aIrma's eye passed directly over Barbuda on Wednesday, and now the northeastern Caribbean nation is anxiously watching Hurricane Jose to the east, which has strengthened to a Category 4 storm.\u000a\u000aAntigua and Barbuda, St. Martin and St. Barts are under a hurricane watch for Jose , which could pass close to those islands Saturday. The government called for voluntary evacuations from Barbuda, Browne said.\u000a\u000aIrma also badly hit St. Martin with about 50 people reported injured.\u000a\u000aDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the looting situation in St. Maarten, the Dutch portion of the island, as serious, a spokesman for his office said Friday.\u000a\u000aThe government said emergency flights delivering water and other supplies to the island will be used to take residents and visitors off it.\u000a\u000aIrma leaves behind damage Thursday in Orient Bay on the island of St. Martin.\u000a\u000a"Our worst fears have played out in Barbuda and elsewhere," said Walter Cotte, regional director for the Americas for the Red Cross. "We can't yet assess the full extent of damage, but we expect that the Red Cross will be delivering extensive support to many thousands over the coming weeks and months."\u000a\u000aAre you affected by Irma?

aVPaying for food at one KFC restaurant in China just got a lot more personal.\u000a\u000aForget cash, credit cards or a smartphone -- customers can now settle the bill with their face thanks to new technology unveiled on Friday.\u000a\u000aAnt Financial, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30), launched the new service in the eastern city of Hangzhou. It's the latest example of the growing use of facial recognition by businesses and government agencies in the world's most populous nation.\u000a\u000aDiners at the restaurant, a KFC brand in China known as KPro, place their order at a terminal, which then scans their face. If it matches the image on the photo ID stored in the system, the customer only has to enter their phone number and the payment goes through. (Their food is still served by a regular human.)\u000a\u000aRelated: You only need a selfie to enter this tourist destination\u000a\u000aThe system is based on Ant Financial's digital payment platform Alipay, which has more than half a billion users worldwide and already allows people to sign into its Chinese app using their face.\u000a\u000aAnt says the KFC restaurant is the first physical store in the world to use facial recognition software to take payments.\u000a\u000aThe company is eager to reassure consumers that the technology is secure. The software analyzes more than 600 facial features to make a match, and uses a 3D camera and a "liveness" algorithm to make sure people aren't trying to fool it with photos or videos of someone else.\u000a\u000aRelated: These three countries are winning the global robot race\u000a\u000aSimilar technology is already being used in a variety of ways in China.\u000a\u000aTech company Baidu (BIDU, Tech30) began testing facial recognition software last year to manage tourist admissions in Wuzhen, a historic town that receives millions of visitors each year. Staff at Baidu headquarters can pay with their faces in the company restaurant.\u000a\u000aOrdering meals at Baidu HQ will literally leave you with a smile on your face!

(Ant is an investor in Yum China (YUMC), the company that runs KFC in the country.)\u000a\u000a"We hope one day in the future people can go out without their cell phones or wallets," said Dong Liyun, a product manager at Ant Financial.\u000a\u000aExperts say the introduction of facial recognition software in China has been helped by the country's massive database of citizens' ID photos -- as well as the huge amount of images collected by internet companies.\u000a\u000aRelated: Chinese park installs facial recognition software to stop toilet paper thieves\u000a\u000aWestern tech firms have taken a more cautious approach because of privacy concerns. Google (GOOGL, Tech30) said in 2011 that it had scrapped software that would let smartphone users snap a picture of a person's face to find out who they are.\u000a\u000aChinese authorities, meanwhile, are already combining facial recognition technology with the country's network of surveillance cameras to monitor citizens. Police are reported to have caught suspects by surreptitiously scanning faces at events, including a recent beer festival.\u000a\u000a"Facial recognition has started to become a requirement in new city surveillance projects in China," research firm IHS Markit said in a recent report.\u000a\u000aFace scanners even made it into the toilet stalls at a popular park in Beijing in order to stop people taking more than their fair share of toilet paper.

aV(CNN) Scott Atran and his research colleagues were sitting face-to-face with captured ISIS fighters in Kirkuk, a city in northern Iraq, near the front lines of battle.\u000a\u000aThe researchers handed the fighters a set of cards, engraved with study questions to answer.\u000a\u000a"They literally threw the cards down and said they refused to respond," said Atran, a cognitive anthropologist who is director of research at Artis International , a multidisciplinary research institution , and who holds teaching positions at the University of Michigan and the University of Oxford.\u000a\u000aTo Atran's surprise, the fighters were still willing to answer research questions; it was just that those particular questions were incomprehensible to some of them because the questions focused on the wrong motivations, he said.\u000a\u000aAtran and his colleagues spent the past couple of years interviewing captured ISIS fighters, as well as Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) members and other front-line fighters battling against ISIS, to better understand what drives anyone to willingly attack and die for a cause.\u000a\u000aThe researchers discovered that three crucial factors motivate both ISIS fighters and those fighting them: a deep commitment to sacred values, the readiness to forsake family for those values, and the perceived spiritual strength of the group or community that the fighter represents.\u000a\u000aThe findings, which were published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour on Monday, also help explain why the ISIS fighters whom the researchers interviewed were irritated with the initial line of questioning, Atran said.\u000a\u000aThat first round of research questions was not related to sacred values. Yet when Atran and his colleagues developed new questions and measurements based around spirituality and values, the ISIS fighters started opening up, he said.\u000a\u000aThe study could "help to inform policy decisions for the common defense" and fighting terrorism, the researchers write.\u000a\u000a"The main thing that really matters to them is what they 'feel in their hearts,' as they themselves put it. Some of these guys are really committed," Atran said, adding that he found the same characteristics in the Kurdish fighters and others fighting ISIS.\u000a\u000a"In our material world, we have underestimated or underplayed the spiritual dimension of human action," he said. "Doing so runs the risk of leaving ourselves open to people who are motivated by deeper spiritual and sacred values and virtues, and I think that's the greatest danger we face."\u000a\u000a'Not only are they willing to sacrifice their group but their family'\u000a\u000aTo examine what may drive someone's willingness to fight and die, the researchers analyzed their previous interviews with captured ISIS fighters and PKK members from 2015.\u000a\u000aThen, in the new study, the researchers carried out a quantitative field study in which they interviewed 19 Peshmerga or Kurdish Regional Government forces, 17 Iraqi army Kurds and 20 Arab Sunni combatants -- all fighting ISIS -- about their willingness to make costly sacrifices for the sake of their values, from February to March 2016.\u000a\u000aMany of those interviews were conducted on the front lines of war.\u000a\u000aTo get access to the front line, "we had to talk to the political leaders or whoever was in charge of the territory," Atran said.\u000a\u000aHe added that his colleagues and he would try to connect with the fighters through word of mouth or even with the help of journalists covering the war.\u000a\u000aThe sacrifices mentioned in their interviews were dying, letting their families suffer, killing civilians, undertaking a suicide attack or torturing women and children.\u000a\u000aThe researchers checked the combatants' responses to interview questions against objective factors, such as the frequency of being wounded in battle or time spent at the front line, Atran said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Majority of ISIS victims are Muslim Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Majority of ISIS victims are Muslim 01:24\u000a\u000aNext, the researchers conducted 14 separate online surveys and controlled psychological experiments in which 6,649 noncombatants in all regions of Spain, including the North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, indicated their own willingness to make costly sacrifices.\u000a\u000aAtran said, "We chose Spain due to reasons that they have been targeted by al Qaeda and ISIS ."\u000a\u000aAmong all study participants, whether on the front lines or noncombatants, the researchers found that the willingness to fight and make sacrifices was associated with whether people saw themselves as having greater spiritual strength than their enemy rather than having greater physical strength.\u000a\u000aThe findings were based on all study participants' in-person interview responses to questionnaires that included experimental designs and measures or online survey results.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Former al Qaeda recruiter's warning about ISIS Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former al Qaeda recruiter's warning about ISIS 04:10\u000a\u000a"This means that sacred values and strength of spirit are critical driving factors for ISIS fighters and the people fighting against them most successfully," Atran said.\u000a\u000a"Now, what if, when push comes to shove, the values and the group divorce? Are you going to go with your buddies or the values? We found for the most devoted fighters ... those most willing to make sacrifices were those willing to sacrifice their group" or buddies, he said. "Not only are they willing to sacrifice their group but their family."\u000a\u000aPredicting an enemy's will to fight can be crucial in times of conflict, according to the study.\u000a\u000aAtran pointed to how in 2014, President Barack Obama endorsed the declaration of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that "we underestimated ISIL and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi army. ... It boils down to predicting the will to fight, which is imponderable."\u000a\u000aMeasuring 'what motivates us all' to die for a cause\u000a\u000aLimitations of the new study include that the data are based on small numbers of participants from the battlefront due to restricted access, and data from noncombatants are self-reports that are only representative of Spain.\u000a\u000aMoving forward, however, Atran said he and his colleagues are working on followup research that involves brain-imaging data.\u000a\u000aAll in all, for the researchers to combine ethnographic fieldwork with fighters, scientific theory and online surveys was "impressive," said Josh Horgan, distinguished professor at Georgia State University's Global Studies Institute and Department of Psychology.\u000a\u000a"The challenges of doing such research shouldn't be underestimated, but this study shows us that it can be done," said Horgan, who was not involved in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.\u000a\u000a"What this study tells us is that there are three compelling reasons why someone would be willing to fight and die: They commit to and embrace some sacred value, they willingly forsake their own kin for those same values, and they truly believe in the spiritual strength of their own group compared to the enemy," he said. "This is an elegant theory that makes both intuitive sense but is supported by real-world data."\u000a\u000aIn other words, he said, "there are common psychological threads woven into the fabric of what motivates us all to fight and die for a cause."\u000a\u000aIn general, those are main components of research on radicalization and terrorism: the ideology component and to some extent the network component, or the component of having support from others who share your values, said Arie Kruglanski, distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Maryland and a fellow of the American Psychological Association.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"The ideology component addresses individuals' need to matter and feel significant. ... It tells people what to do, such as fight and make sacrifices, in order to gain respect and admiration from others," said Kruglanski, who was not involved in the new study.\u000a\u000a"Especially when it comes to violence that is shunned by most religions and most cultures, you need validation from a group of people that would then become your reference group. So the group component is very important, particularly when it comes to antisocial activities that are forbidden or shunned," he said. "Some of Scott Atran's work addresses that aspect. In general, I think it's a very important piece of the puzzle that Scott and his colleagues are addressing."

aVNic Robertson is CNN's international diplomatic editor. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000aAbuja, Nigeria (CNN) There are days in diplomacy that don't go quite as planned -- and I got to witness one up close this week.\u000a\u000aAbove the hammering throb of thrashing helicopter rotor blades, someone shouted: "We are turning back."\u000a\u000aRain lashed the windows. Wiper blades swiped back and forth. Sodden clouds scudded by our feet. Flooded refugee camps came and went in the fog.\u000a\u000aSo near, yet so far: 3,000 miles traveled, an overnight flight, lost sleep -- all following weeks of preparation. And now, only a few miles short, Nigeria's rainy season forced a change of plan.\u000a\u000aTo fly on would have been to put Britain's top diplomat in range of Boko Haram's guns.\u000a\u000aRain didn't win the day, but it sure changed its course.\u000a\u000aThe powerful images of suffering on the front lines of Nigeria's near-forgotten war -- a necessary tool in today's diplomatic grab bag to shore up support -- were in danger of getting washed away.\u000a\u000aWithout these images, Johnson had no way of pivoting from the big headline issues of the day in British politics -- Brexit and the Conservative Party leadership -- which he and his team hoped they'd left behind them in London.\u000a\u000aSo connected has the world become that no diplomat is ever really off the grid.\u000a\u000aEven in this remote corner of war-torn Nigeria, a conflict hot zone, cell phone data is hotter -- a notion unthinkable even half a decade ago to the previous generation of diplomats. A quick on-camera interview can be online in minutes.\u000a\u000aFacing the rain, Johnson and crew quickly improvised a plan B.\u000a\u000aAcross the globe, his boss, British Prime Minister Theresa May, faced her own storm in Japan. She didn't run in to a rain shower so much as a missile launch.\u000a\u000aHours before she landed to plead the UK's case for a post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and Japan, North Korea's Kim had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile over her host's head.\u000a\u000aIf Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was testy when she arrived, she might have realized that getting him to sugar coat his message to her and her delegation of businessmen was out of the question.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Boris Johnson visits victims of Boko Haram Replay More Videos ...

And as night follows day, so Johnson -- thousands of miles away in Nigeria on his own mission -- was led off message and responding to her comments.\u000a\u000aBut nowhere was it raining harder this week than in Houston, Texas.\u000a\u000aThanks to Nigeria's sometimes-reliable cell phone coverage, while covering the effects of war, I'd been more or less keeping up with my family Whatsapp group on the rising water in my sister-in-law's house.\u000a\u000aThank goodness she is safe now, but it's been a worry.\u000a\u000aHarvey has delivered President Trump an deadly diversion from his big diplomatic challenge: Kim Jong Un.\u000a\u000aWithout Harvey, eyes would have been on the US President, expecting something to match the "fire and fury" he threatened Kim with just a few weeks back\u000a\u000aHe's mostly left that diplomatic load for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis.\u000a\u000aNothing is off the table where North Korea is concerned, we are told, other than perhaps President Trump's undivided attention.\u000a\u000aRain and missiles are an odd combination, but in the era of modern diplomacy, they've woven an odd tapestry this week. One long thread, binding the world order together.\u000a\u000aKim's missiles exposing Johnson to May's political dodges because rain grounded his plans, and Kim dodging Trump's fire and fury because rain swallowed his attention.\u000a\u000aSomething to think about for the diplomat planning an arduous journey hoping to further the national interest.

aV(CNN) Groups representing public health officials and doctors banded together Thursday to petition the US Food and Drug Administration to take ultra-high-dosage opioid pills, tablets and nasal sprays off the market. When prescribed, these opioids equal more than 90 milligrams of morphine (MME) a day in potency.\u000a\u000aThese can include higher dosages of both fast-acting, immediate-release opioids as well as slow-acting, longer-release formulations of oxycodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, methadone and fentanyl.\u000a\u000aThe petition specifically requests the removal of OxyContin 80mg, which when taken twice a day equals 240 MME in 24 hours, as well as the removal of oxycodone 30mg, typically taken four times a day for the equivalent of 180 MME daily.\u000a\u000aAlthough the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2016 guidelines on opioid prescribing do not prohibit prescribing dosages over 90 milligrams of morphine a day, the agency says clinicians should generally avoid prescribing at such high levels and always start prescribing at the lowest doses. In cases in which they do have to prescribe at high levels, doctors need to use caution and have justified reasons.\u000a\u000aWho needs ultra-high dosages?\u000a\u000aIt's difficult to say just how many people are using high-dosage opioids because there haven't been any published data to show what percent of the opioid market they represent or the number of prescriptions for them.\u000a\u000aAccording to the petition, these higher opioid dosage units were an answer to increased patient tolerance as more and more doctors were prescribing opioids in the early 2000s. "Many (ultra-high-dosage unit) opioids entered the market as high dose opioid prescribing became more common," the petition says.\u000a\u000aAnd that's in part because of how opioids work. The more a patient takes, the less sensitive their body is to that dosage, meaning a patient needs a higher dose to get the same pain relief.\u000a\u000a"The thinking early on was, as patients became tolerant, you respond to tolerance by giving even more," said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, one of the groups filing the petition. However, as opioid overdoses in the United States have increased to epidemic proportions, there has been more scrutiny on how doctors prescribe.\u000a\u000aIn fact, nearly half of all opioid overdoses in 2015 were from prescription painkillers. Since 1999, according to the CDC, sales of prescription drugs have nearly quadrupled -- and so have the number of overdose deaths involving prescription drugs.\u000a\u000aHigh doses increase risk for addiction and overdose\u000a\u000aThe petition notes that in 2015, 11.5 million Americans misused a prescription opioid. The most common reason: pain relief. And that includes borrowing a friend's extra pills and using a family member's leftover narcotics.\u000a\u000a"If you borrow someone's pills and they are an ultra-high dose, there's a good chance you're going to suffer an overdose," Kolodny said.\u000a\u000aa day double a person's risk of overdose compared with someone with a dose of less than 20 MME a day. According to the CDC, doses at or above 50 MMEa day double a person's risk of overdose compared with someone with a dose of less than 20 MME a day.\u000a\u000aHigher dosages also carry an increased risk for addiction. "A person taking a relatively low dose of prescribed opioids is 15 times as likely to develop an opioid use disorder (OUD) as a person who has not been prescribed opioids," the petition says. At extremely high dosages of more than 120 MME a day, that risk soars to 122 times that of a person who has not taken an opioid.\u000a\u000aWho's using the drugs?\u000a\u000aKolodny believes that taking these high-dosage drugs off the shelves will help reshape opioid prescribing practices and encourage clinicians to prescribe at lower and safer doses. "The thought that (medications) exist in a higher dose gives you a false sense of security," he said. "Say you are on the 60-milligram oxycodone. The fact that there is 80 milligram makes you think, 'How high a pill can I be on?' "\u000a\u000aIf the FDA follows through on the petition, it will not be the first time it pulled drugs off of the shelves over public health concerns.\u000a\u000aIn July, Endo Pharmaceucticals pulled its opioid painkiller Opana ER after the FDA requested that it be taken off of the market because of "the public health consequences of abuse." It was the first time the FDA had made such a request. The drug was connected to outbreaks of HIV and hepatitis C after injection drug users were crushing up the pill and injecting it.\u000a\u000a"We are facing an opioid epidemic -- a public health crisis, and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse," FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said when the agency made its request. "We will continue to take regulatory steps when we see situations where an opioid product's risks outweigh its benefits, not only for its intended patient population but also in regard to its potential for misuse and abuse."\u000a\u000aDr. Jay Butler, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, explained that the new petition isn't meant to make it more difficult for patients to get treatment.\u000a\u000aIt's "important to recognize, in some instances, a high dosage is appropriate: people receiving palliative care, cancer pain. But there are options to receive these high doses without using the ultra-high dosages," Butler said. For example, instead of using higher-dose pills fewer times a day, patients may be prescribed lower doses to take more frequently. He added that for patients who have difficulty swallowing pills, other forms of opioids, such as patches and suppositories, would still be available.\u000a\u000aUnintended consequences\u000a\u000aBut Dr. Steven Stanos, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said that focusing on the dosage itself could have some unintended consequences for patient treatment. The academy represents physicians practicing in the field of pain medicine.\u000a\u000aDoctors need to consider how the medication overall is impacting a patient's quality of life, he said. "Assess depression, anxiety, all these other types of social variabilities. How (the opioid is) impacting function," he said. "If they're thinking of just the morphine dose, they're going to forget these other factors that are patient-specific."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Stanos said, there is a concern that this could lead to further stigmatization for both patients and doctors. "We want to be helpful as we can as pain physicians ... and turn the curve on overdose deaths," he said. "But we don't want patients to feel stigmatized. ... We don't want physicians to feel like they can't use opioids appropriately."\u000a\u000aThe new petition comes on the heels of a National Academies of Sciences report in July that says the FDA needs to create a new framework that incorporates evaluating the public health risks that opioids may present when assessing the risks of a narcotic.\u000a\u000aThe FDA has 180 days to respond to the petition.

aV(CNN) Two Democratic members of Florida's congressional delegation have asked the federal government to step in and help after the state's removal of thousands of children from a Florida Medicaid program.\u000a\u000a"We have seen over the years that the State of Florida has evaded its legal responsibilities in many instances to ensure access to care for the children of Florida," Sen. Bill Nelson and Rep. Kathy Castor wrote in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe letter comes in the wake of a CNN story detailing how Florida's Republican administration took 13,074 children off a Medicaid insurance plan called Children's Medical Services and put them on privately managed Medicaid plans in 2015.\u000a\u000aFor more than 40 years, Children's Medical Services, or CMS, has specialized in caring for Florida children on Medicaid with special medical needs. The children who were removed and put on other Medicaid plans had health problems such as birth defects, heart disease, diabetes and blindness. Their new plans did not specialize in caring for children with these types of medical conditions.\u000a\u000aCastor told CNN on Wednesday that the state of Florida "clearly" did something wrong when it moved the children from CMS to the privately managed Medicaid plans.\u000a\u000a"Florida had one of the highest-quality and most efficient treatment and care programs for children with special health care needs," she said. "They've obliterated that."\u000a\u000a"We urge HHS to exercise its oversight and enforcement authority to ensure that children in Florida are appropriately enrolled in the plan that best fits their needs," Nelson and Castor wrote in their letter.\u000a\u000aMara Gambineri, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Health, said Tuesday that the department is "100 percent focused on making sure the programs we manage are providing quality care -- especially to children."\u000a\u000a"Any assertion that children have been denied care or are not receiving services is absolutely false," she added.\u000a\u000aIn September 2015, a state administrative law judge ruled that the Department of Health had unlawfully removed the children from CMS and ordered it to stop.\u000a\u000aThe state stopped using the screening method in question, but it wasn't until last month that the department wrote letters to families letting them know their children could be rescreened to be put back on CMS.\u000a\u000aThe lawmakers questioned why the letters went to only 6,081 parents when more than 13,000 children were kicked out of CMS.\u000a\u000a"It remains unclear why the state chose to contact only half of the families affected, what criteria the state used in making the determination of which families to contact, and how many children are actually reenrolled after being revaluated," Nelson and Castor wrote.\u000a\u000a"It's unconscionable. There is no reasonable explanation for the state of Florida to be dragging their feet on this," Castor said.\u000a\u000a"The state of Florida and DOH have not followed through with their responsibilities as directed by the courts," she said. "They've left these children in the lurch. They've said they're going to take care of it, and they've utterly failed to do that."\u000a\u000aGambineri said in early August that the letters went to parents of children who were removed from CMS and put on another Medicaid plan and were still on that plan and financially eligible for Medicaid.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aDr. Louis St. Petery, former executive vice president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he doesn't trust the state to reach out to all of the affected families.\u000a\u000aHe pointed out that the state didn't reach out to the families soon after the judge's decision, even though he urged officials to do so.\u000a\u000a"There's been a lack of transparency all the way through, which CNN tracked down," he said. "I always felt that for the Department of Health, the end justified the means, and the end was to get these kids off of CMS."\u000a\u000aSt. Petery and some other pediatricians think the state switched the children to Medicaid plans run by private insurance companies because most of those companies have been generous donors to Florida Republican Party committees.\u000a\u000aA statement by the Department of Health called this allegation "100 percent false."

aVThis feature is part of Colorscope, an award-winning series exploring our perception of color and its use across cultures, one shade at a time. See more here .\u000a\u000a(CNN) It can be hard to tell the difference between someone going to a funeral, preparing for the catwalk or simply taking a stroll in a big city. Each category can involve in an all-black ensemble.\u000a\u000aOver the past 50 to 100 years, the color black has gone through a major transition, according to Leatrice Eiseman, color specialist and executive director of the Pantone Color Institute.\u000a\u000aBlack has gradually made its way from being a color associated with grief and morbidity to one known as a fashion staple that radiates sophistication, she said.\u000a\u000a"It has that kind of weight attached to it ... that now brings a sense of power to the color ... beyond just funerals and grief and widows' weeds," Eiseman said.\u000a\u000aToday, people wear black as a mark of expensive clothing, to minimize the appearance of their size and to exude confidence, she said.\u000a\u000aBut the color's link to gloom still emanates across cultures, for example in American and European mourning practices as well as in fictional depictions of evil -- like a witch's hat or the cape of the Grim Reaper. The origins of this are part of our evolution.\u000a\u000aBlack is "the color of night," Eiseman said, "the color of darkness. The color that conceals all."\u000a\u000aWe fear what we cannot see\u000a\u000aYou're alone at night, cozied up on the couch and watching a movie, with the room a well-lit enclosure; your safety is not in question. There is a gust of wind outside. The trees rattle and scrape against the window. You hear a loud fizzle, and the power goes out.\u000a\u000aYou're now engulfed in pitch darkness, and for most people, fear is probably setting in.\u000a\u000a"Fear is just like pain. Fear is there to protect us from possible harm," said Martin Antony, professor of psychology at Ryerson University in Toronto and author of "The Anti-Anxiety Workbook." "So that fear makes us more vigilant for possible danger."\u000a\u000aPrehistorically, people would have been more at risk of being attacked by predators or by enemies when in the dark, he said. Through evolution, humans have therefore developed a tendency to be scared of darkness.\u000a\u000a"In the dark, our visual sense vanishes, and we are unable to detect who or what is around us. We rely on our visual system to help protect us from harm," Antony said. "Being scared of the dark is a prepared fear."\u000a\u000aEiseman agreed that "the unknown" is an inherent association that humans make with the color black, as It prevents them from seeing distinct shapes and veils potential threats.\u000a\u000a"How we see colors in nature has such an important effect on the human psyche," she said. "And we know that from the beginning of time, black is the color of night, and it's the color that could hide any nefarious deeds that might be perpetrated under the cover of darkness."\u000a\u000aThis notion is imprinted on us from the time we're children, she said. However, thanks to modern technology, we're now able to turn on the light and continue to have fun even at night, she said.\u000a\u000aBut some never quite shake the fear.\u000a\u000a'Excessive fears'\u000a\u000aThough fear is natural, it may become an issue if it gets excessive, Antony highlighted.\u000a\u000aMany of us may experience a strong fear while alone at night in a dangerous part of town, he said, but it's not as common to feel that way in a dark bedroom.\u000a\u000aExcessive fear of the dark can be caused by a variety of factors. It may come from a negative experience such as getting attacked in a dark place. Or it can be caused by something as simple as watching a horror movie, according to Antony.\u000a\u000aThis fear can then become a phobia -- specifically known as nyctophobia -- when it begins interfering with relationships, work or the ability to do things they want to do. If someone is unable to leave their house at night, that would probably be categorized as a phobia, Antony said.\u000a\u000aAids can include nightlights or leaving a door open to allow in light from elsewhere, partially restoring vision.\u000a\u000aThese are called "safety signals," Antony said. Having a small light on or a friend in the room helps us feel protected and more grounded in reality.\u000a\u000aTreatments are also available, including gradual exposure to the feared situation, Antony said. Professionals have their patients rank and order a list of situations they're afraid of and then expose themselves to each fear until they're no longer scared.\u000a\u000a"If right now they're sleeping with a nightlight, for example, we might have them buy a nightlight with a slightly dimmer bulb or one with a switch that's variable," he said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aBut just as the color black can bring fear to most, it can provide security to others -- particularly in terms of fashion.\u000a\u000a"I think more people think of it as kind of an enveloping kind of color that they can pull around them that gives them a certain degree of security," Eiseman said. "They can kind of fade into the shadows."\u000a\u000aIn a way, there's an ambivalence built into black, she added. It is up to the individual to either fear what lurks in the darkness or become one with it.\u000a\u000aWhen taking a look at many women's closets, most are likely to have embraced it.\u000a\u000a"Every woman knows that having the black dress in the closet, the black shoes, the black coat, the black anything that we put on, it will work in just about any circumstance," she said.\u000a\u000aSo one tip could be to beat your fear by stepping over to the dark side.

aVTokyo, Japan (CNN) There's something distinctly punk about Katsuya Kamo's aesthetic. His otherworldly headpieces, designed for some of the world's most revered fashion houses, seem to disregard the limits of millinery, often combine hair with unusual materials.\u000a\u000a"Feathers, paper, butterflies, animals, everything," the Japanese hairstylist and makeup artist said in his Tokyo studio, gesturing to the examples surrounding him, including outtakes from his latest collection for designer Jun Takahashi's Undercover label.\u000a\u000aOn the runway, the butterfly-inspired Undercover designs -- each of which took a day to produce -- fluttered about the models' heads, making them appear half human, half insect.\u000a\u000aBut Kamo isn't just looking to shock; his is a quest to create pure beauty.\u000a\u000a"If it's not that, then the end form cannot be complete."\u000a\u000aA Katsuya Kamo headpiece for designer Junya Watanabe.\u000a\u000aThree decades of innovation\u000a\u000aSince 1996, Kamo has collaborated with Japanese designers Takahashi and Junya Watanabe on hair and makeup for their collections. His international breakthrough came in 2007, with his attention-grabbing looks for Watanabe's Autumn-Winter 2008 show.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) What the American public craves is authenticity: a sense that the men and women we elect are, like us, flesh-and-blood creatures who celebrate and grieve, who dance and despair. But it's rare to see politician reveal his or her vulnerability before a mass television audience.\u000a\u000aAnd that is why Vice President Joe Biden's appearance on "The Late Show" with Stephen Colbert on Thursday night was so uncommonly moving. In the face of Biden's offhand honesty, passion and wrenching humanity as he discussed his beloved son Beau's death from brain cancer earlier this summer, it is almost embarrassing to acknowledge that it made for "good television."\u000a\u000aIt was life happening before our eyes, the kind of life we find in our own living rooms and kitchens.\u000a\u000aReal conversation about the human experience is something we don't expect on late night -- from arch hosts, and particularly from politicians, who often seem like pieces of Styrofoam.\u000a\u000aThe Biden appearance slapped the nation awake, reminding us that we've become almost numb as we listen to the excuses, the prevarications, the bragging, the naked vanity that seems to dominate both major parties in this election season.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Funnyman Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert talks with George Clooney during the premiere episode of "The Late Show," which he took over on Tuesday, September 8.

He referred to the pressing political question of the moment: Will Joe Biden challenge Hillary Clinton and others in the ongoing Democratic primary?\u000a\u000aA lot hung on his answer, and the whole nation leaned forward to listen.\u000a\u000aBiden was shockingly frank for a man under the klieg lights. His face was extremely mobile, with a range of emotion flickering as he dipped his eyes to the floor and seemed to wince. A vast audience saw the obvious truth: Here is father grieving for beloved son, Beau, who died of brain cancer only a few months ago. The rawness of his feelings were vividly on display.\u000a\u000aBiden was frank, saying: "I don't think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, number two, they can look at folks out there and say, 'I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this." One could hear a pin drop in the audience, which held its breath.

And it's clear that even Joe doesn't think he can manage it in the wake of his son's death.\u000a\u000aIt's easy to say why so many like Joe Biden a great deal. I'm among them. He's a compassionate human being, and he's real.\u000a\u000aBorn in 1942, he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- the lunch-pail capital of the western world, in my view. I grew up only a mile or so from Biden, whose father scraped to find work during some hard economic times in this era, when anthracite mining had died out and left many in northeastern Pennsylvania without other options for making a living. My mother, who died at 97 only last year, was a friend of Biden's aunt and mother, and she recalled that they moved to Delaware in search of better work.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Biden unsure if he's 'there' for a run Replay More Videos ...

He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth -- like Jeb Bush or Donald Trump. He made his way -- slowly but surely -- in the often clamorous world of American politics. And he has risen to a height his family could scarcely have imagined in those hardscrabble years after the war in Scranton.\u000a\u000aJoe is the real deal. He would have made a great president, perhaps: a man of the people, who understands their needs, their fondest wishes, their fears. But that probably isn't going to happen.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, Joe Biden has -- unexpectedly -- wakened a nation to what it craves: a vulnerable but fully committed person who can say what he or she means, without bombast or equivocation, and lead us forward.

Especially when money can't buy you good sense.\u000a\u000aLouise Linton, an actress recently married to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is facing criticism for an ill-conceived social media encounter that first involved her bragging about her designer wardrobe, and quickly devolved into her mocking and berating an Oregon mom. She posted a photo to Instagram of herself having just exited an official government plane, and included a series of hashtags to specify exactly which pricey designer brands she was wearing. When Jennifer Miller, an Oregon mother of three, criticized her ("Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable"), Linton struck back. "Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?" she asked. "I'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day 'trip' than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours." She later apologized in a statement\u000a\u000aLiberals were aghast. Some conservatives shrugged, or said nothing. Breitbart gave the story a cursory writeup , and the Twitter chatter about it has been dominated by liberal pundits while conservatives have stayed largely silent.\u000a\u000aThe right passed up the opportunity to side with someone who represents the working and middle class that Donald Trump's campaign supposedly championed against the arrogance of the entitled rich. Instead this encounter is another piece of evidence that we can now put a bullet in the idea that most people who voted for Donald Trump did so because of economic insecurity; for many, it's clearly about a more complex, ugly form of political and racial tribalism.\u000a\u000aThe response from the right (or lack thereof) to Linton's outburst is more evidence that the 2016 election wasn't just about white working-class voters feeling unrepresented by out-of-touch elites. It was also about a group of Americans who don't care one iota about character or honesty or even reality, but do care about sticking it to liberals and creating chaos for fun -- because liberals, and the people increasingly benefiting from the changing political order, are women and people of color.\u000a\u000aTo be clear, Linton is not an elected official, and how she spends her money is her own business, whether it's on Birkin bags and Valentino heels or perhaps copies of her own bizarrely self-aggrandizing book , which peddles racist clichés about Africa and has been thoroughly discredited.\u000a\u000aThere is also something particularly sexist about the vitriol aimed at women who wear pricey clothing, since that outrage is rarely leveled at men who have closets full of $10,000 suits.\u000a\u000aBut Linton's actions are only the latest example of ever-coarsening behavior online from the nation's most privileged and entitled, coupled with stunning conservative hypocrisy. The combination of Linton's Africa memoir, her tacky name-dropping hashtags, and her condescending and classist response to Miller paints a portrait of a self-involved and narcissistic woman with a loose relationship to the truth and very little self-awareness.\u000a\u000aThere seems to be no hypocrisy a startling number of GOP voters won't tolerate, and no point at which an individual's cronyism, lies and ill character matter if there's an R next to their name on the ballot.\u000a\u000aTrump promised to "drain the swamp" in Washington and advocate for the average working man; instead, he's appointed bankers like Mnuchin, a 17-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, to the richest Cabinet in history , and along with those millionaires and billionaires is pushing policies that would devastate the poor\u000a\u000aTrump tarred his opponent as hopelessly corrupt, and Clinton's emails got top media billing at his rallies and in media coverage; many of Trump's supporters cited "Crooked Hillary" as a reason they were voting for him.\u000a\u000aAnd yet as president, Trump has taken nepotism to new extremes and demonstrated a shocking and unprecedented willingness to abuse his position in order to enrich himself and his family. He put his daughter and her husband in plum positions, ignored the fact that his son met with a Russian operative to get dirt on Clinton, and profits handsomely from the hotels and clubs he owns -- and that others pay to stay at so they can get access to the president.

aVTimothy Stanley, a conservative, is a historian and columnist for Britain's Daily Telegraph. He is the author of "Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Hurricane Harvey was a revelatory moment in the early presidency of Donald J. Trump. We got a glimpse of Trump without the cultural politics: Trump as he could be. As Hurricane Irma approaches, Congress returns and North Korea shakes its nuclear fist -- this is the Trump the world needs. Competent and disciplined.\u000a\u000aDisasters always tell us something about America's sins and blessings. Hurricane Harvey showcased bad urban planning -- cheap housing built on swamps and wetlands -- and partisan politics. Some said Texans deserved a deluge for voting for Trump; environmentalists pointed the finger at climate change. And while the left worships Mother Earth, parts of the right still cower before a God who would flatten Houston for having a gay pride parade. "Here's a city that has boasted of its LGBT devotion, its affinity for the sexual perversion movement in America," said Rick Wiles, a Christian broadcaster. "They're underwater."\u000a\u000aTrump flew into the Houston relief center and delivered a more positive message: "As tough as this was," the response to Hurricane Harvey "has been a wonderful thing, I think, even for the country to watch." To this, Chelsea Clinton tweeted with contempt: "People lost their lives, loved ones, homes, beloved pets." And she wasn't the only liberal who found Trump's upbeat tone inappropriate -- treating the hurricane victims as if they had swum here specially to see him. Journalists noted he toured Texas in a white "Official USA 45th Presidential Hat," which retails for $40 on his website. "What a crowd!" he said at Corpus Christi. "What a turnout!"\u000a\u000aThe thing is, that's America. Or at least, that's Texas. Liberals paint a picture of a society at breaking point -- torn apart by gender, class and race, desperately in need of therapy. But the response of Texans to Hurricane Harvey proved them wrong. For days we saw images of ordinary citizens -- including CNN reporters -- going out of their way to help other people. And when Trump showed up in Houston his reception was remarkable. He was encouraging, hopeful, kind and even kissed a few kids. "I had a different opinion of him," said one African-American woman, "and now I think he's a wonderful man."\u000a\u000aIn all my years of writing about US politics, I've noted that no matter how low a president's poll rating is, they always get a good reaction in public. It's partly about deference to the office, partly the appeal of celebrity. It's also that the kind of men who make it to the White House tend to have high levels of empathy and charm, despite how they appear on TV. But watching Trump doing his job well was also a reminder that there were positive reasons why millions of Americans voted for this man. Chief among them, they thought he might be good at running the country.\u000a\u000aWatching Trump doing his job well was also a reminder that there were positive reasons why millions of Americans voted for this man. Timothy Stanley\u000a\u000aIn a nation where the government is a byword for incompetence, why not let a businessman have a go -- especially one with an ability to talk honestly about the country's challenges and with an almost unlimited sense of possibility? Trump's "USA #1!" approach to Harvey is far closer in sentiment to many Americans than Chelsea Clinton's search for pity and blame.\u000a\u000aDon't bring Americans problems, bring them solutions.\u000a\u000aIf Trump has had a bad start to his presidency it's partly because he has actually created new problems. The fights with the media, the attempt to overhaul Obamacare, the incessant tweeting, the stream of resignations and sackings, all these have distracted from two of the most appealing Trump messages: the clear focus on growing the economy and the notion that all Americans are in this together.\u000a\u000aTrump's colorblind approach to national identity was inappropriate in the case of the Charlottesville, Virginia, statue controversy, where he was required by convention to denounce white supremacy as uniquely evil and failed to do so. But in Houston, it was perfect. Because while America is undeniably plagued by social divisions, it also has a strong sense of goodwill. As any foreigner will tell you, it might be one of the strangest places in the world but it's probably the kindest.\u000a\u000aOf course, presidents don't govern by kindness, which is why the administration says it wants to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, set up to help young undocumented immigrants. Trump the grandfather would probably have saved the program; he has said before that thinking about its future pained him. DACA was unconstitutional, say the conservatives; DACA was humanitarian, say the liberals. At the very least, ending it when so many young people had come to rely upon it seems cruel, even if Congress now has the opportunity to cook up a compromise before it runs out.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aBut there is a rational, nonshouty case to be made for setting the right direction when it comes to illegal immigration. The experience of Australia is that if you refuse to accept people who come illegally, it actually makes immigration a much safer and more transparent process. Canada, meanwhile, announced that its borders were open, only to have them overrun with new arrivals -- and is now urging them to apply legally. Imagine if this debate in the United States could be approached with a cool head. Without insult and with greater intellectual discipline.\u000a\u000aTrump's presidency looks like it's low on luck, but history in fact keeps giving him chances to get back on message. Harvey was one; the crises in Afghanistan and North Korea are others.\u000a\u000aObama has left behind a mess. Trump was elected to clean it up. If he could only show a little progress, Trump might remind people why he won. A significant portion of the population has decided he is evil, can do no good and must be driven from office as soon as possible. But the warm reception in Houston suggests there are more open minds out there still waiting to be changed.

aV(CNN) One in three Americans doesn't get enough sleep, and 45% of the world's population doesn't either.\u000a\u000aThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls that a "public health problem," because disrupted sleep is associated with a higher risk of conditions including diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular disease.\u000a\u000aWhat about Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia?\u000a\u000aIt's well known that people with Alzheimer's suffer sleep issues. Insomnia, nighttime wandering and daytime sleepiness are common for them, as well as other cognitive disorders such as Lewy body dementia and frontal lobe dementia.\u000a\u000aBut could poor sleep earlier in life actually cause dementia?\u000a\u000aREM sleep and dementia\u000a\u000anew study in the journal Neurology , the journal for the American Academy of Neurology, finds that people who get less REM, or dream-stage sleep, may be at higher risk for developing dementia. REM is the fifth stage of sleep, when the eyes move, the body heats up, breathing and pulse quicken and the mind dreams.\u000a\u000aResearchers followed 321 people with an average age of 61 for a dozen years, as part of the famous Framingham Heart Study. Sleep cycles were measured for each person, and their cognitive skills were assessed in person at regular intervals. Over the duration of the study, 32 people developed dementia. Of those, 24 were determined to be Alzheimer's disease.\u000a\u000aThe study found that people who took longer than the typical 90 minutes to enter REM were more likely to get dementia. They also spent only about 17% of their sleep dreaming, compared to 20% in those who did not develop dementia.\u000a\u000aNo association with dementia was found for any of the other four stages of sleep.\u000a\u000a"Our findings point to REM sleep as a predictor of dementia," study author Matthew P. Pase, of Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, said in a news release. "The next step will be to determine why lower REM sleep predicts a greater risk of dementia. By clarifying the role of sleep in the onset of dementia, the hope is to eventually identify possible ways to intervene so that dementia can be delayed or even prevented."\u000a\u000aSleep and Alzheimer's plaques\u000a\u000aA growing body of research in both mice and humans shows that disturbed sleep leads to higher levels of soluble beta amyloid, the protein that folds and forms the sticky plaques that kill brain cells and bog down information processing.\u000a\u000aDepositing amyloid in brain tissue is the first known preclinical stage of Alzheimer's and happens well before any obvious symptoms of dementia begin.\u000a\u000aA few studies in cognitively normal people and one in mice have shown a connection between chronic sleep disruption and the development of amyloid plaques. The research in mice was particularly interesting because it showed that mice who slept well reduced their levels of beta amyloid, effectively clearing the toxin from their brains.\u000a\u000astudy in Neurology looked at the relationship between sleep quality and levels of various proteins and inflammatory markers in the cerebrospinal fluid of 101 cognitively healthy adults with an average age of 63.\u000a\u000aAll participants had known risk factors for Alzheimer's, such as family history or evidence of the APOE gene , which is associated with a greater chance of developing the disease. Their sleep quality was rated on a standard scale that measured amount, quality and trouble sleeping, along with daytime drowsiness and naps.\u000a\u000a"Participants in our study were willing to undergo a lumbar puncture to move research on Alzheimer's disease forward," said co-author Barbara Bendlin of the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. "Analyzing this fluid allowed us to look at markers related to Alzheimer's disease such as plaques and tangles, as well as markers of inflammation and nerve cell damage."\u000a\u000aTangles and cell damage\u000a\u000aTangles are created by damaged tau, a protein responsible for cell stability and structure. Recent research points to tau-tangle accumulation as a possible step beyond amyloid plaques in the development of actual signs of Alzheimer's disease.\u000a\u000aBy comparing the spinal fluid against self-reported sleep problems, Bendlin and her colleagues found that the subjects who had sleep issues were more likely to show evidence of tau pathology, brain cell damage and inflammation, even when other factors like depression, body mass, cardiovascular disease and sleep medications were taken into account.\u000a\u000a"Our findings align with the idea that worse sleep may contribute to the accumulation of Alzheimer's-related proteins in the brain," Bendlin said. "The fact that we can find these effects in people who are cognitively healthy and close to middle age suggest that these relationships appear early, perhaps providing a window of opportunity for intervention."\u000a\u000aThat's important, Bendlin added, because delaying the onset of Alzheimer's in those at risk by a mere five years "could reduce the number of cases we see in the next 30 years by 5.7 million and save $367 billion in health care spending."\u000a\u000a"Another new finding in this study is that daytime sleepiness, and not just disrupted nighttime sleep, is associated with early changes of Alzheimer's disease," said Dr. Yo-El Ju, an assistant professor of neurology at Washington University's Sleep Medicine Center.\u000a\u000aJu co-wrote an accompanying editorial for the study and just published research of her own in the journal Brain in which she found that healthy middle-age adults who slept badly for just one night produced an abundance of beta amyloid. A week of disrupted sleep increased the amount of tau, another protein responsible for the tangles associated with Alzheimer's, frontal lobe dementia and Lewy body disease.\u000a\u000a"Overall, these studies confirms the relationship between early Alzheimer's disease and sleep disturbance," Ju said, "and expand -- in terms of both time and symptoms -- the window in which sleep-wake problems can be assessed for and treated, with the hope of reducing the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease."\u000a\u000aOne of the limitations of Bendlin's study was that the sleep problems were self-reported. Bendlin and her colleagues are recruiting people at risk for Alzheimer's to be studied in a sleep lab, where objective measurements can be taken.\u000a\u000a"If it turns out to be the case that an intervention which improves sleep also results in less amyloid being deposited in the brain, that would provide strong support for implementing interventions before people start to show cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease," she said.\u000a\u000aDr. Rudolph Tanzi, who directs the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed.\u000a\u000a"Increasing amounts of evidence indicate that getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep is essential for brain health and function," Tanzi said. "In the deepest stage of sleep, the brain cleans itself out of plaque and other toxic materials that trigger Alzheimer's disease. This reduces brain inflammation and is entirely consistent with this exciting new study."\u000a\u000aWhich problem came first?\u000a\u000aNot everyone with sleep problems in Bendlin's study had abnormalities in their spinal fluid. For example, those with obstructive sleep apnea showed no association. With over 18 millions Americans diagnosed with the condition, obstructive sleep apnea is one of the most common sleep disorders. It's characterized by loud snoring and waking by gasping or choking, which occurs when throat muscles relax and constrict the airway during sleep.\u000a\u000aBut research presented in July at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in London found a connection between obstructive sleep apnea and buildup of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain.\u000a\u000aResearchers looked at 1,639 adults in their mid-70s who either were normal cognitively or had mild cognitive decline. The research found an association between obstructive sleep apnea and an accelerated increase of amyloid and tau deposits in both normal and cognitively impaired adults.\u000a\u000aBendlin stresses that much remains to be discovered about the link between sleep and dementia.\u000a\u000a"Not everyone who experiences sleep problems should now worry about developing dementia due to Alzheimer's disease," she said, adding that therecnn & is not yet a clear cause and effect relationship.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Animal studies suggest sleep affects development of brain changes, but brain changes in turn also affect sleep," Bendlin said. "In terms of figuring out which comes first, brain changes or sleep problems, that will be difficult to tease apart, because the effects really do appear to be going in both directions."\u000a\u000a"In experimental studies, there does seems to be evidence of both chicken and egg," said neuroscientist Jeffrey Iliff of Oregon Health and Sciences University. "You can drive it either direction. So there may be a bio-directional interaction."\u000a\u000aThat's good news if true, he said, because it means we have may have some control over whether we develop dementia.\u000a\u000a"No, the public can't remove amyloid plaque," Iliff said. "But if sleep disruption is promoting this process, then improving sleep is half of the solution to slowing the process of dementia as it develops over one's life."\u000a\u000aKeith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed: "There may be an opportunity to improve cognition and possibly reduce dementia risk through early diagnosis and effective treatment of sleep disorders."

aV(CNN) Notorious "Pharma Bro" Martin Shkreli is testing the credo that Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothing to ... mess with.\u000a\u000aThe business executive and former hedge fund manager took to eBay on Tuesday to sell the legendary rap collective's sole copy of "Once Upon a Time in Shaolin."\u000a\u000aBidding for the two-disc album, which will end September 15, started at $1. By Thursday morning it had topped $1 million\u000a\u000aWhy would Shkreli, 34, give up this piece of hip-hop history? A piece for which he paid $2 million at auction\u000a\u000aHe says it's about respect, which he failed to receive from the Wu or the world.\u000a\u000a"I decided to purchase this album as a gift to the Wu-Tang Clan for their tremendous musical output. Instead I received scorn from at least one of their (least-intelligent) members, and the world at large failed to see my purpose of putting a serious value behind music," he said Tuesday on eBay.\u000a\u000aThat's no doubt a reference to Wu-Tang's Ghostface Killah, who engaged in a public and often hilarious war of words with Shkreli over his business reputation.\u000a\u000aShkreli was pilloried in 2015 for raising the price on a drug used by AIDS and cancer patients from $13.50 to $750 per pill after his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the drug's rights. More recently, Shkreli was convicted last month of securities fraud and conspiracy. He awaits sentencing.\u000a\u000aAn hour after his verdict he posted a livestream on YouTube in which he predicted receiving a sentence of "close to nil" or serving a stint in Club Fed, where he will "play basketball and tennis and Xbox" for a couple of months.\u000a\u000aThe feud between Ghostface Killah and Shkreli began with name-calling and memes but soon escalated. Referencing the price-gouging scandal, the rapper called Shkreli "a real killer, but you're a soft killer," and introduced his "goons" -- his sister and mother -- to give Shekreli a sharp dressing down.\u000a\u000aShkreli responded by calling Ghostface "son" and saying he'd smack him. He also threatened to erase the rhymesmith's verses from the "Shaolin" album.\u000a\u000aThe cachet of 'Shaolin'\u000a\u000aMartin Shkreli is selling his one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album "Once Upon a Time in Shaolin."\u000a\u000aThe sole copy of the 31-track album would come in a hand-carved box with a 174-page leather-bound book of parchment paper containing lyrics and a backstory. It would be sold to the highest bidder.\u000a\u000aRZA had initially wanted to forbid the buyer from publicly releasing the album for 88 years but eventually loosened the terms to ensure that it was never sold commercially.\u000a\u000a"Shaolin" drew interest from "private collectors, trophy hunters, millionaires, billionaires, unknown folks, publicly known folks, businesses, companies with commercial intent, young, old," RZA boasted.\u000a\u000aAn ill-fated Kickstarter campaign set up by Wu-Tang fans could only scrape together $15,406 of its $5 million goal.\u000a\u000aIt was 21 months before Bloomberg Businessweek announced the auction's $2 million winner. The news came beneath a graphic calling Shkreli "young dirty bastard," a reference to deceased Wu-Tang member Ol' Dirty Bastard.\u000a\u000aShkreli, already in the running for most-hated man in America, immediately faced a new onslaught of derision. Even RZA seemed to distance himself from the young mogul.\u000a\u000a"The sale of 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin' was agreed upon in May, well before Martin Skhreli's business practices came to light. We decided to give a significant portion of the proceeds to charity," RZA wrote in an email to Bloomberg Businessweek\u000a\u000aUnfazed, Shkreli tweeted, "If there is a curious gap in your favorite artist's discography, well, now you know why."

aV(CNN) A 9-year-old boy who was enjoying a hot dog took an overly big bite -- and went into cardiac arrest. But choking wasn't the cause, according to a case study published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics.\u000a\u000aThe terrifying incident had a much more unlikely cause, according to Dr. Isa Ozyilmaz of Mehmet Akif Ersoy Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul.\u000a\u000aThe chunk of frankfurter stimulated the boy's vagus nerve, and this triggered an abnormal heart rhythm that in turn caused his heart to abruptly stop beating, Ozyilmaz and his co-authors speculated in the case study. The nerve, which extends from the head to the abdomen, helps the heart and gastrointestinal system function.\u000a\u000aDespite immediate panic, the story has a happy ending: After defibrillation, the child was resuscitated.\u000a\u000aOddly, the boy's family history appeared to be a clean slate with regard to special cardiac diseases. However, doctors discovered a suspicious finding on his electrocardiograph (known as an ECG or EKG) during a followup examination.\u000a\u000aWith a possible diagnosis in mind, doctors at the Istanbul hospital conducted an ajmaline challenge test, which involves injecting the child with an antiarrhythmic drug and then observing how his heart responds. The pattern appearing on the EKG verified the diagnosis, and their verdict was swift: The boy had Brugada syndrome.\u000a\u000aWhat is Brugada syndrome?\u000a\u000a"Brugada syndrome is an inherited (heart) rhythm problem," said Dr. Anne Dubin, a professor of pediatric cardiology at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, who was not involved in the boy's case.\u000a\u000aThe syndrome takes its name from Dr. Pedro Brugada of QLV Hospital in Aalst, Belgium, and his brother Dr. Josep Brugada of the Hospital Clinic at University of Barcelona in Spain, who first described it in a study published in 1992 . (A third brother, Dr. Ramon Brugada of Montreal Heart Institute and University of Montreal helped unravel the genetic basis.)\u000a\u000aThe total number of cases is difficult to measure, because some people may be asymptomatic or have never been tested thoroughly. Based purely on EKG findings, about four in 1,000 Americans have been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome , according to Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease.\u000a\u000aThe essence of the problem is not mechanical, but electrical. Thinking of the heart as an electric pump, the problem "can lead to abnormal heart rhythms in the lower chambers of the heart that can be associated with sudden death," Dubin said.\u000a\u000a"What allows the electrical signal to move through your heart are a series of channels within the heart cells themselves," she said. "Different salt ions, like sodium or potassium or calcium, move through those channels and change the electrical current within the cell, and that's what moves the electrical signal through the heart."\u000a\u000aOne known cause of the syndrome is a deficiency of sodium, which has an impact on the electrical current moving through these channels. When patients with Brugada syndrome eat large bites of food -- which is known to stimulate the vagus nerve -- changes in EKG patterns also occur, and this may lead to sudden cardiac arrest, according to Ozyilmaz and his co-authors.\u000a\u000aThe condition is found in more men than women, according to the Stanford center. It is also more commonly found among people of Asian descent, although anyone can be affected.\u000a\u000aBecause Brugada syndrome runs in families, the 9-year-old's doctors immediately tested his family and discovered that his brother also has the condition.\u000a\u000aGenetic test results for both parents are pending, according to the study, but Dubin said that "odds are good that one of the parents has this. Sometimes, you don't really see it until you do the challenge test."\u000a\u000aAnother way to diagnose the syndrome is through genetic testing, but only about 30% to 40% of the genes that cause it are known, Dubin said. People with symptoms don't require such tests; instead, doctors use the results of DNA testing to figure out which family members may have the syndrome even if they show no signs of illness.\u000a\u000aA very rare condition\u000a\u000aMany people do not even know they have the condition until later in life.\u000a\u000aThe majority of people who develop symptoms of Brugada syndrome are already "in their 20s up to 50s or 60s," Dubin said.\u000a\u000aWhen the condition is discovered in parents, doctors will screen the children, even those without symptoms, and may discover it then. "And then you have to decide what to do with them," said Dubin.\u000a\u000a"As far as symptomatic Brugada syndrome, I have been practicing pediatric electrophysiology for 23 years now, and I have probably seen two to three cases of it," she said.\u000a\u000aThe story of the boy with the hot dog, then, is extremely rare.\u000a\u000aAfter the incident, the boy's doctors implanted a defibrillator in his chest to prevent sudden cardiac arrest, the case report noted.\u000a\u000a"Defibrillators in kids are associated with higher risks than in adults, for sure," Dubin said. "But sometimes we need to do it." She added that "there isn't a whole lot we can do for people, and the primary way we treat them is with a defibrillator."\u000a\u000a"People shouldn't panic about Brugada syndrome," she said. "If you have a family history of people dying suddenly with no known reason or if you have someone in your family who has been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome as an adult, children need to be evaluated for it, and we need to know about it." But there's no need to routinely screen children, she said.\u000a\u000aStill, when children of people with the illness are screened and found to have the condition, "even if there is no golden bullet" for treatment, the information is still vital for parents. Commonly they will be advised "to be very careful about fever prevention, and there are certain drugs they should stay away from" when treating their children for other illnesses.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aInformation from the case report will not apply to most children, said Dr. Elizabeth Saarel, chair of pediatric cardiology at Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital and a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. Still, the syndrome is "rare but life-threatening," so parents need to be aware, she suggested.\u000a\u000a"Kids choke on hot dogs and food all the time and sometimes go into cardiac arrest," said Saarel, who was not involved in the new case report. "Pediatricians assume this is always an airway issue. This case report indicates that children who choke on food and go into cardiac arrest also need to be screened for Brugada syndrome."\u000a\u000aCorrection: A previous version of this story gave an incorrect title for Dr. Anne Dubin.

aVFlorida continues to grapple with a serious gasoline shortage as millions of motorists flee Hurricane Irma's path of destruction.\u000a\u000aAt least 40% of all gas stations in major Florida markets Miami-Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach were without fuel on Friday morning, according to estimates from crowdsourcing platform GasBuddy. At least one-third of the gas stations in Fort Myers-Naples and Tampa-St. Petersburg were also without gas.\u000a\u000aThe situation is even worse a few hours to the north in Gainesville, a central Florida city that is experiencing an outage in 58% of its gas stations, GasBuddy reported\u000a\u000aThe fuel outages come as Florida officials order mandatory evacuations for many counties in South Florida ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Irma on Sunday. The storm, which is expected to remain at Category 4 strength, is extremely dangerous, packing 150 mile-per-hour winds and enormous amounts rainfall.\u000a\u000a"All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon," Florida Governor Rick Scott said on Friday.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, that task is being complicated by the fuel shortages. One-third of the gas stations in the Orlando-Daytona Beach-Melbourne region are empty.\u000a\u000aEven Tallahassee, the state capitol that is around 500 miles away from Miami, is experiencing outages in at least 21% of its gas stations, according to GasBuddy.\u000a\u000a"You just have such incredible demand for gas right now as people pack up and leave," said James Miller, director of communications for the Florida Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association.\u000a\u000aRelated: 'Panic buying' sparks gas shortages in Florida\u000a\u000aThe gas shortages were exacerbated by "panic-buying" earlier this week from Florida residents worried about Hurricane Irma's uncertain path.\u000a\u000aThe other problem: Last week, Hurricane Harvey rocked the Gulf Coast's refinery system, causing major outages that disrupted fuel deliveries to Florida and other markets.\u000a\u000aNow, there are signs that massive demand for gas caused by Hurricane Irma is spreading to Florida's neighbors to the north.\u000a\u000aIn Georgia, at least 10% of the gas stations in Savannah and Augusta were without fuel, GasBuddy reported. Another 19% of the gas stations in Charleston, South Carolina were empty. There are also some sporadic outages in North Carolina.\u000a\u000aThe good news for Florida evacuees is that the state's ports are open and prioritizing fuel deliveries, for now at least. That's critical because virtually all of the Sunshine State's gas is delivered by waterways and Florida operates with minimal fuel supplies on-hand.\u000a\u000aGovernor Scott has also taken several steps to try to speed up gas deliveries and encourage gas stations to remain open as long as possible. He's gone so far as to offer police escorts for fuel delivery trucks shipping gas to stations along evacuation routes.\u000a\u000a"That's been a huge help and will continue to be," said Miller.\u000a\u000aRelated: Florida air travel starts to shut down\u000a\u000aScott also offered police escorts for gas station employees to ensure they're able to get out safely before the storm hits.\u000a\u000aFlorida residents who do manage to find gas should expect to pay more.\u000a\u000aMostly due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey, the average gallon of gas in Florida sold for $2.73 on Friday, according to AAA. That's up from $2.28 a month ago.

aV(CNN) Researchers have turned the spotlight on a new class of drugs that they say could "transform" the field of medicine -- and the drugs work by targeting aging.\u000a\u000aThe researchers, from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, are calling for senolytic drugs to make the leap from animal research to human clinical trials. They outlined potential clinical trial scenarios in a paper published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society on Monday.\u000a\u000a"This is one of the most exciting fields in all of medicine or science at the moment," said Dr. James Kirkland, director of the Kogod Center on Aging at the Mayo Clinic and lead author of the new paper.\u000a\u000aAs we age, we accumulate senescent cells, which are damaged cells that resist dying off but stay in our bodies. They can affect other cells in our various organs and tissues. Senolytic drugs are agents capable of killing problem-causing senescent cells in your body without harming your normal, healthy cells.\u000a\u000aSenescent cells play a role in many age-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, most cancers, dementia, arthritis, osteoporosis and blindness, Kirkland said. Therefore, senolytic drugs are a possible treatment approach for such diseases.\u000a\u000aAs a practicing physician, Kirkland said that he has grown increasingly concerned for his patients who are sick with many of these age-related conditions.\u000a\u000a"The same processes that cause aging seem to be the root causes of age-related diseases," he said. "Why not target the root cause of all of these things? That would have been a pipe dream until a few years back."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Study: Young mice blood reverses aging Replay More Videos ...

In a study published in the journal Aging Cell , they described how senolytic drugs can alleviate symptoms of frailty in mice and extend the length of time the mice are healthy as they grow old.\u000a\u000aThen, last year, the researchers demonstrated in a study in Aging Cell that clearing senescent cells in mice can improve their vascular health\u000a\u000aFourteen senolytic drugs have been discovered and are being actively studied, 11 of which Kirkland's colleagues and their collaborators found, he said.\u000a\u000aAre these age-modifying drugs ready for human trials?\u000a\u000aScientists have long known that certain processes influence your body's aging on the cellular level, according to the paper. Those processes include inflammation, changes in your DNA, cell damage or dysfunction and the accumulation of senescent cells.\u000a\u000aIt turns out that those processes are linked. For instance, DNA damage causes increased senescent cell accumulation, Kirkland said.\u000a\u000aPhotos: People who made it to 100 and beyond Photos: People who made it to 100 and beyond Fauja Singh is recognized as the first 100-year-old to ever run a marathon.

That is, once such an intervention is tested for efficacy and safety.\u000a\u000a"I think senolytic drugs have a great future. If it is proven that it can reduce senescent cells and rejuvenate tissues or organs, it may be one of our potential best treatments for age-related diseases," said Dr. Kang Zhang, founding director of the Institute for Genomic Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the new paper.\u000a\u000aYet taking senolytic drugs from mouse studies to human ones is a "big leap," Zhang said.\u000a\u000a"So we will have to wait for clinical trials to see whether this would work in humans," he said. "One possible clinical trial strategy is to test this class of drugs in an age-related disease, such as neurodegeneration, like Parkinson's disease, to see if it can reduce clinical severity of the disease and improve tissue functions."\u000a\u000aIn the new paper, the researchers wrote that potential clinical trial scenarios include testing whether senolytic drugs could alleviate multiple chronic diseases in a single patient or whether such drugs could treat conditions that involve senescent cell accumulation in one location in the body, such as osteoarthritis.\u000a\u000aThey also suggest testing whether the drugs could treat diseases for which there are no medicines proven to slow the progression of that disease, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , a cell senescence-associated disease that affects the lungs.\u000a\u000aOther potential clinical trial scenarios include testing whether the drugs could alleviate frailty in older adults or could treat conditions associated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, since radiation can produce cellular senescence, Kirkland said.\u000a\u000aFor instance, "in mice, if you treat one leg with enough radiation, after three months, the mouse has trouble walking. If you give a single dose of these drugs, they're able to walk quite well, and that persists for two years," he said. "These drugs could mitigate the effects of therapeutic radiation."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Could aging cells help fight cancer? Replay More Videos ...

Some have already expressed interest.\u000a\u000aOne company, Unity Biotechnology , aims to be the first to demonstrate that removing senescent cells can cure human diseases, said its president, Nathaniel David.\u000a\u000a"In the coming decades, I believe that health care will be transformed by this class of medicine and a whole set of diseases that your parents and grandparents have will be things you only see in movies or read in books, things like age-associated arthritis," said David, whose company was not involved in the new paper.\u000a\u000aYet he cautioned that, while many more studies may be on the horizon for senolytic drugs, some might not be successful.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"One thing that people tend to do is, they tend to overestimate things in the short run but then underestimate things in the long run, and I think that, like many fields, this suffers from that as well," David said.\u000a\u000a"It will take a while," he said.

aV(CNN) For the 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, the Hajj is a spiritual pinnacle. Each year, up to three million pilgrims descend on the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca -- the epicenter of the Muslim world -- to seek redemption, to forgive and to be forgiven.\u000a\u000aWrapped in white cloth, worshippers embark on the five-day pilgrimage, considered one of the five pillars of Islam. All Muslims who are physically and financially able are required to make the journey to Mecca at least once in their lifetime.\u000a\u000aEntering Mecca\u000a\u000aMany Muslim pilgrims, known as hajjis, converge on the city weeks before the start of the Hajj rituals.\u000a\u000aWorshippers wear special white garments -- men wrap themselves in seamless, stitchless cloth, while women wear a simple white dress and headscarf. The clothing is said to symbolize human equality and unity before God.\u000a\u000aPilgrims begin the Hajj with a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure that Muslims believe the Prophet Abraham from the Old Testament constructed. It's the most sacred shrine of Islam.\u000a\u000aThe Prophet Muhammed made the first Islamic pilgrimage in the year 628 AD, when he set out to Mecca with 1,400 of his followers. Though Mecca is considered to be a city for all Muslims, non-Muslims are denied entry at all times.\u000a\u000aSaudi authorities manage the entry and exit of pilgrims through strict visa applications and have a dedicated Hajj ministry, employing 40,000 workers. In the last ten years, 24 million Hajj pilgrims have visited the city. Thousands of civil servants are deployed to the pilgrimage each year.\u000a\u000aA global tent city\u000a\u000aTo go through the six steps of the Hajj, pilgrims walk in massive processions, shoulder-to-shoulder with Muslims from more than 80 different countries. Together they share meals, prayers and very close living quarters.\u000a\u000a"Groups of West Africans in colorful garb, almost singing verses from the Quran. Old Chinese couples, groups of blonde Europeans and Americans; it felt as if we were watching the entire world walk past," wrote CNN's Schams Elwazer who covered the pilgrimage for CNN in 2005, 2006 and 2007.\u000a\u000aSermon on the summit\u000a\u000aFor the third major Hajj ritual, Muslims gather at Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Muhammed is believed to have delivered his last sermon.\u000a\u000aUpwards of a million pilgrims sit on the mountain, blanketing the site in white, while umbrellas used to shield the worshippers from the sun provide flashes of color.\u000a\u000aThis is the climax of the pilgrimage where Muslims perform day-long prayers, incantations and recitations from the Quran. It is not uncommon to see worshippers shed tears as they reach this peak of spiritual cleansing.\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia's top clerics traditionally lead a Hajj sermon on this site.\u000a\u000aComing together\u000a\u000aMecca is the only Islamic holy site where men and women all pray together and perform all the Hajj rites together. In most mosques, women and men are assigned separate areas for worship, and when one room is available, women are expected to pray behind the men.\u000a\u000aAuthorities only segregate men and women at the Hajj in terms of sleeping arrangements.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Brookings Institute's study on Hajj pilgrims, hajjis report more positive views of women's abilities and a greater concern for their quality of life after performing the pilgrimage. They are also more likely to favor educating girls and encourage female labor participation.\u000a\u000aDress codes for women are strict and even a wisp of hair escaping from the required headscarf can prompt frowns, or worse, from the crowds.\u000a\u000aStoning the devil\u000a\u000aDuring the "stoning of the devil," pilgrims lob rocks at three pillars, known as the "Jamarat," symbolizing the rejection of the devil's temptation.\u000a\u000aThe ritual marks the beginning of the four-day Eid al-Adha holiday, known to Muslims as the "big Eid."\u000a\u000aMuslims celebrate the Adha -- the Arabic word for "sacrifice" -- by slaughtering sheep and distributing the meat to the poor.\u000a\u000aThis is also the most dangerous part of the pilgrimage. People stream back and forth between the pillars and the Kaaba, posing a major crowd control challenge for organizers. Many have been wounded or killed by stones thrown from further back within the crowd.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, over 700 people were killed and nearly 900 were injured in a stampede while performing this ritual.\u000a\u000aSince then, Saudi authorities have spent millions of dollars renovating the area, making it multi-layered instead of a flat plain, and renovating the pillars.\u000a\u000aBecoming a Hajji\u000a\u000aAfter five days, the Hajj comes full circle and worshippers return to The Grand Mosque for their final prayers.\u000a\u000aFor pilgrims and Saudi civil servants alike, the end of Hajj is the time to return to family and celebrate the remainder of Eid al-Adha.\u000a\u000aAt home, the pilgrims are greeted with fanfare. Congratulations from neighbors pour in and their homes are usually decked out in festive lighting.\u000a\u000aThe hajji now has a somewhat elevated social status. A person who has completed the pilgrimage can add the phrase al-Hajj or hajji (pilgrim) to their name.

aVAly Vance is a former member of the British modern pentathlon team and host of CNN's Winning Post. You can see more of Aly's training on August's show, which airs (GMT): Aug 19: 1730, Aug 20: 1230, 2230; Aug 24: 1030, 1730; Aug 26: 0730, 2230; Aug 27: 1730.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Coming from an equestrian background I have ridden all my life but never racehorses.\u000a\u000aThis month, that changed. I experienced a race day from an entirely different perspective -- on board a galloping horse as I took part in the Magnolia Cup at the Qatar Goodwood Festival.\u000a\u000aThe Magnolia Cup is a charity race between 12 women across sport, business and media and it offers a glimpse into life in the saddle.\u000a\u000aTraining\u000a\u000aI stepped up my preparations after been given a serious reality check at the British Racing School in Newmarket five weeks prior to race day.\u000a\u000aI was there to be assessed for the race, to make sure I was fit enough for it to be safe for me to compete.\u000a\u000aSport has always been a huge part of my life and, since retiring from the British Modern Pentathlon team, I still try to find the time to train every day.\u000a\u000aHowever, "running fitness" is very different to a jockey's fitness!\u000a\u000aWe went through various strength and endurance tests designed specifically for race riding. We're talking weighted wall squats, a wobble board squat, static push-ups and planking!\u000a\u000aFitness gurus will understand that last sentence and anyone who wants to test themselves can find the exercises through this link: www.brs.org.uk/courses-and-training/fitness-test\u000a\u000aI managed to scrape a pass. I realized that perhaps I wouldn't have a fitness advantage over my competitors and there was serious work to be done!\u000a\u000aAbsolutely no idea!! #jockeytraining #plastichorse #gameface #tiredlegs \U0001f3c7\U0001f3c7\U0001f3c7 I am taking part in the Magnolia Cup at Glorious Goodwood this year and have about a month to learn how to ride a racehorse! I know this is a fake one but I've got to start somewhere! #cnnwinningpost #horseracing A post shared by Aly Vance (@alyvance) on Jul 3, 2017 at 10:31am PDT\u000a\u000aThe Horse\u000a\u000aNext, I needed to find a horse. With my competitive juices flowing, I was keen to find a trainer who could provide me with one fast enough to win!\u000a\u000aSo, at 4:30 in the morning, I arrived at the yard of ex-jumps jockey and now winning trainer Jamie Osborne.\u000a\u000aI quickly realised my riding experience counted for little. On day one I found myself totally out of control -- not once, but twice -- on horses that were meant to be "safe and sensible."\u000a\u000aOut of control meant zero brakes on a horse travelling at 30mph -- not a situation I was very comfortable with.\u000a\u000aIt was a frustrating day, although I realized I was adopting the completely wrong position on the horse.\u000a\u000aMy position was telling them to go faster, when all I wanted to do was slow them down.\u000a\u000aAfter some time on the yard's static wooden horse, I had a better idea of how to control a racehorse.\u000a\u000aSurvived my last morning riding out at Jamie Osborne's yard. \U0001f3c7\U0001f4a8 No more training to be done ahead of Thursday's Magnolia Cup at #goodwood! \U0001f3c6\U0001f633\U0001f40e #notready #toolate #horseracing #cnnwinningpost #cnnsport #goodwood #qgf #gloriousgoodwood A post shared by Aly Vance (@alyvance) on Aug 1, 2017 at 1:25am PDT\u000a\u000aAnd so began a month of heading down to Osborne's yard as much as possible while working on my fitness in the gym.\u000a\u000aMy CNN work schedule at this time of year is pretty manic, with not just the European racing season to cover, but also show jumping. So my training on a horse was limited but I worked hard to build legs of steel in the gym.\u000a\u000aRace day\u000a\u000aExcept that I felt completely underprepared.\u000a\u000aRacehorses rarely train at top speed so I didn't have the opportunity to learn what 45mph felt like.\u000a\u000aI also hadn't ridden the horse I was due to ride for the race. He was called Outer Space.\u000a\u000aOsborne said I wouldn't have been able to stop him during my training on the gallops. But I wasn't to worry, as I "didn't need to have any brakes during the race."\u000a\u000aI just had to hope he would stop before we got to the imposing wall beyond the finish line at the end of the track at Goodwood.\u000a\u000aI was pretty nervous when I was in the parade ring for the first time before the race. There was a huge crowd at the racecourse and I had images of being thrown off before I had even got to the start.\u000a\u000aBeing back in the saddle was strangely comforting though. It felt like familiar territory and, when I got to the start, I was focused on riding the best race I could.\u000a\u000aWe had a reasonable start and I was tucked in nicely behind two horses up until the halfway point.\u000a\u000aWith 400m to race I pulled out to pass them and Outer Space gave me that incredible rush of speed. No other breed of horse can lower, stretch and gallop like a racehorse and it's some feeling, believe me!\u000a\u000aWe tried to catch the winner but alas the line came too soon. Probably not a bad thing as I was certainly exhausted and given how easily Outer Space pulled up, I think he was running on empty as well.\u000a\u000aWhat a great experience! I loved riding in the #MagnoliaCup @goodwood_races yesterday. \U0001f3c7\U0001f3c7\U0001f3c7Very different riding to what I've ever done before so I was happy to come home in 2nd. Thank you to everyone who helped me get ready for the race. Mostly the guys & girls back at Jamie Osborne's yard & the poor horses who's had to put up with me on the gallops! #goodwood #gloriousgoodwood #magnoliacup #swarovski #jockeytraining #inthesaddle #cnnwinningpost A post shared by Aly Vance (@alyvance) on Aug 4, 2017 at 2:22am PDT\u000a\u000aReal Heroes\u000a\u000aAfter my small insight into a jockey's life, I'm sure you'd expect me be in awe of them and their profession.\u000a\u000aYes, they have to be incredibly strong, fit and brave. But they get to enjoy the buzz of race day. Riding down the track at full speed in front of a full grandstand was a real thrill. That would make up for all the traveling, early mornings and light weights that they have to endure.\u000a\u000aFor me, the real heroes are the work riders who risk life and limb to exercise and keep the racehorses fit every day. They don't get the glory that the jockeys enjoy.\u000a\u000aAfter getting up early in the morning, they ride six to eight horses a day. Not your sensible gentle old hacks but racehorses that are unpredictable young thoroughbreds, bred for speed and fed high-energy rocket fuel.\u000a\u000aIt's not easy, it's certainly not safe and I admire their bravery. I enjoyed the month that I was part of their team. It really was a once-in-a-lifetime experience but now I'll leave it to the professionals!

aV(CNN) Two white men have been convicted of attempted murder after they forced a black South African farmworker into a coffin, which they then threatened to set alight.\u000a\u000aA video of the incident went viral last year under the hashtag #coffinassault, igniting a discussion about racism in South Africa, and led to victim Victor Mlotshwa coming forward to police.\u000a\u000aThe two accused, Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson, had argued that they only intended to scare Mlotshwa, claiming he had threatened their families and committed theft.\u000a\u000aBut Judge Segopotje Sheila Mphahlele found both men guilty on counts of kidnapping, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, intimidation and attempted murder. Jackson was also convicted of one count of obstructing the administration of justice for later burning the coffin used in the incident.\u000a\u000aThe two men were also found guilty of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm against a second complainant, Delton Sithole.\u000a\u000aOosthuizen was cleared of one count of unlawful possession of a firearm.\u000a\u000aVictor Mlotshwa sits in court during the appearance of his alleged assaulters on August 21, 2017 in Middelburg, South Africa.\u000a\u000aThe judge set a date of October 23 for sentencing. She extended bail for Oosthuizen and Jackson, who are both married with young children, after dismissing the state prosecutor's concerns that their safety could be at risk and that they might not return to court.\u000a\u000aMphahlele added that the community should be happy with the verdicts.\u000a\u000aBefore announcing her decision, in a sitting of the high court at Middelburg Magistrates' Court, Mphahlele recounted testimony given by several witnesses and the accused.\u000a\u000aMphahlele said Mlotshwa had testified that he was hitchhiking on a road when he was pursued by the men and forced to get into one of their vehicles. When he refused to cooperate, he was assaulted, Mlotshwa said.\u000a\u000aThe men drove him to a secluded spot where they ordered him to climb into a coffin in a deep ditch. He was warned that if he tried to run away, they would shoot him.\u000a\u000aMlotshwa said he was beaten when he tried to resist climbing into the coffin, so eventually cooperated. He then heard one of the accused say they must pour petrol into the coffin. At that stage he was in severe pain, shivering and pleading with accused to spare his life.\u000a\u000aHe thought they were going to kill him, he said. He became very scared when he noticed the men had petrol. "At one stage, Mlotshwa was even asked if he wanted to die fast or slowly," said the judge.\u000a\u000aHe eventually realized that no-one was forcing him back into the coffin, scrambled out and ran away as fast as he could. He said he suffered injuries to his face, shoulder, back, arm and leg but did not seek medical attention. He has a visible scar on his left leg as a result of his injuries, the court heard.\u000a\u000aDefendants denied wrongdoing\u000a\u000aRecounting the defendants' testimony, the judge said Oosthuizen claimed that after they stopped him, Mlotshwa had been arrogant and was threatening to damage their crops and kill their wives and children. He had been carrying a black bag, which Jackson said contained copper cables.\u000a\u000aOosthuizen testified that they never intended to kill Mlotshwa, and only wanted to scare him off and "deter him from carrying out his earlier threats," the judge recounted.\u000a\u000aOosthuizen claimed they told Mlotshwa to get out of the coffin at the end of the incident and that Mlotshwa was able to walk free.\u000a\u000aJackson's testimony, as recounted by the judge, supported that of Oosthuizen.\u000a\u000aThey took videos and a photo so that Mlotshwa could not later accuse them of assaulting him and to show that he admitted stealing the cable, Jackson said. The whole incident took 10 to 15 minutes and Mlotshwa was in the coffin no longer than 5 minutes, he said.\u000a\u000aIn October, his employer instructed him to get rid of the coffin because they would get in trouble for it, so he burned it, Jackson said.\u000a\u000aNeither defendant considered their actions to be wrong. Jackson said his wife had ordered him to delete the video from his cellphone because she didn't want their children to see it.

aVNew Delhi (CNN) A prominent Indian journalist and activist has been shot dead in the southern state of Karnataka.\u000a\u000aThe body of Gauri Lankesh, 55, was found lying in a pool of blood on the porch at her home in Bangalore on Tuesday night.\u000a\u000aA staunch critic of Hindu nationalist politics, last year Lankesh was convicted of defamation and sentenced to six months in prison for a story on a local leader of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\u000a\u000aAt the time of her death, Lankesh was on bail appealing the verdict.\u000a\u000aBangalore Police Commissioner T. Suneel Kumar told reporters that four empty cartridges had been recovered from the scene of the crime.\u000a\u000aLankesh had been shot from close range with three bullets hitting her on the neck and chest.\u000a\u000aSenior police officials visit the house of 55-year-old Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead by unknown assailants in the porch of her home in Bangalore on September 5, 2017.\u000a\u000a'A progressive force'\u000a\u000aLankesh's death has sparked widespread condemnation across India.\u000a\u000a"Gauri Lankesh was never afraid of speaking truth to power. Her assassination must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice," said Asmita Basu, Programs Director at Amnesty International India.\u000a\u000a"The police must investigate whether she was killed because of her journalism."\u000a\u000aShashi Tharoor, a senior member of India's main opposition Congress Party, echoed these sentiments, tweeting , "Saddened by the murder of #GauriLankesh. India wasn't supposed to be a country where journalists are silenced by bullets. Her voice rings on."\u000a\u000aOn a statement posted to his social media account , Karnataka's Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, vowed a "prompt and thorough investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice."\u000a\u000a"Shocked to learn about murder of tall progressive force and senior journalist Gauri Lankesh. Such cold-blooded acts deserve highest condemnation," added Siddaramaiah.\u000a\u000aA disturbing trend\u000a\u000aLankesh was the editor of the newspaper Lankesh Patrike, founded by her father, a journalist and activist himself.\u000a\u000aShe went on to set up her own weekly magazine, the Gauri Lankesh Patrike.\u000a\u000aHer killing bears similarities to the death of scholar MM Kalburgi, 77, who was shot dead outside his home in Dharwad, Karnataka in November 2015.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been no convictions in any of the 27 cases of journalists murdered for their work in India since 1992.\u000a\u000aOne of Lankesh's last tweets before her death read, "Why do I feel that some of 'us' are fighting between ourselves? We all know our 'biggest enemy'. Can we all please concentrate on that?"\u000a\u000awhy do i feel that some of `us' are fighting between ourselves? we all know our ``biggest enemy''. can we all please concentrate on that? \u2014 Gauri Lankesh (@gaurilankesh) September 4, 2017\u000a\u000aHer killing like others before her "raises alarms about the state of freedom of expression in the country," according to a statement issued by Amnesty International India.

aVPhotos: Iconic British design From stunning skyscrapers to flamboyant fashion, perfectly formed household products to streamlined sports cars, British designers have built a reputation for innovation, imagination and style. We take a look at the British designs that have become icons in their own right. Hide Caption 1 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Rolls Royce \u2013 Engineer Henry Royce and car dealer Charles Rolls were the joint force behind the celebrated Rolls-Royce brand at the turn of the 20th century. The 1907 Silver Ghost, pictured, was among the most glamorous models produced by a name that became synonymous with luxury and quality. Hide Caption 2 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Jaguar E-Type \u2013 Aerodynamicist Malcolm Sayer was one of the first to apply the principles of aerodynamics to motor car design, used in Jaguar's elegant 1961 E-Type. Hide Caption 3 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Mini \u2013 Less glamorous than the E-type, but no less important, the Mini was born in 1959, when engineer and designer Sir Alec Issigonis designed a small, accessible car by pushing the wheels out to the corners and placing the engine sideways to make more space for passengers. Hide Caption 4 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Royal Enfield \u2013 Beloved of bikers the world over, the first Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle hit the road in the UK in the 1930s, with the tagline "Made like a gun, goes like a bullet." Made by one of the oldest motorcycle companies in the world, the Bullet has even been used by the Indian armed forces.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 5 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Spitfire \u2013 First used by the Royal Air Force in 1938, the Spitfire, a World War II fighter plane, was used in the Battle of Britain in 1940. More than 20,000 Spitfires were built in 22 different variants, with British aeronautical engineer Reginald Mitchell leading the team behind the first design. Hide Caption 6 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Concorde \u2013 The supersonic passenger jet Concorde was operated by British Airways and manufactured as a collaboration between British Aerospace and French firm Aérospatiale. Despite short flight times -- it could fly from New York to London in just under three hours -- it was not commercially viable, and the fleet of seven aircraft was retired in 2003 after some 50,000 flights since the 1973 maiden journey. But its long, drooping nose and slender wings its appearance as remarkable as its velocity. Hide Caption 7 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Gherkin \u2013 Nestled between more recent additions to the London skyline is Norman Foster's 30 St Mary Axe. Completed in 2003, it's popularly called the Gherkin (a British term for a pickled cucumber), due to its unconventional shape, designed to reduce wind deflection.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 8 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The original Wembley Stadium, with its distinctive Twin Towers, hosted the London 1948 Olympics and England's only football World Cup win, in 1966.

Hide Caption 9 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Penny Black \u2013 Based on Royal Mint engraver William Wyon's portrait of Queen Victoria on the so-called City Medal, the Royal Mail's 1840 Penny Black was the world's first adhesive postage stamp. A small stamp with pitch-black ink etchings, its radical design became the model for making stamps around the world. Hide Caption 10 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Sex Pistols poster \u2013 This provocative image was originally featured on promotional posters for the British punk rock band Sex Pistols' "God Save the Queen" single, released to coincide with the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977. Like the song's lyrics, the poster, design by British artist and anarchist Jamie Reid, was controversial at the time, but has since been reproduced on everything from mugs to jackets and shirts.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 11 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design McQueen's Union Jack frock \u2013 Designed for David Bowie for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, the now iconic "Union Jack" frock with its frilly black-lace cuffs is one of Alexander McQueen's earliest designs. The theme was revisited in his later creations, including scarves and clutch bags carrying the distinct red, white and blue colors of the Union flag.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 12 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Penguin book covers \u2013 Penguin's classic covers originate from the publishing house's first book, "Ariel," by André Maurois, published in 1935. It was designed by Penguin's first production manager, Edward Young. This was also the birth of the distinctive Penguin logo, which Young sketched using the penguins at London Zoo as models.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 13 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design London tube maps \u2013 In 1933 electrical draughtsman Harry Beck straightened out the sprawling squiggly lines of the London tube map, producing a map that was clear, concise and almost beautiful in its sense of order. A radical drawing at the time, the style is still used to help people navigate urban underground networks around the world. Hide Caption 14 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The anglepoise lamp \u2013 From George Carwardine to Paul Smith, an array of British designers have made their mark on the adjustable Anglepoise Lamp. The first version was unveiled by Carwardine in 1932, but the classic model pictured is attributed the company's design director Sir Kenneth Grange.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 15 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The Moulton Bicycle \u2013 Innovator Alex Moulton introduced the small-wheeled but full-sized bicycle with both front and rear suspension systems for enhanced comfort at the 1962 Earls Court Cycle Show. It ws an instant success and the mold-breaking design became the forerunner of the lightweight small-wheeled bikes and foldable frames popular among urban cyclists today.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 16 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Bagless vacuum cleaners \u2013 Frustrated by his vacuum cleaner's poor performance, James Dyson designed the Dual Cyclone in the 1980s. This bagless vacuum design featured what was billed as "cyclonic vacuum technology," which was proudly displayed in the Dual Cyclone's striking transparent body. Hide Caption 17 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Burberry trench coat \u2013 The early trench coat, patented as the Tielocken by Thomas Burberry in 1912, was designed for soldiers and made from a sturdy khaki-colored material called gabardine, which Burberry himself invented. British troops wore the coat in the World War I trenches, where the weather-proof material kept off the rain and mud. The name trench coat has followed the garment since, but its wartime use has been swapped for fashion shows, with Humphrey Bogart and Kate Moss among the famous modelers of the coat, now found in a range of styles and colors. Hide Caption 18 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Liberty prints \u2013 London department store Liberty's iconic and ever-evolving floral, paisley and patterned prints and dress fabrics date back to 1875, when founder Arthur Liberty first set up shop, inspired by Japanese kimonos and Eastern bazaars. Now embraced by the fashion scene, the fabrics have been drawn by artists and designers including Yves saint Laurent and Vivienne Westwood. With their very own exhibition last year at London's Fashion and Textile Museum, the popular prints are now found on anything from sunglasses to socks and scarves.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 19 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Dr Martens \u2013 Now a symbol of youth culture around the world, the eight-holed 1460 Dr Marten's boot, or AirWair, was launched by British brand Griggs in 1960 as a workman's boot. Adapted from a design by German doctor Klaus Märtens, the sturdy and functional "Docs" would grow into a style icon still in production today. While everyone from punks to skinheads have used the boots to express their cultural affiliations, it was the mods, in particular "Who" guitarist Pete Townshend, who kicked off their popularity among teenagers in the sixties.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 20 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Tartan \u2013 These traditional Scottish checked patterns were once associated with displaying clan kinship, but by the 19th century tartan had become a fashion item. Tartan has now traveled the world and can be found in all sorts of colors and designs, worn by everyone from students in school uniforms to punk rockers. Hide Caption 21 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Savile Row suits \u2013 Lined with tailors' shops since the 18th century, London's Savile Row is said to be the birthplace of the bespoke and hand-cut modern suit. It was inspired by the first tailless tuxedo, or dinner jacket -- commonly credited to tailor Henry Poole. He made the first such suit here in 1865 for then Prince of Wales and soon-to-be King Edward VII.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 22 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design Fred Perry polo shirts \u2013 Launched at the Wimbledon tennis championship in 1952 and produced only in white for the first few years, designer and tennis champion Fred Perry's original M12 Fred Perry shirt, with the iconic sewn-in logo, was the first sports shirt with a tipped collar. Later favored by everyone from football fans in the 50s to mods and skinheads in the 60s and 70s, the now-classic design was among the first to make the crossover from sportswear to streetwear.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 23 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The mini skirt \u2013 One of Mary Quant's best known designs is the mini skirt, which brought the spirit of the young and liberated to runways in the 1960s, and became a symbol of 60s swinging London.\u000a\u000aHide Caption 24 of 29\u000a\u000aPhotos: Iconic British design The top hat \u2013 There was a time when no respectable English gentleman would have been seen out without one: these days their use is generally confined to weddings and horse races. The silk top hat emerged in the UK during the 18th century. The first design is commonly attributed to haberdasher John Hetherington, who is said to have caused quite a stir when he walked around London wearing his new creation in 1797.

aV(CNN) Cindy Martinez joined the Marines when she was 17 years old.\u000a\u000a"When you go through Marine Corps boot camp or any type of training in the military, you're trained to be prepared for something big," she said.\u000a\u000aWhat Martinez didn't realize was how much she would need to rely on her mental toughness, not on the battlefield but in civilian life.\u000a\u000aMartinez served four years and met her husband, David, while on active duty. In May 2015, she was working full-time and raising two small children when her strength was put to the test.\u000a\u000aCindy Martinez with her husband, David, and two kids, David and Bianca, before she got sick.\u000a\u000a"One day, I woke up, and it just felt like a little ache on my left side, in my back shoulderblade area," she said.\u000a\u000aMartinez thought she must have slept on it awkwardly. But by the weekend, she was in intense pain.\u000a\u000a"David took me to the emergency room, and from there, I don't remember much," she said.\u000a\u000aFight of her life\u000a\u000aMartinez was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, a type of flesh-eating bacteria. She doesn't know how she contracted, it because she didn't have any visible cuts or wounds.\u000a\u000aDoctors removed the bacteria from her back, but her body was in septic shock.\u000a\u000a"Her life was now in danger," said her husband, David Martinez. "I tried to be as strong as possible for her and for the kids."\u000a\u000aThe medications that saved her life also ravaged her arms and legs.\u000a\u000a"My vessels were constricted, which didn't allow blood flow to my extremities because the doctors wanted all the blood to go to my heart," she said. "They told my husband, it was life over limb."\u000a\u000aMartinez fought for her life after being diagnosed with flesh-eating bacteria.\u000a\u000aMartinez underwent multiple amputations: both legs below the knee, her right arm above the elbow and portions of all the fingers on her left hand.\u000a\u000a"When I woke up and the amputations were done, it's a hard thing," she said. "They're gone, and they're not coming back."\u000a\u000aMartinez spent almost three months in the hospital and seven weeks in rehab. She learned to walk again with prosthetics.\u000a\u000aBut coming home wasn't easy.\u000a\u000a"It's almost like you're a different person," she said. "When your husband is at work, your kids are at school and you're home by yourself, that can take a toll on you."\u000a\u000aFinding new strength\u000a\u000aMartinez found support in an unlikely place. She reached out to CrossFit GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) gym in Dacula, Georgia, to see about becoming a member.\u000a\u000a"I still needed to work on myself and build my endurance to walk on my prosthetics," she said. "So I thought, 'Let me see if CrossFit could be something I could do.' "\u000a\u000aAmanda Greaver, founder of the gym, had never coached someone with multiple amputations. But she was up for the challenge. "It was a lot of trial and error, but Cindy has such a positive spirit," she said. "She's always up for anything I throw at her."\u000a\u000aWhen Martinez arrived at the gym, she could barely lift 5 pounds. But with modifications and adaptive devices, she can now squat 72 pounds and dead-lift up to 95 pounds.\u000a\u000a"Working out has really changed my outlook on life. It's my form of therapy," she said. "Now I can pick up my daughter, and I can pick up my son if I want to and hug them. ... I just can't put it into words."\u000a\u000aAfter regaining her strength, Martinez sought out a new challenge. She signed up for the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington in October.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I did the first 25 miles on my (modified) bike, and then I changed into my running prosthetics for the last 1.2 miles.

No matter how tired she was, she just couldn't stop."\u000a\u000aMartinez completed the Marine Corps Marathon in October.\u000a\u000aMartinez was overcome with emotion when she crossed the finish line.\u000a\u000a"Just a year prior, I was in a hospital bed," she said.

aVNikolaj Coster-Waldau is an actor and activist. In addition to starring on "Game of Thrones," he is a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Development Programme, which is an executive partner of UNLEASH Lab . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In "Game of Thrones" -- the television show in which I play fictional knight Jaime Lannister -- one of the many stunning visual images on regular display is an overwhelmingly massive wall of ice. I know all too well that, were "Game of Thrones" a nonfiction world, that wall of ice would be seriously imperiled by climate change.\u000a\u000aI know this because my second home is in the similarly ice-rich territory of Greenland. My wife is from Uummannaq in the northwest of Greenland, and my two daughters are half Greenlandic. In the considerable time I have spent there, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of rising temperatures on the delicate ecosystem of the world's largest island.\u000a\u000aWhat happens in Greenland is not usually of primary interest to Americans -- nor anyone else outside of the North Atlantic, for that matter. But it should be. If the Greenland ice sheet -- which covers 80% of Greenland -- melts, the results for the rest of the planet will be monumental. And not in a good way. Experts predict that, if the Greenland ice sheet does indeed melt, sea levels would rise 20 feet (6 meters).\u000a\u000aThe risks of climate change do not end at simply rising sea levels, which alone should be of concern to residents of New York, Miami, New Orleans and scores of other major metropolitan areas in the United States. The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -- which set a road map for tackling the planet's most pressing problems -- are delicately intertwined, so that failing to act on one, such as climate change, can have enormous negative consequences on another, such as hunger, poverty, ocean life, energy and even education.\u000a\u000aClimate change also adds an element of unpredictability to weather patterns , leading to an increase in the number and intensity of natural disasters.\u000a\u000aThat is why I am trying to call attention to the dangerous consequences of ignoring climate change. I have happily accepted an appointment as a goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), via which I am championing their work implementing the 17 SDGs -- including fighting climate change. UNDP's portfolio includes helping countries reduce greenhouse gases and their carbon footprints. It is also advocating disaster resilience (minimizing the risk of disasters and helping design effective disaster-recovery plans).\u000a\u000aWe are already seeing a surge in renewable energy investment in countries like China and India ; Honduras and others are committed to protecting and expanding forest coverage; while across Africa and small islands , more accessible and affordable off-grid energy systems are providing clean energy to millions. And mayors from cities like New York , Lima, Rotterdam, Seoul, Amman, and Cape Town have reaffirmed their commitment to implement the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau teamed up with Google Maps to shine a spotlight on climate change effects in Greenland.\u000a\u000aThat is why I also applaud the work of UNLEASH Lab, which for the past eight days has convened 1,000 millennial thought leaders from 129 countries to come up with innovative solutions that can help achieve the SDGs.\u000a\u000aThe event -- which has taken place in my home country of Denmark, but which will continue for the next 13 years in a rotating cast of cities, until the year 2030, when the Sustainable Development Goals are hopefully realized -- is a noteworthy example of much-needed youth engagement, cross-cultural collaboration, and disruptive thinking. UNLEASH concludes on Monday night in Aarhus when 12 out of the 200 proposed ideas will receive awards and potential future funding.\u000a\u000aLike any parent, I want a safe and secure world for my children, their children and the generations to come. We must not bury our heads in the sand when it comes to climate change -- we must instead have the courage to make other changes to preserve the stability and safety of our planet.

aV(CNN) For some, running just one marathon is the ultimate sporting achievement.\u000a\u000aFor others, it's just the beginning.\u000a\u000aAmongst running communities, there are rare breeds who aren't so much concerned with the distance -- it's more about where they run 26.2 miles, who they meet and the memories they make on the way round.\u000a\u000aThat's Henrik Brandt's philosophy, and that's why he's run the Great Wall Marathon in China every year for the past 18 years.\u000a\u000aWhen the race was founded in 1999 with only 350 entrants, Brandt was there. A combination of stunning scenery, testing conditions, and a great atmosphere means the Dane hasn't missed a race since.\u000a\u000aI've run marathons all over the world ... but there's no doubt my love is the Great Wall Marathon Henrik Brandt, marathon enthusiast\u000a\u000a"It's my favorite, my number one," Brandt told CNN.\u000a\u000a"I've run marathons all over the world on every continent, I've had a lot of adventures over the years, but there's no doubt my love is the Great Wall Marathon."\u000a\u000aRunners feel the burn on a climb\u000a\u000aAs endurance races go, the Great Wall Marathon is unique. Covering 5,164 steps, you can find yourself ascending hundreds of meters in a matter of minutes, toiling in temperatures of up to 40\u02daC.\u000a\u000aBut there's something about the endless incline, the intense heat, and the camaraderie on the way round that runners find alluring, and Brandt is no exception.\u000a\u000aAn impulse decision\u000a\u000aIt was the Great Wall Marathon that made Brandt, who only started running two months before he first competed in the race, fall in love with the sport.\u000a\u000a"In 1999 I was married to my first wife," he explains. "She had run two marathons at that time and I thought she was just crazy. All the training she had to do before -- I thought it was a waste of time.\u000a\u000a"We read in a Danish newspaper about the Great Wall Marathon, and I thought it was a great idea because it would be fun to visit China and the Great Wall and all the things I've heard about it."\u000a\u000aA phone call later, and Brandt, to the disbelief of his wife, had signed himself up on a whim.\u000a\u000a"She looked at me and thought I was mad. But later that day she went for a run and I went with her, and continued that for some weeks. I was not a runner at all.\u000a\u000a"It was quite a challenge to start with the Great Wall Marathon. Then I finished in a better time than her, so I thought I'd have to try a real marathon to see what the difference is in the time.\u000a\u000a"I signed up for the Berlin marathon four months later and, to give you a sense of how hard the Great Wall is, I did it two hours faster."\u000a\u000aRaquel Holgado is all smiles during the 2017 Great Wall Marathon\u000a\u000aThis year's winner won in a time of three hours, 14 minutes, 32 seconds, over an hour slower than the time it took Kenya's Daniel Wanjiru to win this year's London marathon.\u000a\u000aSomething different\u000a\u000aThe Great Wall Marathon has seen close to 23,000 finishers over its 18 years, a success that has lead Albatros -- a Denmark-based travel company that specializes in adventure holidays -- to broaden its marathon portfolio.\u000a\u000aAlbatros organize five different marathons in total and aim to offer something different to most organized marathons, swapping cities for safaris, concrete streets for stunning scenery, and well-trodden routes for remote resorts.\u000a\u000aThey appeal to athletes with a sense of adventure that the regular marathon circuit can't satisfy.\u000a\u000a"Going to the Berlin marathon, which I've been to twice, I drive to Berlin by myself, book the hotel by myself, and get to the start area," says Brandt.\u000a\u000a"I run in the morning then go back home [in Denmark] again -- I'm not really getting contact with all the runners at the Berlin marathon."\u000a\u000a"I prefer new marathons, rather than repeating the same one," she told CNN. "But with the Great Wall Marathon I'd 100% do it again."\u000a\u000a"It's great and completely unpredictable. You completely forget that you're doing something difficult or challenging.\u000a\u000a"This was great because I did the video and had lots of people sending me emails and messages. It's just a great way to meet people."\u000a\u000aThe world's hardest marathons?\u000a\u000aOn top of the Great Wall Marathon, Albatros also organizes one in the Arctic Circle; one in the ancient deserts of Petra, Jordan; The Big Five Marathon, held in a South African game reserve, and the Bagan Temple marathon that winds through the iconic spires of the Buddhist temples in Myanmar.\u000a\u000aRunners tackle the inhospitable landscapes of the Petra Desert marathon\u000a\u000aWhichever they sign up for, runners will be pushed to their limits -- be it by icy winds, energy-sapping sand, or sweltering desert heat.\u000a\u000a"With the Big Five Marathon on the sand, you feel like you take three steps forward and one step back," Steen Albrechtsen, head of production at Albatros, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"In the Polar Circle Marathon, we start on the ice cape and we run on the ice cape a certain distance and finish on normal roads. It's extremely cold.\u000a\u000aWe're not trying to break anyone, we're trying to give them a good race Steen Albrechtsen, Albatros Travel\u000a\u000a"But I think the Great Wall might be the hardest. We always say that you can't win on the wall, but you can lose on the wall. You can't really push yourself. If you start pushing yourself, the unrelenting incline will get to you later on.\u000a\u000a"It's a mix of temperature, terrain, and incline that makes them all so hard."\u000a\u000aThat said, it is meant to be a holiday, and Albatros wants the experience to be rewarding, if not necessarily enjoyable.\u000a\u000a"We try to make a race that's a 30% increase of someone's normal marathon time," Albrechtsen adds.\u000a\u000a"We're not trying to break anyone. We're trying to give them a good race, we're trying to give them a good experience. We actually have something like a 97% completion rate."

With ground breaking scheduled for June, Dubai Holding say the islands will be completed late 2020.\u000a\u000aGeared towards tourists, one island will include family-friendly resorts, a 2.5 million square-foot marine park and a custom built 1,700-seat theater, home to the Middle East's first Cirque du Soleil show. It will also house 300 seafront apartments.\u000a\u000aThe second, private island is set to host 14- luxury villas and marina for residents, along with a boutique hotel.\u000a\u000aMarsa Al Arab will add 2,400 hotel rooms to the Jumeirah Group's portfolio. The group is part of Dubai Holding, which is majority-owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai.\u000a\u000aJumeriah Group have experience when it comes to man-made islands. They manage the Burj Al Arab, located 280 meters off Jumeirah Beach on artificial land first constructed in 1994.\u000a\u000aOther artificial islands of grander scale and logistical complexity have followed the Burj, with varying levels of success.\u000a\u000aSea dredgers are used to create Dubai's artificial islands.\u000a\u000aPalm Jumeirah, 9.6-square miles and constructed between 2001 and 2006, is now home to hundreds of family residences and at least two dozen hotels.\u000a\u000aPalm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira are both set to eclipse the Jumeirah, but have suffered setbacks stemming from the global financial crisis of 2008.

aVThe reason is that nutrients and fiber are more concentrated when water is removed from fruit. For comparison, a half-cup of dried apricot halves has 4.7 grams of fiber, but the same amount of fresh apricot slices has 1.6 grams of fiber. Dried fruit is also a rich source of antioxidants and the B vitamin folate.\u000a\u000aOne large epidemiological study involving more than 13,000 individuals found that dried fruit eaters have better nutrient intakes --- and weigh less -- compared with those who don't consume it.\u000a\u000aHowever, it's important to keep in mind that the natural sugars in dried fruit are also more concentrated, which isn't necessarily cause for concern for the general population and may even be helpful for athletes needing quick fuel. But it can be an issue for those carefully watching their sugars, carbs or calories. For example, a cup of grapes has 23 grams of sugar and 104 calories, but a cup of raisins has 116 grams of sugar! And it has 520 calories -- five times the amount!\u000a\u000aAccording to US dietary guidelines, which encourage consumption of 1½ to 2 cups of fruit daily, a half-cup of dried fruit counts as one cup.\u000a\u000aFor diabetics who carefully distribute carbohydrates throughout the day, different rules apply.\u000a\u000a"When educating clients, many dietitians and diabetes educators recommend considering 2 tablespoons of dried fruit as one serving (15 grams) of carbohydrates," said Lori Zanini, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator. For example, 2 tablespoons of raisins is equivalent to 15 grams of carbs, but for the same amount of carbs, you can eat half a cup of red grapes, she explained. You could also eat half of a cantaloupe, minus a couple of bites (a half of a small cantaloupe has 18 grams of carbs).\u000a\u000aOverall, dried fruit can be a nutritious, convenient and portable snack, especially when mixed with nuts and eaten as trail mix. But if sugars, carbs or calories are of concern, be sure to count out your portion of dried fruit, as it can be easy to mindlessly nibble on it.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAlso, limit dried fruits that contain added sugars (cranberries are a frequent culprit, according to Zanini) or are coated in sugar, such as dried pineapple rings or other candied fruit. Finally, if you are sensitive to sulfites or have asthma, choose organic brands of dried fruit that do not contain sulfur dioxide, a preservative.

Back and forth they paced with nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aBecause Grandpa Mann put a circus poster in his store window, he was given free tickets, and Grandma Mann and I went to the afternoon performance. We walked through the midway of special attractions and food stands, a staple of circuses in those days, and Grandma Mann firmly clutched my hand so she wouldn't lose me.

aV(CNN) The number of heroin users in the United States jumped from 404,000 in 2002 to 948,000 in 2016, a 135% increase, according to the most recent government numbers. But even more striking: The number of people who had fatal overdoses related to heroin has skyrocketed from 2,089 in 2002 to an estimated 13,219 in 2016 -- a 533% jump.\u000a\u000aThese numbers are a striking marker of the lethality of the opioid epidemic that has taken root across the country.\u000a\u000aMore Americans lost to drugs than in Vietnam War\u000a\u000aHealth and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price said more American lives are lost to drugs than were lost in Vietnam. The US military saw 58,000 casualties during Vietnam; this year, drug overdose deaths are expected to reach an all-time high of 71,600.\u000a\u000a"This is unacceptable," said Price, who was part of a panel that released the latest findings from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health on Thursday .\u000a\u000aThe report wasn't entirely bad news: The number of people who misused and abused opioids has remained relatively stable since last year. Opioids can include both prescription drugs such as hydrocodone or oxycodone as well as illegal drugs like heroin or street fentanyl. Misuse of a narcotic includes using someone else's prescription drugs, using a higher dose than prescribed or buying prescription drugs off the street.\u000a\u000aThe discrepancy between increased overdoses and steady use levels has public health officials concerned about just how potent the drugs are becoming.\u000a\u000a"What's in today's drug supply is really terrifying," said Richard Baum, acting director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy who is also part of the panel releasing the new report.\u000a\u000aApproximately 11.8 million Americans misused an opioid in 2016, the new report says. Of those, just 8% used heroin. The majority misused prescription painkillers, and the main reason wasn't to get high but to get pain relief.\u000a\u000aIn addition, an estimated 2.1 million people were addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers last year, a number that has remained fairly constant since 2011.\u000a\u000aBut while opioid use hasn't changed much, the number of drug overdoses is expected to grow.\u000a\u000aFentanyl overdoses expected to double\u000a\u000aAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdoses are the leading cause of accidental death in America, killing more people than guns or car accidents.\u000a\u000aIt's a trend that doesn't appear to be reversing course. The CDC estimates that there were more than 52,000 overdose deaths for 2016 and projects that number to climb 38% to over 71,000 in 2017. Opioids continue to be the drivers for these overdoses, including both legally prescribed prescription painkillers as well as illegal drugs. In fact, the number of overdose deaths related to merely fentanyl is expected to more than double, from an estimated 9,945 in 2016 to 20,145 in 2017, the CDC says.\u000a\u000aDr. Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said the continuing rise in overdoses wasn't a surprise. Without increased access to medically assisted treatment, which involves using medications like buprenorphine and methadone to help taper opioid use, this trend could only be expected to grow, he said.\u000a\u000aOverdoses will continue "until it's easier to access bupenorphine than it is easier to access fentanyl, heroin or prescription pills," said Kolodny, who was not involved in the new report.\u000a\u000aThe rise of cocaine\u000a\u000aThe CDC is also seeing a trend in overdose deaths related to cocaine, which have increased steadily from over 4,000 in 2009 to over 6,700 in 2015. The agency expects that number to rise to over 6,900 in 2016 and then to make a 52% jump to almost 11,000 cocaine-related deaths this year.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"These are the highest numbers ever recorded in a single year. A lot of these fatalities are related to fentanyl," Baum said. He emphasized the need to better understand why drug users would use multiple substances.\u000a\u000aAnd while there has been a reported increase in cocaine production, Kolodny said that the rise in cocaine-related overdoses was a logical result of increased fentanyl use.\u000a\u000a"As we see more people dying of fentanyl overdoses, you're going to start seeing other things in their system," Kolodny said.

aVPaul Hockenos is a Berlin-based writer who most recent book is Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall and the Birth of the New Berlin. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It looks increasingly likely that the German national election on September 24 will secure Angela Merkel a fourth and final term as chancellor . With victory comes a definitive opportunity to distinguish her legacy.\u000a\u000aAfter 12 years in office, she'll go down in the history books as one of the great German leaders. Today, the country packs more gravitas -- economically and politically -- than at any time in the postwar era, as well as being a respected middle-heavyweight in world politics.\u000a\u000aBerlin dominates the EU, which Merkel's Germany-first overtures have ensured works to Germany's benefit above all else.\u000a\u000aYet, for all of Germany's fortune, Europe is mired in crisis and the EU is more ramshackle than ever since its founding six decades ago.\u000a\u000aMerkel's legacy beyond Germany -- as a great European statesperson -- will hinge upon her ability, together with French President Emmanuel Macron, to reform the fraught EU, which is the key to so many of the continent's ills, including migration, the rise of far-right populism and economic stability.\u000a\u000aThe question looming before the chancellor is whether she will leave behind her a German Europe -- an EU designed according to German precepts, in the service of German interests -- or a European Germany -- a country that understands its well-being as inseparably intertwined with those of its European partners.\u000a\u000aThe latter must be Merkel's ambition. Indeed, the chancellor has confirmed that she's prepared to work hand-in-glove with Macron to put the EU back on its feet . But Merkel, not a politician known for lofty visions, hasn't revealed her intentions concerning European reform during the election campaign, which has been woefully short of such nuts-and-bolts content as it is.\u000a\u000aShe certainly realizes that Germany will have to relinquish some of its privileges in order for the EU to serve the interests of Europe as a whole -- not a position that would win her conservative votes at home.\u000a\u000aGermany is going to have to compromise -- and this must begin with the first order of business, which is shoring up the monetary union, the eurozone. Most economists in Europe concur that a common currency requires a full-fledged monetary union, in which the money and fiscal policies of its members are tightly woven together.\u000a\u000aThis one-for-all and all-for-one euro means putting in place mechanisms that make the strongest in the currency union -- those, like Germany, who profit most from the union's perks -- responsible for the weaker members, who profit less from borrowing rates and the euro's value.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED The German economy in 60 seconds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The German economy in 60 seconds 01:00\u000a\u000aSome Germans will believe that their country already has made compromises when southern European states and Ireland tanked in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008-2009. Yet Berlin always stopped short of vouching for the debts of weaker economies -- as must happen in a functional monetary union.\u000a\u000aMerkel's conservatives also have plainly said no to deviating from their austerity and tight money policies -- German trademarks -- which Berlin claims are best for all of Europe, despite evidence to the contrary.\u000a\u000aAnd Germany has steadfastly resisted the easing of interest rates and other expansionary measures to stimulate investment, which could enable the rest of Europe to pull itself out of recession the way Germany has.\u000a\u000aIt's an entirely positive sign that Macron appears to grasp what is at stake and, in part, what needs to be done.\u000a\u000aMacron has underscored the necessity of more social and fiscal "convergence" in the monetary union, which points in the right direction.\u000a\u000aHe has floated the idea of a eurozone finance minister and common budget, the latter of which could finance investments to stimulate growth in struggling eurozone countries. It could also mean, Macron has implied, borrowing to do so (thus far, fresh debt has been a strict German taboo.)\u000a\u000aMoreover, the French President wants a separate eurozone parliament within the EU, which would handle euro-related issues. Macron says he will announce a "dozen" proposals for the eurozone after the German election.\u000a\u000aIt's not crucial for Merkel's legacy that this reform agenda spring from her imagination. Rather, she must seize the moment to act and pull her own party on board, which will be no mean feat, given its conservatism. Yet she's run against the grain of Christian Democratic orthodoxy before -- on nuclear power, minimum wage, immigration, and other issues -- and pulled it off. She can do it again with the right coalition partner. "We will not falter," she said of eurozone reform in July together with Macron in Paris. "There will be further steps later this year."\u000a\u000aBut the euro is not the EU's only problem child. The union as a whole suffers from a crisis of legitimacy that has caused its popularity to plummet and eurosceptic parties on the far left and right to flourish. Brexit was just one expression of the exasperation with business as usual. A glaring democracy deficit as ever more national powers are transferred to Brussels has other countries too, such as the Central Europeans, crying "enough!" Yet others, mainly in Western Europe, want to accelerate integration.\u000a\u000aThe EU's structural problems are so great that what is ultimately needed to fix it is a wide-ranging restructuring of its core bylaws and institutions. But this would require changes in the EU's founding treaties, which require all 28 members' legislatures approve them. Merkel knows, though, that there are far too many disparate views among the member states for treaty change of this magnitude to happen.\u000a\u000aThus Merkel and Macron will probably go forward with a "two-speed" EU in which some countries would forge ahead in certain areas, such as defense or European unemployment insurance, while other countries would sit out, perhaps catching up to the "avant-garde" countries at a later point.\u000a\u000aThe euro, with its 19 members, is one example of such a multi-speed approach. Yet there's resistance to this too. Smaller countries such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia fear the two-speed approach would sideline them on all important matters.\u000a\u000aAngela Merkel is going to have to convince Germans that they profit when the EU as a whole profits, even when it costs Germany in other visible and immediate ways. This was the secret of postwar (West) Germany's success and paved the way for German unification in 1990.\u000a\u000aThe EU stands at a critical juncture, which a European Germany could do much to put on the right path. Everything hinges on Angela Merkel's conviction that this is imperative.

aV(CNN) Cinnamon is one of the world's most popular spices, sprinkled on lattes, boiled with ciders and enjoyed in numerous dishes. Without it, Thanksgiving and Christmas meals might well become tasteless and definitely less fragrant.\u000a\u000aHarvested from the inner bark of a tropical evergreen plant, cinnamon has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat respiratory and digestive problems for centuries. Ancient Egyptians used cinnamon as a perfume during the embalming process, while Romans used it in funeral pyres to mask the stench of burning flesh.\u000a\u000aThe Bible mentions cinnamon several times, most commonly as a way to perfume bedding, clothes and anointing oil. The essential oil form is made from the bark, leaves or twigs of the plant.\u000a\u000aBut it's cinnamon's use as a medicinal agent that has scientists buzzing, trying to determine just how well its antioxidant capabilities might work to better our health.\u000a\u000a"Medicine started as herbs and plants," said Lauri Wright, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "So it almost comes full circle, as we're now going back and proving what some of these plant substances may do for health."\u000a\u000aNot all cinnamon is created equal\u000a\u000aThere are two basic types of cinnamon. Ceylon, or Cinnamomum verum, is grown in Sri Lanka. C. cassia, C. loureiroi and C. burmannii, communally known as cassia, are widely produced in China and Indonesia. Cassia has the stronger flavor and odor of the two and, due to its much lower cost, is what we buy in the store to sprinkle on our food.\u000a\u000aBut it's the more expensive Ceylon version, with a milder, sweeter flavor, that might be the best for your health.\u000a\u000aCassia can contain relatively high concentrations of coumarin, a plant compound that can damage the liver. A study of 91 cinnamon samples from various stores in Germany found 63 times more coumarin in cassia cinnamon powder than Ceylon powder. Cassia sticks, which look like a thick layer of rolled bark, also contained 18 times more coumarin than Ceylon sticks, which have thin layers.\u000a\u000a"A challenge with some of these herbal solutions, because they are not a regulated drug, is that you don't know exactly what you are getting," said registered dietitian Melinda Maryniuk, who serves on the professional practice committee for the American Diabetes Association. "A lot of things affect the makeup of the product: where it's grown, the soil, growing conditions, even how the spice was stored and dried."\u000a\u000aThat problem also plagues research on cinnamon. Scientists have used different doses, species and compounds of the spice for their research.\u000a\u000a"The doses have varied greatly among the studies, from less than 1 gram to levels that would be toxic in humans," Wright said. "The duration of taking the capsules has also varied greatly. That's the problem with translation of all of this work. Even when we find positive results, how do we come up with the correct compounding and dosage for maximum safety?"\u000a\u000aKeep that in mind as you read on about where science stands on cinnamon.\u000a\u000aDiabetes and cholesterol\u000a\u000a"I think the strongest evidence lies so far with diabetes and the promise of cinnamon and blood sugar control," Wright said, pointing to studies in test tubes and mice and even small studies in people showing that cinnamon helps with insulin sensitivity and glucose transport while decreasing inflammation.\u000a\u000a"A lot of the studies have been in postmenopausal women and men of that age," said biochemist Amy Stockert, who studies cinnamon at Raabe College of Pharmacy at Ohio Northern University. "Some have found positive effects; other studies have not."\u000a\u000aStockert co-authored a small study of 18 people with type 2 diabetes that showed the cassia species of cinnamon was more effective than diet alone in lowering blood glucose levels. In fact, her study found that it was comparable to oral diabetes medications.\u000a\u000aAnother study of 60 people with type 2 diabetes found that small doses of cinnamon reduced blood sugar levels and improved LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol.\u000a\u000a"I like the fact that the amount that showed benefits for blood sugar and cholesterol in that study was 1 to 6 grams, which is the range of half-teaspoon to three teaspoons, or one tablespoon, so it's easy to sprinkle on cereal or in yogurt or use in recipes," said registered dietitian Lisa Drayer, who writes about nutrition for CNN. The Food and Drug Administration's recommended limit is 6 grams a day.\u000a\u000aBut while the future looks promising, the American Diabetes Association urges caution.\u000a\u000a"The ADA believes there's not enough evidence," Maryniuk said. "A 2013 meta-analysis, which is one of the most rigorous of reviews, found that cinnamon had no impact on hemoglobin A1c levels, which is what we look at to measure how well blood sugar is being controlled over time. If that had gone down, I'd be more impressed."\u000a\u000aStill, if you want to see whether cinnamon works for you, Maryniuk suggests that people with type 2 diabetes do a self-test.\u000a\u000a"Do some paired blood glucose testing," she said. "Use a half a teaspoon in the morning, on fruit or oatmeal or in coffee, and see what happens to your blood sugar levels before and after you eat. Check again two to three hours later and see if there's a difference.\u000a\u000a"But keep taking your medicine," she warned. "You don't want to try something to the exclusion of the medicine you're taking."\u000a\u000a"We still need a bit more work before we roll this out," Wright agreed. "And you must be careful to work with your doctor when using cinnamon with diabetes medications, as it might drop your blood sugars too low."\u000a\u000aDementia, HIV, cancer and more\u000a\u000aThe antioxidant properties of cinnamon are also being studied for their impact on the formation of the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Cinnamaldehyde, a compound responsible for the spice's sweet smell, and epicatechin, a powerful antioxidant that's also in blueberries, red wine and chocolate, seem to offer some protection against the oxidative stress that damages tau, a key player in the development of dementia.\u000a\u000aAnother study found a component of Ceylon cinnamon to have the same effect. However, research has occurred only in mice, rats and laboratory Petri dishes.\u000a\u000a"It appears to work as an anti-inflammatory or antioxidant, protecting the body on a cellular level from bad things that happen," Wright said, "by getting rid of waste products and keeping the cells healthy."\u000a\u000aCinnamon and other traditional Indian medicinal plants are also being tested in the fight against HIV. One study found that green tea, elderberry and some extracts of cinnamon rich in flavonoids blocked the virus from entering and infecting certain cells.\u000a\u000a"That's how AZT works, which is one of the early HIV drugs," said Wright, who specializes in nutrition for infectious disease at the University of South Florida. "And while that's interesting, what I would hate is that patients will use cinnamon and other supplements instead of their HIV medications.\u000a\u000a"Having worked with many HIV clients over the years, I know there's definitely a big interest in supplements," she said. "But I would always caution them to always use the meds that we know work, that have been tested and dosed, and then look carefully to make sure there are no conflicts with any additional supplements."\u000a\u000aThe research on cinnamon doesn't stop there. Ceylon cinnamon has also been associated with cancer-fighting properties in rodents, anti-parasitic effects, improved diabetic neuropathy, lower blood pressure and wound healing, including liver damage. Studies have shown that solutions of cinnamon oil can kill a number of common bacteria, such as streptococcus and E. coli. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health is investigating cinnamon's impact on multiple sclerosis.\u000a\u000aUsing a computer model, biochemist Stockert found that cinnamon was as effective as resveratrol, an antioxidant in red wine known for anti-aging and disease-fighting properties, in activating SIRT-1 -- also known as the longevity gene because of its role in repairing DNA.\u000a\u000a"In some cases, it did better than resveratrol," Stockert said. "We're talking anti-cancer, anti-aging, a very, very big deal if that is what is going on."\u000a\u000aCinnamon as health aid\u000a\u000aBased on all this preliminary research, the potential of cinnamon seems enormous. But experts caution that it's still too early in the scientific process to suggest cinnamon as a daily supplement.\u000a\u000a"I don't recommend capsules. There's not enough science to tell us to take capsules," Wright said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"You are affecting your body's signaling," Stockert said, "and that's significant. We're at an early stage in research where we don't know how cinnamon will affect most people. Is it healthy to cook with spices and use them liberally? I'm sure that's fine. But I would be cautious about taking any supplements on their own."\u000a\u000a"I think the bottom line is that cinnamon is a perfect pantry staple, a pleasant spice that can add flavor to foods for minimal calories, with antioxidant properties that may give an edge to those looking to better control their blood sugar," Drayer agreed. "But we need to see more research before we can make any solid health claims linking cinnamon to reduce risk of disease or improved health."

In retrospect, maybe they weren't very good to begin with.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000aBut Generation X is tired of your sense of entitlement. Generation X also graduated during a recession. It had even shittier jobs, and actually had to pay for its own music. (At least, when music mattered most to it.) Generation X is used to being fucked over. It lost its meager savings in the dot-com bust. Then came George Bush, and 9/11, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Generation X bore the brunt of all that. And then came the housing crisis.\u000a\u000aGeneration X wasn't surprised. Generation X kind of expected it.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is a journeyman. It didn't invent hip hop, or punk rock, or even electronica (it's pretty sure those dudes in Kraftwerk are boomers) but it perfected all of them, and made them its own. It didn't invent the Web, but it largely built the damn thing. Generation X gave you Google and Twitter and blogging; Run DMC and Radiohead and Nirvana and Notorious B.I.G. Not that it gets any credit.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000aBut that's okay. Generation X is used to being ignored, stuffed between two much larger, much more vocal, demographics. But whatever! Generation X is self-sufficient. It was a latchkey child. Its parents were too busy fulfilling their own personal ambitions to notice any of its trophies-which were admittedly few and far between because they were only awarded for victories, not participation.\u000a\u000aIn fairness, Generation X could use a better spokesperson. Barack Obama is just a little too senior to count among its own, and it has debts older than Mark Zuckerberg. Generation X hasn't had a real voice since Kurt Cobain blew his brains out, Tupac was murdered, Jeff Mangum went crazy, David Foster Wallace hung himself, Jeff Buckley drowned, River Phoenix overdosed, Elliott Smith stabbed himself (twice) in the heart, Axl got fat.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is beyond all that bullshit now. It quit smoking and doing coke a long time ago. It has blood pressure issues and is heavier than it would like to be. It might still take some ecstasy, if it knew where to get some. But probably not. Generation X has to be up really early tomorrow morning.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is tired.\u000a\u000aIt's a parent now, and there's always so damn much to do. Generation X wishes it had better health insurance and a deeper savings account. It wonders where its 30s went. It wonders if it still has time to catch up.\u000a\u000aRight now, Generation X just wants a beer and to be left alone. It just wants to sit here quietly and think for a minute. Can you just do that, okay? It knows that you are so very special and so very numerous, but can you just leave it alone? Just for a little bit? Just long enough to sneak one last fucking cigarette? No?\u000a\u000aWhatever. It's cool.\u000a\u000aGeneration X is used to disappointments. Generation X knows you didn't even read the whole thing. It doesn't want or expect your reblogs; it picked the wrong platform.\u000a\u000aGeneration X should have posted this to LiveJournal.\u000a\u000aRepublished from Mat Honan's tumblr.

aVJonathan Tasini ( @jonathantasini ) is the author of " The Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America ," president of the Economic Future Group and the host of the " Working Life " podcast. His book "Resist and Rebel: The Peoples' Uprising in America" will be published in the fall. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Picture this (imaginary) 2020 scenario: President Donald Trump, running for re-election, forces voters to attend his rallies, prevents his Democratic opponent from campaigning during the daylight hours and, in the event the Democrat wins the general election, delays for months and years his opponent's taking office. Even the most vociferous Trump critic could not imagine this happening in America -- but these are the kinds of conditions workers face every time they try to win by forming a union. And often, it's even worse.\u000a\u000aOn Labor Day, each year, there is the usual accurate observation that the decline in union strength is the principal reason workers' wages have not kept pace with productivity over the past three decades; union representation in the private sector has fallen well below 7% -- compared to 35% in the 1950s\u000a\u000aBut, that decline in union power, and its result -- the undermining of the American Dream of a middle-class livelihood -- is rarely attributed to its real cause. That cause? The direct assault being waged by the union-busting industry, and the failure of the Labor Department and the National Labor Relations Board to stop repeat violations of the law. Many on the right too often attribute this decline wrongly to a lessening in the support for unions overall.\u000a\u000aThe truth is that many people want to be in a union, and, by most public opinion measurements, that desire has not waned, and has even strengthened in recent years, according to some scholars.\u000a\u000aRichard Freeman, co-director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, points out , "In 2002 the proportion of workers who said they would vote for a union rose above the proportion that said they would vote against a union for the first time in any national survey: a majority of nonunion workers now desire union representation in their workplace."\u000a\u000aThe narrative that support for unions is dying is just plain wrong. Instead, rarely making the headlines or exposed by the traditional media is a hidden, ugly war against unions, orchestrated by a sophisticated, multibillion-dollar industry\u000a\u000aThese union-busters are no longer the Pinkerton-style company goons who shot down strikers with impunity in the early 20th century. These days, they wear three-piece suits, work as lawyers or consultants for national law firms, and specialize in convincing you that no one wants to be in a union in the first place.\u000a\u000aTheir stock-in-trade is spreading fear and intimidation. With the first murmurs of an attempt to unionize, they unload a barrage of videos, websites, posters, buttons, T-shirts and PowerPoint presentations for employers to deploy against their workers' unionizing efforts.\u000a\u000aSome of them allegedly train supervisors how to intimidate workers . Some of them break the law if they need to, for example by illegally threatening to fire workers. Since penalties imposed by the National Labor Relations Board are small, large companies can view fines as just a cost of doing business.\u000a\u000aDuring the recent organizing effort at Nissan in Canton, Mississippi, for instance, supervisors inundated employees with anti-union messages in mandatory one-on-one meetings. Nissan broadcast anti-union videos inside the plant telling workers to "Vote No." The union, as is the case in virtually every union election, had no such access to workers inside the plant.\u000a\u000aIndeed, six days before ballots were cast in the two-day election, the NLRB charged Nissan , not for the first time, for breaking the law by threatening workers with cuts in wages and benefits and holding out the possibility the plant would close if workers voted for the union. With this kind of fear coursing through the plant, workers voted 2-1 against the union. Full disclosure: I am a member of the United Auto Workers (UAW), the union attempting to organize workers in Canton.\u000a\u000aEven in situations where workers do vote in favor of a union, the battle does not end. It's common for management to stall or use tactics of endless delay to avoid actually agreeing to terms with the new union. Delay is the friend of the union buster: after voting for a union, workers want to see immediate results from standing up against the company -- the entity that issues a paycheck.\u000a\u000aIf companies and their union-busting lawyers can drag out the process, the company can, then, petition for a new vote one year later -- and worn-down workers are frequently too exhausted to put up with another battle.\u000a\u000aIn this vicious war in the workplace, Donald Trump's administration wants to make the union buster's work even easier. During the Obama administration, then-Secretary of Labor Tom Perez (who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee), led an effort to close a loophole in the so-called " Persuader Rule ," which mandates full disclosure of all activities undertaken by these union-busting consultants.\u000a\u000aCasting sunlight on the consultants operating behind the scenes is one tool unions can deploy: When workers learn who their company's hiring to threaten and intimidate them, it can help build support for the union.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aBut the current secretary of labor, Alexander Acosta, is moving to rescind the persuader rule and allow " indirect advice " to go unreported. That will allow much of the union buster's activity to recede back into the shadows.\u000a\u000aIf the activities of the union-busting industry received just 1% of the media coverage devoted to Russia's involvement in the 2016 election, we might have a far different country -- where at least a modicum of democracy is present at work, where most of us spend half of our waking lives.

aVJoe Minihane, CNN \u2022 Updated 28th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Picturesque hilltops aren't always wild and empty.\u000a\u000aSome are adorned by ancient castles or churches, with pretty towns teetering on the edge. These vertiginous villages exude a special aura and offer far-reaching vistas over the landscape below.\u000a\u000aFor a glimpse of the high life, here are 14 of the most beautiful hilltop towns in Europe:\u000a\u000aSt Michael's Mount, England\u000a\u000aThis conical tidal island sits opposite the pretty village of Marazion in the middle of Mount's Bay in Cornwall. Perhaps the southwest England's most famous sight, the outcrop is home to a medieval castle and church, dating from the 12th century, as well as a smattering of homes overlooking the water.\u000a\u000aThe island can be reached via a causeway at low tide. Swimmers sometimes brave the half-mile journey, too.\u000a\u000aMont Saint-Michel, France\u000a\u000aMont Saint-Michel emerges from the tides in Normandy, France, like an ancient village from a fairytale. The coastal town built on a massive granite rock cuts a dramatic silhouette against the sky, rising from disappearing marshes to a Gothic Abbey at its height. With a permanent population of around 50, this popular tourist destination has a history dating back to at least the Roman era. Fancy a tour before the tides roll in?\u000a\u000aPerhaps Europe's most famous hilltop village, Mont Saint-Michel in Brittany has been home to a monastery since the 8th century. Today about 40 people call it home.\u000a\u000aThe lower walls and simple fishermen's houses rise steeply to a spectacular abbey, upon which Cornwall's St Michael's Mount was based. In fact, the two belonged to the same monastic order in the 11th century.\u000a\u000aAt low tide, pilgrims can walk across the sand and scale the ramparts.\u000a\u000aOia, Santorini, Greece\u000a\u000aThe countless cruise ships and daily tourist flights can make the tiny island of Santorini feel cramped.\u000a\u000aYet brave the crowds and head to Oia, on the northern tip of Greece's most famous caldera, and you'll find a picture-postcard village of white houses, windmills and blue-domed churches. Few Greek islands can match the sunset from here, best viewed from a rooftop bar with an ice-cold Mythos beer in hand.\u000a\u000aHeptonstall, Yorkshire, England\u000a\u000aPerched above the town of Hebden Bridge, Heptonstall's cobbled streets retain a spooky, mystical feel. Accusations of witchcraft were rampant here in the 1600s, with this part of Yorkshire known for its history of paganism.\u000a\u000aThe ruins of a 12th century church loom over the valley, while the graveyard of its 19th century replacement is the burial place of poet Sylvia Plath. Her former husband, the poet Ted Hughes, was born in nearby Mytholmroyd.\u000a\u000aBardi, Italy\u000a\u000aBardi is dominated by the ninth-century Castello dei Landi which peers over the Ceno Valley in northern Italy.\u000a\u000aAt a distance, Bardi, just a short drive from Parma, seems impossible to reach. The ramparts of the ninth-century Castello dei Landi are built on sheer rock, but the winding road switches back and forth before emerging onto a small square, home to the pretty church of San Giovanni Battista.\u000a\u000aWith a handful of coffee spots and pizza joints, there's ample time to indulge in the local cuisine as well as all that culture.\u000a\u000aBeaumes-de-Venise, France\u000a\u000aSipping on a glass of locally made Cotes du Rhone with views over the vineyards, it's hard not fall in love with Beaumes-de-Venise, named after the caves found in the surrounding hills.\u000a\u000aThe drive up from the wine trail which runs through this part of Provence offers stunning views of the craggy Dentelles de Montmirail, the foothills of Mont Ventoux. The narrow streets wind up to the ruins of a 12th century chateau. Perfect for walking off lunch.\u000a\u000aBad Gastein, Austria\u000a\u000aBad Gastein, Austria: Cold winters, warm waters.\u000a\u000aDeep in the Austrian Alps, Bad Gastein has a long history as a spa town. The thermal spring waters draw thousands of visitors a year, but its position high in the mountains and its spot right on top of the Gastein waterfall mean it's a mecca for climbers, skiers and adventurers, too.\u000a\u000aIts Belle Époque hotels help make it one of Austria's most charming villages.\u000a\u000aArcos de la Frontera, Spain\u000a\u000aAndalucia's pueblos blancos (white villages) are some of the most stunning, precariously built villages in Europe. And Arcos is the most famous.\u000a\u000aWith a Moorish castle dating back to the 11th century, a string of awe-inspiring churches and basilicas and, of course, those classic, whitewashed houses, this is a village that demands to be photographed and marveled at from every angle.\u000a\u000aGrindelwald, Switzerland\u000a\u000aIn the shadow of the Eiger, Grindelwald is arguably Switzerland's most beautiful village. Its classic wooden chalets sit among some of the highest mountains in the Alps, making it the ultimate destination for skiers in winter.\u000a\u000aHikers and climbers pour in over the summer months looking to conquer the peaks or simply walk the 300 kilometers of surrounding trails, with classic views back down the valley and over the rooftops.\u000a\u000aCivita di Bagnoregio, Italy\u000a\u000aCivita di Bagnoregio is slowly disappearing. The plateau on which this arresting little village stands is crumbling away. Many of its classic stone buildings have been lost down the centuries since it was first settled 2,500 years ago.\u000a\u000aToday, tourism keeps this beautiful hilltop village alive, its tiny population truly living on the edge. The gorgeous San Donito church can be seen for miles around above the Tiber River valley.\u000a\u000aGroznjan, Croatia\u000a\u000aCroatia's Istria peninsula is blessed with a number of hilltop villages. But none are as captivating as Groznjan.\u000a\u000aDubbed "the town of artists" because of the large number of musicians, painters and thinkers who moved here in the 1950s, there are galleries galore to explore. Views over the Mirna Valley, plus its baroque churches, make it worth lingering in Groznjan for a few days.\u000a\u000aMdina, Malta\u000a\u000aMdina, Malta: City of conquests.\u000a\u000aMalta does a fine line in hilltop towns, but none are as special as Mdina. The one-time capital of this Mediterranean island, the city still sits behind its ancient walls.\u000a\u000aSt. Paul is said to have spent time here after being shipwrecked off the coast, while various religious orders maintain a strong presence in Mdina's monasteries and convents. Palaces built by conquerors from as far as Normandy and Spain dominate the skyline.\u000a\u000aTaormina, Sicily, Italy\u000a\u000aA stop on the classic 19th century Grand Tour, Taormina still draws in the tourists.\u000a\u000aIt can get hectic, but it's easy to see why: dazzling vistas of the big blue; the vast Teatro Antico, Sicily's second largest Greek theater; views to the smoldering Mount Etna; and the boutique-filled Corso Umberto I.\u000a\u000aAll go to make Taormina one of Italy's most special hilltop towns, a true gem on an island full of treasures.\u000a\u000aMonsaraz, Portugal\u000a\u000aBelieved to be one of the oldest settlements in Portugal, Monsaraz's hilltop location has been occupied by a string of different conquerors down the years, from the Moors to the Visigoths.\u000a\u000aToday, its 14th century castle pulls in the crowds, the village's walls offering huge views of the surrounding olive groves and nearby Alqueva Dam.

You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000aHumans never have lived on a planet that's 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels, in the late 1800s, and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2-degree mark.\u000a\u000a"This is gambling with the planet," said Gernot Wagner , the lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of the book "Climate Shock."\u000a\u000aThink super droughts, rising seas and mass extinctions.\u000a\u000aYet for all of its importance, I don't think the 2-degree threshold is as famous as it should be. I've heard it referred to as the "north star" for climate negotiations. Meaning: This one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world's attention.\u000a\u000aIt's so significant that it's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year. I'm calling that effort "2 degrees," and I need your help to make it work.\u000a\u000aUntil 5 p.m. ET Monday, you can vote on the first story I'll report for the series.\u000a\u000aTell CNN's John Sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. This poll closes Monday, April 27, at 5pm ET. #2degrees Posted by CNN on Tuesday, April 21, 2015\u000a\u000aAll of those story ideas came from you, by the way.\u000a\u000aThey focus on what a 2-degree world might look like.\u000a\u000aCNN kicked off this effort with a Facebook chat last week. We asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2-degree threshold, specifically.\u000a\u000aI don't have all the answers right now. We'll continue to explore the importance of this number together. But below you'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number. Many of them come straight from you, the readers. And I tossed in a couple of my own.\u000a\u000aIf you'd like to follow this project as it evolves, I'd encourage you to sign up for the "2 degrees" newsletter . And feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below. They'll shape the way I spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number.\u000a\u000a1. Where did the idea for 2 degrees come from?\u000a\u000aOne guy, it turns out. William Nordhaus , an economist at Yale.\u000a\u000aNordhaus, 73, proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 (1977!) paper titled " Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem ."\u000a\u000aThe estimate was "crude, but it was a reasonable first start," he told me.\u000a\u000a"If there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years," he wrote in "The Climate Casino."\u000a\u000aA growing body of research now supports the idea.\u000a\u000a2. How did 2 degrees become the international standard?\u000a\u000aScience has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming. And that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want.\u000a\u000a"You need a judgment call for these things," said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, who has written on the history of 2 degrees Celsius. "And this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy."\u000a\u000aGermany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal, Jaeger told me. That happened in the 1990s. Later came the European Commission , the G8 , the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most significantly, the Copenhagen Accord , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much.\u000a\u000aThe United States was among the signatories\u000a\u000a3. What would the world look like at 2 degrees?\u000a\u000aI'm going to spend the month of May exploring this question, so look for more on this. But here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like. These are pulled from reports by the National Research Council , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Bank\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.\u000a\u000a\u2022 A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates\u000a\u000a\u2022 The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.\u000a\u000a\u2022 The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%. \u2022 Wildfires in the United States are expected to increase 400% to 800% in size.\u2022 Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.\u2022 A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates 20% to 30% of animals and plants species will be at "increasingly high risk of extinction" at or near the 2-degree mark.\u2022 The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.\u2022 Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.\u2022 The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%.\u000a\u000aSo ... not good.\u000a\u000aAnd numbers don't convey the emotional toll.\u000a\u000a"I'm from New Mexico," said Nordhaus, the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold. "I love it there, and I know it's going to be a completely different climate. The trout fishing probably won't be as good. The hiking won't be as good. These forests may look completely different, or burn down. I love to ski. It's one of my things I love most. And that's obviously affected by warming. I love the ocean, and the New England coastline, and it's in peril. That's just for starters."\u000a\u000a4. What happens at 2.1 degrees?\u000a\u000aNo one knows, exactly. Think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking. How many cigarettes give you cancer? No one knows, exactly. But the more you smoke, the more you up your risk. And 2 degrees, policy experts agree, is certainly risky territory.\u000a\u000aPlus, everyone hates a fraction.\u000a\u000aTargeting 1 degree of warming is "ridiculous because you can't do it," said Nordhaus, the economist. "Three sounds too high. And you can't have a fraction because it's too complicated.\u000a\u000a"So two is kind of an obvious number."\u000a\u000a5. How much has the climate warmed already?\u000a\u000aThe climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the Industrial Revolution . And we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we're already putting into the atmosphere, even with "very ambitious mitigation action" to reduce carbon emissions, according to a 2014 report from the World Bank. Some of that warming is "locked-in to the Earth's atmospheric system," that organization says. The impacts of climate change already are being felt.\u000a\u000a6. Is it possible to stay below 2 degrees?\u000a\u000aYes, but it won't be easy.\u000a\u000a"If you want to stay below 2 degrees, you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree," said Jaeger from the Global Climate Forum.\u000a\u000aHere's the best guess for what that "amazing speed" might need to look like: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80% to 90% by 2050, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. "It depends on how much risk you want to accept," she said. Some activists, including those from 350.org and Avaaz, which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in New York , want to accept less risk than that.\u000a\u000a"Our position is 100% clean energy," said David Sievers, a senior campaigner for Avaaz.\u000a\u000a7. What happens if we don't take action?\u000a\u000aSome writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target, saying it's too ambitious, or even naive. But we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that "north star" to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem.\u000a\u000aIf you think 2 degrees sounds bad, 5 degrees is far, far worse.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by "major extinctions around the globe" and a "reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide." Just beyond that, at 6 degrees, we're looking a "catastro-f***" that would be almost "infinitely costly," said Wagner, the Environmental Defense Fund economist. "It's akin to killing the planet, basically. Or society on the planet."\u000a\u000aThis much should be clear: Something has to change.\u000a\u000aIf we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3, that's still better (or less awful) than 5 or 6. What's important is that we maintain a sense of urgency, and keep sight of the goal.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 11 ways climate change affects the world Melting polar ice caps \u2013 The consequences of climate change go far beyond warming temperatures, which scientists say are melting the polar ice caps and raising sea levels.

Climate change has not been kind to the world'sforests. Invasive species such as the bark beetle, which thrive in warmer temperatures, have attacked trees across the North American west, from Mexico to the Yukon. University of Colorado researchers have found that some populations of mountain pine beetles now produce two generations per year, dramatically boosting the bugs' threat to lodgepole and ponderosa pines.

aV(CNN) A small zoo in the Palestinian territories is an unlikely place to find a budding community of skateboarders.\u000a\u000aBut dozens of youngsters rolled up to a wooden ramp in Qalqilya Zoo last month -- not far from enclosures containing lions, peacocks and monkeys -- to learn the tricks of the skater trade.\u000a\u000aThe children were taking part in a free, three-week skating program run by SkateQilya , a non-profit that uses the sport to reach out to young people across the West Bank.\u000a\u000a"The kids learn very fast because they are in love with skateboarding," says 17-year-old Faiza Batta, who traveled to the summer camp from the nearby village of Hajjah in 2016 before returning this year to help out the organizers.\u000a\u000aThe experience, she says, has inspired many attendees to dream of becoming a professional skater and showcasing their skills abroad.\u000a\u000a"Some of them say it is a way to fly .. (to) use the skateboard as a passport for traveling," Batta says.\u000a\u000aGetting kids on board\u000a\u000aSkateQilya, the non-profit organization, was co-founded by Palestinian activist Mohammed Othman, New York-based filmmaker Adam Abel and American former pro skateboarder Kenny Reed in 2016.\u000a\u000aOthman and Abel have been making a feature film about the nascent Palestinian skateboarding scene since 2011, which they hope to send to festivals next year.\u000a\u000aThey met Reed when he came to Qalqilya to help build its skate ramp in 2013, after the local municipality donated land for the project.\u000a\u000aThe trio decided to set up a summer camp , also called SkateQilya , last year.\u000a\u000aFrom left, SkateQilya founders Adam Abel, Mohammed Othman and Kenny Reed.\u000a\u000aAs well as teaching skateboarding techniques, the camp aims to nurture community building, leadership and creative skills. Attendees have been taught, for example, how to use video cameras and take photos.\u000a\u000a"We envision expanding (the curriculum) to include more entrepreneurial skills, too," Abel says.\u000a\u000a"My ultimate goal would be to start getting coding programs in here. All these things are creative like skateboarding, but are also skills these kids can pursue in careers and potentially for income."\u000a\u000aCheckpoints and walls\u000a\u000aLocated in the northwest region of the West Bank, Qalqilya is a town of more than 40,000 surrounded by Israel's imposing security wall.\u000a\u000aAccording to Othman, there are few things for kids in Qalqilya to do.\u000a\u000aLand is sparse and there are no municipal parks, one reason why the skatepark was built in the zoo.\u000a\u000aBut even with access to this space, setting up the summer camp has been far from simple.\u000a\u000aOthman says the Israeli army can cause disruption by setting up checkpoints and making incursions into Palestinian towns and villages.\u000a\u000aIsrael has long stated such actions are necessary for security, but Othman says they can make it difficult for children to reach the camp.\u000a\u000a"You never know when the checkpoint is going to start and going to end," he says, adding that their program is non-political.\u000a\u000aThe challenges don't end there. Even obtaining the right equipment can be hard, as there are no skateboard shops in the West Bank.\u000a\u000aAbel and Reed describe bringing duffel bags full of boards, helmets and knee pads donated by international sponsors and donors to the West Bank.\u000a\u000aBut that can be complicated, too. "Last year our equipment was held for a short period but we eventually got it," Reed says.\u000a\u000aA post shared by SkateQilya (@skateqilya) on Aug 7, 2017 at 12:14am PDT\u000a\u000aNurturing a scene\u000a\u000aTom Bird, editor of " Roll With The Punches ," a new magazine dedicated to skateboarding in the Palestinian territories, says there are two skate parks in the West Bank.\u000a\u000aThese were built by non-profits skate-aid and SkatePal in the towns of Bethlehem and Asira Al-Shamaliya, respectively, and differ from the Qalqilya Zoo ramp in that they contain a number of dips and obstacles over a larger area.\u000a\u000aAnother skate park is planned in the village of Jayyous, thanks to a joint project between SkateQilya and SkatePal -- with whom Bird has volunteered in the past.\u000a\u000aAt the new park, Othman says SkateQilya will work with a local school to offer skateboard classes as part of its physical education curriculum.\u000a\u000aSkatePal founder Charlie Davis told CNN via email, meanwhile, that his organization runs classes five days a week at their Asira Al-Shamaliya skatepark.\u000a\u000aBird says there were only a handful of people skateboarding until groups like SkatePal and SkateQilya showed up.\u000a\u000aA post shared by SkateQilya (@skateqilya) on Aug 21, 2017 at 12:01pm PDT\u000a\u000a"(Now) in terms of the talent level, some of the children are progressing at a really rapid rate ... I think part of that is because there aren't really too many other distractions," Bird says.\u000a\u000a"There are some people who you can tell are very, very dedicated to skateboarding and it's come to define what they do and who they are."\u000a\u000aProgressive attitudes\u000a\u000aFor Othman, the fact that the SkateQilya program is open to both genders is extremely important.\u000a\u000a"Having boys and girls together in a summer camp in the West Bank is something that's not normal," Othman says.\u000a\u000aMany West Bank communities remain socially conservative, says Abel, with boys and girls generally not playing sports or socializing together\u000a\u000aBut, he says, SkateQilya has worked to change that, with the support of the children's parents.\u000a\u000aA young skateboarder takes on the ramp at the SkateQilya camp in the West Bank.\u000a\u000a"We had 14 and 15-year-old girls and boys holding hands as they go down a skate ramp," Abel explains. "This is a major, major thing here in Qalqilya."\u000a\u000aBird says some critics argue that children in the West Bank need more than skateboarding facilities to overcome the challenges they face.\u000a\u000aBut he believes skateboarding can provide some important lessons.\u000a\u000a"A lot of life skills and qualities that I use in adult life, I got skateboarding as a youngster," he says.\u000a\u000a"Persistence would be a big one. I'm persistent with a lot of things. I think much of that comes through skateboarding. You know, not leaving a skate park until you get a trick that you've been trying for hours and hours."\u000a\u000aIn a place like the West Bank, persistence is perhaps not a quality to be underestimated.

It usually is found in women who are sensitive to the higher hormone levels that come with pregnancy.\u000a\u000aEach month during a woman's menstrual cycle, the estrogen circulating through her body rises, Dr. James Liu told CNN in 2012, during the duchess' first pregnancy. Liu is now the chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, UH Cleveland Medical Center.\u000a\u000a"But once a woman achieves pregnancy, the ovary at the beginning and later on the placenta makes much higher levels of estrogen and progesterone; and very high levels of estrogen in general can have an effect on a part of the brain called the chemoreceptor zone and it causes nausea," Liu said. During pregnancy, hormone levels can rise 100 to 1,000 times the amount of a normal menstrual cycle.\u000a\u000aExtreme nausea and vomiting during pregnancy may occur if a woman is carrying more than one baby, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Another possible cause for higher hormone levels leading to excessive nausea is something called abnormal placentation, where the placenta overgrows, says Liu, adding that this happens only occasionally.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVStory highlights Richard Fontaine: The response of other wealthy nations to famines in Yemen, South Sudan, Yemen, and Nigeria has been inconsistent\u000a\u000aPresident Trump should use his unwavering media visibility to influence countries to give more aid, he writes\u000a\u000aRichard Fontaine is president of the Center for a New American Security in Washington, DC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In his first six months as President, Donald Trump has used his platforms to decry and cajole anything or anyone that stands in the way of his campaign promises -- or that he simply doesn't like. And he recognizes and praises the people and things he does. For better or worse, this has drawn attention to those who have been the subject of Trump's remarks.\u000a\u000aRichard Fontaine\u000a\u000aNow a worthy target is crying out for President Trump's extraordinary reach: The so-called "four famines" that currently afflict South Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. The United States has been generous in providing resources to confront the spread of starvation in these countries; it's other wealthy countries who have fallen down on the job. And it's here that the President could rack up a win for his administration and for humanity.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump's megaphone is perhaps the loudest of any world leader in memory. With near 24/7 coverage of his statements and actions and tens of millions of social media followers, the President possesses the unique ability to illuminate a humanitarian catastrophe that garners few headlines at home or abroad -- and help save millions of lives.\u000a\u000aThe numbers are staggering.

aVS.E. Cupp is the author of "Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity," co-author of "Why You're Wrong About the Right" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.\u000a\u000aBoston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.\u000a\u000aUntil I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.\u000a\u000aI'd always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn't decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I'd ever endured.\u000a\u000aThe pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally -- it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)\u000a\u000aThe pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It's why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It's why I didn't tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he'd spare my next effort.\u000a\u000aAs Marion Underwood and Robert Faris' excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.\u000a\u000a"Even before the dawn of social media," they write, "adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist."\u000a\u000aSo true. I can't imagine my 13-year-old self, naïve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today's unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.\u000a\u000aBut while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to "go viral") were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think 02:10\u000a\u000aNow that I'm a parent of a 10-month-old son, I'm clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents -- especially as parents were either bullies or bullied -- is what kind of kids do we want to raise?\u000a\u000aI could be honest and tell you I've had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a "socially-adept" child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn't the target of bullying. But we've had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.\u000a\u000aLooking back on my difficult year, I'm not sure I'd wish I could have been popular. I do wish I'd been a little more secure.\u000a\u000aI'm also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It's anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won't be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.\u000a\u000aI think I'm pretty tough. Mine wouldn't be the best job -- regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) -- if I had thin skin.\u000a\u000aThere's name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there's stuff you don't prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.\u000a\u000aWhen we talk about bullying, it's hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that's among the adults!).\u000a\u000aOf course, we're tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to "just ignore them" rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.\u000a\u000aAs difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it's also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.\u000a\u000aBeing 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn't necessarily be that it gets better -- adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It's that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you.

aVKelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When Avital Norman Nathman's son was about 3, she says, he freaked out after he walked in on her changing a sanitary pad. So she decided to have an age-appropriate conversation about menstruation with him right then and there.\u000a\u000aShe has taken an open approach ever since with her son, now 10, when it comes to talking about sex.\u000a\u000a"It's not just one conversation," said Norman Nathman , of Northhampton, Massachusetts, a blogger and editor of an anthology on motherhood titled "The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality." "We have this idea in our heads that there is 'the talk,' but it shouldn't be just one conversation. It should be multiple conversations, and starting from a pretty young age."\u000a\u000aNorman Nathman's approach is influenced by what she observed when she taught high school for about four years, beginning in 2002. With sex ed as part of the curriculum, she often led discussion groups based on what the students heard from experts on sex education.\u000a\u000aAnd she was surprised by "the amount of people that would come in from the overall talk with, 'Oh, my gosh. I didn't realize these things.' "\u000a\u000aFor instance, a lot of them thought they could get pregnant simply by being in a hot tub, she said.\u000a\u000a"Talk to your kids," she said when I asked her advice for other parents. "Be there to answer questions, because as uncomfortable as it may be for you, it might be more uncomfortable when your kid comes to you with (a sexually transmitted infection) or with an unplanned pregnancy."\u000a\u000aParents might dread talking to their kids about sex, but here's something really important for every parent to realize: They have tremendous power. Consistently, in surveys conducted by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, teens have said parents have the most influence over their decisions about sex.\u000a\u000aThe power of parents\u000a\u000aIn the most recent survey, released in October, 52% of children ages 12 to 15 said their parents have the most influence when it comes to sex, with friends far behind at 17%. For the 16 to 19 age group, 32% of teens say their parents carry the most weight, with 28% saying their friends have the most influence.\u000a\u000aHowever, when parents are asked who they think most influences their teens' decisions about sex, friends come out far on top. Nearly 60% of more than 2,000 adults over 18 surveyed nationally said friends carry the most weight, in findings released exclusively to CNN, while just 11% said that parents were the biggest influencers.\u000a\u000a"It's a natural rite of passage for teens to act like adults don't matter. It's just part of the developmental process in many, many cases, so I think it's fair for adults to believe what their teens are telling them, and the reality is that teens are clearly saying, especially younger teens and even 16- to 19-year-olds, their parents absolutely matter," said Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\u000a\u000aEven though Janeane Davis, a suburban Philadelphia mom of four, has been talking to her kids about sex since they were young, she still finds it surprising that teens say their parents have the most power when it comes to their decisions about sex.\u000a\u000a"I expected that in my house, but I didn't expect that to be true across the country, and so that's kind of encouraging to know that as parents, we can still influence our children," said Davis, whose kids are 9, 14 and 21 and who blogs at Janeane's World\u000a\u000aWe need to talk to our children, she said, and give them our opinions, "because they're going to listen to what we say, even if they don't do what we want. At least they're listening."\u000a\u000aBut parents seem skeptical about their own abilities to be a trusted source for their children or other young people when it comes to topics such as sex, birth control and relationships, according to the survey.\u000a\u000aWhile 68% said they consider themselves someone whom a younger person could approach to discuss these sensitive issues, 32% said they either couldn't be that person or didn't know whether they could play that role, according to the findings to be released this week.\u000a\u000a"We know that parents are key influencers ... and parents might not believe that, but what they should remember is that this is part of a process and that what parents instill in young people ... might not take hold and catch hold at the moment, but they're preparing their young people, their kids, for the future," Ehrlich said.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that young people who believe there is an adult they can talk with and trust are less likely to have a teen pregnancy, she said.\u000a\u000aSo how can parents start and have these important conversations with their kids? First, they should realize that the conversation is as hard for the teen as it is for the adult, Ehrlich said. "So many sitcoms have really covered that. As soon as the adult brings it up, the teen goes, 'Oh, no!' and vice versa: As soon as the teen brings it up, the adult is like, 'Oh, no!' "\u000a\u000aThe key is for both teen and parent to realize that it's uncomfortable and that's it's OK to feel uncomfortable, she added.\u000a\u000aHere are some tips to start the conversation and keep it going.\u000a\u000a1. Talking about sex in the digital age\u000a\u000aDiana Graber, who teaches "Cyber Civics" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California, remembers the first time she talked to her older daughter about sex. It was probably pre-middle school when she learned from another parent that she had had "the talk" with her son. Graber, a mom of two, then felt like she needed to have a conversation with her daughter because she didn't want her to be left behind.\u000a\u000a"And so I did, and she was looking at me: 'Why are you telling me this? I don't want to know any of this,' " recounted Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital media literacy platform for tweens and teens, teachers and parents. "For years after, even now today, she is 21 years old, she said, 'You told me that stuff way too young.' But as a parent, you just don't know. You don't want to be the one that their kid finds out from their friends because you were too lame to have that conversation."\u000a\u000aHer daughter grew up before kids had cellphones in their hands, she said. "I feel like it's so different for parents today because they don't have that opportunity to break the news to them."\u000a\u000aGraber says her sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders are often seeing a lot of sexual imagery that's sometimes confusing to them. A widely touted statistic is that 70% of children between 7 and 18 have stumbled upon pornography accidentally.\u000a\u000aShe advises parents who give young kids devices to make sure parental controls are in place to keep them from seeing inappropriate content and to spend time on the social media networks their kids are on.\u000a\u000aShe says social media can actually open a door to have discussions about sex that parents wouldn't know how to bring up before.\u000a\u000a"If something inappropriate happens and you know about it, well, that's a great door opener to talk about it and to be that wisdom and kind of guide them through what they're seeing," Graber said. "That's the thing about technology and social media. It does give you a window into your child's world that we never had before. When I was having conversations at the corner with friends, my parents weren't listening."\u000a\u000aEhrlich, of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, said parents should keep in mind how more and more conversations about sex are happening via text. Talking about sex with our kids through texts might be uncomfortable for those of us who didn't grow up in the digital age and prefer face-to-face chats, but texting might help break the ice and then make the face-to-face conversation easier, she said.\u000a\u000a"I think there may be something ... in being askable and making sure the door is open for conversation," Ehrlich said. "I think that for some young people, probably, the knowledge that the door is open is more important than the conversation itself."\u000a\u000a2. How pop culture can get the conversation going\u000a\u000aMore than half of young people ages 12 to 24 have had a helpful conversation with their parents about sex because of something they saw in popular media, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\u000a\u000a"I think watching things in media ... can be a great conversation starter," Ehrlich said. Parents can then use those moments as opportunities to talk about what happened, ask their child what they thought and talk about how it's similar or different to what they believe and do as a family.\u000a\u000aDavis, the mom of four, uses this approach quite a bit with her children. "If we see something on a television show, we'll do something along the lines of, 'Why is she making out with him? She just said she doesn't like him.' "\u000a\u000aHaving regular conversations and making them part of their everyday lives is a much better approach, she believes, than having one big talk.\u000a\u000a"We try to look for ways to make it part of life, because if it's part of life, they're more likely to listen when we talk than if it's 'Oh, my God, we got to have that conversation again,' " she said. "If we keep it along those lines, we think or we're hoping that we'll have better results than if it's just this major once a year conversation."\u000a\u000a3. Practice, practice, practice\u000a\u000aThe old adage "practice makes perfect" applies to talking about sex with your kids, Ehrlich said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Sex talk with mom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sex talk with mom 02:11\u000a\u000a"How do we practice for these conversations, knowing that developmentally, they're probably going to come, so how do we think about how we're going to prepare ourselves as adults not to react in a way that isn't going to keep the door open?" she asked.\u000a\u000aThat means thinking about what you might say and what resources you might want to offer to your child, because adults don't need to be experts in everything, she added. We have plenty of resources on the Internet, so that takes some of the pressure off. We just need to think beforehand about which trusted resources would be good for our kids to utilize on their own time.\u000a\u000a4. 'Stay early and stay late'\u000a\u000aEhrlich says "stay early and stay late" is an expression one of her colleagues likes to use. What it means is, there is no such thing as "the talk" -- but rather many talks that parents should be having with their children as they grow.\u000a\u000aAlso, the conversation doesn't need to be about technicalities and specifics, she said. It's more about making sure your children know that they have the power to decide when and if to have sex and what you as parents feel about that as a family.\u000a\u000a"Here's kind of what our teachings tell us about it. Here's what we want to think about," she said, sharing examples of what parents might say. "These are all kinds of guidance conversations that really parlay into the future and what (could happen) in the future."\u000a\u000a5. Be open\u000a\u000aDavis says her and her husband's philosophy has always been that kids are going to do what they want to do, and so they've been open with their children about sex and birth control.\u000a\u000a"They're not necessarily going to listen to us and just wait until you're married," Davis said. "And if they're not going to do that, we want them to be protected."\u000a\u000aHer husband has made the point with their 14-year-old son that just like a cellphone has a case, he needs to "keep it covered" if he's going to have sex.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We figure, if we talk to them and we're open and honest, then they're more likely to do the right thing and not be afraid to tell us what they've done and what they plan to do."\u000a\u000aNorman Nathman, the mom of one and editor of "The Good Mother Myth," says people might think that if you talk to kids about sex and teach them about it, they're more likely to have sex.\u000a\u000a"But they are going to have sex regardless. Why don't we give them the tools to do it safely for themselves and their partners?"

aV(CNN) When Pope Francis arrives Wednesday in Colombia for a five-day visit, he'll be on difficult terrain, and not just because of the country's high altitude.\u000a\u000aIn early 2016, Francis promised he would visit the South American country once a peace agreement ending its civil war of more than 50 years had been reached. A few months later, the government and FARC rebels forged an agreement, but Colombian voters struck it down in a referendum.\u000a\u000aA revised agreement was not put to a second referendum but passed in Colombia's Congress in November. President Juan Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, but the deal is still unpopular.\u000a\u000aNow the Pope must make good on his promise and help the peace agreed to on paper become a reality in the hearts of a divided Colombia.\u000a\u000a"The Vatican has made it very clear that the Holy Father is not going to Colombia to bless the peace process or support either the government or the opposition," said Nestor Ponguta, a longtime Vatican correspondent for W Radio Colombia and the author of a book on Pope Francis.\u000a\u000a"The great hope for his visit is that it helps us to heal the wounds, and that the message extends to other countries like Venezuela that are experiencing very difficult conflicts."\u000a\u000aThe Pope and Vatican diplomacy have been working for several years to help Colombia achieve peace.\u000a\u000aIn December, Francis personally brought together Santos and opposition leader, former President Alvaro Uribe, in an unprecedented three-way meeting at the Vatican.\u000a\u000aThe Pope publicly called on Colombia's leaders to push forward on the path to peace from Havana's Revolution Plaza during a visit to Cuba in 2015. "We do not have the right to allow ourselves yet another failure," he said.\u000a\u000aThe 52-year civil war in Colombia, the longest in Latin American history, has claimed 220,000 lives and displaced millions.\u000a\u000aFormer US Secretary of State John Kerry officially recognized Francis' role in helping to end the conflict.\u000a\u000a"I also must express my deep appreciation to Pope Francis for his moral leadership and the Vatican's good offices in the quest for peace in Colombia," Kerry said in 2015\u000a\u000aThough the focus is on peace, Vatican officials say the Pope's visit is about much more.\u000a\u000a"This trip is daring and important," Guzman Carriquiry, vice president of the Vatican's Commission for Latin America, said at a Vatican briefing Friday. "It is wrong to only focus on peace; the Pope sees this trip as part of a long process in fighting violence."\u000a\u000aCarriquiry pointed to some causes of the violence. "Over 50% of (the) Colombian population live in poverty; the drug trafficking culture poisons and creates corruption in the life of the country."\u000a\u000aDuring his visit, Francis will stay at the papal ambassador's residence in Bogota and take day trips to Villavicencio, Medellin and Cartagena.\u000a\u000aThe Pope will participate in a prayer meeting for national reconciliation Friday in Villavicencio with some 6,000 victims of violence, former fighters and militia.\u000a\u000aAt Mass on Friday, Francis will beatify two Colombian priests who were killed in violence.\u000a\u000aBishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo Monsalve of Arauca, was shot twice in the head by rebels in 1989 and the Rev. Pedro Ramirez Ramos, known as the "martyr of Armero," was killed in 1948.

aVMelbourne, Australia (CNN) Australia's High Court has ruled that a national postal vote on same-sex marriage will go ahead, after a challenge by marriage equality advocates failed.\u000a\u000aSame-sex marriage advocates had taken the government to court over the postal vote which they argued was both unnecessary and an illegal use of public funds.\u000a\u000aBut in decision Thursday, the High Court ruled the national survey could go ahead.\u000a\u000aBallot papers will be now be mailed out to households across Australia from September 12, beginning the two-month process.\u000a\u000aThe question will be, "Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?"\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the national vote on August 8, after another attempt to pass his preferred plebiscite failed in Australia's senate.\u000a\u000aUnlike the plebiscite, the postal vote is voluntary and doesn't require legislation to go ahead.\u000a\u000aIn response to the announcement the survey would go ahead, opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten tweeted, "Alright, let's win this."\u000a\u000aAustralian independent political Andrew Wilkie (center left) speaks to media Thursday after High Court knocks down his challenge to same-sex marriage vote.\u000a\u000a'Vote yes for love'\u000a\u000aWithin minutes of losing the vote, Anna Brown, director of the Human Rights Law Center legal advocacy group, was handing out leaflets encouraging a "yes" vote at Melbourne's Flagstaff station.\u000a\u000a"All Australians deserve the same opportunity for love, commitment and happiness. All people in Australia should be able to marry the person they love," Brown told journalists outside the court.\u000a\u000a"This plebiscite was completely and is completely unnecessary. LGBTI people didn't ask for this plebiscite but now the court has determined (it) will go ahead ...

"And I'll be encouraging others to be voting 'yes'," he said.\u000a\u000a"No" vote campaigners welcomed the decision, saying it would give Australians a chance to have their say on the issue.\u000a\u000a"We need to double our efforts to ensure every Australian understands the consequences of changing the Marriage Act," the Marriage Alliance wrote on their Facebook page after the decision.\u000a\u000aResult expected on November 15th\u000a\u000aAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, who will be running the survey, voters will have until November 7 to submit their forms.\u000a\u000aThe final result will be revealed on November 15th.\u000a\u000aThe postal vote will be voluntary, unlike all other voting in Australia which is mandatory, but will not be binding on politicians.\u000a\u000aHowever, Turnbull has promised to introduce legislation legalizing same-sex marriage if a majority of Australians vote "yes".\u000a\u000aAustralians have long been in favor of marriage equality, but multiple governments have maintained they wanted to keep the traditional definition in law.\u000a\u000aAn August 22 poll by Newspoll showed 63% of Australians supported same-sex marriage, while just 30% were against.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, under pressure from moderates in his party to take action, then-prime minister Tony Abbott announced there would be a national vote, or plebiscite, to decide whether marriage equality should be legislated.\u000a\u000aHe was unable to get funding to hold the plebiscite after legislation was blocked twice in the Australian senate.\u000a\u000aSo in August, Prime Minister Turnbull announced a national postal vote would be held instead over two months, run by the Australian Bureau of Statistics using funding already authorized under the Appropriations Act.\u000a\u000aArtist David Lee Pereira paints a pro-gay marriage mural on a wall at Melbourne Central on August 27.\u000a\u000aWhy same-sex marriage advocates are against vote\u000a\u000aMarriage equality campaigners said in advance of the court hearing if the verdict allowed the postal vote they would fight as hard as possible for a "yes" vote.\u000a\u000aBut advocates have been consistently against the idea of a national vote on the issue since it was first announced in 2015.\u000a\u000aThey have a number of complaints about the national vote, first of which being it is unnecessary given the parliament is able in theory to legalize same-sex marriage at any time.\u000a\u000a"We've always said the way this should be done (in Australia) is the way all issues pertaining to people's rights are dealt with, by parliament," Tiernan Brady, executive director at the Equality Campaign, told CNN.\u000a\u000aBut also, advocates are concerned about the damage a lengthy national campaign on marriage equality and the validity of LGBT relationships could do to gay and lesbian Australians.\u000a\u000a"This is a debate in the public sphere about (LGBT people's) worth in society, their value and that's a hard debate to be a part of," Brady said.

Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000a(CNN) "Climate change is the canvas on which the history of the 21st century will be painted."\u000a\u000aThat's Mark Lynas, writing in "Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet."\u000a\u000aIt's a true if disturbing prediction.\u000a\u000aBy some accounts, we've already entered the Anthropocene , an epoch defined by human degradation of the natural world. We're causing extinctions, changing the climate. Mother Nature is still powerful, sure. But, as Lynas explains, we humans are so fundamental a force that we are changing the way she works.\u000a\u000aI recently asked readers of my "2 degrees" newsletter ( sign up here ) to suggest "must-read" books on climate change -- and Lynas' important work of nonfiction was among your top recommendations. I've been reading it, and I recently interviewed the author. The book takes a degree-by-degree look at the future of our planet as it continues to warm. Two degrees of warming, which the international community is trying to avoid, and which is the focus of my climate change initiative at CNN, sounds bad. But, as Lynas told me, a world that's 6 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution, which is possible if we keep burning alarming amounts of fossil fuels and chopping down forests, sounds downright hellish.\u000a\u000aYou'll find Lynas' "Six Degrees" on a list of 12 climate change must-reads below. It includes a Pulitzer Prize winner, Elizabeth Kolbert's "The Sixth Extinction," as well as an illustrated account of an artist's dive into climate science, titled "Climate Changed."\u000a\u000aYou readers suggested all these, and I've included some of your comments about them.\u000a\u000aWe'll tackle "Six Degrees" first, since it's a great primer. I'll post an interview with Lynas on Thursday, and then we'll read his book together over the course of the month.\u000a\u000aHe's graciously agreed to take your questions in a few weeks.\u000a\u000aThink we missed something? Feel free to leave suggestions in the comments section below.\u000a\u000a1. "Six Degrees," by Mark Lynas\u000a\u000aChapter by chapter, Lynas explores what the world would look like if it warms 1 degree, 2 degrees, 3, degrees Celsius, etc. He's great at distilling the science and maintaining a sense of optimism amid some very gloomy predictions about the future. Suggested by Lance Olsen.\u000a\u000a2. "This Changes Everything," by Naomi Klein\u000a\u000a"Well researched, compelling arguments, hits home for multiple audiences, and is a realistic call to action." -- Laura S. Lynes, from Canmore, Alberta\u000a\u000a3. "The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight," by Thom Hartmann\u000a\u000a"It's all-encompassing -- it delves into the various feedback systems in a climate change context, and also the underlying cultural philosophy or stories we tell ourselves that continue to create the situation we're in. Fascinating stuff!" -- Trevor, from Los Angeles\u000a\u000a4. "The Age of Sustainable Development," by Jeffrey D. Sachs\u000a\u000a"Comprehensive and positive summary of the steps required for sustainable development with good overviews of the problems causing climate change." -- Dan Fowler, from Austin, Texas\u000a\u000a5. "Comfortably Unaware," by Richard A. Oppenlander\u000a\u000a"People don't realize the devastating impact that our food choices have on the planet. This book explains how animal agriculture is the single biggest cause of global warming." -- Wendy Horowitz, from New Haven, Connecticut\u000a\u000a6. "The Sixth Extinction," by Elizabeth Kolbert\u000a\u000a"An amazingly well written narrative on the effect our species has had on the planet. As our population continues to grow and our demand on our very limited resources escalates, the negative impact we have had and continue to have is well explained." -- Sharon Lynch, from Benicia, California\u000a\u000a7. "The End of the Long Summer," by Dianne Dumanoski\u000a\u000a"A really thoughtful, wise and balanced appraisal of fact that, going on past changes to the climate, we are likely to reach a sudden tipping point and experience huge climate changes over just a few years, BUT that humans are incredibly resilient and adaptable and rather than go extinct, will likely rise to the challenge.\u000a\u000a"This book gave me hope while presenting the facts." -- Persephone Maywald, from Australia\u000a\u000a8. "Climate Wars," by Gwynne Dyer\u000a\u000a"Waves of climate refugees. Dozens of failed states. All-out war. From one of the world's great geopolitical analysts comes a terrifying glimpse of the strategic realities of the near future, when climate change drives the world's powers towards the cut-throat politics of survival," the publisher's description says.\u000a\u000a9. "Merchants of Doubt," by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway\u000a\u000aHere's an endorsement from John Horgan, of Scientific American : "The book, which packages rigorous research in fiery rhetoric, inspired a documentary, 'Merchants of Doubt' ... I highly recommend the book and documentary, which reveal how disturbingly easy it can be for unscrupulous spin-meisters to dupe journalists and the public." The book was suggested by Aaron Thierry, a reader from Edinburgh, Scotland\u000a\u000a10. "Don't Even Think About It," by George Marshall\u000a\u000aA Twitter user -- @timreckmeyer -- suggested this one as part of a discussion on whether we at CNN should be leading climate change stories with images of sad polar bears on ice sheets. (He thinks we shouldn't. You can see from the gallery below that we still are, from time to time.) George Marshall, the book's author, explores how our brains shape (and warp) perceptions about climate change. I'm hoping this book will help me understand how to better explain this subject -- and will settle the polar bear debate.\u000a\u000a11. "Climate Changed," by Philippe Squarzoni\u000a\u000a"It's an amazing book. It's an illustrated nonfiction book (graphic novel format) that is built on Squarzoni's interviews with IPCC scientists. The science is well explained, but the power comes from watching Squarzoni absorb the information and struggle to fit it into his life, just like a reader, over the six years it took him to put the book together. So the intangible social aspect of climate, which is probably more important to solutions than climate science itself, is explored with candor." -- Richard Reiss, from New York\u000a\u000a12. "The Great Transition," by Lester Brown\u000a\u000a"Right away, book club or no, this book must be read: 'The Great Transition,' by Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute," a reader, Elizabeth McCommon, wrote in an e-mail.

aV(CNN) While President Donald Trump insisted Congress repeal Obamacare within his first 100 days , the legislation was rushed, according to his Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price, and that's why the Republicans failed.\u000a\u000aBut the recent setback will not deter the Trump administration, he said during an interview at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday with CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\u000a\u000aPrice runs a department with a budget of more than $1 trillion dollars and more than 80,000 employees who do work that he said touches on "the lives of every single American." The orthopedic surgeon -- the third doctor to hold the secretary position -- said he was visiting Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday to meet leaders at the CDC. He also gave a speech Wednesday about the country's growing opioid epidemic at the National RX Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit.\u000a\u000a"Recovery is possible for every single individual," Price said in addressing the summit attendees. "America is not giving up on this fight. Surrender simply is not an option. The stakes are too high and the value of every life is too precious."\u000a\u000aPrice is part of the executive opioid commission announced by President Trump last month. When asked about what was at the root of the crisis, Price pointed to a sense of despair in individuals and lack of connection to community. "It's a struggle now that is being met with these powerful, powerful agents that are destroying lives, destroying communities, all over, all across the land," Price told Gupta in a follow up interview Wednesday.\u000a\u000aBefore becoming secretary, Price represented Georgia's 6th district in Congress and he happened to be visiting on the day his seat was up for grabs in what was seen as a litmus test on the Trump presidency. Tuesday's unexpectedly close election unfolded in a district that has elected a Republican since 1979, including Newt Gingrich.\u000a\u000aThis week, it gave the most votes to a Democrat, newcomer John Ossoff, whose lawn signs urge people to "Vote your Ossoff." He'll be in a runoff in June against Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, who got the second highest number of votes.\u000a\u000aAsked about the election, Price declined to weigh in saying that he was "told by the legal beagles at the Department of Health and Human Services" that he has to "take that political hat off and put it in the corner" so that's what he says he's done.\u000a\u000aWhomever gets elected to Price's old seat will be one of the many leaders Price will have to court if he is going to successfully transform the American health care system he has spent a political career railing against, one he has characterized as "failing."\u000a\u000aFrom doctor to politician\u000a\u000aPrice's first public complaints in the 1990s came long before he was elected. He served on the Georgia State Medical Association, a group that advocates for medical professionals. Representing the association, he visited Rotary clubs and church groups all around Georgia talking about how the Bill Clinton administration had "started down a path that I felt, along with many others, was not the right path to head."\u000a\u000aPrice turned that message into a political career. He served four terms in the Georgia state Senate. There, he became the first Republican Majority Leader in the state's history, bringing what his hometown paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , called a "Newt Gingrich-style sense of Republican partisanship" to the state House.\u000a\u000aHe brought in tort reform that placed new limits on medical malpractice complaints, voted consistently against access to abortion, and repeatedly demonstrated his conservative values beyond medicine. He voted for a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage in 2006 and sponsored a bill to create a Confederate history month that didn't mention slavery. He voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Georgia flag, then voted against eliminating the remaining Confederate symbol from the flag, which Democrats questioned him about in his contentious confirmation hearing in January. (At the hearing, Price said the move "addressed all the concerns of the state and was adopted and supported by the state.")\u000a\u000aWhen Rep. Johnny Isakson decided to run for the Senate, vacating his 6th district seat, Price took his conservative politics and passion for reforming health care to the national stage, getting elected in 2005. In Congress, he continued to get a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee and a 0% rating from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, voting against federal coverage for abortion and against expanding research on embryonic stem cell lines.\u000a\u000aHe also introduced a comprehensive health care bill of his own, the Empowering Patients First Act of 2015, that expanded health savings accounts. It gave states grants to create pools of high-risk patients, rather than have expensive patients deemed "high risk" by insurance companies in the general insurance population. The legislation never made it into law. Price said this week he still likes the idea of high-risk pools\u000a\u000aResearch shows, though, they are limited in their ability to help give "insurance for everybody," as Trump said he wanted to do. A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation found prior to Obamacare, the states with high-risk pools offered coverage that was expensive, and only a small fraction of the people who needed the coverage actually got it.\u000a\u000aPrice told Gupta that while they did not work "terribly well" in the past, it's because they weren't funded to the "degree they should be" and the pools weren't big enough to be cost effective. Going forward, the administration's plan would need to address this issue, he said.\u000a\u000aA third-generation doctor, Price said he will work to transform the health care system to make it more "patient centered." The 62-year-old said he knows this kind of care is possible, since he witnessed those relationships first hand when he was a little boy, making housecalls with his grandfather.\u000a\u000a"The door flung open and they said, 'Dr. Price.' and gave him a big hug," Price remembered "And to me that's what the doctor-patient relationship was all about."\u000a\u000aIn contrast, at Resurgens Orthopaedics, which Price helped build into a nationwide practice, he said the system prevented those kinds of relationships.\u000a\u000a"I remember, almost to the day, the moment in my medical practice when I was back in my office working on some paperwork and I went out to see a patient, and I crossed, I went through that door, you know the door between the clinical side where you see patients and the back-office area, and it hit me that there were more people behind that door working on all the clerical stuff. Working, fighting with insurance companies, fighting with the government, fighting with this supplier, that supplier, to get the services and the apparatus needed to care for those people," Price said.\u000a\u000a"I said to myself then, at that very moment, 'There's something wrong with this picture.' When we have more people in the system who aren't providing clinical care, who aren't hands-on taking care of patients or having a responsibility to care for patients, then that's a system that again, may be working for other folks, but it's not working for the patients."\u000a\u000aMoving on after failure\u000a\u000aThe most recent Republican attempt to fix the healthcare system failed, Price said, because of the "compressed timeline for the sale of the bill." While his boss said, "nobody knew health care could be so complicated," Price seems to have understood and told Gupta that "the different systems that we have, don't make a whole lot of sense."\u000a\u000aHe vowed the administration will "keep our eye on the ball and make certain that we move in the direction of a system that is much more responsive to patients, again, those end users, the people and the patients across this land who need to be paid attention to," Price said.\u000a\u000aPrice suggested one way to fix the system will be to make sure the right resources go to the right initiatives.\u000a\u000aHe wants to cut redundancy and waste. And while he runs the federal agency that operates 11 divisions including the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, he thinks the states, rather than the federal government should get more power over your healthcare.\u000a\u000a"States are much more flexible, much more nimble to be able to create and modify a system that would work best for their constituents," he said.\u000a\u000aStates may have to pick up the slack since Trump's initial budget plan slashes billions from Price's departments, which have already seen shrinking budgets for years. For instance, a report from Trust for America's Health found that the CDC's core budget has decreased by more than $580 million since 2010. Still as the CDC budget fell, state public health spending remained relatively flat.\u000a\u000aMoney, though, is not the answer, Price repeatedly told Gupta. "For us to say,'OK, let's just throw more money at that system. Let's see if more money helps that out' is the wrong way," Price said.\u000a\u000aWhen pressed to give an example of a state that has improved healthcare with less money, Price did not give a direct answer.\u000a\u000aInstead he pointed to Indiana as a state that reformed its health care system under the guidance of the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services director Seema Verma.\u000a\u000aThe Healthy Indiana Plan did not do more with less; instead, it used the money it was given for Medicaid to create benefit packages for low-income adults that were modeled after high-deductible health plans. This created health savings accounts for the poor that required most to contribute some money toward their own health care, even if it was only a few dollars.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aPrice will continue to push for reform and is confident the Trump administration will leave Americans with a better health care system.\u000a\u000a"When we look back on this," Price said, "I believe, in 10 or 20 years, I think that we will say that we moved in the direction of a much more responsive, much more higher quality healthcare system for the American people, and I still believe that's what will occur."

aVBeverly Hills attorney Charles Harder helped wage Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel's legal crusade against Gawker. Now Harder is going after a Gawker affiliate.\u000a\u000aIn a lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York Supreme Court, a life coach named Greg Scherick claims that a "false and defamatory article" published last year by Jezebel continues to bring him "substantial reputational and economic harm."\u000a\u000aJezebel, the female-focused blog that was previously a part of the Gawker Media network and that now partly comprises Gizmodo Media Group, published a story in the spring of 2016 that called Scherick's therapy group, known as Superstar Machine, a "cult...that preys on its members' insecurities, exploits them financially, and isolates them from friends and family."\u000a\u000aAs laid out in the complaint, the story included accounts of former Superstar Machine members, suggesting that Scherick especially preyed on women in creative fields.\u000a\u000a"This case is nothing more than another obvious attempt by Charles Harder to intimidate journalists," a spokesperson for Gizmodo Media Group said in a statement provided to CNNMoney. "The story in question was published on May 10, 2016\u2014months before our acquisition of certain Gawker Media assets, including Jezebel. Any litigation over the story should have been brought against Gawker Media in bankruptcy court\u2014not against Gizmodo Media Group or the individual writers.

"We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people's perception.\u000a\u000aShe added: "Nothing about me changed. I'm still the same person that I am, and I've never defined myself by my relationship."\u000a\u000aMarkle spoke for the first time about her high-profile relationship in this month's Vanity Fair cover story.\u000a\u000aIn November, Prince Harry ended weeks of speculation and confirmed that they were in fact an item in a statement released by Kensington Palace.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 20th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Home to a cool 88 million people, the Yangtze River Delta is the most populated region on Earth. In the center of it all is Shanghai -- China's commercial capital and a must-visit destination\u000a\u000aShopping, ancient gardens, temples and dynamic architecture make it one of the most fascinating megacities. But that's not the only reason to go. Shanghai also happens to be an easy jump-off point for more rustic side trips.\u000a\u000aFrom the canals of Shaoxing to Hangzhou's famous West Lake, China's ancient "water towns" and lush tea plantations are just a 20- to 30-minute bullet train ride away. Here are five day trips you'll enjoy:\u000a\u000a1. Hangzhou\u000a\u000aBoating on West Lake in Hangzhou.\u000a\u000aA 45-minute bullet train ride from Shanghai (on a "D" or "G" train), Hangzhou has been praised by poets and explorers alike (including Marco Polo) as one of the most photogenic places in China.\u000a\u000aThe city revolves around West Lake, which is best explored by bike in the morning, when the byways are empty and willow tree-lined causeways are shrouded in ethereal mist. Around the lake, travelers will find dozens of ancient pagodas, gardens, carp ponds, half-moon bridges and temples -- not to mention easy treks through the hillsides.\u000a\u000aThe majority of hotels -- including a Four Seasons Hotel Hangzhou at West Lake and the historic Shangri-La Hotel, Hangzhou -- are along the western shores. Nearby, a cluster of gardens and islands were once part of Emperor Qianlong's holiday palace, back in the 19th century.\u000a\u000aBut the countryside is half the reason to go. Outside of town, travelers can explore the Dragon Well Tea Village for fresh air and Longjing green tea.\u000a\u000a2. Shaoxing\u000a\u000aA fan shop in Shaoxing.\u000a\u000aA 20-minute bullet train ride southeast of Hangzhou will drop travelers in Shaoxing, which -- perhaps optimistically -- has been dubbed the "Venice of Asia." A small city (by China's terms) of 5 million, Shaoxing is best known for its romantic canals and stone bridges.\u000a\u000aMore than 4,000 bridges connect the cityscape and a stroll along the cobbled pathways will take you past traditional white houses with slate-tiled roofs. Shaoxing is also famous for its literary history, once home to Chinese scholar Zhou Enlai and famous writer Lu Xun.\u000a\u000aMost of the action revolves around the eponymous Lu Xun Road pedestrian strip, where travelers can walk through Lu Xun's 19th-century residence.\u000a\u000aThe most charming hotel in Shaoxing is the Xianheng Hotel , which dates back to 1894 -- supposedly opened by the writer's uncle. Here you'll find beautiful lotus ponds, antique furniture and a restaurant serving traditional Shaoxing cuisine. And what exactly is that?\u000a\u000aTravelers will find stinky tofu, braised pork belly and Shaoxing wine (a Chinese rice wine) -- said to be made with special water from the nearby Jianhu-Mirror Lake and then buried underground to mature.\u000a\u000a3. Moganshan\u000a\u000aThe villa at Le Passage Moganshan.\u000a\u000aAbout a 30-minute drive northwest of Hangzhou, or 2.5 hours southwest of Shanghai, the small village of Moganshan is a refuge for nature lovers. Part of the beauty of Moganshan is there's not too much to do, aside from explore the bamboo forests and tea plantations.\u000a\u000aA typical day might include an easy bike ride through the hills, a tea tasting, a bit of lounging by the pool or a zip-line outing at Discovery Adventure Park . While it might feel completely untouched, Moganshan was actually a popular hill station during the 19th and 20th century.\u000a\u000aThis is where Shanghai's foreign expats and politicians (including Chairman Mao) came for cool mountain air during the city's steamy summers. The exclusive nature of Moganshan attracts elite jetsetters who gravitate towards eco-friendly retreats like Naked Stables and Le Passage Mohkan Shan\u000a\u000aOffering an ultra-posh experience, there's also La Residence -- a villa with 30-feet-tall ceilings and eclectic Scandinavian furniture that's been built into the tea hills above sister property Le Passage Mohkan Shan. Costing roughly $28,000 a night, the eight-bedroom villa might be part of the reason the area's been called "The Hamptons of China."\u000a\u000a4. Ningbo\u000a\u000aA view of Xuedou mountain, near Ningbo.\u000a\u000aAn easy drive from Shanghai across the Hangzhou Bay Bridge -- the world's longest trans-oceanic bridge -- Ningbo is a rapidly modernizing city with a long history. Not only is Ningbo home to one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, but it's also one of China's oldest cities.\u000a\u000aDating back to 4800 BCE, Ningbo was an important stop on the Silk Road. Beautifully preserved pagodas and towers can still be seen today, including the Tang Dynasty-era Tianfeng Tower.\u000a\u000aOne of the city's most scenic areas is the centrally located Moon Lake, where travelers will find the Tianyi Pavilion, an ancient library, temple and stunning Chinese pavilions.\u000a\u000aHistory is everywhere, from China's oldest wooden structure -- the Baoguo Temple in the north -- to the Tang Dynasty-era Qita Zen Buddhist Temple downtown.\u000a\u000aThe city has also drawn attention for its exciting architecture, such as the Ningbo History Museum . Designed by Pritzker Prize-winner Wang Shu -- of Amateur Architecture Studio -- the contemporary museum is made of concrete and bamboo, incorporating traditional tiling techniques and handmade bricks that pay homage to demolished houses in China.\u000a\u000a5. Suzhou\u000a\u000aA sightseeing boat sails on a canal in Suzhou.\u000a\u000aAbout a 20-minute train ride west of Shanghai, Suzhou is another beautiful canal city -- split north to south by the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal.\u000a\u000aNearly half of this 2,500-year-old town is covered in water, with rivers and canals dividing the streets into a checkerboard.\u000a\u000aThe romance continues in the cobbled streets and Chinese gardens, of which there are more than 60 scattered about the city. The main sights include the 12.85-acre Humble Administrator's Garden, a World Cultural Heritage site that dates back to 1509. A walk -- or bike ride -- here uncovers lotus pools, poetic temples, bamboo groves and elegant courtyards.\u000a\u000aCome evening, Pingjiang Lu is the best pedestrian street for a stroll past historic white houses and trendy new teahouses. Meanwhile, the Suzhou Silk Museum shows off the city's 4,000-year-old silk-weaving traditions. If you're looking for a souvenir -- this is the place.\u000a\u000aShould time allow, there are few other "water towns" nearby that are worth a visit, including

aVThe former president on climate change, curiosity, and what it means to be a leader\u000a\u000aThe office where I met Clinton high in the UN headquarters building belongs to another era. It is an institution built for a world of the past -- one based on Cold War rivalries and the last century's balance of power. It was Clinton's first day in the cramped space, and his entourage of bodyguards and assistants were stumbling over one another in the confines. The Secret Service men dispatched a young press aide to inquire why so many UN staffers were loitering near the elevators, though it was clear that they were simply trying to catch a glimpse of the ex-president.\u000a\u000a"Is this the office?" an exhausted Clinton asked after shaking my hand. I nodded, as did most of the swarm that followed him. The entire place felt as if it hadn't been touched since the early fifties when the building was raised, a lone skyscraper above an otherwise flat block on the East Side of Manhattan. I heard him chuckle to a staffer as he stepped inside, "You know what," -- 'wahut,' the final word came out -- "It kinda reminds me of Mad Men. Have you seen that show yet?"\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliam Jefferson Blythe III never met his father, a traveling salesman who died in a car accident three months before Bill was born. He took the name Clinton from his hard-drinking and abusive stepfather, Roger, who Bill, at fourteen, demanded never hit his mother again. He hid the abuse from most people in his life. As a junior at Georgetown University, though, he shuttled back and forth to Durham, North Carolina on weekends to make peace with his dying stepfather as he underwent cancer treatments. Clinton almost never drinks; he sleeps little and speaks without reprieve. On the day that we met, the topics of his endless seminar ranged from the evolution of the light bulb to early twentieth-century American film to the beauty of Columbia's Aburrá Valley and Medellín.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most interesting dimension of his character is the pace with which he lives. "He had said to everybody over and over and over again," Chelsea Clinton has said, "that none of the men in his family live past sixty, or much past." As a result, he has always moved at a rather reckless pace, trying to accomplish as much as possible before a short clock -- either real, imagined, or prophetically self-fulfilling -- ticks to a stop.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs members of my generation look around the world today, we see climate change on the rise and nothing in the way of a successor for the Kyoto Protocol, the proliferation of nuclear weapons still un abated, Millennium Development Goals we're still well short of, a hugely imbalanced global economy that will continue to undermine itself, and I wonder if you worry that you and this post-Cold War generation of leaders will be judged harshly by history?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNo. I think that's a cheap trick. I mean, all of this "the greatest generation is World War II?" -- it just happens that they're the most horrible parents in human history, right?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf all of us baby boomers were so bad, then our parents were terrible; they failed. And if we were so bad, how come our kids are so great? We were hellaciously good parents.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI think it's phony as a $3 bill. I think they had a chance to win World War II and it was clear. These are much more complex things [now]. We have no idea if the World War II generation would have made the decisions they should make on climate change if they thought doing so would bring an end to their economic prosperity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe real problem in climate change is that we're paying for our past success. The established order has too many self-protecting economic entities, and not enough people who yet understand what it takes to change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe World War II generation was thrown into a war by a madman, Hitler, and an expansionist empire in Japan, and we did what we had to do. Look, I admire the World War II generation; I'm just trying to make a point here. I don't think there are defective generations. There are times and struggles and they present different challenges.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI believe the United States will pass reasonably good climate change legislation, I believe we will get a successor that will be better than Kyoto, and I think that we're in a race against time and circumstance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis will be calamitous if we don't do something about it, and the population of the earth will drop hugely over the next 1,000 years, maybe over the next 200 years, if we don't do something about it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe're really in a race against time. I think history is a relay race and you just got to keep handing off and making things happen. I'm basically pretty optimistic.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhere the intersection of science and politics is on climate change, I'd leave to others. We might lose. Our minds may not be able to expand enough collectively to avert the worst.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI think most people are more literal and they learn things in a serial fashion. Most people have all they can do to keep body and soul together -- even before this economic collapse -- raise their kids, pay their taxes, worry about how to pay for college, deal with their mother's health, and everything.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt just takes time to change the mindset, but we're a much more communitarian country and a much more communitarian world than we were 20 years ago. I basically think you've got to get people's attitudes right, and then they have to have a general analysis that's right, and you have to organize for action. And you just have to stumble in the right direction. I'm pretty upbeat about it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen you're my age, I hope you're dealing with a different set of problems. There'll always be problems, but that's what I hope will happen\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Leopolus, a childhood friend of yours, used to joke with friends that if they were bored, they could always go and watch you read. Is that insatiable curiosity critical to being a good leader?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI think in order to do one or two big things, you have to know many little things. I think it's also important in a complex time with a lot of dynamism to be able to relate to all different kinds of people, because, in the end, most political power depends more on persuasion rather than coercion.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd then I think you have to be able to reconcile the complexities and order them in a pattern. For a lot of people who just follow the evening news or read the morning paper, it's like the political equivalent of chaos theory in physics.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut your job, if you're a leader, is to take superficially random events and organize them into patterns that tell you what you should do to maximize an opportunity or head off the problem.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBeing decisive in the face of complexity and ambiguity is important. Being able to make a call, to decide to act, and then figuring out how to act to support that decision. Yes, be curious; yes, appreciate the complexity and ambiguity; but then organize into patterns and decide what you're going to do and execute. I think that's extremely important.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYou know, Machiavelli said in the 15th century that change was hard because the people who would benefit from it were uncertain of their gain and the people who would lose were positive of their loss; that's pretty much the way it still is. And if you sign on to be a progressive change agent, you had to have a high threshold for pain and you keep throwing yourself under the bridge, but I believe you can really make a difference if you just make these efforts and get up and work at it every day. I left the White House more optimistic than I entered it, after all I went through, and I would wake up every day believing that you can make good things happen.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis post was adapted from Brian Till's new book, Conversations with Power: What Great Presidents and Prime Ministers Can Teach Us about Leadership. Well, I think that insatiable curiosity is important in a time dominated by complexity and dynamism, because you have so many things you need to understand. For the last 20 years, insatiable curiosity has been really important.I think in order to do one or two big things, you have to know many little things. I think it's also important in a complex time with a lot of dynamism to be able to relate to all different kinds of people, because, in the end, most political power depends more on persuasion rather than coercion.And then I think you have to be able to reconcile the complexities and order them in a pattern.

The Democratic presidential primary of 2008 muddled the esteem that had ballooned during eight years of gaffes and incompetence by his successor in the Oval Office. During that span, Clinton largely redefined the post- presidential years; he circled the globe as a nimble, intrepid freelancer, leveraging charisma and a seemingly limitless Rolodex for both the broader good and personal gain."Clinton is a nonprofit conglomerate," says one former advisor and long-time friend. It's not an in- accurate characterization. His work fittingly mirrors the rise of social networking and the Internet, a two-point-zero version of previous post-presidential benevolence.Among his most important accomplishments is his success drastically reducing the cost of life-saving anti-retro viral treatment for AIDS victims around the world. The latest round of deals with pharmaceutical companies -- on the heels of others that have helped two million people access treatment -- drops the cost of second-line regiments, for those whose illnesses have overcome first line drugs, by 60 percent. Commitments to charitable work made each year by individuals and corporations attending the Clinton Global Initiative conference reach into the billions of dollars. He launched a ten-year $100 million campaign against extreme poverty in Rwanda and Malawi and, in 2005, raised over a $120 million following Hurricane Katrina with George H. W. Bush.As president, his achievements were matched by equally notable shortfalls. He presided over a massive expansion of economic growth, generating surpluses of $122 billion and $230 billion during his last two years in office; he waged a successful campaign to stem genocide in Kosovo, and greatly expanded free trade and global commerce. But his failure to intervene in Rwanda, where some 800,000 were massacred, or to move effectively to stop genocide in Bosnia, or to advance middle east peace, marked high-profile failures. Domestically, he was unable to pass comprehensive health care reform and ambitious campaign finance reforms. He signed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, which had raised a wall between the speculative trading and underwriting of investment banks and the more traditional lending of commercial, depository banks. The law had been in place since the 1930s. Its elimination helped inflate the massive bubble that burst in the 2007 financial collapse, and meant commercial institutions, like Bank of America and Citibank, were allowed to assume massive risk in the form of housing market credit derivatives. They, of course, had to be bailed out to protect the broader economy. "I think they were wrong," he told ABC in April 2010, referring to his economics advisors, "and I think I was wrong to take [their advice]." The Monica Lewinsky scandal and a myriad of other sex-related allegations forever scarred his legacy and remains the first thought for many when his name is invoked.But for most of those who've had the chance to interact with Clinton, his warmth and intelligence overpower the more lurid details that special prosecutor Ken Starr seared into the American conscience. Clinton is surprisingly tender in person, a gentle handshake matches the soft white hair and the unmistakable bulb nose.He has been called the Michael Jordan of politics, an apt comparison in terms of both talent and intensity. Stan Greenberg, who worked as a consultant for both of Clinton's bids for the White House, recalled Clinton's rage at a Ross Perot attack in the closing days of the 1992 campaign: "They are attacking my character and we must attack Perot's character." He went on, speaking over the phone with aides after a long day of campaigning, "We need to take a meat axe to his brain, cut his head open." He demanded a response that was "red meat and passion, no more pussy ads."

aV(CNN) Last year, Kraig Moss sold the equipment for his construction business in upstate New York and stopped making mortgage payments so he could follow Donald Trump on the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aThe amateur country crooner sang pro-Trump ditties while strumming a guitar emblazoned with Trump campaign stickers, earning him the moniker "Trump Troubadour."\u000a\u000aBut now, Moss refuses to play the guitar with the Trump decorations. He's soured on the President because of the newly proposed Republican health care bill.\u000a\u000aThat legislation, which the president supports, could result in dramatic cuts in addiction treatment services.\u000a\u000aThree years ago, Moss found his son, Rob, dead in his bed from a heroin overdose. He was 24.\u000a\u000a"The bill is an absolute betrayal of what Trump represented on the campaign trail," he said. "I feel betrayed."\u000a\u000aMoss feels it personally.\u000a\u000aLast year, at a campaign rally in Iowa, Trump reached out and spoke directly to Moss about Rob's death.\u000a\u000a"In all fairness to your son, it's a tough thing. Some very, very strong people have not been able to get off (heroin)," Trump called out to Moss in the crowd. "The biggest thing we can do in honor of your son ... we have to be able to stop it."\u000a\u000aWhen Moss became emotional, Trump comforted him.\u000a\u000a"I know what you went through. And he's a great father. I can see it. And your son is proud of you. Your son is proud of you," Trump said. "I'll bet he was a great boy."\u000a\u000aKraig Moss, a supporter of Donald Trump during the campaign, sings a song outside a truck with a Trump painting last year in Iowa. Now, he regrets doing so.\u000a\u000aSeveral times on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to increase services for people facing addiction.\u000a\u000a"We will help all of those people so seriously addicted. We'll get them assistance," he told the crowd at a campaign event in New Hampshire in October.\u000a\u000aMoss trusted Trump.\u000a\u000a"I truly believe from the heart that (Trump) is going to do everything he can. He's going to create treatment centers for the kids," he said last year.\u000a\u000aBut last week, Moss read about the proposed American Health Care Act.

aVHong Kong (CNN) Terence Tam's dad fled to Hong Kong from China during the political chaos of the Cultural Revolution to make a better life for himself and his family.\u000a\u000aThen a British colony, the city became home to a huge number of refugees fleeing Communism in the 1960s and 1970s.\u000a\u000aNow 39, Tam says he's ready to make another escape, 20 years after the UK handed sovereignty over the city to China.\u000a\u000aWhile Hong Kong is one of the most affluent cities in the world, he says it's now in the throes of its own political upheaval.\u000a\u000a"I want to see if I can do the same for my family (as my father did for us)," he says. "I'm not satisfied with the situation in Hong Kong. The political situation, the government. We have so many complaints."\u000a\u000aHong Kong: How the city has changed since 1997\u000a\u000aHong Kong: How the city has changed since 1997 03:14\u000a\u000aHong Kong: How the city has changed since 1997\u000a\u000a'I feel like we are refugees'\u000a\u000aBy most yardsticks, Tam's done well for himself. He's an assistant IT manager at one of Hong Kong's universities and owns an apartment -- no mean feat in a city that has the world's most unaffordable property prices.\u000a\u000aBut Tam objects to China's growing grip on the city.\u000a\u000aUnder the principle of "one country, two systems," Hong Kong was supposed to have preserved the rule of law, freedom of speech and the right to protest as enjoyed under the British -- at least until 2047 -- but Tam, and others, feel that China hasn't held up its part of the bargain.\u000a\u000a"Some people say that we are emigrating but I feel like we are refugees escaping from Hong Kong," he says.\u000a\u000aIn two years, once his newborn daughter is ready for kindergarten, Tam plans to uproot his family and move to Taiwan.\u000a\u000aTerence Tam and his wife on vacation in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.\u000a\u000aHis wife has already secured citizenship there through an investment visa scheme and Tam plans to cash out his Hong Kong pension pot and start a business selling Hong Kong snacks.\u000a\u000aTam is one of a growing number of people in the city looking for an exit. According to an opinion poll conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong last year, two in five Hong Kongers want to live overseas -- up from one in five in 2014 -- although only 10% of those who said they wanted to leave had put such a plan into action.\u000a\u000aWhat's changed?\u000a\u000aIt's not the first time that political upheaval has had Hong Kongers scouting for boltholes.\u000a\u000aFrom 1989, in the wake of the Tiananmen massacre, almost 60,000 people left the city every year, primarily for Canada, the United States and Australia, according to one academic study.\u000a\u000aHowever, many came back as the nightmare scenarios some had imagined didn't emerge and Beijing largely left the city alone during the first 15 years of Chinese rule.\u000a\u000aBut in 2014, Beijing denied Hong Kongers the universal suffrage promised to the city under its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, triggering massive streets protests that paralyzed much of the city for more than two months.\u000a\u000aPolice fire tear gas upon pro-democracy demonstrators near the Hong Kong government headquarters on September 28, 2014.\u000a\u000aSince then, fears have grown that Beijing neither cares about, nor pays heed, to the city's supposed autonomy.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, five men involved in publishing gossipy books on China's ruling elite -- two of whom had European passports -- disappeared only to reappear in Chinese custody weeks later.\u000a\u000aChina has also moved to bar pro-democracy lawmakers from taking office, using a rarely invoked power.\u000a\u000aThis erosion of the city's autonomy has led to calls for Hong Kong's independence from a small but persistently vocal group.\u000a\u000aMany fear that Hong Kong's new leader Carrie Lam , who was selected by a 1,200-strong committee and takes office July 1, will now enact a controversial security law, known as Article 23 , that would "prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against China."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Next Hong Kong leader on missing bookseller Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Next Hong Kong leader on missing bookseller 03:51\u000a\u000aLooking to Taiwan\u000a\u000aAndrew Lo, an immigration consultant at Amlex in Hong Kong, said his company has seen an upturn in business since the 2014 Occupy protests -- largely down to the deteriorating political situation, though he says the city's pressure cooker school system and cramped high-rise living conditions also play a role.\u000a\u000a"The main reasons why people leave Hong Kong is because of political instability -- the future is uncertain -- and poor education in Hong Kong," he says.\u000a\u000aSchooling starts young in Hong Kong and there's lots of pressure to make the grade.\u000a\u000aTaiwan, and southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Thailand, have emerged as popular destinations -- particularly for younger couples and retirees, says Lo. It's also now much harder to emigrate to places like Australia and Canada than it was in the 1990s.\u000a\u000aTam says he chose Taiwan because it's a place he fell in love with on vacation and it has the same cultural roots as Hong Kong.\u000a\u000aHe knows that life won't be easy. Tam's native language is Cantonese and says he speaks Mandarin, the language most Taiwanese use, haltingly. Jobs are also lower paid on average in Taiwan than in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000a"I love the culture in Taiwan. I've been to the UK to study for one year. When I landed there, the first step, I felt like I didn't belong. But when I went to Taiwan I felt different," Tam says.\u000a\u000aSupporters shout during Tsai Ing-wen's speech on her presidential election victory on January 16, 2016 in Taipei, Taiwan.\u000a\u000aIt's also the world's only Chinese-speaking democracy -- an important drawcard.\u000a\u000aAccording to official figures, the number of Taiwan permanent residents hailing from Hong Kong has more than doubled since 2014 -- though the absolute number is still very small at 1,086.\u000a\u000aTaiwan, however, is not without its own political issues and complexities . Despite Taiwan governing its own affairs for more than six decades, China views the island as part of its territory , to be taken by force if necessary.\u000a\u000aThe two -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China -- split in 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a civil war.\u000a\u000a"I have a stable job, income and property, but I find the environment here very uncomfortable," Tam says. "We were born before 1997. Our birth certificates, our passports were issued by the UK. After 1997 we didn't immediately see any changes but we do now."\u000a\u000aOn July 1, thousands are expected to brave the city's sultry summer humidity to mark the 20th anniversary of the handover by marching through Hong Kong's streets to demand greater democracy. The annual event has taken on extra significance this year with Chinese President Xi Jinping visiting the city for the very first time.\u000a\u000aTam has joined the protest in the past but won't this year -- he sees it as a futile act: "I have a choice, I can leave. It's time to get out."

aVTaesung village, South Korea (CNN) A triumphant anthem blares across the rice fields that surround this village, singing the praises of a regime most of the world abhors.\u000a\u000aThe 24/7 propaganda is so loud the houses need extra thick walls for insulation.\u000a\u000aThis is the noisy reality for the residents of Taesung, a small village on North Korea's doorstep.\u000a\u000aAlso known as "Freedom Village," it's the only South Korean settlement in the 160-mile long and 2.5 mile-wide demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea.\u000a\u000aAt its closest, it's just over 500 yards from the North, giving it a ringside seat to the heightened military tensions, which flared last month after North Korea threatened to send four missiles close to the US territory of Guam and intensified this week after North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test.\u000a\u000aCho Young-sook, who runs the village restaurant, is one of just 197 South Koreans living in Taesung. She moved here 38 years ago when she married a local man -- the only way anyone is allowed to move into this unusual and tight-knit community.\u000a\u000aShe describes a village on edge.\u000a\u000a"We... see this situation as quite negative. We lock our doors at night now which we didn't before," she said when CNN visited the village in August.\u000a\u000aPropaganda war\u000a\u000aThe propaganda war between the two Koreas isn't subtle. In addition to the broadcasts from the North, over the years each side has been engaged in a tat-for-tat over the size of their respective flagpoles. North Korea is currently in the lead with a pole of 165 meters -- one of the world's largest.\u000a\u000aThere is a village in the North Korean side of the DMZ, Kijong, where the flag pole is located. Residents say they sometimes see people moving about -- but they can't tell whether they are civilians or soldiers. South Korea also broadcasts its own propaganda toward the North -- but not from this village and not as loud.\u000a\u000aTaesung is a rice farming community and has been for generations, but since 1953, when the peninsula was split in two in the aftermath of the Korean War, residents have lived with a threat that colors every facet of their life.\u000a\u000aFarmers need a South Korean military escort every time their go to their fields -- one step too far and they could stumble into the North. A stream between rice paddies is all that marks the actual border.\u000a\u000aResidents must abide by a midnight curfew and are subject to checks by armed soldiers in their home every night. They must also go through checkpoints when they go in and out of the village -- a bus comes twice a day.\u000a\u000aThese aren't idle precautions -- there have been two abductions of Taesung residents by North Korean soldiers. In 1997, a mother and son were taken by soldiers while picking acorns and released five days later and in 1975 a 20-year-old farm worker was abducted. North Korea claims he voluntarily crossed the border and has yet to return him.\u000a\u000aIn exchange for the risks, residents, who must live there 240 days each year, do enjoy benefits. As the village is under the control of the United Nations Command, not the South Korean government, villagers don't need to pay tax and are exempt from compulsory military service.\u000a\u000aIn Taesung, also known as Freedom Village, houses are built with extra thick walls because of the incessant propaganda.\u000a\u000aFew residents want to talk on camera, some don't want to talk at all. There's concern that anything they do or say will be misread by North Korea, bringing them unwelcome attention.\u000a\u000a"We just gather and listen to the television since there is so much news regarding this, we just feel a bit unsettled at the moment," says Cho.\u000a\u000aOutside Cho's restaurant is a static reminder of the risks residents face: A bomb shelter that is permanently stocked with gas masks and emergency supplies. Residents conduct regular evacuation drills.\u000a\u000aHowever, Cho says she would never consider leaving Taesung.\u000a\u000a"Unlike other villages, there are young people here as well, there's a sense of community, that's why I like this place... I'm doing very well here."\u000a\u000aThe village has a well-resourced village school attracts students from outside the DMZ.\u000a\u000a'Dream Making Zone'\u000a\u000aThe village boasts a school to be proud of.\u000a\u000aTwelve teachers for 35 students, class iPads, better facilities than the average South Korean elementary school or kindergarten. The letters DMZ are pinned on the wall but here they stand for "Dream Making Zone."\u000a\u000aThe young students we see in their art class appear far more concerned with making felt bags than their next door neighbor. We ask them if they feel scared living so close to North Korea. One says yes, another says no.\u000a\u000aJin Young-jin, the principal of the school, says teachers no longer describe North Koreans as evil.\u000a\u000a"We rather stress the importance of the two Koreas' unification," Jin said. "Many children here do hope South and North Korea will be reunified in the near future."\u000a\u000aBy necessity, the kids have a remarkable understanding of one of the world's most prescient dangers but it doesn't appear to have affected their hopes or ambitions.\u000a\u000aA poster hanging on the school wall shows what the children want to be when they grow up.\u000a\u000aTheir top choice? A baseball player, closely followed by football player, nurse, engineer and for just one child among dozens their dream job is to become a soldier.

aVNathan A. Thompson is president of the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia. For more information, please see www.nathanathompson.co.uk . The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Journalists in Cambodia are under siege. Scared of losing next year's general election, the ruling Cambodian People's Party has recently launched a series of attacks on anyone it deems a threat to its power.\u000a\u000aAfter losing ground to the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party in June's local elections, it is paranoid that the tide of public opinion is turning against it.\u000a\u000aIn response to this crackdown, the US Embassy asked recently on its Facebook page , "Is #Cambodia Committed To Democracy?" Judging from repeated attacks on both nongovernmental organizations and newspapers, it appears the answer to the embassy's post is a hard no.\u000a\u000aThe Cambodia Daily -- an English-language newspaper founded by American journalist Bernard Krisher in 1993 -- was slapped with a $6.3 million tax bill on August 4 and given 30 days to pay. Unable to comply, it looks set to collapse.\u000a\u000aThe bill was calculated by the tax department without any audit of the paper's books, Jodie DeJonge, Cambodia Daily editor-in-chief, told me. The tax office has offered no opportunity to appeal or negotiate.\u000a\u000aHun Sen, who has been Prime Minister of Cambodia for 32 years, denied the move was politically motivated. If Cambodians go abroad and do not fulfill their obligations to their host state, they would face the same action, he said, quoted by Fresh News -- a media outlet branded "a bludgeon for the ruling party" by The Phnom Penh Post, another English daily.\u000a\u000aSen then called the Cambodia Daily a "thief" and said to pay up or leave. A restrained speech for a man who earlier this year told opposition figure Sam Rainsy to "prepare your coffin."\u000a\u000aBlows continued to come from all directions. Radio Free Asia, Voice of Democracy and Voice of America fell silent as their host networks were ordered to stop broadcasting "outside programs without requesting authorization."\u000a\u000aThese radio stations have long been a target of the ruling Cambodian People's Party because they broadcast programs critical of the government in the local Khmer language. It seems keeping information away from the people is a tactic in the run-up to the 2018 elections.\u000a\u000aNow that $500 million in Chinese loans dwarfs America's $35 million in aid contributions to Cambodia, the Cambodian government has been emboldened to take down pro-democracy organizations it used to tolerate for the sake of relations with the United States. Last week, the National Democratic Institute, a US-funded nongovernmental organization, was told to close and foreign staff were given seven days to leave for not registering with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation or the tax office.\u000a\u000aLeaks detailing assistance given by the institute to the opposition party appeared in Fresh News. Ministers accused it of colluding with the Cambodia National Rescue Party.\u000a\u000aCambodian People's Party spokesman Sok Eysan said the National Democratic Institute was not "neutral and independent" and had not complied with local laws. However, the institute said in statement that it attempted to fulfill its legal obligations in September 2016 but had been ignored.\u000a\u000aHowever, allegations that the institute and its parent organization, the National Endowment for Democracy, have a secret agenda are not baseless. They have been around since the foundation took over pro-democracy duties from the CIA in 1983.\u000a\u000a"I've heard rumors for years that the institutes might be recipients of CIA funds," said political scientist Karen Paget, author of "Patriotic Betrayal: The Inside Story of the CIA's Secret Campaign to Enroll American Students in the Crusade Against Communism." "They ought to be held more accountable even if their activities appear to be aboveboard."\u000a\u000aJane Riley Jacobsen, senior director of public affairs at NED, strongly rebuts that claim: "Speculation that the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) or NDI have a 'secret agenda' in Cambodia is wrong and baseless. NED has never had a relationship, financial or otherwise, with US Intelligence agencies, and to report rumors of this is irresponsible. Far from pursuing a covert agenda, NED is very transparent about its work and descriptions of all grants are listed on our website . NED supported its first project in Cambodia in 1989, with a grant to the Cambodian Documentation Center, which did critical work documenting the genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge. More recently, NED has maintained a very limited grants program in Cambodia addressing issues of corruption and accountability, the development of business organizations, encouraging good governance, protecting labor rights and encouraging civic engagement by young leaders. "\u000a\u000aCurrent funders of the National Democratic Institute include both the UK and Australian governments and Lockhead Martin, the arms manufacturer, according to its 2005 annual report -- the only one available on its website.\u000a\u000aHowever, the institute's critics in Cambodia have offered zero evidence that the organization is doing anything more than promoting democracy in a bipartisan manner to all parties. Unless you regard promoting democracy itself as a threatening activity.\u000a\u000aAs the US Embassy pointed out in a statement , the National Democratic Institute offered the same training to the ruling party as it did to the opposition party.\u000a\u000a"This is just the latest action in the government's campaign to silence proponents of democracy, harass civil society and restrict the media," said Sen. John McCain in an August 24 statement . Even if there were compliance issues, the government has at best handled them in a churlish and unprofessional manner -- you don't just order an organization to close without due process.\u000a\u000aIt's the same for the Cambodia Daily tax issue. What if it were a garment factory that had been remiss in paying tax?\u000a\u000aThe garment industry is a key revenue stream for the developing nation and reportedly accounts for 80% of exports . The last thing the government would do is shut down a decent factory; it would negotiate a way to recoup the losses.\u000a\u000aThe Cambodia Daily has offered to open its books to the tax department but has been ignored, according to DeJonge. Hardly the hallmarks of a typical tax dispute.\u000a\u000aFinally, Yat Run, owner of Lucky Lucky Motorcycles Shop in Phnom Penh, which also handles visa renewals, told local media that the immigration office ordered him to make sure all foreigners had proof of employment before issuing visas. In Cambodia, no work permits have been needed for visas up until now.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aCambodian visa laws are overdue for an overhaul, but given the current climate, journalists and foreign NGO workers are worried that their applications will now be considered by a hostile government. Many are married and have families here, some with local partners.\u000a\u000aThe changes make it easy for the government to deny visas to free-lance journalists and correspondents who displease them. There has been no statement from the government on the changes, which only adds to a growing atmosphere of menace that many expect to thicken as the 2018 general elections draw closer.\u000a\u000aThis story has been updated to include the comments of the National Endowment for Democracy.

aV(CNN) Ask any parent about the top challenges of raising kids, and getting them to eat healthy would probably be high on the list. Countless parents have kids who just want to eat chicken nuggets, or pasta, or macaroni and cheese, or all of the above, and definitely without any vegetables.\u000a\u000aIt's a problem throughout the year, but at back-to-school time, it gets maybe a tad more stressful, as parents are looking to start over or at least give their kids lunches that pack a healthy punch and won't get traded away for Oreos or some other sugary snack.\u000a\u000aSo what's a parent to do? First, don't stress -- we reached out to parents across the country, including a few experts on healthy eating for kids, and they had a ton of great advice. We've boiled down their insights into 11 great tips that are sure to make healthy eating in your household a little less complicated, beginning with what not to do:\u000a\u000a1. Do nots? There are many\u000a\u000aDon't let your kids get hooked on sugar, says Agatha Achindu, a mother of three who founded Yummy Spoonfuls Organic Baby Food in 2006. "Sugar is in just about all packaged food these days, in one form or another," said Achindu, who grew up on a farm in Cameroon, West Africa. Banish soda and other sugary drinks from the household, read the labels and don't buy anything with added sugar, she says.\u000a\u000aYou might not be able to control everything your child eats, especially when your kids are not at home, but you can give them a good healthy foundation. She suggests not bringing junk food into the house: "If it's not there, they won't eat it." Don't plead or threaten or bribe your child to eat healthy food, she says, because those tactics are not effective. And don't judge your child's tastes by your own. "You may not like broccoli, but your child is not you. He/she may love foods that you don't care for," Achindu said.\u000a\u000a2. Make food interesting\u000a\u000aLori Day, an educational psychologist and consultant, says her mom always told her that she was a terrible eater and that it would be karma if her daughter also didn't like to eat well. But that's not what happened. When her now-grown daughter was young, Day thought that if she found food interesting, she'd be more likely to try it. So Day let her daughter shell peas, count them, sort them by size and play with them before putting them in the pot. She loved eating them raw or cooked, Day said.\u000a\u000aSame with mussels marinara, which became one of her daughter's favorite foods. She enjoyed inspecting the mussels and looking for the potentially dead ones to throw away, learning about their biology and pulling the cooked shells all the way apart and picking out the meat.\u000a\u000a"My main tip is to make food interesting if your child is naturally curious, enjoys science/nature and is willing to engage," Day said.\u000a\u000a3. Get the kids involved\u000a\u000aSeveral parents talked about how bringing their children with them to the farmers market or the grocery store and having them help with the cooking can get them more excited and invested in what they are eating. "Kids can be inspired to eat healthy when they are part of the meal and snack planning process," said Margaret McSweeney, host of the podcast Kitchen Chat, on which she has interviewed about 200 chefs, cookbook authors and food industry experts. "A trip to the local farmers market or produce aisle can be an adventure and connect them with the source of food."\u000a\u000aMonica Sakala, a mother of two who runs the social media consulting business SOMA Strategies , said she continues to be amazed by the power that growing their own vegetables has had on encouraging healthy eating in her kids. This is their third summer with a vegetable garden.\u000a\u000a"They delight in going out back, getting dirty and picking the veggies. I watch them eat them raw," she said. "They seem to delight in what they've grown, and there's never a battle."\u000a\u000a4. Give kids choices\u000a\u000aAva Parnass, an infant-child psychotherapist and author of "Hungry Feelings Not Hungry Tummy," said that from a young age, parents should let their kids choose foods, fruits, vegetables and snacks they like, within reason.\u000a\u000a"Give them more room to choose as they get older," she added. And never get into a power struggle with your kids about eating, food or even healthy food, she said. "Make sure you are not overcontrolling, overeducating or over-lecturing them, or they will rebel in the food arena."\u000a\u000a5. Get creative\u000a\u000aRachel Matos, a social media marketing strategist, says her teenage son would live on chicken wings and Pop-Tarts if she let him. He has always been picky about eating his greens but loves his juices, she said. "Instead of arguing every night at dinner, I got a juicer ... and started making him natural fruit juices and smoothies but gradually started adding in kale, spinach and other greens."\u000a\u000aHe noticed the change in color but continued to enjoy the taste, so as time went on, she added more and more greens. Now, he can drink a kale or spinach drink with no issue. "The juices helped him develop taste for veggies. He also notices how much better he feels when he drinks them consistently," she said.\u000a\u000aMcSweeney, the podcast host, has another idea, this one for younger kids: Present healthy food in a creative way, such as hosting a purple night. "Everyone dresses in purple for a purple meal. Menu items could include purple peppers, purple cauliflower, purple potatoes, grapes and/or eggplant," she said. "Savor the day!"\u000a\u000a6. Model healthy eating\u000a\u000aOur kids watch everything we do, so it should be no surprise that they can be influenced to make better choices if they watch us doing the same. Pam Moore says her kids, ages 3 and 5, always see her and husband eating healthy. "Both my husband and I typically add greens to our eggs (spinach, kale, Swiss chard, whatever is around) at breakfast. I always add greens to my smoothies. I often keep sliced veggies (bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers) washed, sliced and ready to eat for snacks," said Moore, founder of the blog Whatevs.\u000a\u000aAdded Parnass, the author and psychotherapist, "Our children will ask for bites as time goes on, as they like to copy what we do, not what we say."\u000a\u000a7. Forget about making your kids clear their plates\u000a\u000aCherylyn Harley LeBon , a lawyer, strategist and mother of two, says that as a child who was the last person sitting at her table many nights, she is not a fan of making kids stay at the table until they are finished with their meal. "If they do not want to finish their vegetables or meal, they are welcome to leave the table, but there is nothing else to eat," she said.\u000a\u000aMoore, of the Whatevs blog, said she and her husband never force their kids to eat anything and are not in a habit of fixing them a separate dinner. "If they refuse to eat the meal, we tell them that's OK, but that's all there is, and they can eat again at breakfast," she said. "If they want a second helping of, say, steak, and they have not finished whatever veggies are on their plate, we tell them they have to finish what's there before they can have more of something else."\u000a\u000a8. Words matter\u000a\u000aJohn Furjanic, a single father of one, said his daughter is the second-smallest child in her elementary school class -- she's about to begin fifth grade -- and is acutely aware of the size difference between her and her classmates. Recently, she surprised Furjanic by repeating one of his mantras, which is "Protein builds muscles."\u000a\u000a"I flex my muscles when I say it, and she rolls her eyes, but apparently she has been listening," said Furjanic, who works as a financial adviser. "I'm ecstatic that she is asking me to make chicken, steak and eggs."\u000a\u000a9. Get colorful\u000a\u000aKathy Beymer, founder of the craft site Merriment Design , said that her mom taught her when she was growing up that she should eat a bunch of colors on her plate, so she has passed that on to her kids. "We talk about food colors and how it's healthiest to make meals that have a variety of colors, a little red, a little green, some orange, a bit of yellow," said Beymer, a mom of two. "If everything on the plate is beige, then they know that's not a healthy meal and that they need to add some brighter colors."\u000a\u000a10. Consider "litterless lunches"\u000a\u000aJulie Cole, a mother of six and co-founder of the personalized labeling company Mabel's Labels, says that packing "litterless lunches" will mean you are not sending in "pre-packaged snacks that are often loaded with salt or sugar." It will encourage you to pack more fresh fruit and fresh veggies, she said. "Healthy snacks and good for the environment? Sign me up."\u000a\u000a11. Experiment\u000a\u000aJennifer Bosse, a mother of two boys ages 4 and 6, analyzed the family diet a few years ago and realized there were some "obvious tweaks" they could make to ensure healthier eating. She realized they were consuming a lot of bread at each meal, and pasta was on the weekly lunch and dinner rotation. So, she did some research and started trying new things.\u000a\u000aInstead of pasta noodles for spaghetti, she switched to spaghetti squash. When she makes baked goods like muffins, she uses alternative flours like coconut and almond. Instead of oil, she uses unsweetened applesauce.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I've made some dishes that my boys absolutely loved and others that weren't as successful," said Bosse , who has contributed to the Huffington Post, Scary Mommy and Mamalode. "It's an ongoing process. ... Some days, I hit a home run. Other days, I have to pull out the chicken nuggets. As with everything else in life, moderation is key."\u000a\u000aCorrection: A previous version of this story misspelled Julie Cole's name.

aVGeorge Takei is an actor and activist. His Broadway show "Allegiance" screens across cinemas in the United States on the Day of Remembrance, February 19. Follow him on Twitter @GeorgeTakei. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.\u000a\u000aI remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.\u000a\u000aThat was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion. On its face, the order was "neutral," authorizing the military to designate whole swaths of land as military zones, and evacuate any persons from it as they saw fit.\u000a\u000aBut behind that facade lay a much darker purpose: to tear 120,000 innocent Japanese-Americans from their homes along the West Coast and relocate them to 10 prison camps scattered throughout the United States.\u000a\u000aIt didn't matter, back then , that most of us were US citizens and had never even been to Japan. We were presumed guilty, and held without charge for four years, simply because we happened to look like the people who had bombed Pearl Harbor. For that crime, we lost our homes, our livelihoods and our freedoms.\u000a\u000aEvery year, on February 19, we Japanese-Americans honor this day as Remembrance Day, and we renew our pledge to make sure what happened to us never happens again in America. I am always amazed, and saddened, that despite our decadeslong efforts, so many young people today are not even aware that such a tragedy and miscarriage of justice took place here.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Portraits from 'a great injustice' In 1943, legendary photographer Ansel Adams took portraits of Japanese-Americans interned at Manzanar Relocation Camp in California. "The purpose of my work was to show how these people, suffering under a great injustice, and loss of property, businesses and professions, had overcome the sense of defeat and despair by building for themselves a vital community in an arid (but magnificent) environment," Adams stated in a letter written when he offered the collection of images to the Library of Congress.

Instead, he suggested that it was a tough call, and that he "would have had to be there" in order to know whether it was the wrong one.\u000a\u000aI cannot help but hear in these words terrible echoes from the past. The internment happened because of three things: fear, prejudice and a failure of political leadership. When the administration targets groups today, whether for exclusion from travel here on the basis of religion and national origin, or for deportation based on their undocumented status, I know from personal experience that these are not done, as they claim, truly in the name of national security.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Reflecting on life in a WWII prison camp (2016) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Reflecting on life in a WWII prison camp (2016) 02:25\u000a\u000aNo, instead they are intended to strike fear into communities, to show the muscle and "toughness" of a new president, and to divide the citizenry against itself. These are the acts of a despot, not an elected leader.\u000a\u000aI have dedicated my life to standing against our nation's impulse toward demagoguery and tyranny by the whipped-up masses. The answer lies not just in education, but in empathy. The false narrative -- that there are those who belong here and those who do not -- is designed precisely to divorce us from the truth that we are all here and in this together.\u000a\u000aWe are an interdependent people, sharing a common bond of humanity. The most pernicious aspect of Trump's policies is thus the denial of those basic bonds and that humanity. I will not stand for it, and no people of good conscience should.\u000a\u000aThe question before us, then, on Remembrance Day is a simple one: Will America remember? The internment is not a "precedent," it is a stark and painful lesson. We will only learn from the past if we know, understand and remember it. For if we fail, we most assuredly are doomed to repeat it.

Even the mid-Atlantic and northeast need to remain vigilant.\u000a\u000aAre all of these places ready?\u000a\u000aIt depends on what one means by that question. There are reasonable grounds for cautious optimism that a landfall by Irma along the US coast won't cause large numbers of fatalities, even if it hits a highly populated area.\u000a\u000aDamage to property and infrastructure, on the other hand, could well be massive, as could displacement and loss of livelihoods.\u000a\u000aGood forecasts by the NHC, uncertainties notwithstanding, are allowing timely preparations. And by global standards, both our infrastructure and our emergency management procedures are adequate to protect the lives of almost everyone who listens to the advice of their local officials.\u000a\u000aEven as Harvey caused truly catastrophic devastation in Texas, the official death toll there remains well below 100. That number will probably yet rise, and of course each death is awful for that person's loved ones. But the number will remain much, much lower than it could have been if not for our modern emergency management capabilities.\u000a\u000aThe potential losses in other respects are nonetheless huge. Here in the United States, even after Katrina and Sandy, recent decades have seen rapid growth in population and real estate development along hurricane-prone coastlines. There is a lot there to be destroyed now, and most of it hasn't been tested by a storm with Irma's potential for destruction. (Matthew last year came close, but in the end spared Florida's Atlantic coast its worst.)\u000a\u000aIf Irma's path from here ends up resembling that of the 1926 Miami hurricane -- still a definite possibility at this moment -- the financial toll could exceed $150 billion, according to a 2008 study reported last year by the Miami Herald . (That's comparable to numbers being thrown around for the cost of Harvey. Two such events within a couple of weeks would be hard to comprehend.) The numbers of people displaced, homes destroyed or damaged, and lives upended would also be enormous.\u000a\u000aYet one can reasonably hope that the death toll in this awful scenario might be less today -- maybe even much less -- than the 372 killed in 1926, even though the population is nearly 20 times larger today than it was then.\u000a\u000aAnd compare any of these numbers to the more than 1,000 that are so far estimated to have died in this summer's monsoon floods across India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The real body count in these countries might be much larger; accurate estimates are difficult in many of the places affected. And the numbers will continue to rise due to follow-on public health impacts, such as cholera outbreaks due to contamination of drinking water.\u000a\u000aThe disparity in death tolls between richer and poorer countries leads some to argue that we shouldn't worry about either the increasing risks due to climate change, or the increasing exposure to natural hazards, whether in the United States or elsewhere. The key, this line of thinking goes, is for economic growth to proceed as quickly as possible. Then disasters like Harvey, or the one that Irma threatens to become, will be just " speed bumps " on the road to prosperity.\u000a\u000aI doubt people who have been through any of these events in the United States can see it that way. Many of them suffer harmful effects -- financial, personal, psychological -- for years afterward.\u000a\u000aAs our economy has grown, our exposure to "natural" disasters has grown with it. Yes, we can save more lives, and that rightly deserves to be celebrated. But the toll from disasters by financial and other measures is increasing fast.\u000a\u000aIt is within our power to do more about that by reducing the incentives that currently exist (such as heavily subsidized flood insurance) to put people, property and infrastructure in harm's way. And in the longer term, we can mitigate the potentially much greater threats from rising seas, increasing temperatures, and more powerful storms by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aAnd -- through better forecasts, emergency management, infrastructure and public health measures -- the potential exists to reduce harm in the developing world in the short term, rather than just waiting for growth to solve everything. Hundreds of thousands died in Bangladesh in cyclones in 1970 and 1991. A similar storm in 2007 killed about 3,500 -- still an awfully large number by current US standards (it's about double the official death toll from Katrina), but an enormous improvement -- not because the country had become rich, but because, with some international help, it built shelters and set up effective warning networks.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aOf course, economic growth brings many benefits and everyone wants it. But at all levels of economic development, risks from extreme weather events can be greater or lesser, depending on policy choices.\u000a\u000aIn the United States, we can still hope, at this moment, that Irma won't test our capacity to manage disaster to the extent that Harvey did. Nevertheless, we might take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are -- we are extremely unlikely to be killed by weather, even if we live in the most exposed places.\u000a\u000aThat peace of mind, such as it is, shouldn't mean that we do nothing more about disaster risk than cheer on economic growth. Many other problems in life aren't simple functions of wealth or poverty; disasters aren't either. We have choices to make.

Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world.\u000a\u000aPandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living.\u000a\u000aDiverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing.

aVUber is facing competition from a Chinese-backed upstart promising cheaper rides in one of the world's busiest markets.\u000a\u000aTaxify launched its ride-hailing app in London on Tuesday, offering half price fares and no surge pricing until the end of the month.\u000a\u000aOnce the initial discounts end, Taxify still aims to be 10% cheaper than Uber, CEO Markus Villig told CNNMoney.\u000a\u000a"I think we mainly have a very strong second mover advantage," Villig said. "We don't need to do the hard work of actually establishing this market. We can rather come in, be more efficient, more lean and take a smaller cut for ourselves, and therefore undercut the existing incumbents."\u000a\u000aIts launch in the British capital comes as Uber is struggling to recover from a series of damaging scandals that resulted in its former CEO being forced out by investors.\u000a\u000aThe new arrival appeared to be drawing plenty of interest: Taxify was top of the trending list in Apple's App Store in the U.K. on Tuesday morning.\u000a\u000aRelated: As Uber stumbles, rivals mobilize abroad\u000a\u000aBut even though Taxify said it had "thousands of drivers signed up" ahead of the launch, its service appeared to be lagging Uber in some central London locations early Tuesday, with longer waits for rides.\u000a\u000a"In this early stage, this is normal and we are expecting more drivers to come online within the following hours," a Taxify spokeswoman said. "In the longer term, we are aiming to offer our customers the shortest waiting times."\u000a\u000aWait times were already competitive in some places, such as near the Royal Opera House, she added.\u000a\u000aTaxify is entering a crammed marketplace. Other apps such as Gett and MyTaxi already jostle with more traditional cab firms for business in London.\u000a\u000aTaxify started operations in Estonia in 2013. It says it takes less commission from drivers than Uber and other rivals, enabling it to charge customers lower fares.\u000a\u000aIts London launch coincides with the official first day on the job for Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who was picked to help the world's most valuable startup bounce back from months of crisis.\u000a\u000aRelated: New Uber CEO tells staff company 'has to change'\u000a\u000aTaxify says it already has more than 2.5 million customers across 19 countries in Europe, Central America and Africa. It's planning to launch in Paris before the end of 2017.\u000a\u000a"We see that in the long term, actually taking a smaller cut and having happier drivers will really lead to a sustainable business," Villig said, adding that the firm had been profitable over the past 12 months.\u000a\u000aAnd he has powerful friends. Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing service that beat Uber out of the world's most populous nation, said last month it was investing in Taxify and would help it grow.\u000a\u000aThe partnership is just one of several Didi has established with Uber rivals around the world, including in the U.S., India and Southeast Asia.\u000a\u000aDidi, whose backers include Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and major Chinese tech firms, is pressing ahead with the tie-ups despite its financial links to Uber.\u000a\u000aRelated: China's Uber worth $50 billion after raising more cash\u000a\u000aDidi's deal to buy Uber's China business resulted in the U.S. company receiving a roughly 18% stake in the Chinese firm. And Didi ended up with a stake in Uber.\u000a\u000aA Didi spokeswoman played down the potential conflicts of the company's web of links to Uber and its rivals around the world, saying there was "ample room" for multiple operators in the rapidly developing market.\u000a\u000a"Eventually, drivers and riders, and cities looking for solutions to their congestion and efficiency problems, will benefit from robust investments into the industry from different players," she said.\u000a\u000aUber said millions of Londoners were using its app and waiting less than three minutes on average for a ride.\u000a\u000a"Competition is a good thing as it raises service levels across the board," an Uber spokesperson said.\u000a\u000a-- Samuel Burke and Mark Thompson contributed to this report.

aVIf you think it's the flames or the heat, that's understandable: those are dangerous, too. But both from a victim's and a firefighter's perspective, the deadliest enemy is smoke.\u000a\u000aSmoke causes more fire deaths than flames, according to the National Fire Protection Association , because people are incapacitated by fumes so quickly that they can't get to safety.\u000a\u000aAnd it leaves firefighters blind, because it's impossible to see anything in a smoke-filled room.\u000a\u000aThat's why firefighting teams use special cameras that allow them to see through the smoke, rendering images based on heat rather than light.\u000a\u000aThey've been around for decades, but they've always had one crucial flaw.\u000a\u000aSee-through\u000a\u000aHumans lose consciousness when oxygen concentration drops below 9 percent, but start losing judgment and coordination at around 17 percent, a whiff below the normal amount in breathable air of 21 percent.\u000a\u000aIn a building on fire, that means smoke can often hide unconscious or disorientated victims. To be able to spot them -- and also see danger areas by gauging heat levels -- rescue teams must be equipped with thermal imaging cameras, which show heat in brighter colors over darker backgrounds.\u000a\u000aBut here's the problem: "Conventional systems require you to hold the camera, so you can look into the screen - but for firefighters to not have a free hand in a dangerous environment is not ideal," said Graham Wilson, director at Design Reality, His UK-based company was tasked by firefighting equipment manufacturer Scott Safety to create a product that could address this specific concern.\u000a\u000aHands-free\u000a\u000aScott's idea was to integrate the thermal camera into the mask all firemen already use, the respirator. It has multiple functions, but primarily it protects from particles and smoke.\u000a\u000aThe new camera, called Sight, is small and -- at around 8 ounces -- light enough to not add significantly to the heft of the mask. But it projects a small thermal image inside the mask, at nine frames per second. Further settings can be easily configured through a smartphone app.\u000a\u000aSince it is mounted on an essential piece of equipment, every member of a rescue team gets one, which it's hoped will increase safety as it means firemen can see for themselves, rather than rely on voice indications from a team leader wielding the camera.\u000a\u000aAccording to its makers, it's the first of its kind in production: "But in the industry the idea is not that novel, because everyone has wanted it for so long," said Wilson. "The challenge was to turn it into a product."\u000a\u000aAnother challenge was to not bog down the mask itself: "It was tricky to fit new tech into an existing mask, because we can't afford to lose any performance on the respirator -- it has standards we need to respect," said Wilson.\u000a\u000aThe solution? No cables: the camera sends information to the in-mask display system wirelessly, so there's no need to penetrate the mask with a cable, which would limit the field of vision.\u000a\u000aLife-saving\u000a\u000aFrom the conceptual stage, Sight was developed in collaboration with actual firefighters, who were engaged in tests and training sessions: "The key tell to whether this was gonna do well," said Wilson, "Was when it was launched and firemen were coming up to our stands at conventions to say 'Hallelujah, we've been wanting this for so long!'"\u000a\u000aCompared to traditional hand-held cameras, which can cost thousands of dollars, the Sight is also more affordable: it retails for around $1,500 inclusive of the mask.\u000a\u000aBut Wilson believes the real selling point is elsewhere. "This product is going to save lives," he said. "What more could you want?"

They think they will be instantly critiqued -- which they will be -- but it's not the job of athletes to avoid critique."\u000a\u000a"That is an anti-risk-taking behavior, which is anti-athletics," Amaechi, now an organizational psychologist in London, tells CNN.

aV(CNN) Bold, disruptive and totally unapologetic, a new Nigerian online magazine 'A Nasty Boy,' is set to ruffle a few feathers.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes our visual content will not be safe for the workplace... we won't make it any easier for you with our provocative editorials and swear words; take it in good spirits," read's the magazine's disclaimer.\u000a\u000aThe magazine is filled with provocative images, featuring nude models, articles contain swear words and avant-garde ideas.\u000a\u000aIn Nigeria, a conservative country, where public expressions of nudity are uncommon, 'A Nasty Boy' is unsurprisingly causing controversy.\u000a\u000aBut for editor Richard Akuson, the publication is sending out a clear message: he's not interested in fitting the status quo.\u000a\u000a'There has to be room for people that don't fit in'\u000a\u000aGrowing up, Akuson says he was bullied for being different.\u000a\u000a"I was always called a boy-girl," Akuson told CNN.\u000a\u000a"In university, I was called a yansh man which means a guy with a big butt...my classmates thought I was too polite, in their words too polished and that was not the way guys were meant to be."\u000a\u000aIt was this idea, that a man or woman is meant to behave in a particular way, that Akuson sought to challenge through 'A Nasty Boy.'\u000a\u000aPhotos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson Photos: Boys: An editorial by Richard Akuson In his editorial 'Boys' Richard Akuson hopes to challenge the concept of Nigerian masculinity.

"If a friend sees someone looking at a post like that, there would be questions. They might have liked it but didn't have the confidence to show that openly." Hide Caption 5 of 5\u000a\u000a"There cannot be one singular kind of Nigerian man or woman, there has to be room for other definitions that don't necessarily fit that opinion," he adds.\u000a\u000aAkuson had previously launched three other publications but says none of them felt right, he was pushed to publish 'A Nasty Boy,' after a run in with internet trolls.\u000a\u000aCelebrating 'otherness'\u000a\u000a"I once did a story on EJ Johnson... and how I felt his wardrobe could inspire, but the conversation in the comment section completely moved from the subject matter to me. 'Why are you always interested in stories like this?; and some responses were 'Oh you know Richard is gay'"\u000a\u000a"That was the awakening for me," he said. "And from that morning I knew I would start 'A Nasty Boy.'"\u000a\u000aAkuson says after his experience he knew the time had come for a platform that allowed for self-expression and shape-shifting ideas and explored "otherness in fashion, people and culture."\u000a\u000a"There are people who do not fit the status quo but are however very Nigerian," he explains. "We should hear their stories and also celebrate them."\u000a\u000a'Fear of association'\u000a\u000aWhile the public is slowly warming up to his publication, there is still fear and hesitation to be publicly associated with the magazine Akuson claims.\u000a\u000aA large chunk of the magazine's readership resides in Nigeria, Akuson notes that the number isn't reflected in their social engagement. He feels it's because people are still weary to be publicly associated with subject matter that could be considered taboo.\u000a\u000aIn an photo editorial called 'Boys', Akuson tried to challenged the perceived notion of strangeness surrounding men being naked around one another. After it was published, he observed something unusual.\u000a\u000a"I could see from my analytics that the photo had been seen many times but the engagement was not as much. Then I got messages and calls from people who thought it was impressive work and I asked, 'why didn't you leave a comment?'"\u000a\u000aFunding also poses a huge problem for his ambitious publication with potential investors questioning its importance.\u000a\u000a"We have met people who just say outright that this is not a necessary publication, it could be something else, and it doesn't have to be this. They don't understand why it's necessary."\u000a\u000aBold and unapologetic\u000a\u000aBut Akuson does, and is driven by the effect the magazine has on people who connect to the message and need to celebrate difference.\u000a\u000aAkuson shares the story of a photographer who collaborated with him on an editorial, whose father broke his camera because he found photos of naked men on it. The incident prompted the photographer to give up on photography, but seeing his work in 'A Nasty Boy' feature on a British website lit his fire again.\u000a\u000aFinancial setbacks and going against the grain of Nigeria's conservative principle aside, Akuson's focus is in one direction and he is doing it boldly, and unapologetically.

aVAnyone who knows me also knows that I have a huge sweet tooth. I always have.\u000a\u000aMy friend and fellow graduate student Andrew is equally afflicted, and living in Hershey, Pennsylvania -- the "Chocolate Capital of the World" -- doesn't help either of us.\u000a\u000aBut Andrew is braver than I am. Last year, he gave up sweets for Lent. I can't say that I'm following in his footsteps this year, but if you are abstaining from sweets for Lent this year, here's what you can expect over the next 40 days.\u000a\u000aSugar: natural reward, unnatural fix\u000a\u000aIn neuroscience, food is something we call a "natural reward." In order for us to survive as a species, things like eating, having sex and nurturing others must be pleasurable to the brain so that these behaviors are reinforced and repeated.\u000a\u000aEvolution has resulted in the mesolimbic pathway , a brain system that deciphers these natural rewards for us. When we do something pleasurable, a bundle of neurons called the ventral tegmental area uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to signal to a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens.\u000a\u000aThe connection between the nucleus accumbens and our prefrontal cortex dictates our motor movement, such as deciding whether or not to taking another bite of that delicious chocolate cake. The prefrontal cortex also activates hormones that tell our body: "Hey, this cake is really good. And I'm going to remember that for the future."\u000a\u000aNot all foods are equally rewarding, of course. Most of us prefer sweets over sour and bitter foods because, evolutionarily, our mesolimbic pathway reinforces that sweet things provide a healthy source of carbohydrates for our bodies. When our ancestors went scavenging for berries, for example, sour meant "not yet ripe," while bitter meant "alert -- poison!"\u000a\u000aFruit is one thing, but modern diets have taken on a life of their own. A decade ago, it was estimated that the average American consumed 22 teaspoons of added sugar per day, amounting to an extra 350 calories; it may well have risen since then. A few months ago, one expert suggested that the average Briton consumes 238 teaspoons of sugar each week.\u000a\u000aToday, with convenience more important than ever in our food selections, it's almost impossible to come across processed and prepared foods that don't have added sugars for flavour, preservation, or both.\u000a\u000aThese added sugars are sneaky -- and unbeknown to many of us, we've become hooked. In ways that drugs of abuse -- such as nicotine, cocaine and heroin -- hijack the brain's reward pathway and make users dependent, increasing neuro-chemical and behavioural evidence suggests that sugar is addictive in the same way, too.\u000a\u000aSugar addiction is real\u000a\u000a"The first few days are a little rough," Andrew told me about his sugar-free adventure last year. "It almost feels like you're detoxing from drugs. I found myself eating a lot of carbs to compensate for the lack of sugar."\u000a\u000aThere are four major components of addiction: bingeing, withdrawal, craving, and cross-sensitisation (the notion that one addictive substance predisposes someone to becoming addicted to another). All of these components have been observed in animal models of addiction -- for sugar, as well as drugs of abuse.\u000a\u000aA typical experiment goes like this: rats are deprived of food for 12 hours each day, then given 12 hours of access to a sugary solution and regular chow.\u000a\u000aAfter a month of following this daily pattern, rats display behaviours similar to those on drugs of abuse. They'll binge on the sugar solution in a short period of time, much more than their regular food. They also show signs of anxiety and depression during the food deprivation period.\u000a\u000aMany sugar-treated rats who are later exposed to drugs, such as cocaine and opiates , demonstrate dependent behaviors towards the drugs compared to rats who did not consume sugar beforehand.\u000a\u000aLike drugs, sugar spikes dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Over the long term, regular sugar consumption actually changes the gene expression and availability of dopamine receptors in both the midbrain and frontal cortex\u000a\u000aSpecifically, sugar increases the concentration of a type of excitatory receptor called D1, but decreases another receptor type called D2, which is inhibitory.\u000a\u000aRegular sugar consumption also inhibits the action of the dopamine transporter , a protein which pumps dopamine out of the synapse and back into the neuron after firing.\u000a\u000aIn short, this means that repeated access to sugar over time leads to prolonged dopamine signalling, greater excitation of the brain's reward pathways and a need for even more sugar to activate all of the midbrain dopamine receptors like before. The brain becomes tolerant to sugar -- and more is needed to attain the same "sugar high."\u000a\u000aSugar withdrawal is also real\u000a\u000aAlthough these studies were conducted in rodents, it's not far-fetched to say that the same primitive processes are occurring in the human brain, too. "The cravings never stopped, [but that was] probably psychological," Andrew told me. "But it got easier after the first week or so."\u000a\u000aIn a 2002 study by Carlo Colantuoni and colleagues of Princeton University, rats who had undergone a typical sugar dependence protocol then underwent "sugar withdrawal." This was facilitated by either food deprivation or treatment with naloxone, a drug used for treating opiate addiction which binds to receptors in the brain's reward system.\u000a\u000aBoth withdrawal methods led to physical problems, including teeth chattering, paw tremors, and head shaking. Naloxone treatment also appeared to make the rats more anxious, as they spent less time on an elevated apparatus that lacked walls on either side.\u000a\u000aSimilar withdrawal experiments by others also report behaviour similar to depression in tasks such as the forced swim test. Rats in sugar withdrawal are more likely to show passive behaviours (like floating) than active behaviours (like trying to escape) when placed in water, suggesting feelings of helplessness.\u000a\u000aA study published by Victor Mangabeira and colleagues in Physiology & Behavior reports that sugar withdrawal is also linked to impulsive behaviour. Initially, rats were trained to receive water by pushing a lever.\u000a\u000aAfter training, the animals returned to their home cages and had access to a sugar solution and water, or just water alone. After 30 days, when rats were again given the opportunity to press a lever for water, those who had become dependent on sugar pressed the lever significantly more times than control animals, suggesting impulsive behaviour.\u000a\u000aThese are extreme experiments, of course. We humans aren't depriving ourselves of food for 12 hours and then allowing ourselves to binge on soda and doughnuts at the end of the day. But these rodent studies certainly give us insight into the neuro-chemical underpinnings of sugar dependence, withdrawal, and behaviour.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThrough decades of diet programmes and best-selling books, we've toyed with the notion of "sugar addiction" for a long time. There are accounts of those in "sugar withdrawal" describing food cravings, which can trigger relapse and impulsive eating.\u000a\u000aThere are also countless articles and books about the boundless energy and new-found happiness in those who have sworn off sugar for good. But despite the ubiquity of sugar in our diets, the notion of sugar addiction is still a rather taboo topic.\u000a\u000aAre you still motivated to give up sugar for Lent? You might wonder how long it will take until you're free of cravings and side-effects, but there's no answer -- everyone is different and no human studies have been done on this.\u000a\u000aBut after 40 days, it's clear that Andrew had overcome the worst, likely even reversing some of his altered dopamine signalling. "I remember eating my first sweet and thinking it was too sweet," he said. "I had to rebuild my tolerance."\u000a\u000aAnd as regulars of a local bakery in Hershey -- I can assure you, readers, that he has done just that.

All times Eastern.\u000a\u000aThe film will be available beginning Monday, Sept. 5, on demand via cable and satellite systems, CNNgo platforms, and CNN mobile apps. The Reagan Show will also live stream tonight at 9:00pm for subscribers via CNNgo apps for AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV, Android TV, and via www.CNN.com/go.\u000a\u000aCo-directed by filmmakers Pacho Velez and Sierra Pettengill reviewed nearly 1,000 hours of footage filmed by the U.S. Naval Photographic unit and preserved by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, in the creation of the film. While previous administrations also filmed White House activities, the Reagan Administration\u2019s volume of documentation was unprecedented. Archival news footage from the era augments this fly-on-the-wall perspective on the dramatic history and pageantry of the Reagan years.\u000a\u000aThe Reagan Show also represents a new milestone for CNN Films, which celebrates its fifth anniversary this fall. Velez and Pettengill are alumni of the inaugural filmmakers\u2019 retreat created by a partnership with Tribeca Film Institute, Camden International Film Festival, and CNN Films in 2015. Each June, the annual workshop is hosted by Points North Institute in Camden and Rockport, Maine, and provides master classes, mentorship, and guidance to emerging documentary filmmakers. This film is the first co-production to be acquired for broadcast by CNN Films from alumni of the workshop, fulfilling a goal of CNN Films to contribute to the industry through nurturing documentary filmmaking and filmmakers.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the telecasts and live stream, The Reagan Show will also stream via CNNgo and the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android.\u000a\u000a# # # # #

aVStory highlights The US has long respected and promoted science, Nye writes\u000a\u000aNye: Science is being undermined by ideological forces motivated to maintain the status quo\u000a\u000aBill Nye, known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, is an American science educator, television presenter, and mechanical engineer. He is the CEO of The Planetary Society, the world's largest non-profit space interest group. The opinions expressed are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I was proud to join thousands of concerned citizens, scientists and engineers in Saturday's March for Science. With more than 600 marches taking place around the world, we conveyed that science is political, not partisan, and science should shape our policies.\u000a\u000aAlthough it is the means by which humankind discovers objective truths in nature, science is and has always been political. Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution refers to promoting "the progress of science and useful arts" to motivate innovators, stimulate the economy and establish just laws.\u000a\u000aThe US has become the most powerful nation on Earth and among the greatest in history, because it has long respected and promoted science. Countless policies, from military deployments to regulations that control the formula of a shampoo, are based on science.\u000a\u000aScientific research depends on government investment (approximately $65 billion in the US last year), which itself relies on a social compact: that basic research across all fields is beneficial to a nation.\u000a\u000aCurrently, science is being actively undermined by ideological forces motivated to maintain the status quo rather than advance the nation's long-term interest. This is especially true of the extractive fossil fuel industries. When facing tides of deliberate misinformation, scientists, engineers and researchers have taken it upon themselves to organize and raise awareness about their professions and the vital importance of the scientific enterprise.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVJonathan Cristol is a fellow at the World Policy Institute and a senior fellow at the Center for Civic Engagement at Bard College. You can follow him @jonathancristol. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Early Wednesday morning North Korea launched a Hwasong-12 missile which traveled 1,678 miles over the Japanese island of Hokkaido and landed in the Pacific Ocean.\u000a\u000aThis missile launch was not a test -- it was a demonstration. Kim Jong Un wanted to show the world his confidence that the missile could make it over Japan without failing over Japanese territory, though the missile's trajectory appears to have been plotted to minimize risk to Japanese civilians.\u000a\u000aThe immediate, obvious response to an accidental strike on Japan would be to strike back at the launch site. This would be easy if launched from an area without a large civilian population.\u000a\u000aBut the fact that this missile was launched from from the capital city of Pyongyang shows that Kim is confident he would not suffer a preemptive or retaliatory strike.\u000a\u000aThis was a dangerous escalation from North Korea's previous missile tests, which have followed steep trajectories to avoid flying over Japan , and should be met with a serious response. But since the 2016 US election, the US has greeted North Korea's missile tests with the typical disjointed reaction we have come to expect from the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aAfter the latest missile launch, President Trump's 140-character response was just as confusing: "The US has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!"\u000a\u000aIt is not at all clear what extortion payments he was talking about, though the tweet is in keeping with Trump's view that the US, the most powerful country on Earth, is constantly being taken advantage of.\u000a\u000aThe later part of his tweet seemed to contradict both Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who said, "We're never out of diplomatic solutions," and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has supported talks with Pyongyang while simultaneously gutting his own department's capability to conduct them.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Is N Korea calling Trump's bluff with missile threats? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is N Korea calling Trump's bluff with missile threats? 03:30\u000a\u000aThe escalation of North Korean threats may lead some to fear that war on the Korean peninsula is imminent, and President Trump's tweets certainly don't detract from that perception.\u000a\u000aBut war in East Asia remains an unlikely outcome. Because Trump's threats are empty, and so are Kim's.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea will never strike Guam (or the US mainland) with a nuclear missile because they value their own survival and a nuclear strike by Pyongyang would result in the destruction of North Korea.\u000a\u000aMutual deterrence is more powerful than either leader's desire to win the game of chicken they're playing.\u000a\u000aHowever, non-nuclear escalation is always a threat and the US should show Pyongyang that while it may be able to live with a nuclear-armed North Korea, it will not tolerate risky behavior and escalation towards the US or its allies.\u000a\u000aThe US and South Korea attempted to demonstrate that by showing their ability to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles like the Hwangsong-12 and their bunker-busting precision bombing capability.\u000a\u000aThat is unlikely to persuade Kim to stop testing, and he will almost certainly develop the capability to strike the US with a nuclear warhead. We will not like it, but we will live with it, just as we have lived with Russian and Chinese nuclear weapons pointed at the US.\u000a\u000aAn appropriate response to North Korean testing would show that escalation will not be tolerated, a preventive strike is not imminent and that we are always open to talks (talking does not equal concessions; talking equals talking).\u000a\u000aTrump said that "all options are on the table," and he was right to say so.\u000a\u000aBut provocative, escalatory, and dangerous North Korean actions requires a multifaceted, nuanced, coordinated, and thoughtful response. And unfortunately those qualities haven't exactly been hallmarks of the Trump administration.

aVGov. Roy Cooper visited Asheville on Thursday to draw attention to the deadly opioid epidemic. Cooper, who met with local people in recovery, said it will take a multipronged approach to end the addiction crisis that's affected so many families. (Photo credit: WLOS staff)\u000a\u000aGov. Roy Cooper visited Asheville on Thursday to draw attention to the deadly opioid epidemic.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCooper, who met with local people in recovery, said it will take a multipronged approach to end the addiction crisis that's affected so many families.\u000a\u000aHe touted his opioid action plan unveiled to tackle the epidemic that's killed 12,000 people since 1999.\u000a\u000a"Four people a day. Four people a day die from substance abuse overdose," Cooper told a hushed room before proclaiming September Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month.\u000a\u000aThe governor, along with state and local leaders, got an up close look at a life saver. Vaya Health received a state grant for 2,400 kits, which include the opiate antidote Narcan. The kits will be distributed by the the state Harm Reduction Coalition\u000a\u000a"It has saved life after life and making sure that it is widely available is a first part of this plan," Cooper said.\u000a\u000aAddiction leads to more deaths than car accidents nationwide, with a $1.3 billion economic impact in the Tar Heel State.\u000a\u000a"That should get our attention, and it does," the governor said.\u000a\u000aAs much as stats drive home the problem, the stories of recovery may be even more powerful.\u000a\u000a"I just met with five very strong people who have a had a long road," Cooper said.\u000a\u000aRichie Tannerhill, of Haywood County, has been down that road for 12 years, and he's now a peer counselor.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to convey to him that we've got to do more work in the community. And why I say that is, that's where recovery happens," Tannerhill said.\u000a\u000aTannerhill's story gives the governor hope.\u000a\u000a"You can recover from the depth of this problem," Cooper said.\u000a\u000a"Today, I'm a husband, a father, a homeowner, I pay taxes. Today, I contribute to the community because I eventually got supported," Tannerhill said.\u000a\u000aThe governor stressed that access to health care is a vital issue connected to the crisis. Without that care, Cooper said many simply won't get the treatment they need. He said working closely with law enforcement is another component to getting addicts help.

aVStory highlights Gregory C. Allen: Though Russia may not lead in AI technology, it is at the forefront of weaponizing it\u000a\u000aAs an authoritarian leader of a nation with a declining economy, Putin has every reason to employ AI to maintain power, writes Allen\u000a\u000aGregory C. Allen is an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security. In July 2017, his report "Artificial Intelligence and National Security" was published by the Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Follow him on Twitter @Gregory_C_Allen. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Last Friday, a million Russian schoolchildren watched a televised address from Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Artificial intelligence is the future, not only of Russia, but of all of mankind," Putin said. "Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world." After seeing Putin's comments, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that "competition for AI superiority at national level (is the) most likely cause of WW3."\u000a\u000aThough never before stated so frankly by a head of state, Putin's views on AI are increasingly shared by national security leaders in the United States China and around the world. As I wrote in a report published by the Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, AI research is likely to deliver a revolution in military technology on par with the invention of aircraft and nuclear weapons. In other words, Musk is correct that each country is pursuing AI superiority and that this pursuit brings new risks.\u000a\u000aGregory C. Allen\u000a\u000aBut in spite of Putin's ambitious goals, Russia's pursuit of AI domination is unlikely to come in the form of generating AI technological breakthroughs. Both the United States and China possess digital tech industries that are larger, more sophisticated and growing faster than Russia's.\u000a\u000aHowever, Russia could be a leader in weaponizing AI in pursuit of its grand strategy, which is to end US hegemony in the international system and re-establish Russian influence over the former Soviet region. Russia was never a leader in internet technology either, but the country has built a large and capable force of cyber hackers that knocked out a substantial portion of the Ukrainian power grid, infiltrated US nuclear facilities and brought chaos to the 2016 presidential election.\u000a\u000aIndeed, even before Putin's comments, Russia's behavior demonstrated a keen understanding of how AI is likely to empower militaries and intelligence agencies -- especially those willing to break with international laws and norms. Over the past five years, Russia has been aggressively investing in new military robotics and unmanned systems, and testing these systems in Russia's conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. In 2015, the US Army's commanding general in Europe stated that when Ukrainians see Russian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, "they know in the next 10-15 minutes, there're going to be rockets landing on top of them."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Musk, Zuckerberg feud over future of AI Replay More Videos ...

aV(CNN) Residents of the Miami area and the Florida Keys streamed north in packed vehicles Friday morning, anxiously rushing to dodge Hurricane Irma as the deadly Category 4 storm took aim at the state's eastern coast after devastating the Caribbean.\u000a\u000aThe dramatic mass exodus from South Florida could turn into one of the largest evacuations in US history, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties are home to about 6 million people combined\u000a\u000aBut the clock is ticking for those who haven't left yet, officials warned.\u000a\u000a"Get inland for safety," Florida Gov. Rick Scott said.\u000a\u000a"Based on what we know, the majority of Florida will have major hurricane impact and deadly winds. We expect this along the entire east coast and west coast," the governor said at a news conference. "All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate."\u000a\u000aThousands of motorists braved clogged roads, backups and slowdowns to get out. Some drivers waited for hours at gas stations, some of which ran out of fuel. The Florida Highway Patrol escorted fuel tankers so they could reach and resupply gas stations, the agency reported.\u000a\u000aTravel hot spots included Interstates 95 and 75, and the Florida Turnpike. Troopers monitored roadways, stepping in to help after fender-benders and with disabled cars and trucks.\u000a\u000aMandatory evacuation orders covered parts of Miami-Dade County, Broward County east of US 1, Palm Beach County, low-lying parts of Brevard County, coastal and low-lying areas of Jacksonville and Duval County, and Monroe County, home to the Florida Keys.\u000a\u000aThe evacuation of Miami-Dade County was the largest in the county's history, with an estimated 660,000 people asked to leave, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said.\u000a\u000a'You could die'\u000a\u000aSome people heard officials' dire admonition loud and clear.\u000a\u000a"If you don't heed the warning, you could die," Key Largo resident Don Anderson told CNN. "This is your life. What's it worth? You can always party later."\u000a\u000aPaulita Kundid, left, and her brother, Mike Kundid, board up their apartment building Friday, ahead of Hurricane Irma in Daytona Beach, Florida.\u000a\u000aIgnoring official advisories, other residents stocked up on supplies and prepared to ride it out.\u000a\u000a"I have been here 15 years and been through so many storms. We have been told many times to evacuate," said Scott Abraham, who lives on the 11th floor of a building on Miami Beach. "I don't think it's going to hit us directly. If it does, I think we are safe. We have food. We have supplies. We have everything we need."\u000a\u000a"We are ready to rock and roll with the storm," he said.\u000a\u000aFlying out of the storm zone\u000a\u000aSome Floridians unwilling to risk chaos on the highways opted to try to fly out of town. Delta Air Lines added flights out of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Key West to Atlanta, its largest hub, and allowed passengers affected by Irma to rebook flights for free, the airline said.\u000a\u000aPets, pets, pets!!! Every second passenger has pet on flights today \U0001f917\U0001f64f\U0001f436\U0001f431#miami #southbeach #hurricane #irma #\u0421NNweather A post shared by Elena Yampolskaya (@ellenworldwide) on Sep 7, 2017 at 8:25am PDT\u000a\u000aAmerican Airlines and United Airlines also waived change fees for passengers impacted by Irma, the airlines said. American planned to wind down operations Friday afternoon at its Miami hub, as well as in other south Florida cities, then to cancel flights throughout the weekend, the airline said.\u000a\u000aIrma's impending landfall had forced airlines serving some of the nation's largest airports to plan to shut down operations. By late Saturday, Miami, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale -- home to the 12th, 13th and 21st largest airports in the US, respectively -- were expected to be largely dormant.\u000a\u000aStranded at the airport\u000a\u000aKevin Brokbals, who hails from Germany, was among several dozen people who spent the night on cots at Miami International Airport. He planned to be stuck for a while and said airport officials hadn't given much sense of his options.\u000a\u000a"The airport didn't tell us anything," he said. "We asked some police officers to give us any information because there was no one officially from the airport."\u000a\u000aPeople crowd Fort Lauderdale International Airport as evacuations get underway on Thursday for the arrival of Hurricane Irma.\u000a\u000aFirst, he and others were told they had to leave the airport and head to a shelter. Then, they were told all shelters were full.\u000a\u000a"And we have to stay here," he said. "We can't stay upstairs because there are too many windows, too many glasses which can break. And that's why they want all the people in one area, even though it's not a shelter."\u000a\u000aLeila Traversoni, of Argentina, visited Miami to shop for her wedding dress and a tuxedo for her fiancé. The couple is desperate to get back home; they've never been through a hurricane.\u000a\u000a"I am very afraid," Traversoni said. "I am terrified. I don't know what to do. We don't have any place to go. We are looking for a shelter."\u000a\u000aTraversoni said she's hoping for an answer from American Airlines or airport staff.\u000a\u000a"We don't know what to expect," she said. "We are really, really terrified because we don't know what to do, where to go -- just praying at this point."\u000a\u000aHunkering down\u000a\u000aOther people planned to stay put to protect their homes.\u000a\u000a"I evacuated Matthew," one Merritt Island resident said, referring to last year's hurricane. "I feel this is going to be a Category 2 or 3 by the time it hits us. I've got a pretty strong home, so I'm pretty confident it will survive."\u000a\u000aWary of tornadoes, though, he said he could change his plans if it looks like Irma could strike as a Category 4 or 5 storm.\u000a\u000a"I'm watching the weather and the news and keeping track with the storm," he said.\u000a\u000aTourist Bjorg Aasen and Arne Forsmo walk to catch a shuttle to a shelter as Miami Beach announces a mandatory evacuation.\u000a\u000aLinda Blackshear, who lives in South Florida, also planned to stay. She doesn't live in an evacuation zone, she said, and her grandson lives with her.\u000a\u000a"I feel safe," she said, adding that she has no place to evacuate to. "I have all the supplies and all the essentials."\u000a\u000aOn the road\u000a\u000aRoseanne Lesack, her husband and three children were among the evacuees.\u000a\u000aThey left Boca Raton on Wednesday and headed to Atlanta to stay with friends, she said. After encountering slow traffic, the family spent the night at a motel in Orlando and continued north Thursday morning, Lesack said.\u000a\u000aHeavy traffic hit Port St. Lucie, Florida, on Thursday as residents evacuated.\u000a\u000a"What should have been another six- or seven-hour travel experience is coming up on 12 hours," she said Thursday night from her vehicle, about 35 miles south of Atlanta. "It has been slow. Right now, we're going about 20 mph. ... It's just three lanes of red bumper lights."\u000a\u000aLast year, the family stayed with friends in Florida to ride out Matthew, she said, adding that she was glad they decided not to chance it now.\u000a\u000a"Now, there are a lot of people who are really nervous about staying but don't feel like they can get out," Lesack said.\u000a\u000aWarnings and watches\u000a\u000aBy Friday, tropical storm-force winds from Irma covered more than 65,000 square miles -- about the area of all of Florida, and the National Hurricane Center had issued hurricane and storm surge warnings for South Florida. Irma's cone of potential landfall included almost the entire state of Florida, meaning residents would not be able to flee to the state's Gulf Coast to avoid its wrath.\u000a\u000aAs the storm plodded toward the United States, more warnings echoed from public officials and experts:\u000a\u000a"We cannot save you in the middle of a storm," Scott said at a news conference Friday..\u000a\u000a"You do not want to leave on Saturday, driving through Florida with tropical storm-force winds," CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said.\u000a\u000a"This is not a Category 1. This is not one to ride out and say, 'Oh, it's just a blow, we'll be fine.' No. If you're in the Keys, you need to go. This isn't an 'always fine' kind of storm," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.\u000a\u000aWithout knowing exactly where Irma would make landfall, governors in Georgia and South Carolina decided not to take chances, ordering mandatory evacuations of low-lying coastal areas around Savannah and Charleston.

aVCarol Costello anchors the 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET edition of CNN's "Newsroom" each weekday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single.\u000a\u000aI did. And I do.\u000a\u000aRecently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want.\u000a\u000a"I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom," 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. "There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well."\u000a\u000aJackie Demate, also 21, agreed. "I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe."\u000a\u000aCarol Costello\u000a\u000aAt first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, "Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!"\u000a\u000aJackie didn't blink. "But, Europe!" she exclaimed. "I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy."\u000a\u000aBefore you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once . That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960.\u000a\u000aWhat a fine example my generation is! Not.\u000a\u000aStill, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29.\u000a\u000aReligious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction.\u000a\u000aA study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says: "From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being." On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be "more desirable marriage prospects."\u000a\u000aBingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt.\u000a\u000a"Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt," Emily Crille told me. "That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home."\u000a\u000aI felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable?\u000a\u000aPerhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right.\u000a\u000aScandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today : "In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying."\u000a\u000aThe article also points out that "Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth."\u000a\u000aIn an effort to understand the joys of "sambo," the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden.\u000a\u000a"To put it short," he told us, "marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation."\u000a\u000aWow.\u000a\u000aFifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, "I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it."\u000a\u000aMaybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: "The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities."\u000a\u000aMy Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, "Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for."\u000a\u000aMarriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough.\u000a\u000aWhich brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point?\u000a\u000aIn the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with "I dos"?\u000a\u000aI don't know. But I would love to know if you do.\u000a\u000aRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.

aV(CNN) The election had been bitter, and the outgoing President was miffed at the victor's arrogant promise that he would bring a political revolution to Washington, DC. He had no energy left for civility.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the nation's second President, John Adams, even skipped Thomas Jefferson's 1801 inauguration, leaving him only, in the words of historian Joyce Appleby, "a curt note informing him that there were seven horses and two carriages in the White House stables."\u000a\u000aThe tone of the inauguration day letter from outgoing President Barack Obama to President-elect Donald J. Trump, released Sunday, belongs to a different tradition, the modern presidential ritual of leaving private notes behind in the Oval Office desk as a parting gesture to its next occupant. Beginning with a short note from Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush in 1989, a Reaganesque "Don't let the turkeys get you down," the gesture became a tradition when George H. W. Bush, an enthusiastic letter writer, penned his "Dear Bill" note for Clinton in 1993. Despite the pain of his own crushing defeat, President Bush ended his letter with the gracious "I am rooting hard for you." The theme of President Bush's letter was that since we have only one President at a time, we want that individual to succeed.\u000a\u000aWhile reflective of this tradition, Obama's "Dear Mr. President" letter is a departure from the billet doux of his recent predecessors -- truly unusual in the sweep of recent history. And yet it is not surprising, since it was written to someone who proudly declared himself as outside the modern presidential tradition.\u000a\u000aThe note is civil rather than colloquial, aspirational rather than inspirational. While longer, and characteristic of different aspects of the man (President Obama, Professor Obama and the private Barack Obama), the letter is also very much a product of the tumult of the 2016 election. At the risk of reading too much into a note, it appears to reflect not only careful crafting but also significant concern about the possible implications of a Trump presidency.\u000a\u000aSpeaking historically, it seems inconceivable that any previous modern President would have felt the need, as President Obama did, to remind his successor of his role as caretaker of our democratic institutions and of the importance of the rule of law. And yet, having seen candidate Trump's repeated stirring of anti-constitutional passions -- his attacks on Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, his vow to " lock up " his opponent, his avowed skepticism of the First Amendment -- Obama must have had one eye on history and the other on Trump when implicitly warning him of where these dark forces might lead.\u000a\u000aFrom Reagan through Obama, five Presidents from both major parties shared a commitment to more open markets and borders and, to a varying extent, cultural exchange. Trump, who campaigned hard against so-called globalism, is the first Oval Office occupant since 1989 not to share this basic understanding of America's role in the world. Candidate Trump vowed to turn the clock back to the petty, disastrous isolationism of the America First movement of the 1930s. Obama's letter, by implication, asked President Trump to think twice before doing it.\u000a\u000aIn spite of these soft warnings, President Obama kept the letter nonpartisan, avoiding any mention of specific policy issues -- the right to affordable health care, the significance of climate change or the importance of not turning our backs on the Dreamers. In a curious turn of phrase, however, he flattered President Trump by linking both men's rise to the top of the American pyramid, saying "we've both been blessed, in different ways, with great good fortune." This was a segue to Obama's bigger point that since most Americans do not start life on third base, it was important for President Trump to "build more ladders of success" for hardworking people who were not as fortunate as both recent Presidents have been.\u000a\u000aSo, what did this unorthodox President think of what Obama had to say? Shortly after his Inauguration, Trump shared with the public not only that he had received a "beautiful" letter from Obama but that he would "cherish" it.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aAt the time we did not know what was in it. Now that we do, it is easy to conclude that Trump has an odd way of showing that he cherishes something. Although we are years away from a deep historical understanding of the inner workings of the Trump administration, let alone of the presidential mind, there is substantial evidence that this President hasn't taken any of his predecessor's observations to heart. To name just a few examples, these would be Trump's attack on the judiciary after the failure of his initial travel ban, the way he fired FBI Director James Comey, his dithering over US treaty obligations to NATO, his repeated rhetorical attacks on long-standing US allies (let alone his withdrawal from the Paris accord), and, above all, his revealing and distressing comments after Charlottesville.

aV(CNN) Emily Gavigan was convinced that a nearby truck was following her. Someone was after her.\u000a\u000aShe was a sophomore at the University of Scranton in January 2009 when the "bizarre" behavior began, said her father, Bill.\u000a\u000aHer parents noticed that she had been rambling, not making any sense. At one point, she called her family and friends to warn them: Something terrible was going to happen to all of them.\u000a\u000a"Emily was like a different person. We didn't know who she was," Bill Gavigan said. "We had gone from having this daughter who was perfectly normal, happy, vibrant ... with a bright future ahead.\u000a\u000a"All of a sudden, this all came crashing down."\u000a\u000aThen, one day, Gavigan disappeared.\u000a\u000a"We didn't know where she was for more than 24 hours," her father said.\u000a\u000aShe had gotten in her car and driven from Pennsylvania to New Jersey with no money. She went right through toll booths without paying. But she eventually found her way back to her grandparents' house, still convinced that she was being followed.\u000a\u000aHer grandfather peered out the window, looking for something suspicious. But they soon realized there was no one after her.\u000a\u000a"I get emotional when I think about it," said Gavigan's grandfather Joseph Chiumento.\u000a\u000aHer parents showed up and took her to the hospital.\u000a\u000aEmily Gavigan began exhibiting odd behavior when she was 19, which doctors mistook for a mental illness.\u000a\u000aSay, 'I love you, dad'\u000a\u000aDoctors initially thought Gavigan had a mental illness. She spent time in different psychiatric facilities, which made her family uneasy. One in particular reminded her father of the movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."\u000a\u000a"They just kept trying medication after medication after medication, and none of it worked," Bill Gavigan said.\u000a\u000aThings kept getting worse. There was some numbness in her face and hands, and she would develop seizures. Doctors went looking for something that might be wrong with her brain -- a tumor, perhaps -- but found none. She was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis but continued to decline.\u000a\u000aIn a video that the Gavigan family shared with CNN, Bill asks his daughter how she's feeling today. She opens her mouth, and her tongue moves like she's about to respond.\u000a\u000a"Say, 'I love you, dad,' " he nudges.\u000a\u000aShe shakes her head weakly. No.\u000a\u000aTwist of fate\u000a\u000aA year after Gavigan started having symptoms, her family noticed something peculiar on an episode of NBC's "Today" show. The guest was Susannah Cahalan , a reporter at the New York Post who had written an article about her "mysterious lost month of madness."\u000a\u000a"Who knows how many people out there are suffering from what I suffered from and are just not getting the diagnosis that they need?" Cahalan told the talk show hosts.\u000a\u000aCahalan's story sounded familiar to the Gavigans. She had become paranoid and exhibited odd behavior, just like Emily. She became convinced that she had bed bugs, and she could feel them on her left hand and face, according to neurologist Dr. Souhel Najjar, who treated Cahalan.\u000a\u000aBut Najjar had a hunch that Cahalan might have a neurological problem, not a purely psychiatric one.\u000a\u000aSo he asked asked Cahalan to draw a clock, and she drew all the numbers bunched up on the right side. This alone couldn't make a diagnosis, but it clued doctors in that something could be misfiring on the right side of her brain.\u000a\u000aThat something, it turned out, could be treated.\u000a\u000aThe wrong target\u000a\u000aThe key to making the right diagnosis is a simple test on the blood or spinal fluid, Najjar said. You just have to know what you're looking for: a type of antibody.\u000a\u000aTo fight off disease, the immune system makes antibodies, Y-shaped proteins that attack foreign invaders like bacteria or viruses. But sometimes, those proteins can attack our own bodies. This is known as autoimmune disease.\u000a\u000aIn Cahalan's case, those antibodies were directed against a receptor in her brain: the NMDA receptor, which plays a role in how brain cells communicate with each other. The receptor takes part in the brain's normal functioning, from memory to breathing.\u000a\u000aThe disease was given a name in 2007: anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, or NMDARE for short. Had Cahalan had the disease a few years prior, there would have been no diagnosis to give her.\u000a\u000a"The disease is definitely not new," said Dr. Josep Dalmau, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is credited with discovering the disease.\u000a\u000aMany patients have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, Dalmau said. Some have been admitted to psychiatric units, where they were given medications, electroconvulsive therapies and other treatments that probably made their symptoms worse, he added.\u000a\u000aThere are over 15 known types of autoimmune encephalitis, according to the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance. Meaning the immune system can attack other brain receptors, too.\u000a\u000aThousands and thousands of cases\u000a\u000aDr. Belinda Lennox, a psychiatrist and researcher at the University of Oxford, believes that we should be testing for autoimmune encephalitis more routinely. After she learned about NMDARE, she wondered how many of her own patients might have it.\u000a\u000a"It seemed to me a very simple, straightforward thing just to test the people in my service using the same blood test," she said.\u000a\u000aAmong the first 46 patients Lennox tested, all with their first episodes of psychosis, three tested positive for the antibody. Based on symptoms alone, those patients looked no different from the other 43.\u000a\u000a"That was the alarming bit," she said. "They didn't stand out."\u000a\u000aLennox published these findings in 2011. In December, she published another study in The Lancet Psychiatry of 228 patients with first-episode psychosis. She found that 9% of the patients had antibodies against a range of brain cell receptors. She found some of these antibodies in healthy people too, but none of them had the NMDA variety.\u000a\u000aNot all doctors agree with Lennox that we should be routinely testing for the antibodies when a patient is psychotic, at least based on what we know now. Dalmau himself has argued that just because those antibodies are there doesn't mean they necessarily cause psychosis.\u000a\u000aStill, Lennox wonders what portion of mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, can be traced back to medical causes. And while the question isn't without controversy, doctors agree that NMDARE is more common than previously thought.\u000a\u000a"In 2007, we have around close to 10 cases," Najjar recalled. "In 2010, there was a presentation of around a hundred cases, and now we have ... thousands and thousands of cases.\u000a\u000a"The rising incidence of (autoimmune encephalitis) is because of the rise in awareness."\u000a\u000aFinally, a diagnosis\u000a\u000aAfter seeing Cahalan's story on TV, Gavigan's parents urged doctors to test her for it. But the doctors initially dismissed the idea.\u000a\u000aEmily Gavigan, left, said she wouldn't have survived her autoimmune disease if journalist Susannah Cahalan hadn't told her story publicly.\u000a\u000a"You two have to come to grips with the fact that you have a child with mental illness," her father recalls one doctor saying. "You're not doing anybody any favors by grasping at these type of straws."\u000a\u000aBut her parents' persistence paid off, and she was eventually tested.\u000a\u000aAfter a lengthy series of hospital stays -- after being hooked up to a ventilator, after the seizures, after developing a blood clot in her brain following a new treatment -- the Gavigans had an answer.\u000a\u000a"Everybody was cheering that we had a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis," Gavigan said.\u000a\u000aStill, a long road to recovery lay ahead.\u000a\u000aOne step forward, two steps back\u000a\u000a"Recovery is a very complicated, one-step-forward, two-steps-back process," said Cahalan, who could not read, write or walk when she was released from the hospital in 2009.\u000a\u000aWhen the disease is identified and treated, patients typically recover, but some spend weeks or months in rehab. They may even have a relapse of the disease down the line.\u000a\u000aThe disease is treated with medications that suppress the immune system, like steroids, and treatments that counteract the harmful antibodies.\u000a\u000aGavigan, a passionate figure skater, had a long way to go from her wheelchair.\u000a\u000a"It did take a long time for Emily to fully recover, but there were some milestones," Bill Gavigan said. "It was probably about a year after Emily was released from the hospital that she got back on the ice."\u000a\u000aHe shared this milestone with Cahalan, who was sitting at her desk at the New York Post when she first heard from the Gavigan family.\u000a\u000a"I just remember clicking that video ... and just watching her twirl around that ice and just crying in the middle of the newsroom," Cahalan said. "I couldn't believe that ... my story helped her find an answer, helped her find a diagnosis."\u000a\u000aPaying it forward\u000a\u000aIn November 2012, Cahalan made another appearance on "Today" -- but this time, it was with Emily and Bill Gavigan at her side. Cahalan had just published the New York Times bestseller about her illness, "Brain on Fire."\u000a\u000a"If she wasn't able to tell her story, then I wouldn't have gotten a diagnosis," Gavigan told CNN. "That connection, it was just surreal."\u000a\u000aNow, it was time for her to help fill those shoes.\u000a\u000aMadison Jensen was diagnosed and treated for autoimmune encephalitis.\u000a\u000aIn Omaha, Nebraska, yet another family, the Jensens, eventually heard about their story. Their 6-year-old daughter, Madison, had been throwing tantrums, drooling and sometimes forgetting how to speak or read.\u000a\u000aMandy Jensen, Madison's mother, went back and found the "Today" clip online. It was just the clue they needed to get to the correct diagnosis.\u000a\u000aAnother coincidence: The episode originally aired the same day her daughter was first admitted to the hospital.\u000a\u000aSusannah Cahalan, right, wrote about her rare autoimmune disease, leading others to a correct diagnosis -- including Madison Jensen, left, and Emily Gavigan.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"It's like divine intervention or something," Jensen said. "They saved Madison's life."\u000a\u000aMadison Jensen, now 10 years old and an avid soccer player, hopes that telling her own story will drive other families and doctors to the correct diagnosis -- just like Cahalan did for Gavigan and they did for her.\u000a\u000a"They helped me when they were on the 'Today' show," Madison said. "Maybe we could help someone, and then ... it'd just keep going."

aVMarc J. Randazza is a Las Vegas-based First Amendment attorney and managing partner of the Randazza Legal Group. Follow him on Twitter: @marcorandazza. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Donald Trump has said a lot of strange things -- some funny, some creepy, but none scarier than what he said on Friday : that if he is elected president, he will "open up our libel laws" to make it easier to sue the media and "win lots of money." No matter what you may think about his other policy ideas, if he keeps this promise, we won't be able to effectively express dissent against anything else he might want to do. We can fight any bad policy if we have a robust First Amendment.\u000a\u000aSome say that Trump is just being a blowhard, that he doesn't know what he is talking about, and that for all his bluster, there is nothing he could or would do.\u000a\u000aI am not so sure. Trump has a history of filing SLAPP suits. SLAPP stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. This describes a lawsuit filed against someone for exercising his or her First Amendment rights -- filed with little chance of success, but with the knowledge that the lawsuit itself is the punishment. After all, if people have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves because they criticized Donald Trump, they might think better of doing so again in the future.\u000a\u000aHowever, some states, like California and Nevada , have strong anti-SLAPP laws, which dispense with such cases early and force the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorneys' fees. (Full disclosure: I was instrumental in urging passage of the Nevada Anti-SLAPP law.)\u000a\u000aTrump recently got stung with an anti-SLAPP decision, which he probably had in mind when he spoke about "opening up" our libel laws. In fact, he isn't the first big shot to try to make it easier to sue for defamation after having a SLAPP suit blow up in his face.\u000a\u000aTherefore, Trump is clearly frustrated with anti-SLAPP laws (which shows that they work) and the landmark defamation case, New York Times v. Sullivan.\u000a\u000aWhen people say that Trump can't do anything about defamation law at the federal level, I think they miss the point that there is a lot of support for a federal anti-SLAPP law. I think we need one, and in fact, HR 2304 was one such proposal this last session. If it passes, we could expect President Trump to veto it.\u000a\u000aBeyond new federal legislation, defamation law is a matter of state law, leaving little for a president to do about it. To win a defamation case, the plaintiff must show publication of a false statement of fact that damages the plaintiff's reputation. This standard can vary a bit from state to state, but it generally fits that general set of requirements.\u000a\u000aTherefore, what could Trump do to "open up" the libel laws? He personally? Nothing legally, but if elected, he could pick Supreme Court justices willing to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan, which is in my view the most important case protecting our First Amendment rights. It is the greatest protection we have from government officials or powerful businesses choking the life out of public debate and a free press. Overturning it would change everything we know about freedom of the press.\u000a\u000aIn a defamation case involving an ordinary citizen suing for defamation, the citizen only needs to show that the defendant knew the statement was false, or failed to exercise "reasonable care" before publishing it. So let's say that a blogger writes an article about a private citizen accusing that person of a crime, based on a false statement by a witness, without following up. That might be a failure to exercise reasonable care, and the blogger might lose the case.\u000a\u000aBut if the same blogger wrote one about a public figure, like Trump, then Trump has to prove that the blogger did so with "actual malice."\u000a\u000aEven some judges and lawyers get this wrong, so don't feel bad if you didn't know what "actual malice" means. It has nothing to do with "malice" at all. It means that the defendant published the statement knowing it was false or with a reckless disregard for the truth.\u000a\u000aSo if we return to my example, let's say someone wrote a blog post about Donald Trump, accusing him of a crime, but based it just on an anonymous email, without following up -- that might be considered to be "reckless disregard."\u000a\u000aWhy the different standard depending on the plaintiff?\u000a\u000aFrom New York Times v. Sullivan: "(W)e consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."\u000a\u000aDebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open... Justice William Brennan\u000a\u000aHow beautiful that language is. It encapsulates what America is all about, the way only Justice William Brennan could.\u000a\u000aThe court recognized that public figures have access to the media to defend themselves, and it went on to reject any notion that the speaker must prove truth; instead the plaintiff must prove falsity. This is all because the First Amendment needs "breathing space" in order for free speech to survive. And if we impose liability for merely erroneous reports on political conduct, it would reflect the "obsolete doctrine that the governed must not criticize their governors."\u000a\u000aSo what if Trump appoints one or two Supreme Court judges who are willing to overturn Sullivan? Justice Elena Kagan has already voiced skepticism about the extension of Sullivan too far into other kinds of libel cases. The only member of the court I think we could count on to be strongly opposed to overturning it is Chief Justice John Roberts.\u000a\u000aNo matter how flawed it is, our democracy depends upon robust free speech and free press rights. New York Times v. Sullivan matters more than anything else. If we lose the right to criticize the government in wide-open and robust debate, we lose an important part of what it means to be free.

aVThere is no Olympics and no US presidential election in 2017, so we\u2019ve added some new questions this year. Where will Donald Trump visit first as president? Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize? Check out the predictions for these questions and more:\u000a\u000aHow did they do? CNN legal analyst Paul Callan deserves a special shout out for being the only person to predict both a Donald Trump election victory and that the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series, although the strong performance of the Dow Jones Index in 2016 took all our contributors by surprise.\u000a\u000aAbout this time last year, we asked a group of CNN commentators for their predictions for some of the big political and cultural events of the year.\u000a\u000aPaul Callan CNN Legal Analyst @PaulCallan Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Trump will travel to the one country on Earth that will warmly welcome the new US President while Americans cheer as well: Israel. He is respected there for his pro-Israel and anti-Iranian foreign policy positions. Daughter Ivanka\u2019s conversion to the Jewish faith won\u2019t hurt, either. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Patriots will win again, this time using fully inflated footballs. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Martin Scorsese\u2019s 28-year \u201cpassion project\u201d Silence, a film about the Japanese Roman Catholic rebellion against the Tokugawa shogunate in 17th Century Japan will win the Oscar for Best Picture. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Great Britain\u2019s Andy Murray will once again win the men\u2019s final while Germany\u2019s Angelique Kerber will win the woman\u2019s title. Who will win the World Series? Chicago Cubs do it again with their strong, young team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for her humanitarian efforts regarding Europe\u2019s growing Muslim refugee crisis. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The Dow will hit 22,000 as lower taxes and fewer government regulations stimulate a growing and vibrant US economy. Sadly, air quality diminishes as fossil fuel use skyrockets with the acquiescence of the EPA. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? While Presidential approval ratings are generally high during the first \u201choneymoon year,\u201d constant controversies will prevent Trump from ever getting a traditional honeymoon. He will, nevertheless, achieve a high 55% approval rating as the US economy improves in 2017 because in the words of James Carville: It\u2019s \u201cthe economy, stupid.\u201d\u000a\u000aDanny Cevallos CNN Legal Analyst @CevallosLaw Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Traditionally, the first state visit is to Canada\u2026but how likely is Donald Trump to feel bound to tradition? He\u2019s already been to Mexico and met with President Enrique Peña Nieto -- a country everyone believed he\u2019d long ago alienated. So, although it sounds unbelievable, maybe\u2026the Philippines? Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots -- because America loves a dynasty. Doesn\u2019t it? America? Hello? Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? "Manchester by the Sea"! Everyone\u2019s already said it\u2019s going to win the Oscar and I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea what it is even about yet. The majority is clearly behind this film and the majority vote is always right, right? Hello? Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Wimbledon? Ummm. I\u2019ll say that guy Murray. And a Williams? A Williams will win the women\u2019s final. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Based on the buzz right now..."Manchester by the Sea". Who will win the World Series? As insufferable as all my Chicago friends have been, the Cubbies will win the Series again. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? My \u201clockzilla\u201d prediction is 19,500. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? I\u2019m going to say 35%, but then again, predicting the predictability of polls is\u2026unpredictable.\u000a\u000aLanhee Chen CNN Commentator @lanheechen Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Israel. It's our staunchest ally and friend in the Middle East, a region that Trump will likely place significant focus on as he begins his presidency. Which team will win the Super Bowl? Even with their starting quarterback injured, I'm going with the Oakland Raiders. It's my team and the closest they've been to the playoffs in a long time, so I'm sticking with them. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? "Moonlight." I don't follow these things closely but Google says it's an incredible film. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray and Madison Keys. Who will win the World Series? Los Angeles Dodgers. Here again, picking my team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis. He's overdue. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 22,100. Think it will be another strong year for markets, as the Fed acts predictably and investors look forward to Trump's pro-growth policies. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 50%. It remains a divided country, but a productive first 100 days should carry him to a decent showing at year-end.\u000a\u000aSE Cupp CNN Commentator @secupp Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? The layup is, of course, to say Russia, right? But I'm betting it's Israel or the UK. Which team will win the Super Bowl? I'm required to say the Green Bay Packers. But the Patriots will greedily win it again. Because it's been nearly a year. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Most early Oscar buzz is for movies that are just about to come out, so it's hard to say. But I will lose my ISH if it's a Star Wars product. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? My New York Metropolitans! Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? If there is any good left in the world, it should be the White Helmets, who have done more to stem the Syrian genocide than any other group or body, voluntarily and at great sacrifice. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 20,000, baby! What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 60%+\u000a\u000aFrida Ghitis CNN Opinion Contributor @FridaGhitis Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Donald Trump likes to make brazen, unpredictable moves. A visit to China would fit the bill. He has been needling Beijing, with provocative statements that undercut decades of US policy. In Beijing he could present his demands to the Chinese and discuss what he expects them to do about the growing threat from China\u2019s friend, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots. Still, don\u2019t bet on politics staying out of the game, or out of Lady Gaga\u2019s halftime show, a reminder that political tensions will be hard to escape in 2017. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? The winner will be \u201cLion,\u201d an astonishing story of survival, with elements that can provide a sense of pride and optimism to people of different ethnicities and economic conditions. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Serena Williams will win the women\u2019s final, and instead of debating whether she is the best female athlete of all time, the sports world will ask if she is the best athlete of all time. The men\u2019s title will go to Novak Djokovic. Who will win the World Series? The experts said Trump had as much of a chance of becoming president as the Chicago Cubs had of winning the World Series. They both won. I say the Cubs win again. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Syria\u2019s White Helmets. It will be a gesture from an international community rightly ashamed over its failure to stop the carnage. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The markets will climb during Trump\u2019s first year in office, as he launches a massive government spending infrastructure plan. The Dow Jones will close 21,800. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 34%. Backers will support him passionately, but most Americans will feel revulsion watching blatant conflicts of interest and mounting scandals plaguing the Trump administration, openly calling for the President\u2019s impeachment.\u000a\u000aRoxanne Jones CNN Opinion Contributor @iamroxannejones Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Israel. Trump will visit and stage photo ops with like-minded hardliners against a Palestinian state in effort to rally the right and legitimize his pick of far-right David Friedman as Israeli ambassador. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Pittsburgh Steelers. I\u2019m a Philly girl. My Eagles fell off, but I\u2019ll stick with the home state. I\u2019m rolling with Le'Veon Bell, the best running back in the game. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? \u201cFences.\u201d Only the mega talented Denzel Washington could take August Wilson\u2019s theater masterpiece and turn it into a big screen blockbuster. Washington, along with co-star Viola Davis, make this a winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Going with the two classics here, and the best man and woman to ever play the game of tennis: Roger Federer and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? The Cubs. It would be preposterous to predict Chicago will win another MLB-best 103 games again, but the 2017 team is as strong as last year\u2019s club. Cubs will repeat. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Angela Merkel. If the Nobel is more than a popularity contest, the German Chancellor wins. After Brexit, anyone who could simultaneously stop the European Union from collapse, seek humane immigration policies, and, keep Vladimir Putin\u2019s power at bay is worthy of the Nobel. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 20,001. Today, Wall Street loves Trump and is eagerly awaiting his pro-business, no regulation policies. The Dow will break the 20,000 mark before it starts to tumble. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? 40%. Trump will see high approval ratings early in the year but by the end of 2017, his approval rating will begin to drop.\u000a\u000aPeniel Joseph CNN Opinion Contributor @PenielJoseph Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? President Trump\u2019s first visit abroad will be to Russia, where he will meet with Vladimir Putin, a leader he repeatedly expressed admiration for during the election, as the first step toward easing economic sanctions. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The New York Giants go on another magical run, defeating the New England Patriots 27-24 \u2013 and beating them for the third time in nine years -- to win the big game. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? The Oscar will go to "Moonlight", a searing examination of a young gay black boy\u2019s coming of age under extraordinarily challenging circumstances in Florida. A film that humanizes experiences often reduced to stereotypes or flat out ignored. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. Who will win the World Series? The New York Yankees shock the world with a talented young roster to win their 28th championship. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Institute, which has emerged as the conscience of America\u2019s broken criminal justice system. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? The Dow will close above 20,000 on the last day of the year. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? President Trump\u2019s approval ratings will hover around 50% buoyed by Wall St. friendly policies, but hurt by rhetorical gaffes, lack of press access, and endless controversies.\u000a\u000aDean Obeidallah CNN Opinion Contributor @TheDeansreport Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Russia, to thank Vladimir Putin for his help winning the election. Which team will win the Super Bowl? Being a diehard New York Giants fan I\u2019m predicting the Giants win it all. But if they don\u2019t I will be rooting for any time playing against the dreaded New England Patriots. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Sure, it\u2019s a longshot but then again so was Trump. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m too busy rooting for the Giants and rooting against the New England Patriots to watch tennis. Who will win the World Series? New York Mets. That was easy. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Not sure, but I\u2019m pretty confident that the winner will not be named Donald Trump. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? 21,220.12 or 21,220.13. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? What is the all-time lowest? Whatever that is I predict Trump will be below that. In fact by end of 2017 I predict the only ones approving of Trump\u2019s job as president will be named Trump.\u000a\u000aRaul Reyes CNN Opinion Contributor @RaulAReyes Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? The Philippines, to see the controversial Rodrigo Duterte. This would bolster American influence in the Pacific -- and the Philippines is home to Manila\u2019s Trump Tower. Which team will win the Super Bowl? The Dallas Cowboys. Their defense is on an upswing, their offense is consistently great, and Dak Prescott is unstoppable. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? Best Picture will go to La La Land: a romantic tribute to movie musicals, visually stunning, with a strong ending. Oscar voters love movies about the movies. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Novak Djokovic will make a comeback and win at Wimbledon in 2017. The Queen, Serena Williams, will too, with her amazing combination of physical and mental strength. Who will win the World Series? The Chicago Cubs will win the World Series. Yes, lightning will strike twice in our lifetime for this young, talented team. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis will win the Nobel Peace Prize. Although no pope has won the honor, he deserves it for his peace efforts and work on behalf of refugees. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictability will keep growth in check despite his pro-business policies. Look for the Dow to stay static around 19,000. What will Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating be in Gallup\u2019s final survey of 2017? Trump\u2019s approval will be 40% by the end of 2017. Half of the country will be exhausted by his erratic behavior, and the other half will be angry at his broken promises.\u000a\u000aMel Robbins CNN Commentator @melrobbins Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President? Russia is likely the first stop, particularly with Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Which team will win the Super Bowl? New England Patriots. Deflategate is in the rearview mirror and Brady is in his prime. The only question is whether their defense can win it. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? La La Land. It\u2019s the classic insider plot movie that the Academy loves to make a winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the men's. It\u2019s time for an upset. And Serena Williams will win the women's. It's her time. Who will win the World Series? The Chicago Cubs. How epic would that be? I mean really. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? Pope Francis. I would have loved for the Syria White Helmets to win, but I am deeply afraid that with the current decimation of Aleppo, by the time the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded it will be last year's news.

Check out Trump's Twitter account and you\u2019ll see a guy who\u2019s primary focus is his ego -- not the 300 million people he\u2019s been elected to serve. Tweeting insults at people won\u2019t change lives in the Rust Belt -- or elsewhere in the country. SNL\u2019s satirical skits about Trump will remain a hit, but Trump\u2019s approval rating will be on the decline.\u000a\u000aTara Setmayer CNN Political Commentator @TaraSetmayer Which country will Donald Trump visit first as President?

Great Britain. Trump is half British, he has businesses in the UK and he loves Brexit. It\u2019s one country that wouldn\u2019t riot if he showed up. Which team will win the Super Bowl? No idea. Which movie will win the Oscar for Best Picture? La La Land. We need a feel-good winner. Who will win the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon? Who will win the women\u2019s final? Andy Murray is still at the top of his game. Someone called Williams for the women\u2019s. Who will win the World Series? No idea. My knowledge of sport is limited to tennis and beer pong. Who will win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017? I hope that it\u2019s won by a group responsible for bringing peace and transition to Syria. What will be the closing level for the Dow Jones on the last day of 2017? High. If Republicans proceed swiftly with their tax cut plan, we should see a surge in confidence.

aVMelissa Blake is a freelance writer and blogger from Illinois. She covers disability rights and women's issues and has written for The New York Times, Good Housekeeping, Glamour and Racked, among others. Read her blog, So About What I Said, and follow her on Twitter . The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It takes more than guts to be a woman in 2017.\u000a\u000aThis is especially true on social media, where Donald Trump and his supporters have become 21st century schoolyard bullies and Twitter is their playground.\u000a\u000aI've been navigating that playground since the November presidential election. In fact, I spent two solid days blocking vile people on Twitter recently after witnessing a truly scary side of humanity -- a side that, sadly, has only been swiftly gaining steam.\u000a\u000aAfter I challenged Paul Nehlen, a former Republican congressional candidate, on Twitter this summer, his supporters insulted my appearance and mocked how I looked, with one even going so far as to say I should be euthanized.\u000a\u000aWhat egregious sin had I committed? I dared to stand up to misogyny -- to a man hurling vile words at a woman.\u000a\u000aAfter Nehlen insulted comedian Sarah Silverman on Twitter (he called her a "skank"), I simply suggested that he shouldn't be calling women names if he wanted to run for public office. From there, things went downhill pretty quickly. He proceeded to mansplain to me and criticize the publications I've written for, and pretty soon, his followers were piling on.\u000a\u000aThe 140-character insults quickly devolved into jabs about my appearance (I'm physically disabled), going so far as to ask if I was a human. Is this the price of being a woman who speaks online in 2017?\u000a\u000aHere are just some of the words that were hurled my way\u000a\u000a--By the look of things diabetes will claim you before the next election.\u000a\u000a--Jesus, you might want to rethink that three dozen donuts.\u000a\u000a--That's pretty funny coming from a chick that could play Jabba's long lost daughter w/no makeup or cgi. #MovesLikeJabba\u000a\u000a-- Do you think it's human? Looks like a species of great ape.\u000a\u000a-- Why are you offended on behalf of women? Potatoes don't have genders.\u000a\u000aThere may have been other taunts. As I sat there scrolling through my feed, I felt more exposed and vulnerable than I'd ever felt before. Strangers who knew nothing about me reduced me to an object. I felt violated, and that broke me.\u000a\u000aThrough all those emotions, though, one conclusion became crystal clear: Women aren't safe anymore. Not in real life and not in cyberspace. Because what happened to me? It was assault. Sure, it may not have been the physical kind, but make no mistake about it, as I read through those cruel words, it felt like I was being ripped apart.\u000a\u000aThanks to social media, assault can't be so narrowly understood anymore.\u000a\u000aDoes any of this remind you of anyone? More and more, President Trump's high-profile treatment of women online highlights a dark and dangerous trend. The leader of our country has shown no hesitation in going after women who challenge him and shown no interest in restraining his supporters from attacking everyone.\u000a\u000aAs a candidate, he targeted Megyn Kelly and took no action against his supporters who threatened her. He also attacked an 18-year-old who challenged him at a political forum on Twitter in 2015, and his followers then harassed her viciously. As president, he mocked Mika Brzezinski for "bleeding badly from a face-lift."\u000a\u000aThere's already a long history of men tearing women down. Now, social media gives men more access to do this than ever before, as each tweet is perpetuating a culture of hate -- one where the strongest and most powerful are whoever can intimidate others or ridicule them into silence.\u000a\u000a"In a culture that seems to value women for how they look over what they say or do, it's no surprise that many use attacks on women's looks as a go-to method of silencing them," says Renee Engeln, psychology professor at Northwestern University and author of "Beauty Sick: How the Cultural Obsession with Appearance Hurts Girls and Women."\u000a\u000a"In the past, if all you knew about a writer was what that writer said, you were limited to attacking ideas instead of physical appearance."\u000a\u000aThis is the culture women face every day. This is our reality. It's disgusting.\u000a\u000aSince when is it a bad thing for women to be outspoken, have opinions and express them, anyway? Until those tweets filled my notifications, I'd never felt like I had to silence myself -- in any part of my life -- and speaking my mind has always made me feel empowered. But men like Nehlen, Trump and their supporters seem to be threatened by the very thought that a woman will speak up.\u000a\u000aThere will be those people who say that I shouldn't say anything, that I'll never be able to change people's minds. They'll caution me not to rock the boat or make too big a deal of this. And to those people, I say this: What if you had said that to Susan B. Anthony during women's suffrage or to Rosa Parks during the civil rights movement? What if you had told them they shouldn't be so outspoken? And what if they'd listened?\u000a\u000aWe'd no doubt be living in a very different world. I shudder to think what humanity would be like, don't you?\u000a\u000aBecause every time we choose silence over speaking up, that line of normalization widens the circle just a little, as if to say, "Yes, this behavior is perfectly acceptable."\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aI won't lie -- I'm afraid of this world we're living in, but I'm more afraid saying nothing. I often wonder what future generations of women will think. As Engeln says, "We look to the behavior of others to learn about cultural norms and appropriate behavior. When our leaders model humility and kindness, that can increase our tendency toward humility and kindness. When they model cruelty, cruelty becomes normalized and loses its shock value."\u000a\u000aIn that tangled web of hateful tweets, someone called me the Purveyor of the Matriarchy. It was meant to be an insult, but I couldn't help but see it as a compliment -- a call to duty, even.\u000a\u000aI'm never going to be quiet, especially not on Twitter and social media. I'm not going away. And I'll always stand up -- and speak out -- for women everywhere.

aV(CNN) Meals from the sunny Mediterranean have been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life, along with a reduced risk for diabetes and high blood pressure.\u000a\u000aNow you can add lowering your risk for dementia to the ever growing list of reasons to follow the Mediterranean diet or one of its dietary cousins.\u000a\u000aNew research being presented at the Alzheimer's Association International conference in London this week found healthy older adults who followed the Mediterranean or the similar MIND diet lowered their risk of dementia by a third.\u000a\u000a"Eating a healthy plant-based diet is associated with better cognitive function and around 30% to 35% lower risk of cognitive impairment during aging," said lead author Claire McEvoy, of the University of California, San Francisco's School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aMcEvoy stressed that because the study was conducted in a nationally representative older population "the findings are relevant to the general public."\u000a\u000a"While 35% is a greater than expected decrease for a lifestyle choice, I am not surprised," said Rudolph Tanzi, who directs the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and recently co-authored a book with Deepak Chopra on genes and aging called "Super Genes."\u000a\u000a"The activity of our genes is highly dependent on four main factors: diet, exercise, sleep and stress management," said Tanzi, who was not involved in the study. "Of these, perhaps diet is most important."\u000a\u000aMcEvoy's study investigated at the eating habits of nearly 6,000 older Americans with an average age of 68. After adjusting for age, gender, race, low educational attainment and lifestyle and health issues -- such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, depression, smoking and physical inactivity -- researchers found that those who followed the MIND or Mediterranean diet had a 30% to 35% lower risk of cognitive impairment.\u000a\u000aThe more people stayed on those diets, said McEvoy, the better they functioned cognitively.\u000a\u000aThose who marginally followed the diet also benefited, but by a much smaller margin. They were 18% less likely to exhibit signs of cognitive impairment.\u000a\u000aWhat are the Mediterranean and MIND diets?\u000a\u000aForget lasagne, pizza, spanakopita and lamb souvlaki -- they are not on the daily menu of those who live by the sunny Mediterranean seaside.\u000a\u000aThe true diet is simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra virgin olive oil. Say goodbye to refined sugar or flour and fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all.\u000a\u000aMeat can make a rare appearance, but usually only to flavor a dish. Instead, meals may include eggs, dairy and poultry, but in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. Fish, however, are a staple.\u000a\u000aThe MIND diet takes the best brain foods of the Mediterranean diet and the famous salt-reducing DASH diet, and puts them together. MIND encourages a focus on eating from 10 healthy food groups while rejecting foods from five unhealthy groups.\u000a\u000aMIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, with DASH standing for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.\u000a\u000aMIND was developed by Martha Clare Morris, a nutritional epidemiologist at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center in the US.\u000a\u000aThose who follow MIND reject butter and stick margarine, red meats, cheeses, fried or fast food and sweets. Instead, they eat at least six servings a week of green leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale, and at least one serving a day of another vegetable. Three servings a day of whole grains are a must.\u000a\u000aThey also add in at least three servings of beans, two or more servings of berries, two servings of chicken or turkey, and once serving of fish each week. Olive oil is their main cooking ingredient, and they drink a glass of wine a day.\u000a\u000aMorris has some powerful stats behind her diet.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, she studied 923 Chicago-area seniors and found those who say they followed the diet religiously had a 53% lower chance of getting Alzheimer's, while those who followed it moderately lowered their risk by about 35%. Follow-up observational studies showed similar benefits.\u000a\u000aMorris and her colleagues are currently recruiting volunteers for a three-year clinical study to try to prove the link.\u000a\u000aAdditional evidence\u000a\u000aA second study presented at the conference also examined the impact of the MIND diet. Researchers from Wake Forest School of Medicine followed 7,057 women, average age 71, over almost 10 years and found those who most closely followed the MIND diet had a 34% reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer's.\u000a\u000aA third study at the conference looked at the dietary habits of 2,223 dementia-free Swedish adults over six years who followed the Nordic Prudent Dietary Pattern (NPDP) diet, which avoids sweets and fatty and processed foods. Instead, the diet emphasizes eating non-root vegetables, apple/pears/peaches, pasta/rice, poultry, fish, vegetable oils, tea and water, and light to moderate wine intake.\u000a\u000aSwedes who stuck to the diet at a moderate or higher level preserved their cognitive function better than those who ate more processed and fatty foods.\u000a\u000aLastly, a fourth study examined MRI brain scans of 330 cognitively normal adults, with an average age of 79, and found eating foods that raise inflammation in the body -- such as sweets, processed foods and fried and fatty foods -- raised the risk for a shrinking "aging" brain and lower cognitive function.\u000a\u000aThat comes as no surprise to neurologist Rudy Tanzi.\u000a\u000a"Foods that keep blood pressure normal, provide us with antioxidants, and maintain healthy bacteria in our gut, or microbiome, will serve to help keep chronic inflammation in check in the brain and entire body," said Tanzi.\u000a\u000aDespite the similarities of the results, experts point out that all of this research is observational, meaning that it is based on reports by individuals as to what they eat. To prove the connection between diet and dementia risk, said McEvoy, researchers will need to move to scientifically controlled experiments.\u000a\u000a"I think the studies, taken together, suggest a role for high quality dietary patterns in brain health and for protection against cognitive decline during aging," said McEvoy. "Diet is modifiable, and in light of these studies we need clinical trials to test whether changing diet can improve or maintain cognition."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aUntil that definite proof is available, say experts, there's no harm in using this information to makes changes in your diet and lifestyle that could help protect your brain.\u000a\u000a"Although the idea that a healthy diet can help protect against cognitive decline as we age is not new, the size and length of these four studies demonstrate how powerful good dietary practices may be in maintaining brain health and function," said Keith Fargo, Alzheimer's Association Director of Scientific Programs and Outreach.\u000a\u000aTanzi agrees. "It's about time we started placing a greater emphasis on what we eat as we strive to have our 'healthspan' keep up with our increasing 'lifespan'."

aV(CNN) Seven points in it, eight races to go.\u000a\u000aFormula One is revving up for the next installment of an absorbing world championship battle as Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton lock horns once again at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday.\u000a\u000aIn a season where the Ferrari and Mercedes drivers have wrestled for track supremacy, it's Vettel who arrives at Monza with a slender championship lead but it is Hamilton who has momentum after victory at last weekend's Belgian Grand Prix.\u000a\u000aHamilton hit the ground running after F1's summer break putting on a driving masterclass at Spa. The 32-year-old equaled Michael Schumacher's all-time F1 record of 68 poles during Saturday's qualifying before bossing the race to seal his fifth victory of the year.\u000a\u000aA repeat performance at Monza would hand Hamilton the initiative and inflict a psychological blow to Ferrari in front of their adoring Tifosi.\u000a\u000aIt's the most atmospheric race you can go to ... the passion just pours down from the grandstands Maurice Hamilton, F1 journalist and author\u000a\u000a"What would hurt if Lewis Hamilton wins this weekend is that he will lead the championship. It would also be the first time either he or Vettel have won consecutive grands prix -- that tells you how nip and tuck this season is between the two teams."\u000a\u000aMonza will provide the clearest guide yet as to whose engine -- Ferrari or Mercedes -- is the more powerful. The affectionately nicknamed "Temple of Speed" is F1's fastest circuit where drivers blast round at average speeds in excess of 150 mph.\u000a\u000aBack in 2004, Juan-Pablo Montoya recorded the fastest lap in F1 history at the track -- clocking an average speed of 162.95 mph (262.24 kph) in a Williams car.\u000a\u000aOne of only four tracks to feature on the inaugural F1 calendar in 1950 that are still used today, Monza is always one of the most eagerly anticipated races of the year.\u000a\u000aSilverstone maybe the sport's spiritual home, Monaco its shimmering seaside jewel, with Spa the track for the F1 purist, but Monza offers a full-blown adrenaline rush unlike anything else.\u000a\u000a"Along with Interlagos (Brazil) it is the most atmospheric race you can go to purely because of the passion that just pours down from the grandstands and enclosures," Hamilton says.\u000a\u000aSituated in the grounds of a former royal park north of Milan, Monza holds a noble status for F1 fans who flock from all over the world.\u000a\u000a"It's got such history, that's what strikes you ... the place is so vibrant, you get sucked along by it. Going there on a warm September afternoon -- there's nothing like it."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Sebastian Vettel on his past, present & future Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sebastian Vettel on his past, present & future 22:31\u000a\u000a'Lewis could win this'\u000a\u000aHistorically there is little to choose between Vettel and Hamilton at Monza. Both men have won three times and scored five podiums apiece, although the Briton's pole record is marginally better -- he has five to Vettel's three.\u000a\u000aMercedes has also dominated the last three races in Italy while Ferrari hasn't won since Fernando Alonso took the checkered flag back in 2010 -- the season Vettel pipped the Spaniard by four points to win his first of four consecutive world titles for Red Bull.\u000a\u000aThis year represents Ferrari's best chance yet to end the drought, although it's hard to look past Mercedes.\u000a\u000a"I think Lewis could win this," Hamilton said. "He's on top form, the car's working well, but he's being pushed. All things being equal he should win it. But last weekend was so close -- so there's nothing in it."\u000a\u000aThe Autodromo Nazionale Monza, north of Milan is once of F1's most famous race tracks\u000a\u000aVettel finished two seconds behind Hamilton in Belgium and speaking on Thursday, the German struck a quietly confident tone about Ferrari's chances at Monza before conceding that Mercedes probably have the edge.\u000a\u000a"The form we showed in Spa was real and the speed was there in the race," Vettel told reporters. "I think we've made improvements on all fronts and I'm very happy.\u000a\u000a"The track layout suits Mercedes, so we will do our best. There should be a good atmosphere (at Monza) so we will try to give something back."\u000a\u000aPhotos: Ferrari Under the Skin Ferrari 125-S, 1947 \u2013 The first ever Ferrari was fired up and left the Maranello factory gates 70 years ago.

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 18th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 On the shores of Dong Mo Lake, about 40 kilometers east of Hanoi, sequined dancers twirl with ribbons, while guitarists perform intimate concerts on rafts.\u000a\u000aThere's camping, yoga and swimming -- not to mention 40 hours of non-stop live music.\u000a\u000aIt might sound like Glastonbury but this, in fact, is Quest , a lifestyle festival now in its fifth year.\u000a\u000aIt's not alone. Hanoi, which has long been the country's creative heart, is challenging regional powerhouses such as Tokyo, Singapore and Seoul for the festival capital of Asia title.\u000a\u000a"Hanoi absolutely has potential to become a music hub in Asia -- there's a strong cultural underpinning to work with," Jeremy Wellard, co-founder of Quest, tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"As Vietnam's economy keeps growing, and as social structures change, we are going to see the country become a player in the arts and culture scene."\u000a\u000aA new beat\u000a\u000aHanoi's 7.5 million inhabitants famously buzz around in an impenetrable, deafening sea of motorbikes.\u000a\u000aDespite this, the city retains a quaint, historic feel with its low-rise colonial architecture and leafy promenades.\u000a\u000aIt was this romantic vibe that inspired Wellard to relocate to Hanoi from Australia, where he'd helped organize music events such as Brisbane's hip-hop festival Stylin'Up and the G20 Cultural Celebrations , a citywide arts and culture festival.\u000a\u000aIn 2011, Wellard and a few friends spent a weekend at Son Tinh Camp, at Dong Mo.\u000a\u000aA freshwater lake, forests, tents for rent ... they quickly saw its potential.\u000a\u000a"We wanted to bring that festival atmosphere to Hanoi, at a place that felt like an escape, without the city bearing down on us," he says.\u000a\u000aA performance at Quest.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Quest launched as a "really DIY project," with roughly 250 festival-goers. This year, it'll be 20 times that size, with five stages and about 5,000 guests between November 10 and 12.\u000a\u000aEnglish pioneers of ambient house The Orb are on the line-up, alongside gypsy-electro-nu-rave act Slamboree Sound System, Hanoi's own house and techno artist DJ Tùng Tím and dreamy Indonesian pop act Stars and Rabbit.\u000a\u000a"We were lucky to be around at a time when Hanoi really started to open up to the outside world and the tastes of Vietnamese were opening up," says Wellard.\u000a\u000aPlease don't stop the music\u000a\u000aQuest isn't an anomaly.\u000a\u000aThis April, house and techno festival Equation joined Hanoi's festival scene, at the same camp site as Quest at Dong Mo Lake.\u000a\u000aEquation festival debuted in April.\u000a\u000aIts founders -- the team behind Cliche Records , a Hong Kong-based music label, booking and promotion agency -- tell CNN that Hanoi was the obvious choice for their event.\u000a\u000a"Hong Kong was saturated and too hard to pull off," Ouissam Mokretar, one of the festival's co-founders, tells CNN. "Seoul and Japan have the same problem, with space and pricing.\u000a\u000a"China, Manila and Bangkok are so hard with the politics and the laws. But Vietnam is still emerging. Travelers are coming and falling in love with the country and local kids want to experience new things."\u000a\u000aEquation revolves around two main stages, with a third platform in the wings for yoga, film screenings and craft workshops.\u000a\u000aMore than 30 acts performed over three days, including American electronic musician DJ Shlomo Alex from Tokyo (now based in Berlin), and Norwegian act Telephones\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Monsoon Music Festival -- which has hosted Grammy-winner Joss Stone and German rock band the Scorpions -- returns for the third time this autumn, with thousands of guests expected at the Citadel of Thang Long, a historic fort south of West Lake.\u000a\u000aA city on the move\u000a\u000aMokretar says Hanoi's expanding festival scene is thanks, in part, to the city's growing network of budget flights.\u000a\u000aIn the past year, VietJet has launched direct routes from Hanoi to Yangon, Seoul, Busan, and Siem Reap -- with a link to Kuala Lumpur to follow this September.\u000a\u000aFellow low-cost carrier Jetstar Pacific Airlines also introduced affordable, direct flights to Osaka earlier this year.\u000a\u000aOuissam Mokretar, Equation festival co-founder \u201c(Hanoi is) much more connected now than just a year ago -- the difference from 2016 is crazy.\u201d\u000a\u000a"(Hanoi is) much more connected now than just a year ago -- the difference from 2016 is crazy," recalls Mokretar.\u000a\u000a"Tickets are almost 50% cheaper. Last year, flying between Taipei and Hanoi cost around $400, but now VietJet opened a route and it's only $150."\u000a\u000aThe relative affordability of attending a festival in Hanoi, compared with Hong Kong or Tokyo, also has an impact.\u000a\u000aTickets to Quest, for example, cost $57 for the three-day weekend, compared with $208 for a three-day ticket to Hong Kong's annual Clockenflap festival.\u000a\u000aAn appetite for music\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 8 Down time at the Japan Ultra Music Festival . A glittery haven for hardcore EDM junkies, the festival takes place again this September in Tokyo's Odaiba Ultra Park.\u000a\u000aNana Nguyen, a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman who has attended Quest for the past four years, says it has an open-minded, "free love" mentality -- much like what you might expect to find at European or American festivals.\u000a\u000a"The (countryside) festival location might be a little inconvenient, but once you're there in nature, you feel really refreshed, relaxed and free," Nguyen tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"It's good to have that break from the city. We're all working all the time, and there you can feel like there's another side of Hanoi."\u000a\u000aShe also put Quest's success down to a voracious appetite for new music in Vietnam.\u000a\u000a"This generation, they are really into entertainment -- much more than before. They want to be modern, up on all the new fashion and music trends," says Nguyen.

aVStory highlights Nikki Haley: Widespread human rights violations a warning sign that breakdown in security is coming\u000a\u000aSyrian war just one example of how such violations can spiral into all-out war, she says\u000a\u000aAmbassador Nikki R. Haley is the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. The views expressed are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Imagine you are the parent of a boy -- a teenager. Policemen come to your home in the middle of the night and take your boy away. He is held without explanation for weeks. And when he finally comes home, your boy has all the marks of having been tortured. Bruises from being beaten. Red, open wounds from being burned. Then you look at his hands and the worst is confirmed. Where his fingernails once were, there are only raw, bloody, exposed nerves. Grown men with pliers, he tells you, ripped his fingernails off in prison.\u000a\u000aFor a group of parents in Syria in 2011, this was not an exercise in imagination but a horrifying reality. Their boys were arrested and tortured for the crime of writing anti-government graffiti on the wall of a school. When the parents marched in protest to demand their children's release, security services opened fire on them. When more people came out to protest the killings, the government fired on them again. Soon, the point of no return was reached.\u000a\u000aNikki Haley\u000a\u000a"We were asking in a peaceful way to release the children but their reply was bullets," a relative of one of the boys told a reporter . "Now we can have no compromise with any security branches."\u000a\u000aThe Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.\u000a\u000aAs the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.\u000a\u000aRead More

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In Paris on Thursday, fashion designer Rick Owens gave audiences quite a show when he sent male models down the runway wearing clothes with peepholes that offered a glimpse of the guys' formerly private parts.\u000a\u000a"Nudity is the most simple and primal gesture -- it packs a punch," Owens said of his decision to have his models bare all. "It's powerful. ... Who else can really get away with this stuff? It's a corporate world!"\u000a\u000aThe looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate -- after all, they can't be worn out in public and won't be sold in stores. But let's be honest: Were we even shocked? After all, female models have been asked to sashay down runways in states of near nakedness for years.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity. There was Michael Fassbender in "Shame," of course. And who can forget the uproar over the cameo of Ben Affleck's penis in "Gone Girl," albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it?

aV(CNN) Looking like a design amalgamation of a Roman coliseum and a doughnut, tulou buildings, found in China's southwest Fujian province, are some of the most stunning historic structures in the country.\u000a\u000aBut many of these residential buildings, which feature a courtyard surrounded by a perimeter of homes that rise several stories high, are under threat.\u000a\u000aAlthough 46 of the largest and most important tulou have been listed by UNESCO as World Heritage sites, an estimated 3,000 remain in the province with no such status.\u000a\u000aMany of these tulou are nearly empty and are falling into disrepair, with homes abandoned as residents leave for economic opportunity in the cities.\u000a\u000aUNESCO describes the tulou it protects as "exceptional examples of a building tradition and function exemplifying a particular type of communal living."\u000a\u000aUNESCO points out that tulou design was ideal for defense purposes as well as encouraging communal lifestyles. The organization says that, "Housing a whole clan, the houses functioned as village units and were known as 'a little kingdom for the family' or 'bustling small city'."\u000a\u000aLin Lusheng, who grew up in a tulou named Taoshu Building in Fujian's Neilong village, agrees with this sentiment. He has been on a mission to shine new light on the intriguing design of these often neglected buildings.\u000a\u000aThe 34-year-old started the "Hao Cuobian" project -- the phrase means "good neighbor" in a dialect spoken by his Hokkien ancestors -- and since 2015 he has spent money he raised through the project on renovating Taoshu Building, and educate its remaining residents about their heritage.\u000a\u000a"Tulou make me aware of this sense of community," he says. "When I was small, kids would eat at a neighbor's house if their parents had to work on the farm. It was common to see kids knocking at each other's doors to ask friends to eat and play," he recalls, of the tulou's design and its ability to foster social interaction.\u000a\u000a"This is something missing in modern society."\u000a\u000aGood neighbors\u000a\u000aThe first tulou, which are unique to southeast China's Fujian province, were built toward the end of China's Song Dynasty (960AD - 1279AD) by people from the Chinese Hakka ethnic group who fled from the north of the country via various migrations due to social unrest or to avoid war-torn northern areas.\u000a\u000a"They settled in rural areas because they were often poor and had nothing to do with authorities," Lin says. "They had to build their own clan houses at their own cost."\u000a\u000aThe residences, which could hold up to 800 people at a time, were constructed using a mixture of clays, which were sometimes fortified with wood, and hardened into sections by large bamboo molds.\u000a\u000aOften three or four stories high, the housing usually had only one gated entrance that led into the main courtyard.\u000a\u000a"The walls were extremely thick, and there would be water tanks above the gate because in ancient times invaders or burglars would set fire to the gate," explains Lin Weicheng, an architecture student at Xiamen University who worked with Lin Lusheng on the Taoshu Building renovation.\u000a\u000a"It's also said that there were underground tunnels to escape through," Lin Weicheng adds. "They had water wells, and bigger tulou would have little farm areas with vegetables and livestock.\u000a\u000a"In some big tulou the reserves could last for two or three months."\u000a\u000aThe shape of the tulou encouraged tight-knit communities and although families had individual housing sections, residents would convene in the courtyard for ceremonies such as ancestor worship and weddings, as well as the normal interactions of daily life.\u000a\u000aAlthough their facilities seem basic by modern standards, living in a tulou was an indicator of success among the Hakka people who built them, with only those able to help pay for them to be built living in them.\u000a\u000aPeople of the Hokkien ethnic group also built tulou, but while Hakka structures feature long corridors that run through every floor of the buildings, the Hokkien-built residences do not.\u000a\u000aAlthough both styles feature open public spaces in the middle, the shared corridors in the Hakka style make the structures even more communal.\u000a\u000a"This is due to culture," says Lin Weicheng. "Hakka people were migrants or refugees from the north and did not feel safe settling in another region, so having that public space made it easier for them to stay together in emergencies."\u000a\u000aFading memories\u000a\u000aTourism rather than farming now supports many of those who live in the historical structures, and there is an increasing trend for young rural people in China to move from their hometowns to cities.\u000a\u000aLin Lusheng has fond memories of growing up in a tulou, and hopes his ongoing work will ensure his heritage does not die out with this generation. Many people started moving out of Taoshu Building in the 1990s and now only about 30 people from 14 families live there.\u000a\u000a"Young people don't live in tulou anymore -- people are leaving their country houses empty," he says. "It's not just the tulou -- even newly built houses are becoming empty as people go to cities to work.\u000a\u000aSo far he's raised close to 120,000 yuan ($17,400) through donations and grants to support his efforts, and while he completed the renovation of Taoshu Building in June 2016, the work continues.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Reclaiming China's soul Replay More Videos ...

aV(CNN) North Korea tested a hydrogen bomb on Sunday, raising fears that Pyongyang is getting close to constructing a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the US.\u000a\u000aThe weapon was the most powerful North Korea has tested to date, with separate estimates putting the explosive yield at 50 or 120 kilotons.\u000a\u000aTo put that in context, the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 -- which instantly killed 80,000 people -- had a yield of 15 kilotons.\u000a\u000aHere's what you need to know to get up to speed.\u000a\u000aWhy did North Korea test a nuclear bomb?\u000a\u000aA nuclear weapon is the ultimate survival mechanism for an isolated regime with little influence and few friends.\u000a\u000aMany experts believe North Korea would not use its weapons first. Kim values the survival of his family dynasty and the regime. He knows the use of a nuclear weapon would start a war the country could not win.\u000a\u000aKim also craves international recognition -- and a nuclear arsenal is one guaranteed way to make the global community sit up and take notice.\u000a\u000a"North Korean leaders know that dead people do not need money, and they believe that without nuclear weapons they will be as good as dead," Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, South Korea, wrote in an oped for CNN.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED North Korea: The Kim Dynasty Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korea: The Kim Dynasty 04:13\u000a\u000aAre we going to war?\u000a\u000aUS Defense Minister James Mattis warned of a "massive military response" to any threat from North Korea against the United States. When US President Donald Trump left church on Sunday morning, he was asked if he'd attack North Korea. His answer? "We'll see."\u000a\u000aOn Monday, South Korea launched a huge show of military force with live-fire drills , simulating an attack on Pyongyang's nuclear testing site. Seoul also said the US was preparing to bolster its military presence amid concerns the North appears to be preparing to launch more missiles in the wake of Sunday's test.\u000a\u000aAnd while the US possesses overwhelming firepower compared to North Korea, any American strike on North Korea would likely expose neighbors South Korea and Japan to devastating casualties, analysts say.\u000a\u000aPlus, with two launches of long-range missiles this year and the latest hydrogen bomb test, the US homeland may now potentially be at risk of a nuclear strike.\u000a\u000aExperts say it's very difficult to verify North Korea's claims, but the very possibility of such a scenario makes the risks of any military action unimaginably high.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED The weapon that makes North Korea more dangerous Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The weapon that makes North Korea more dangerous 01:12\u000a\u000aWhat happens if Kim attacks?\u000a\u000aIf North Korea were to strike first -- and last month Pyongyang threatened to send four missiles to the waters off the US territory of Guam and later sent a missile over Japan -- the US has a number of defenses in place.\u000a\u000aThey include the anti-missile defense system THAAD , which shoots down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles, and the ship-based Aegis system, which can track 100 missiles simultaneously and intercept them.\u000a\u000aThese systems, which analysts liken to a bullet taking out another bullet, could in theory take down a missile with a nuclear payload without detonating it -- although the radiation emitted would still pose risks.\u000a\u000aWhat other options does the US have?\u000a\u000aIt boils down to two: Sanctions and negotiations. The United Nations Security Council has been trying to stifle North Korea's nuclear weapons program for more than a decade -- with little success.\u000a\u000aAt an emergency United Nations Security Council session in New York on Monday, US ambassador Nikki Haley said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was "begging for war." At the conclusion of the meeting, Haley said that the US would circulate a resolution in response to the nuclear test, with plans for a vote on it next week.\u000a\u000aBut there's not much left for President Trump to go after, although it could yet target crude oil -- something North Korea exports for foreign currency and imports from China, and its textiles industry.\u000a\u000aThe US position, however, has long been that it is willing to talk with North Korea -- but only on the condition that it abandons its nuclear missile program.\u000a\u000aSome analysts say the US should accept a freeze -- allowing Pyongyang to keep its nuclear missiles but refrain from testing and developing any more -- to get North Korea to the negotiating table.\u000a\u000a"It is a choice between bad and worse, and in this case all alternatives to the freeze are indeed, worse," said Lankov.\u000a\u000aWho else could help?\u000a\u000aTrump has prodded China to rein in its unruly neighbor but many analysts don't share the White House's confidence in Beijing's ability to force change from Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aWhile China has consistently supported UN sanctions on North Korea over the country's nuclear and ballistic missile testing, the US complains Beijing does not do enough economically to pressure Pyongyang and threatened targeted sanctions on Chinese companies.\u000a\u000aChina for its part has repeatedly said sanctions alone will not work . Along with Russia, it has urged the US and South Korea to suspend military drills in exchange for Pyongyang's halt of its nuclear weapons development -- a proposal Haley slammed as "insulting" on Monday.\u000a\u000aThe United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017\u000a\u000a"Despite Washington's hopes, China won't solve the North Korea problem, regardless of how often the Trump administration insists that it can or must," Jennifer Lind, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College, wrote for CNN last month.\u000a\u000a"China worries most about political stability on the Korean peninsula. The Chinese fear that serious economic pressure would risk causing Kim Jong Un's regime to collapse, which could unleash chaos on the peninsula, and usher in a variety of long-term problems."

aV(CNN) Amid the twists and turns of a tumultuous year, readers came to CNN Opinion for context, insight and fresh perspectives on politics and social issues worldwide. The presidential election was clearly a dominant topic of interest, but stories on culture, climate change, and how to be a family in a divisive and sometimes dangerous time in the world also drew avid readership.\u000a\u000aHere's a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2016. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.\u000a\u000aRoxanne Jones: Beyonce gets Super Bowl show right\u000a\u000aFebruary 9\u000a\u000a"There were nods to Michael Jackson, to Black Greek step shows, to Malcolm X and a salute to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panthers. For a minute, watching Beyonce and those strong black women sporting black berets and big afros march out onto the field, I forgot I was watching a Super Bowl performance. For the first time I felt like I wasn't just a spectator of the game but that the game had become a part of my black experience in America.

Scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president, I might have some influence on the decision -- or at least enough to pass along a message.\u000a\u000a'I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation,' said Scalia, then in his 23rd year as the court's leading and most provocative conservative voice.

Leaning forward, as if to share a confidential thought, he tried again.\u000a\u000a'Let me put a finer point on it,' the justice said, in a lower, purposeful tone of voice, his eyes fixed on mine.

Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning.\u000a\u000aAnd yet people hate her. Her negative ratings, in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of 'Why don't they like you?'\u000a\u000aOf course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that 'there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.' As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points."\u000a\u000aRead more here\u000a\u000aDanny Cevallos: Abby Wambach's arrest for a crime that makes no sense\u000a\u000aDanny Cevallos\u000a\u000aApril 4\u000a\u000a"Why?

Most other criminal activity unambiguously violates our social norms. There's no 'gray area' when it comes to smoking meth at a cocktail party, for example. Most crimes are also social faux pas, such that you would neither engage in, nor tolerate the behavior from a peer.\u000a\u000aWith DUIs, however, there are mixed messages.

aVDean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program "The Dean Obeidallah Show" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @deanofcomedy . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) You can take Donald Trump out of the reality show, but it seems you can't take the reality show mentality out of Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aAnd we are seeing it again with how President Trump has been despicably building drama over his expected decision on whether to end or phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. After first indicating he would act on DACA last week, then changing his story more than once, Trump has essentially turned nearly 800,000 young people who are desperately awaiting a decision on their fate into contestants on his dysfunctional reality show.\u000a\u000aDACA took effect by executive order in 2012 as a way to allow children brought to the United States by their parents in violation of immigration laws to remain in the country without fear of deportation if they comply with a long list of requirements . DACA has truly been a life-changing program for many, by allowing these young people to have hopes and dreams without fear of suddenly being deported back to a country where they have no memories or contacts.\u000a\u000aAs one "Dreamer," Andrea Fernandez, explained on my SiriusXM radio show last week, even though she graduated high school in Texas with a 4.0 average, she wouldn't have been able to legally attend a US college without DACA. But thanks to this program, the 21-year-old Fernandez was able to enroll in college in Texas, where she is a model student, leading student organizations and dreaming one day of running for the US Congress.\u000a\u000aBut given President Trump's pending decision, Andrea says she is afraid. And who wouldn't be if you were in her shoes, like the thousands of other young people awaiting the President's decision? Making matters worse for these young people is that it appears that Donald Trump -- like the master showman he is -- has intentionally sought to stoke the anticipation surrounding his decision.\u000a\u000aOn Friday afternoon, Trump told reporters the decision on DACA would come later that day or over the weekend. About an hour later, Trump added to the tension by saying the decision would come Monday at the latest. But only two hours after that, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders injected Hollywood levels of drama by declaring the announcement would come on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aAnd even President Trump's statements over the last few days seem better suited to building buzz for the season finale of a reality show than to a policy decision. On Friday, he stated , "We love the Dreamers." That statement would have been a great sign to the Dreamers that DACA was safe, but in true Trump fashion, the President refused to show his hand by then adding, "We love everybody."\u000a\u000aSome might think this is just Donald Trump wrestling with a tough decision. But his history makes it more likely this is just more of his governing like he's hosting a show.\u000a\u000aTrump put on spectacle straight out of reality TV in February when announcing Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court justice nominee, with a prime time announcement that rivaled any season finale of "The Apprentice."\u000a\u000aHe played the same game over whether he was secretly recording conversations that occurred in the Oval Office, refusing to tell the media one way or another for weeks until finally giving an answer. And in July, the inner workings of the White House had a reality-show feel that bordered on soap opera, complete with fiery characters bad-mouthing each other with President Trump's supposed blessing.\u000a\u000aBut with the lives of these nearly 800,000 young people hanging in the balance, there's no place for this type of showmanship. People like Andrea Fernandez are wondering what happens to them if Trump rescinds DACA. As she said to me : "Are they [immigration agents] going to go after my parents? Are they come knocking on doors trying to find us?" She fears being deported to Mexico, a country she left when her mother brought her to America when she was 8 -- and has never returned to.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThese Dreamers are unfortunately dependent on the compassion and empathy of Donald Trump. As Fernandez noted, "It feels so unreal that some people are willing to hurt almost a million people just because of something we couldn't control ... it's unfair and unkind." She is right.\u000a\u000aLet's hope at least this one time President Trump can be more focused on the reality of his decision -- and not the reality-show aspects of making and announcing it. Let's hope he continues DACA, so these young people can continue living, thriving and dreaming in the country they call home: the United States of America.

Here are five ways tech has nibbled away at valuable life skills and experiences, and what you can do about it.\u000a\u000aHome Assistants vs. Manners\u000a\u000aIf you are one of the millions of households in the United States with Alexa or Google Home, you may have noticed an unfortunate side effect of using the device: a lack of enforced courtesy. Kids (and adults) shout commands at the device: "Play Beyoncé!" or "What's the weather?!" The devices do not require a "please" or "thank you," and the more lifelike these devices become, the weirder it is to hear your child rudely demanding something from a humanlike voice.\u000a\u000aWhat to do: Model the behavior you want to see. It might feel strange to say "please" to a machine, but if that's what you expect from your kid, you should do it too. It might help explain to kids that even though you know Alexa doesn't have feelings, Model the behavior you want to see. It might feel strange to say "please" to a machine, but if that's what you expect from your kid, you should do it too. It might help explain to kids that even though you know Alexa doesn't have feelings, using polite voices and words makes it nicer for the real people in the house who do have feelings. You can talk about how it can feel bad to be around someone who's yelling or angry, even if they're not yelling at you.\u000a\u000aPhones vs. Respect for Elders\u000a\u000aHow many of us have witnessed a teacher, coach, or grandparent try to make conversation with kids who can't unglue their eyes from a screen ? Of course it's only polite to put down your phone when anyone is talking to you, but it can be especially embarrassing for parents who were raised to defer to the older generation.\u000a\u000aWhat to do: Make your expectations very clear. Talk to your kids about how important it is to use good manners when you're on your phone. Explain that it can be very difficult to put down your phone when you're in the middle of a game or chat, but you believe it's important to pay special respect to people like grandparents and elders. And of course, respect breeds respect, so put your phone down when your kid talks to you (unless it's about Make your expectations very clear. Talk to your kids about how important it is to use good manners when you're on your phone. Explain that it can be very difficult to put down your phone when you're in the middle of a game or chat, but you believe it's important to pay special respect to people like grandparents and elders. And of course, respect breeds respect, so put your phone down when your kid talks to you (unless it's about how much redstone they need to build a castle in Minecraft , in which case it's totally OK to ignore them!).\u000a\u000aInternet vs. Value of Boredom\u000a\u000aWhen a phone full of cute cat videos and funny memes is only a swipe away, it's easy to forget what it was like to be truly bored. But science tells us that boredom is actually useful -- for kids and adults. Not only can boredom lead to deep thinking, it can help kids practice perseverance, or pushing through uncomfortable moments without stimulation or distraction. And without boredom, kids might not take the time to explore their surroundings -- dig in the dirt, wonder how a house is built, bake cookies without a recipe -- and they might not stumble on something they really love to do.\u000a\u000aWhat to do: Create opportunities for boredom by setting up times and places where devices are off-limits. And make sure kids have unstructured time -- even a little bit -- where they can roam the house or the neighborhood without a schedule. Keep a list of activities that kids say they like to do -- from drawing to hammering to bouncing a ball -- and point them toward it when they complain.\u000a\u000aActivity Trackers vs. Activity for Its Own Sake\u000a\u000aIf you've ever taken a walk with someone who's trying to get steps, it can be hard to concentrate on the conversation while they're jogging in place, hopping up and down, and constantly checking their device. Activity trackers -- while useful for many -- tend to distract from the activity itself. And if we want kids to appreciate the beauty of their surroundings, the comfort of a meandering conversation, or even the rush of endorphins that can come with a strenuous walk, we need to emphasize the benefits of the activity , rather than the quantification of the actions.\u000a\u000aWhat to do: First, don't buy your kid an activity tracker unless they need it for a specific reason. Second, engage in lots of outdoor activity and fun exercise, and comment on how good it feels. And last, model the behavior and values you want to see in your kid -- even if you're tracking your steps, wait until the walk is over to check your progress, for example.\u000a\u000aDevices vs. Empathy\u000a\u000aThe mere presence of a phone on the table between two people having a discussion has been shown to decrease feelings of empathy. Whether this is because the phone owner is distracted by the possibility of an incoming message or the promise of something more interesting on the device is unclear. But it makes sense that if someone isn't giving you their full attention, they're less likely to understand or empathize with you, and ultimately that can affect the quality of the relationship.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

aVBy FIona Reilly, for CNN \u2022 Updated 23rd June 2014\u000a\u000aTea, that most ordinary of beverages, was once so highly prized that traders, travelers and seafarers risked their lives to bring the precious cargo from China to the rest of the world.\u000a\u000aNow, a small but growing band of tea aficionados is traveling across the country in pursuit of tea at its source, fueled by an appreciation of China's ancient tea culture and traditions and a more modern interest in green methods of cultivation and artisanal production.\u000a\u000aTea tourism within China is still a relatively new phenomenon, gaining traction in the last few years and generally associated with an educated and upwardly mobile Chinese middle class.\u000a\u000aFor Chinese people, traveling for tea brings with it a certain cachet.\u000a\u000a"In most public schools, there is no formal education about tea, so one's knowledge of the subject proves you have traveled, and studied about tea on your own," says tea guide Michael Wang. "In others' eyes, you are not only educated but cultivated."\u000a\u000a'Understanding begins with a single cup'\u000a\u000aTea expert and guide Tracy Lesh specializes in bringing Chinese tea culture to foreign travelers and expats within China -- a small portion of her clientele are Chinese people who appreciate her depth of knowledge.\u000a\u000aLesh began arranging tea tours more than five years ago when she realized there was a growing interest in learning not just about the tea itself, but the culture surrounding it.\u000a\u000a"Americans are overwhelmed and undereducated about Chinese tea culture," she says.\u000a\u000a"Many aren't aware of the benefits of loose-leaf teas and are mainly drinking teas blended with fruits and flowers. It takes a lifetime to appreciate tea, but understanding begins with just a single cup."\u000a\u000aChinese tea tourists tend to have a different focus than Westerners when it comes to visiting a tea area.\u000a\u000aWang says non-Chinese look for a sense of adventure and don't mind hiking into the tea terraces. They have a strong interest in seeing production methods firsthand and picking tea for themselves, but don't yet understand the culture of tea.\u000a\u000a"Foreigners have difficulty understanding the delicate taste of xian (savory) and huigan (sweetness) in tea," Wang says.\u000a\u000aChinese visitors, on the other hand, place an emphasis on relaxing and drinking tea without the need to hike into the tea plantation or pick leaves.\u000a\u000aThey often use artisanal teas as gifts for building good business relationships and are interested in learning gongfu tea -- a refined way of serving tea involving proper vessels, brewing techniques and atmosphere that takes patience and skill to master.\u000a\u000aLike good wine, tea's final flavor is influenced heavily by terroir -- the microclimate in which it's grown.\u000a\u000aFor those interested in taking a tea tour, below are three starting points, corresponding to three of China's most well known teas, each different in climate, geography and taste.\u000a\u000aLongjing (Dragon Well) green tea\u000a\u000aLongjing is filled with small tea houses and is home to the China National Tea Museum.\u000a\u000aLocated just south of Hangzhou province's beautiful West Lake, Longjing is home to China's most celebrated green tea, which is the color of jade and has the fresh aroma of chestnuts and cut grass.\u000a\u000aThe best time to visit the area is during China's Qing Ming Festival (usually April) when most picking and roasting take place.\u000a\u000aLongjing's tea villages and plantations -- many are open to the public -- are connected by a cycle pathway and bus route.\u000a\u000aLongjing is home to the China National Tea Museum.\u000a\u000aAmong the temples, pagodas and gardens lining the shores of nearby West Lake sit many small tea houses where longjing tea can be enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere.\u000a\u000aHangzhou is reached by high-speed train from Shanghai's Hongqiao Railway Station. Trains run every 30 minutes and take one hour.\u000a\u000aTracy Lesh and Michael Wang arrange small group tea tours to the Longjing tea terraces year round ( shanghaiandbeyond.com ; +86 159 009 03998).\u000a\u000aChina National Tea Museum , 88 Longjing Road, West Lake, Hangzhou; +86 571 8796 4221; open 9 a.m.-5 p.m., May-October 7; 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m., October 8-April 30;\u000a\u000aclosed Mondays; free admission\u000a\u000aWuyi Mountain oolong tea\u000a\u000aOolong tea originally comes from southern China's Fujian Province.\u000a\u000aOolong tea, a fragrant partially oxidized tea midway between green teas like longjing and black teas like pu'er, has its origins in southern China's Fujian province.\u000a\u000aThe most famous of Fujian's oolongs, da hong pao or "big red robe" tea comes from Wuyi Mountain, a UNESCO-protected natural heritage site rich with rare and animal life, centered around the pristine Nine Twists River.\u000a\u000aGenuine da hong pao is picked from just a few ancient tea trees high on Wuyi Mountain and is unobtainable to all but the wealthiest and most influential, but oolong plantations in the surrounding hills produce wonderful teas too.\u000a\u000aLike wine, the terroir of these teas is demonstrated by oolong's floral notes, which are subtly different according to the orientation, altitude and soil mineral content of the hillside on which the tea is grown.\u000a\u000aNearby is the well preserved medieval tea-trading town of Xiamei and further afield are Fujian's famed tulou -- ancient rammed earth roundhouses that hold up to 400 families inside.\u000a\u000aWuyi Shan has its own airport with daily flights to and from major Chinese cities.\u000a\u000aChina Base Travel runs three-day Wuyi Mountain and oolong tea tours year round.\u000a\u000aWuyi Shan UNESCO World Heritage Site; daily from 7:30 a.m.; admission RMB 235 ($38) for a two-day pass\u000a\u000aSouthern Yunnan's pu'er tea\u000a\u000aPu'er is considered the pinnacle of Chinese teas.\u000a\u000aPu'er, a fermented and aged black tea with a complex, earthy taste, is considered the pinnacle of all Chinese teas.\u000a\u000aUsually pressed into cakes, it's allowed to age so that its complexity and depth of flavor increase over time (as does the price), again drawing comparisons to wine.\u000a\u000aPu'er has a fascinating trade history.\u000a\u000aTea was carried, often on foot, overland on the ancient Tea Horse Road linking Yunnan and Tibet in exchange for the Tibetan mountain ponies sought by the Chinese for their hardiness.\u000a\u000aThe area of southern Yunnan where pu'er is produced lies adjacent to Myanmar, Laos and the Mekong River.\u000a\u000aThe region features an enormous protected native jungle and wild elephant reserve, a tropical and medicinal botanic garden, hills terraced with tea plantations and areas filled with wild tea trees that are hundreds of years old.\u000a\u000aThere are daily flights to the regional capital, Jinghong, from all major Chinese cities, or you can fly directly into the smaller Pu'er airport (known as Pu'er Simao).\u000a\u000aPu'er tea tours can be arranged through Jinghong's Mekong Café\u000a\u000aSanchahe Nature Reserve and Banna Wild Elephant Valley is 48 kilometers north of Jinghong; daily, 8 a.m.-5:30 p.m.

John McCain McCain leaves the Senate chamber after voting on the GOP '"skinny repeal" health care bill on July 28, 2017. Three Senate Republicans, including McCain, voted no to a stripped-down version of Obamacare reform. Hide Caption 34 of 34\u000a\u000aAll of Thursday, the usually talkative senator had declined to show his cards to probing reporters. There was an evening phone call with House Speaker Paul Ryan aimed at reassuring a group of concerned senators they would get their demands for a conference committee, but even after that call, McCain simply said he wasn't convinced. Since his dramatic return to the Senate several days earlier, McCain had agitated over the rushed and partisan way in which Republican leaders crafted their Obamcare repeal bill.\u000a\u000aNow, with the future of the GOP health care bill in great suspense -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell needed 50 "yes" votes and could only afford two defections -- McCain stepped out of his office in the Russell building to make his way to the Capitol shortly before midnight. A CNN reporter was waiting for him, but until the moment he got into the elevator, the senator was on his cell phone.\u000a\u000a"Which piece?" McCain said into the phone. "No, I didn't see it. What did it say?"\u000a\u000aAfter a pause, the senator responded: "All right, I'll get ready to do that. But it's very hard to do the right thing."\u000a\u000aHe ignored the reporter's question about how he would vote.\u000a\u000aWhen McCain walked onto the Senate floor, the chamber was still largely empty. The vote was called shortly after midnight and most senators still had not arrived.\u000a\u000aIn the cavernous, air-conditioned room, McCain sat down behind a desk next to his best friend, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. From the gallery above, the intensity of the conversation was unmistakable. Both men leaned back into their seats, and it was McCain who did most of the talking, gesturing as though he were trying to explain something. Graham nodded along.\u000a\u000aGraham's phone -- his famous flip phone -- began to ring, and he stepped out the back to take the call. By then, a number of senators had walked into the chamber. But none would approach McCain. For a short while, he sat alone, looking intently ahead of him, a striking contrast to the continuous fanfare he had received from colleagues since returning to Washington after his brain cancer diagnosis and surgery.\u000a\u000aSomething was off for GOP leaders. McConnell and his top deputies, including Sen. John Cornyn and Roy Blunt, were gathered with heads bowed, talking quietly.\u000a\u000aThen, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska approached McCain. Murkowski was one of two senators who had voted "no" earlier in the week on a procedural vote and was speculated as a possible "no" vote again on Friday. As McCain spoke to his colleague, he was so animated -- pumping his fists and speaking slowly for emphasis -- that it was possible to read his lips.\u000a\u000a"I promise," he seemed to say to Murkowski. Moments later, he gestured with his index finger several times. "One senator," he appeared to say, with space between the two words.\u000a\u000aThere was soon another conspicuous sign: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one senator widely expected to vote "no" on Friday, walked up to McCain. When she did, the group broke into laughter. Collins got comfortable, setting down her bright pink bag.\u000a\u000aBy this point, Vice President Mike Pence had arrived. If 50 senators voted yes, he would need to be the final, tie-breaking vote.\u000a\u000aMcCain and Pence spoke for a long stretch, with the vice president standing and the senator still sitting. Once again, McCain was spirited and energetic.\u000a\u000a"I promise you," were the words that the senator appeared to say to Pence at one point.\u000a\u000aBy 1 a.m. ET, it was more than clear that the problem was serious. What was supposed to be a relatively quick procedural vote had dragged out for almost an hour, stuck in limbo as GOP leaders were huddled in hushed conversations. Many eyed McCain from around the room.\u000a\u000aSuddenly, the senator was on the move. He stood up from his desk, hugging and kissing Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, before walking over to the other side of the room where the Democrats sit.\u000a\u000aSurrounded by colleagues from the other party including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, McCain abruptly flexed his armed inward like a gorilla. It was with such force and playfulness that reporters watching from above collectively laughed, prompting some of the senators to look up. Schumer smiled at the press.\u000a\u000aSen. Chris Coons, one of the senators in that huddle, said this was the moment that McCain informed them of his decision. "He stood with a group of us and said, I am a 'no,'" Coons told CNN afterwards. "I was trying not to jump up and down and smile."\u000a\u000aIt was also during this conversation that McCain urged his Democratic colleagues to take up the defense bill as quickly as possible after health care was behind them. McCain has hinted that he would likely be returning to Arizona for cancer treatment next week, and he hoped to have a vote on the defense bill on Friday.\u000a\u000aShortly before the roll call began to be called, McCain briefly stepped out of the Senate chamber.\u000a\u000aReporters would later learn that McCain spoke on the phone with President Donald Trump off of the Senate floor. The President tried -- with no success -- to change McCain's mind.

aVYou may have never used Equifax yourself -- or even heard of it -- but the credit reporting agency could still have a treasure trove of your personal information.\u000a\u000aEquifax said Thursday that 143 million people could be affected by a recent data breach in which cybercriminals stole information including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and the numbers of some driver's licenses.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, credit card numbers for about 209,000 people were exposed, as was "personal identifying information" on roughly 182,000 customers involved in credit report disputes.\u000a\u000aEquifax is one of three nationwide credit-reporting companies that track and rate the financial history of U.S. consumers. It gets its data -- without you even knowing -- from credit card companies, banks, retailers, and lenders.\u000a\u000aEquifax will not be contacting everyone who was affected, but will send direct mail notices to those whose credit card numbers or dispute records were accessed.\u000a\u000aRelated: 143 million people could be affected by Equifax breach\u000a\u000aThe company suggests you sign up for credit file monitoring and identity theft protection. It is providing free service for one year through TrustedID Premier -- whether or not you've been affected by the breach.\u000a\u000aTo enroll, go to www.equifaxsecurity2017.com and click on the Check Potential Impact tab. You must submit your last name and last six digits of your Social Security number there. At that point you'll be given a date when you can return to the site and sign up for the service.\u000a\u000aThe site says once you've submitted your information you will receive a message indicating whether you've been affected. But it's unclear when or how you will receive that message.\u000a\u000aSome are being told: "Based on the information provided, we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident."\u000a\u000aBut even in that case, Equifax is not offering the credit monitoring service until next week at the earliest. Monday is the first day you can sign up.\u000a\u000aIf you do choose to sign up for the credit monitoring service, you must agree to submit any complaints against Equifax to arbitration. You can't sue on your own behalf, and you can't join a class-action case or benefit from any class-action settlement that Equifax agrees to.\u000a\u000aRelated: Want help from Equifax? There are strings attached\u000a\u000aThe company also recommends that you review account statements and credit reports yourself to check for incidents of fraud. You can request a copy of your credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com. You are allowed a free copy once a year from each of the three credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.\u000a\u000aIf you see any unauthorized activity, immediately report it to your bank and/or credit card company. If you believe you've been a victim of identity theft, you should also contact law enforcement.\u000a\u000aRelated: Equifax execs sold stock before hack disclosed\u000a\u000aAnother way to protect yourself is by immediately placing fraud alerts on your credit reports, according to credit expert John Ulzheimer, who previously worked at FICO and Equifax. This means that a lender must contact you to verify your identity before it issues credit in your name. You can place an alert on your report for free by contacting one of the credit agencies, which is required to notify the other two. It will last for 90 days and can be renewed.\u000a\u000aSince cybercriminals may have accessed what Ulzheimer calls the "crown jewels of information" at Equifax, he also suggests putting a long term freeze on your credit.\u000a\u000aA freeze takes your credit report out of circulation. If someone else goes to take out a loan in your name, the lender will not be able to pull your report and therefore cannot extend the credit. If you want to take out a loan yourself, you'll have to contact the reporting agency to temporarily lift the freeze. Fees to freeze your account vary by state, but commonly range from $5 to $10.\u000a\u000a"It's a pretty extreme measure, but when 143 million people have been exposed like this, I think you have to take it," Ulzheimer said.\u000a\u000aRelated: The biggest data breaches ever\u000a\u000aThe Federal Trade Commission's website, www.ftc.gov/idtheft, also offers information about how to protect yourself against fraud.\u000a\u000aIf you have more questions for Equifax, the company has set up a designated call center at 866-447-7559.\u000a\u000aCNN's Chris Isidore contributed to this report.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) That thing in a boxing ring Saturday night in Las Vegas turned out to be totally real. Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor was a genuine, honest-to-goodness fight.\u000a\u000aOk, so it wasn't a knockdown, drag-out fight. No one got knocked down. No one got dragged out.\u000a\u000aBut no one demanded a refund. It lasted into the 10th round. (Some thought it might last 10 seconds.) Mayweather was declared the winner by a technical knockout. (Some thought McGregor might be declared DOA by CSI.)\u000a\u000aMike Downey\u000a\u000aThe referee stopped the fight because McGregor looked to be wobbly, exhausted and nearly out on his feet.

aVMatt Villano \u2022 Updated 8th September 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 There are three parts to an epic Napa Valley getaway: Life-changing wine-tastings, scrumptious meals and sumptuous accommodations.\u000a\u000aReputation and word of mouth make the first two relatively easy for visitors to arrange. With so many good options, however, locking down the last one can be a little tricky.\u000a\u000aWhile the Valley still boasts classic resorts such as Meadowood Napa Valley, Solage Calistoga and Bardessono, new openings and renovated properties have brought other overnight destinations to the forefront. Here are our seven favorites.\u000a\u000aLas Alcobas Napa Valley, St. Helena\u000a\u000aThe Napa Valley outpost of this Mexico City brand redefined luxury when it opened in spring 2017.\u000a\u000aAll 68 rooms are sleek and modern, with fancy touches such as automatic toilets, complimentary minibars and blackout shades. A handful have private balconies overlooking a cabernet sauvignon vineyard owned by Benzinger next door. Some even have showers that double as steam rooms.\u000a\u000aElsewhere on property, Atrio Spa specializes in aromatherapy, while the fitness center has cruiser bikes for guests to borrow, free of charge.\u000a\u000aPerhaps the main attraction is Acacia House, the latest restaurant from celebrity chef Chris Cosentino. The menu largely eschews Cosentino's true love of offal, instead focusing on modern California cuisine with a Mediterranean flare.\u000a\u000aA summer menu featured lamb tartare with green harissa, mint and chickpea crackers, as well as Iberico pork schnitzel with herbs, watercress and caviar ranch dressing. The restaurant sits in a meticulously restored 1905 mansion. Dinner on the porch at sunset is divine.\u000a\u000aLas Alcobas Napa Valley , 1915 Main St., St. Helena, 94574; +1 (707) 963-7000\u000a\u000aSenza Hotel, Napa\u000a\u000aFive buildings make up this ultraluxury bed-and-breakfast owned by Kathryn and Craig Hall, the couple behind the famous Hall and Walt wines. The Halls are known for their art collection, and it shows: Senza is dotted with 11 eclectic sculptures across the property, as well as smaller sculptures and paintings inside the main guest areas and guest rooms.\u000a\u000aAll 41 rooms are modern and clean. Most have private patios or balconies and fireplaces. Accommodations in the renovated and circa-1870 Parker Mansion have built-in USB ports, smart-screen televisions and bathrooms with heated floors. They also have complimentary minibars.\u000a\u000aOf course there's an on-site spa, restaurant, fitness center, outdoor pool and fire pit. Guests are welcome at a nightly wine-and-cheese hour, which features wines from the Hall family's portfolio. Perhaps Senza's most remarkable attribute is its layout; the property sits just off Highway 29, looking out on a parcel of vines that is owned and operated by the family. Regardless of the season, this backdrop soothes the soul.\u000a\u000aSenza Hotel , 4066 Howard Lane, Napa, 94558; +1 (707) 253-0337\u000a\u000aRancho Caymus Inn, Rutherford\u000a\u000aLocation, location, location. Above all else, this is what fans love about Rancho Caymus, which reopened in July after a two-year renovation and refresh.\u000a\u000aThe hotel sits smack in the middle of the valley in Rutherford and is a short walk to Rutherford Grill , arguably the best-known eatery in Napa, and a handful of stellar wineries, including Honig and Round Pond Estate\u000a\u000aAll 26 rooms are quirky. Heritage wood ceilings, fireplaces and private patios come standard. All accommodations also boast framed pillow cases and blankets from Ecuador, items originally procured by the hotel's first and long-time owner, Mary Tilden Morton.\u000a\u000aAnother interesting detail is the mosaic mural that overlooks the pool area, a work of art by artist Guillermo Wagner Granizo. The mural dates back to 1987, just three years after the hotel was built.\u000a\u000aGuests enjoy access to the new pool and spa, as well as complimentary continental breakfast every day.\u000a\u000aRancho Caymus Inn , 1140 Rutherford Road, Rutherford, 94573; +1 (707) 200-9300\u000a\u000aAuberge du Soleil, Rutherford\u000a\u000aThe 50-room "Auberge," as it's known to locals, has been one of the most popular luxury hotels in the area for years. New for 2017, however, are eight renovated guest rooms and suites developed by San Francisco interior designer Suzanne Tucker of Tucker & Marks fame.\u000a\u000aSimply put, these new rooms make palace quarters seem dull. Amenities include daily fresh fruit, custom-made mattresses and hand-carved headboards. The undisputed highlights of at least two of the new rooms are al fresco wash areas that each have a shower and a tub. (You haven't truly arrived until you bathe under the stars.)\u000a\u000aAuberge is known for its views. Because the hotel sits up on Rutherford Hill, on a clear night you can see south all the way to San Francisco and north all the way up to Mount St. Helena and beyond. This view of the valley makes the patio at the on-site restaurant -- The Restaurant at Auberge du Soleil -- one of the most romantic spots around.\u000a\u000aAuberge du Soleil , 180 Rutherford Hill Road, Rutherford, 94573; +1 (707) 963-1211\u000a\u000aVintage House, Yountville\u000a\u000aOld is new again at Vintage House, a 112-room Yountville hotel that reopened in early August after a yearlong renovation and name change -- it was previously known as the Vintage Inn.\u000a\u000aThe new rooms are completely modern, with tufted sofas, fireplaces and either patios or balconies. New bathrooms are worth bragging about, too, with dual sink vanities and twin walk-in rain-showers or oversized soaking tubs.\u000a\u000aWithout question, the best of the bunch is the 1,000-square-foot Loft Suite, with its high-beamed ceilings and French doors that lead out to either the patio or the balcony. Elsewhere on property, a new pool area, spa and lobby provide guests with ample opportunities to indulge or simply relax and read a book.\u000a\u000aIncluding work on these spots, the refresh at Vintage House is the first step in a multifaceted modernization of The Estate Yountville, which eventually will include properties currently known as Villagio Inn & Spa and V Marketplace.\u000a\u000aVintage House , 6359 Washington St., Yountville, 94599; +1 (707) 944-1112\u000a\u000aHarvest Inn, St. Helena\u000a\u000aHotelier and celebrity chef Charlie Palmer breathed new life into the moribund Harvest Inn when he purchased it in 2015, and he has been refining the St. Helena resort ever since.\u000a\u000aExhibit A: Harvest Table, a signature restaurant that sources ingredients from local farms and has started its own beer program.\u000a\u000aExhibit B: Vineyard View Collection rooms, which boast comfy leather club chairs and patios looking out on a lush and healthy vineyard of cabernet sauvignon. (The vines belong to neighboring Whitehall Lane Winery.)\u000a\u000aExhibit C: A new art installation that features metal animal sculptures from local artists, the result of a partnership with a local gallery.\u000a\u000aShort of a total rebuild, however, there's not much Palmer can do with the outdated brick-and-stucco Tudor-style structures that dot the eight-acre property. Still, taking in the surrounding redwood grove and considering that most rooms come standard with a fireplace, plush bed and complimentary wine, the Harvest Inn proves that what's inside counts most of all.\u000a\u000aHarvest Inn , 1 Main St., St. Helena, 94574; +1 (707) 963-9463\u000a\u000aBrannan Cottage Inn, Calistoga\u000a\u000aBuilt in 1860 by Calistoga founder Samuel Brannan, the Italianate Victorian at Brannan Cottage Inn was one of the first town buildings to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A painstaking renovation in 2014, coupled with Victorian-style furnishings, has enabled this six-room bed-and-breakfast to retain much of that old-school feel.\u000a\u000aToday the most spacious of the accommodations are the Deluxe Kings, both of which sit above the garage in a separate building. These rooms are perfect for families traveling with small children. They also offer more privacy than the four rooms in the main house, which flank a pair of common rooms.\u000a\u000aDesign freaks will love the Art Deco-inspired in-room wallpaper, one-of-a-kind and new but created to look old. Also be sure to check out the giant palm tree, planted in 1878, that grows through the eaves of the roof.\u000a\u000aGuests can play the antique (circa 1880) upright grand piano at their leisure.

aV(CNN) Walking through the corridors of Bayer Leverkusen's BayArena, you get the sense this is a club proud of its past.\u000a\u000aTrophies take pride of place in glass cabinets, framed shirts of club legends adorn the walls and artistic graffiti depicts famous nights in the club's history.\u000a\u000aBut it's something going on in the rooms deeper inside the stadium that is ensuring Leverkusen is keeping its eye very much on the future.\u000a\u000aThe Bundesliga side are one of several top level European clubs, as well as NBA and NFL teams, using Catapult Sports technology to help analyze player performance.\u000a\u000aUsing a highly sensitive GPS tracker -- inserted into a training vest between the shoulder blades -- the data provides a detailed breakdown of an individual's top speed, acceleration, distance covered, deceleration and weight distribution, among other statistics.\u000a\u000aGone are the days of slacking off in training. Players can be held accountable for their performances -- and how they look after their bodies in between.\u000a\u000a"The focus on fitness now is absolutely huge, there's just no other way," Kevin Volland, Leverkusen's club record signing, tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"Maybe 10-20 years ago, you could have a beer or two," he quips.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Bayer Leverkusen explore the future of tech Replay More Videos ...

"It can be a little more stress for players and the whole team but it's all part of it, everyone benefits from it.\u000a\u000a"All the fitness trainers then know where you stand, so you can build up your condition and get to what's ideal for you in particular."\u000a\u000aFor football clubs and in particular their players, the "why?" is becoming just as important as the "what?"\u000a\u000aVolland says players are now no longer blindly following the advice of coaches, instead choosing to understand the reasoning behind their instructions.\u000a\u000a"Every player is, in fact, quite interested to meet with the fitness trainer to take a look (at the data)," he explains. "You see the averages, you see your own results."\u000a\u000aOver two days club coaches set up a series of circuits designed to measure the individual skill sets of every player.\u000a\u000aBalance, strength and endurance tests are at the forefront of the assessment process, with players then sorted into three groups -- average or above and below -- based on how well they perform.\u000a\u000a"It helps you pinpoint what your weaknesses might be," the 25-year-old says. "It gives you good feedback, in particular on the medical side of things.\u000a\u000a"For me, for example, I realized that my balance when I'm on a see-saw board can lack a little -- others I did better."\u000a\u000aTesting the Catapult\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED How beet juice could win the Champions League Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How beet juice could win the Champions League 02:47\u000a\u000aAs the afternoon sun beats down on the pristine training pitches adjacent to the BayArena, Leverkusen youth team coach Tim Riedel leads out a group of six journalists to test the technology.\u000a\u000aNormally accustomed to commanding a group of elite athletes, the panting and wheezing after only two widths of the pitch provides him with an altogether different challenge.\u000a\u000aAfter undergoing a rigorous and draining one-hour session -- just a third of the time Leverkusen's players spend training and the equivalent of their warmup -- the data from the GPS tracker is downloaded and portrayed in bar graphs.\u000a\u000aThis allows the coaches, but more importantly the players, to easily digest the data and subsequently plan their personalized training and recovery programs.\u000a\u000aUnsurprisingly, the performance of Leverkusen's professionals was often as much as 50% higher than that of the journalists.\u000a\u000aRiedel says the players become very competitive when comparing results, which in turn gives them an added incentive to work that much harder.\u000a\u000aOne of the measured variables is distance covered at high intensity (over 25 km/h), something which the now departed midfielder Kevin Kampl -- "the runner of the team," as Riedel described him -- was vastly superior at compared to the rest of his teammates. Kampl joined RB Leipzig on August 31.\u000a\u000aWinger Karim Bellarabi, meanwhile, is by far the quickest member of the squad and is able to reach a top speed of 33 km/h.\u000a\u000a"It (the data) helps you to see 'OK, so I need to work harder here' which you can then utilize when you're doing some individual training workouts," Volland says.\u000a\u000a"It's important though not just for the endurance aspect -- but also in regards to the recovery."\u000a\u000aCatapult Technology is only used by Leverkusen during training and practice matches, as the Bundesliga uses Opta Sports' data to analyze player performance during the season.\u000a\u000aDuring one of these training sessions, Leverkusen opened its doors to hundreds of fans in an attempt to galvanize the players ahead of a crucial derby match against local rivals Cologne last season.\u000a\u000aHoards of supporters lined the pathway as the players made their way onto the training pitch, with the electric atmosphere more akin to that of a matchday than a pre-game practice.\u000a\u000aBeing innovators in technology has helped Leverkusen qualify for European football every year since 2009-10, though numerical data is always prone to throw up an anomaly.\u000a\u000aThe 2016-17 season was the first time in history that Cologne finished above Leverkusen in the league.\u000a\u000aDespite going 2-0 down early in the second half, Leverkusen rallied to level the scores and secure their place in the Bundesliga after a season of teetering precariously on the brink of relegation.\u000a\u000aTactics and nutrition\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Monaco players fueled by 'superfoods' Replay More Videos ...

aVFederal prosecutors want a judge to revoke bail for Martin Shkreli after he offered money to anyone who could grab Hillary Clinton's hair.\u000a\u000aIn a court filing on Thursday, the prosecutors called it part of "an escalating pattern of threats and harassment."\u000a\u000aShkreli, a former pharmaceutical executive who gained national notoriety two years ago for jacking up the price of a drug used by AIDS patients, was convicted of securities fraud last month for mismanaging two investment funds.\u000a\u000aThe prosecutors cited a Facebook post on Monday in which Shkreli promoted a conspiracy theory about the Clinton Foundation and offered the money for a lock of Clinton's hair.\u000a\u000aProsecutors wrote that it was "certainly not appropriate behavior for a defendant who has been found guilty of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud -- a defendant whose detention is presumed under the law."\u000a\u000aShkreli later edited the post to say it was "satire" and then removed it altogether. However, the post triggered an investigation by the Secret Service, prosecutors said. Clinton is promoting "What Happened," her memoir of the presidential campaign. Her representatives and the Secret Service declined comment.\u000a\u000aProsecutors cited previous examples of harassment by Shkreli. After Clinton collapsed from pneumonia on September 11, 2016, Shkreli stood outside Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where her mother was recuperating, and live-streamed his own heckling, prosecutors said.\u000a\u000aRelated: Shkreli is auctioning Wu-Tang album on eBay\u000a\u000aProsecutors also mentioned his online harassment of a Teen Vogue editor in January, which got him kicked off Twitter.\u000a\u000aShkreli's lawyer, Ben Brafman, told CNNMoney: "However inappropriate some of Mr Shkreli's postings may have been, we do not believe that he intended harm and do not believe that he poses a danger to the community."\u000a\u000aRelated: Prosecutors request gag order for Shkreli\u000a\u000aDuring his trial in the investment case, Shkreli's courtroom antics got him in trouble with the judge. She chastised him for entering an overflow courtroom used by reporters and speaking to them directly, without his lawyer present, to criticize his prosecutors as "junior varsity."\u000a\u000aHe also posted comments online and, against the wishes of his own lawyer, livestreamed his life on YouTube, where he would ramble on for hours, take calls and play chess, or sleep.\u000a\u000aThe most serious count against Shkreli carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.

aVThe 19-year-old was the darling of the Games, winning four gymnastics gold medals and dazzling the watching world with her skill and sunny temperament.\u000a\u000aHer excellence proved the early pinnacle of a journey that presented Biles with formidable obstacles, not only in terms of her early family life, but also her own body image.\u000a\u000aIt can be a touchstone issue for teenage girls in the sport, their muscular physiques marking them out as different to their peers, and Biles says she was teased at school, mostly by the boys.\u000a\u000a"I think in the gymnastics world, it is your body figure because you get a little bit shy about your body because you are very muscular," Biles told CNN when asked what was the biggest personal challenge she has had to overcome.\u000a\u000a"But we wouldn't be able to do the things or achieve the things we did without our bodies so we're very grateful for them."\u000a\u000aIf her tumble skills look effortless, Biles' ability to shrug off taunts about her body shape only came through some painful experiences.\u000a\u000aIn a 2016 interview with CNN, Biles explained: "Going to public school nobody really had a body build that I did, and I was a girl, so the guys would sometimes make fun of me.\u000a\u000a"I think they were just jealous because they didn't have the muscle definition I did. I would try to hide my muscles, not show them, and I would always wear a jacket."\u000a\u000aIt's just another strand of the intense scrutiny Biles has been under since her Olympic success.\u000a\u000aAfter taking gold in the all-around, vault, floor and team competitions, as well as winning bronze in the beam, the conversation around her looks intensified, leading to negative comments on social media.\u000a\u000aIt prompted her to hit back at her accusers: "You all can judge my body all you want, but at the end of the day it's MY body. I love it & I'm comfortable in my skin."\u000a\u000aTwo of Biles' gold medal-winning teammates from Rio have encountered similar problems.\u000a\u000aGabby Douglas, a gold medal-winning teammate of Biles, suffered at the hands of online trolls and Aly Raisman has described as "completely normal" her feelings of insecurity relating to her body.\u000a\u000aIf Biles encounters any element of insecurity relating to her ability, recalling that brilliance in Brazil should help.\u000a\u000aNever before had a woman from the US won four gold medals at a single Olympics, and her complete haul of five medals in Rio cemented her status as America's most decorated gymnast.\u000a\u000aEarly troubles\u000a\u000aBiles' difficult upbringing has been well documented, but key to her success has been positive role models within her extended family.\u000a\u000aShe was placed in foster care aged just three due to her mother Shanon's ongoing battle with drug and alcohol addiction.\u000a\u000aIn 2003, Biles and her sister Adria were adopted by her grandparents, Ron and Nellie Biles and moved to live with them in Spring, Texas, while her two brothers moved in with Ron's sister.\u000a\u000aThe grandparents' influence was pivotal in Biles' early life and she credits her adoptive mom and dad as being one of her biggest inspirations.\u000a\u000a"Outside of gymnastics it was my parents because they're such good role models," she said.\u000a\u000a"They've never steered us wrong and they've always let us choose what we've wanted to do and they would just help us guide that the best way they could.\u000a\u000a"And then in gymnastics either the 2008 or 2012 Olympic Team because we wanted to be just like them."\u000a\u000aHer journey to gold was down to a field trip visit to a gymnastics studio in Houston as a schoolgirl.\u000a\u000aBiles returned home with a note suggesting she be enrolled into a class such was her natural aptitude for the sport.\u000a\u000aBy the time she was 13, it was decided that home schooling would be the best to fit around her training regime, which was upped to 32 hours a week.\u000a\u000aHer promise was clear for all to see but after a wobbly performance at an event in 2013, the family enlisted the help of a sports psychologist to help her with big-event nerves.\u000a\u000aThe rest is history. So what has had the biggest impact on her career?\u000a\u000a"I think it's not just one person," she said. "I think it takes a whole team that impacts my whole entire gymnastics career.\u000a\u000a"It really does take an army to get you where you are. So I would say it's a combination of my parents, my family, my friends, my coaches, my mentors.\u000a\u000a"I have a great agent. So it takes a huge group and it's not just one person."\u000a\u000aBiles' exploits at the Olympics catapulted her to stardom and opened a number of doors back home.\u000a\u000aA predictably successful stint in "Dancing With the Stars" -- one of America's biggest shows -- saw her exit in the semifinal, but only after receiving two perfect scores for her routines.\u000a\u000aShe's achieved so much at the tender age of 20, but what advice would she offer her younger self before she burst into the limelight?\u000a\u000a"Oh gosh! It's to stop being so stubborn because I was a very stubborn kid," she laughed. "Very crazy too! I think it kind of halted a bit of stuff but I think it turned out for the best."\u000a\u000aShe has quickly become a role model for a legion of young people, especially young women, not only for her prowess but also for her poise and personality.\u000a\u000aSo what advice would she give those who look up to her?\u000a\u000a"Just to never give up and to write down your goals and to always wake up in the morning with something you love to do and that you have a passion for," she said.

aVThe company that makes them, Fiskars, claims to have sold over a billion worldwide, so there's a good chance you have a pair at home.\u000a\u000aBut you may not know this: In Bäckström's homeland of Finland, the scissors are so iconic that their 50th birthday is being celebrated with a special exhibition at the Helsinki Design Museum.\u000a\u000aThese simple household tools have become a source of national pride in a country that takes design seriously, according to Pekka Korvenmaa, a professor of design and culture at Finland's Aalto University.\u000a\u000a"They're the most widely-spread Finnish design product," said Korvenmaa in a phone interview.\u000a\u000a"In Finland, when we say 'scissors' we mean Fiskars. There are no other scissors -- more or less -- so it's taken for granted."\u000a\u000aGame-changing design\u000a\u000aEveryday users may give little thought to the design of scissors, but Korvenmaa heralds it as ground-breaking.\u000a\u000a"Its success comes from the ergonomic performance -- the shape and grip of the handle. You take the scissors into your hand and feel the fit," he said.\u000a\u000aHowever, the real game-changer wasn't the shape but the materials. Most of the scissors available in 1967 -- when Bäckström made his design breakthrough -- were the heavy iron variety used by tailors.\u000a\u000a"Tailors' scissors were horrendously expensive, so Fiskars took the shape and cast it in a cheap material -- plastic," said Korvenmaa.\u000a\u000a"Rather than being forged from iron, the blades were made from pressed steel which was held together by a single piece of metal in the middle. The whole production process became quite simple and inexpensive."\u000a\u000aAlthough Fiskars calls the design an " amazing leap in cutting performance ," its success was as much a matter of affordability.\u000a\u000a"Scissors became much more accessible," explained on the phone Marika Orkamo, Fiskars' Vice President of branding and marketing.\u000a\u000a"Not every household had them, even in the 1960s. But eventually they became part of the mass market."\u000a\u000aA happy accident\u000a\u000aFiskars has flirted with different colors over the years. Red handles, for instance, are used to differentiate left-handed models.\u000a\u000aBut the company's brand remains tied to the distinctive orange of its best-selling product -- 'Fiskars Orange' even became a registered trademark in Finland in 2003.\u000a\u000aThe choice of this particular hue, however, came about by accident, according to Orkamo.\u000a\u000a"When the first samples were being produced, there were supposed to be three options -- black, green and red," she said. "But the guy who mixed the plastic had just made an orange-colored juicer, and he had some leftovers in the machine.\u000a\u000a"He wanted to use orange first so that they didn't waste any plastic. When [Fiskars' employees] were presented with the four final choices, they had a vote, and orange beat black by nine votes to seven."\u000a\u000aWhile the original color stuck, changes have been made to the design first proposed by Bäckström, who died in 1998 aged 75. The cutting angle has been altered to improve performance, and a more durable plastic has been in use since the 1980s.\u000a\u000aNot just for the home\u000a\u000aNext month, the Design Museum Helsinki will host an exhibition of work by artists and designers who use -- or are inspired by -- the simple orange scissors.\u000a\u000a"It's such an everyday object that we were worried it could be quite boring," said Orkamo, who curated the exhibition. "But then we started thinking about the different ways the scissors are used, and all the industries that use them."\u000a\u000aThe result is a varied collection of contributions from fashion designers, paper-cutters and food artists. The exhibition also features a playlist by a Finnish musician who goes by the name "DJ Fiskars."\u000a\u000aSome of the participants play explicitly on the scissors' color and design. But others, like artist and designer Martin Bergström, simply used them as a tool. Hailing from Sweden, Bergström will present two pieces: a long flowing dress and collages made from dried flowers.\u000a\u000a"I've had these scissors around since I was a child," he said on the phone. "I've used them in my work for a long, long time.\u000a\u000a"Fiskars' scissors are very well-known in Sweden too -- but I don't think everyone knows they're Finnish. Most people probably think they're from Sweden!"

aVFrida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It's too bad Superman is not running for president of the United States; this would have been his year. Americans, as we have discovered, are angry, frustrated, disillusioned -- and yearning for a savior.\u000a\u000aThis happened before, almost a century ago in Europe. It was a time of despair; a time when the old models didn't seem to be working, when the world was changing in confusing ways, and hyperconfident individuals proposed a way out by blaming scapegoats and promising exciting, almost miraculous change. The results proved catastrophic.\u000a\u000aNo, America is not 1930s Germany, not by a long shot. But the images of Europe after World War I keep coming to mind. The parallels are not precise, but we hear the echoes, see the shadows. We should heed the warnings.\u000a\u000aWho would have thought that in the 21st century, American voters would be seriously considering as presidential candidates a neofascist and a neosocialist -- throwbacks to the old, failed utopias? Talk about fashionably retro!\u000a\u000aLooking at Donald Trump stoking his supporters into a frenzy, attacking "them" -- whoever "they" happen to be at the moment -- vowing to return American to greatness and then flashing his self-satisfied smile, the mind harks back to those grainy newsreel images of Benito Mussolini , the theatrical Italian "Duce," the leader, who became the central figure of fascist Italy a century ago.\u000a\u000aIs Trump a fascist? No, not quite. In fact, Trump doesn't propose anything close to a coherent ideology. He's a Trumpist. And we're only learning what that means, along with him, as he makes it up.\u000a\u000aFascists viewed the nation as an organism superseding the needs of the individual. That does not match Trump's rhetoric. But fascists also ridiculed and suppressed the opposition, and they embraced a level of authoritarianism that we can only hope Trump would reject. But who knows?\u000a\u000aCult of personality\u000a\u000aOne distinct similarity between Trump and the populist politicians of the 1930s is his ability to create and draw power from a cult of personality. The Republican front-runner's main campaign platform is that he will make everything OK. Trump will fix it. Trump will make America great again. How? That's not clear. He will do it by the power of his Trumpness. And we know it will work because look at him; look at how successful he is. Look how strong and fearless he is. There's very little in the way of substance. There's just a lot of Trump.\u000a\u000aAnd to prove how much America needs him, he reminds voters that America is in deep, deep trouble. He hints at nefarious conspiracies; he highlights every problem and every threat, making it sound as ominous as possible. And then he vows to tackle it without mercy, even if it means committing war crimes, violating the Constitution , and expelling millions of people from the country. That, incidentally, would create the digital color version of those 1930s deportations : armed U.S. security forces (very armed) leading frightened people to the trains. (Or would he make them walk across the border?)\u000a\u000aCharisma is a dangerous power in the wrong hands. When combined with popular discontent and disorienting change it can make a travesty of democracy and it can disfigure a society.\u000a\u000aValidating prejudices\u000a\u000aTrump has an uncanny ability to bring out the worst instincts in people. He validates the prejudices that people try to erase from their hearts. Trump seems alarmingly reluctant to distance himself from support from the KKK. Instead of debating ideas and policies, Trump insults and mocks people. He routinely appears to advocate violence against protesters, another disturbing throwback to the 1930s, and he draws a sharp distinction between "us" and "them."\u000a\u000aWe don't know what kind of a president he would be. It's hard to imagine he would continue to speak of punching people in the face, or that he would continue to mock people with disabilities, or follow through with any of his illegal or nonsensical proposals as a head of state. But there's no telling. He has already defied all predictions.\u000a\u000aIn a new turn of events since Thursday's GOP debate, Trump's opponents, who had seemed intimidated by Trump's savaging of Jeb Bush, have finally decided to take him on. It's good to see them challenging his empty offerings, but it's unsettling to see Sen. Marco Rubio also resorting to personality-driven attacks, eliciting uproarious laughter from his supporters. Despite the laughs, it's a sad sight.\u000a\u000aSanders found a scapegoat\u000a\u000aThen there's the other end of the political spectrum: Sen.

But in the spirit of his socialist convictions, he too has found a scapegoat for all that ails America. Sanders would squeeze the rich, for whom he does not hide his contempt. In the manner of a demagogue, he declared , "Fraud is the business model of Wall Street."\u000a\u000aSanders proposes social programs containing the seed of potentially useful ideas, and he undoubtedly points to very real flaws in the system. But his overall approach, if it could ever be implemented, has the makings of an economic disaster . We know that because it was already tried.\u000a\u000aHillary Clinton's overwhelming victory in South Carolina may mark the beginning of the end for the Sanders movement, perhaps a sign that voters know Sanders' idealistic offerings, no matter how appealing, are disconnected from what is possible.\u000a\u000aHis plans would create deficits so large that there are not enough zeroes in calculator displays to hold them. His plans would produce deficits of between $18 trillion to $30 trillion (with a T) from new spending. You can squeeze the Wall Street billionaires as hard as you want. Even they don't have that much money. And while you're at it, see what happens to the economy if you impose the taxes required to even start those programs.\u000a\u000aSanders running honorable but mistaken campaign\u000a\u000aBoth Trump and Sanders are advocating granting much greater powers to the government. To be sure, Sanders appears to be aiming to force discussion of important issues in the campaign, and, unlike Trump, has run an honorable, throughtful and respectful campaign.\u000a\u000aTrump would apparently expand government to secure the country from enemies and from immigrants. Sanders would do it to pay for social plans. Both positions carry a faint whiff of Nirvana, telling voters who feel unsettled -- by growing inequality, expensive unwon wars, and a sense that America is starting to fall behind -- that they have an answer to repair the country, to make them feel safe.\u000a\u000aAgain, this is not Europe in the 1930s, but the European experience carries a warning: Beware of politicians offering easy fixes. Rousing speeches are no guarantee of a better future.

He gave them a pep talk -- a good old fashioned, go-get-'em kind of pep talk.\u000a\u000a"You're a great example for our country right now, and it's got some problems. You know it, and I know it. It's got problems we don't have in the military. And you just hold the line, my fine soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines," Mattis said.\u000a\u000aHe's got a point.

We shouldn't underestimate our fellow citizens.\u000a\u000aOf course, some people pounced on Mattis and claimed he was rebuking President Donald Trump, that he was taking a shot at the commander in chief, who, after the Charlottesville protests, only deepened the tear in the nation's political and social fabric by equating counterprotesters with neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED WH: Trump to donate $1 million of own money to recovery Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH: Trump to donate $1 million of own money to recovery 02:29\u000a\u000aMattis pushed back on that notion Thursday, telling Pentagon reporters that he was channeling the same unifying message Trump delivered last Monday during his Afghanistan speech.\u000a\u000aTrump began that speech by decrying the rifts in modern American society. "When one part of America hurts," Trump said , "we all hurt. And when one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together. Loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another. Love for America requires love for all of its people."\u000a\u000aI know what Mattis meant, even if it did come across a bit differently than the way Trump put it. The defense secretary wasn't picking on his boss, and he wasn't suggesting that the troops are better than the citizens they defend.\u000a\u000aHe was simply stating the obvious: We're a nation divided right now, and the troops serve as a great example of selflessness and teamwork.\u000a\u000aFair enough. But was he totally correct?\u000a\u000aI'm not so sure. Look at Texas.\u000a\u000aNot a lot of hatred, bigotry and political backbiting going on there right now. Well, maybe there's a little backbiting, but it sure seems confined to the politicians.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of Hurricane Harvey, what we're seeing instead is a lot of good people looking for ways to help a lot of other good people. Government and private shelters, as well as private homes, opening up their doors. Neighbors searching for neighbors ... and their neighbors' dogs, cats, parakeets and hamsters.\u000a\u000aMillions of dollars pouring into the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and dozens of other grassroots aid groups. And a literal fleet of john boats, rafts, canoes, kayaks, paddle boards and airboats, manned by citizen sailors, going back and forth across newly formed lakes and rivers of flood water, rescuing people -- their fellow citizens -- in need.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED See human chain help man in submerging car Replay More Videos ...

Or maybe, just maybe, both can be true at the same time: we can still be a divided nation and able to pull together when it's most needed.\u000a\u000aIn either event, the thousands of troops now engaged in recovery efforts will continue to contribute to those efforts with the same professionalism with which they perform every other mission assigned to them. They will subvert themselves to civil authority. They will come prepared to stay for as long as needed. They will help organize and integrate hitherto uncoordinated efforts.\u000a\u000aAnd they will bring with them all the tools necessary: helicopters, boats, radios, supplies and, perhaps above all else, compassion, skill and alacrity -- the very same qualities being exhibited by their fellow countrymen.\u000a\u000aBecause these troops aren't something apart from America.

We need to do a better job listening to and respecting one another. And, clearly, there's still a civilian-military gap we need to continue to close. Americans support the troops, to be sure, but because so few of them have ever served in uniform -- less than 1% -- most civilians don't really understand the troops or their families.\u000a\u000aBut when you look at those images coming out of Texas, and you see what everyone is doing to save lives and support civil authority, you have to believe there's hope that it's not just our troops who serve as great examples.\u000a\u000aYou have to consider that Mattis isn't entirely right, either.\u000a\u000aAnd I'm betting he would be just fine with that.

aVFlorida property insurance stocks have gotten hammered this week as Hurricane Irma threatens to unleash catastrophic damage on the state.\u000a\u000aProperty insurers with major exposure to Florida have lost as much as one-quarter of their value this week due to fears they will be forced to pay enormous claims caused by the Category 4 storm's ferocious winds.\u000a\u000aSunrise, Florida-based Federated National Holdings (FNHC), which insures high-value homes, condos and other properties, has plummeted by 25% this week. Universal Insurance Holdings, (UVE) one of the three leading writers of homeowners insurance in Florida, is down nearly 20% on the week. Both Florida insurers were down even more before rebounding on Friday.\u000a\u000aOther major Florida insurers being hit include Heritage Insurance Holdings (HRTG)and Tampa-based HCI Group (HCI), both of which are down around 20% this week.\u000a\u000aHurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricane in recorded history, is forecast to barrel into Florida this weekend. It's expected to become just the fifth-ever hurricane to hit the state with winds of at least 150 miles per hour.\u000a\u000aMore than 20 million people in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina are expected to experience wind gusts of greater than 75 miles per hour.\u000a\u000aRelated: Florida was leveled by the housing bust but now it's back on top\u000a\u000aRegional insurers are particularly vulnerable to losses in Florida because large national carriers retreated from the state in last decade following a spate of damaging hurricanes.\u000a\u000aSome of these Florida players have highlighted the absence of larger carriers as a competitive advantage. For instance, St. Petersburg-based United Insurance Holdings (UIHC)said on its website that its target market consists of "areas where the perceived threat of natural catastrophe has caused large national insurance carriers to reduce their concentration of policies."\u000a\u000aBut that exposure to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina has caused United Insurance stock to drop about 9% this week.\u000a\u000aMajor national carriers like Chubb (CB), Travelers (TRV) and Allstate (ALL) have experienced more muted losses in recent days.\u000a\u000aState run Citizens Property Insurance Corp., a nonprofit that is not publicly traded, could also face heavy losses from Hurricane Irma.\u000a\u000aHowever, Florida insurers likely won't be on the hook for all of the storm's damage. That's because insurers typically buy protection known as reinsurance that helps cover the costs from major catastrophes. Reinsurance stocks fell sharply this week.

aVWHITE PLAINS (CBSNewYork) \u2013 The ripple effects from Hurricane Harvey are getting stronger at local gas stations.\u000a\u000aPrices are now popping above $3.00 a gallon and will likely keep climbing in the weeks ahead.\u000a\u000aSo, as CBS2\u2019s Brian Conybeare reported, drivers may want to slow down and take a closer look before pulling in to fill up.\u000a\u000aIn Westchester County on Wednesday morning, gas prices varied by 50 cents a gallon from $2.63 a gallon for regular unleaded at the CITGO station on Tarrytown Road in Greenburgh to $3.13 at the Mobil on Marbledale Road in Tuckahoe as prices spike in the wake of Harvey.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous \u2013 how quickly it just rose like that,\u201d said driver Helen Paladino, of Eastchester.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverything is related to the Hurricane Harvey,\u201d said Gentin Gijnaj, who owns an independent gas station in White Plains.\u000a\u000aWhile Hurricane Irma churns toward Florida with potentially devastating results, Harvey\u2019s lasting effects are still hitting New Yorkers in the wallet.\u000a\u000a\u201cCustomers are actually complaining a little bit about the prices just going up, but it\u2019s not us who are raising the prices. It\u2019s actually the wholesalers,\u201d Gijnaj said.\u000a\u000aThe president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores told Conybeare that wholesale prices are very volatile right now, because the Colonial Pipeline that brings gas from the Gulf Coast in Texas to New York was knocked offline by the hurricane.\u000a\u000aMultiple oil refineries were also affected by the storm, and Irma could do even more damage to the supply chain.\u000a\u000aConybeare went out with inspectors from the Westchester Department of Consumer Protection as they investigated any possible price gouging.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want all gas stations across the county to behave responsibly, and we don\u2019t want to see any consumers being taken advantage of because of Harvey,\u201d inspector Mark Fang said.\u000a\u000aIf your local station got a wholesale delivery before Harvey, prices could still be well under $3.00, but likely not for long.\u000a\u000aAAA says the average price of a gallon of regular gas nationwide is currently $2.66.

aV(CNN) She's faced death threats, violence and depression, but the former captain of Afghanistan's women's football team Khalida Popal refuses to be silenced.\u000a\u000a"There are so many women who can't get out of Afghanistan and die," Popal told CNN during a recent visit to London, where she attended the Beyond Sports awards. "I have a voice -- I feel a responsibility to those who can't speak out."\u000a\u000aThe 29-year-old Popal was hounded out of Afghanistan by those who believed women had no right to kick a ball around a field and assaulted by angry gangs. In the end it got too much for her and she made a daring underground escape to the safety of Europe.\u000a\u000aPopal can speak freely now -- those who wanted her dead because she dared to promote women's football and would not be cowed still remain -- but at least they are now thousands of miles away.\u000a\u000aAnd in the safe haven of Denmark, and with her parents having been granted asylum to join her, Popal's world is a very different place.\u000a\u000aNever did she think that just kicking a ball around a school yard with a friend would lead to such upheaval -- nor provide the opportunities which have enriched her life.\u000a\u000aFootball has brought a new sense of freedom to the women of Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aGame time\u000a\u000aIn 2004, at the age of 16, Popal began playing football at a time when the Taliban had banned women from participating in sports or attending stadiums -- the local football arena had also been used for public executions.\u000a\u000aSo, in the shadow of the school, the girls found a secluded yard with high walls in which they could practice -- though Popal says they had to make sure not to make a sound in case of discovery.\u000a\u000aThe Afghan women's national football team played a friendly against the local NATO force.\u000a\u000aSlowly but surely, more girls began to join in, finding solace and escapism in the sport even while prying eyes continued to disapprove.\u000a\u000aEmboldened, the girls then took to the field, a move which led to stones being thrown and full out assaults, says Popal.\u000a\u000aSo taken with the girls' plight, the local NATO base allowed them to train on its field -- as long as they vacated it whenever a helicopter came in to land.\u000a\u000aThe NATO women's team even played a friendly against the Afghan national side to show their support.\u000a\u000aThe US is approaching the 15th anniversary of its war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. It's the longest foreign conflict in US history, with little sign that the NATO allies can disentangle themselves from the country's continuing problems.\u000a\u000aAfghanistan's women's national football team members take a break from training as a US Black Hawk helicopter lands.\u000a\u000aLiving underground\u000a\u000aAmid the conflict and as the profile of women's football grew, Popal, by now captain of the national team, continued to speak out, and her critics began to take more threatening action.\u000a\u000a"I had to leave Afghanistan -- it wasn't safe for me," she said. "I had death threats -- I felt in danger and insecure."\u000a\u000aIt was April 2010 that she began the mission to leave Kabul, the capital, by stealth.\u000a\u000aAfghan women practising on the NATO field.\u000a\u000a"I'll never forget that day. It all happened so quickly. I had to leave everything and save my life. I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my own family, or my teammates. I didn't get the chance to tell them to stay strong.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to tell them I am not giving up but was going away to become stronger -- and come back stronger."\u000a\u000aFor two months she lived underground, slowly working her way towards the border with Pakistan and onto India. Popal says her escape involved people risking their lives to help her leave Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aWhile in India she applied for asylum in Denmark with the help of sports kit manufacturer Hummel, which had made the uniform for the Afghan women's team.\u000a\u000aThrough her work with Hummel she was able to reach Denmark, though Europe was to provide Popal with equally testing challenges.\u000a\u000aDepression\u000a\u000aEnsconced in an asylum center, Popal's journey began to catch up with her. Alone, without family or friends, she found herself struggling to deal with her new surroundings.\u000a\u000a"It was the worst period of my life," Popal said. "When I escaped I left everything behind and had no idea where I would end up. I didn't know about how the asylum center worked -- it was so hard."\u000a\u000aDepression set in -- she remembers feeling "sick" and wondering about her fate. Many of those who had arrived at the center some months before her had yet to find out about their future.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Lionel Messi's biggest fan?

aVCesar Montelongo Hernandez remembers when his parents made the risky decision to overstay their migrant worker visa and keep the family in the U.S.\u000a\u000aHe was just 10 years old and his sister was nine.\u000a\u000a"My family lived in Juarez in Mexico. We were very poor," he recalls. "The drug cartel was very active there and my parents feared for us."\u000a\u000aMontelongo Hernandez's life has changed dramatically since. Now 28, he's two years into an eight-year dual degree MD-Phd program at Loyola University Chicago's Stritch School of Medicine. And he's attending the program on a full scholarship.\u000a\u000aBut Montelongo Hernandez now fears he could lose everything.\u000a\u000aThat's because he is one of nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants who have sought protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The Obama-era program enables undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children -- a group often referred to as Dreamers -- to come out from the shadows.\u000a\u000aRelated: DACA repeal will make doctor shortage worse\u000a\u000aBut on Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it was putting an end to the program. Trump's order gives Congress six months to create a law protecting the people who participate in the program.\u000a\u000a"I woke up on Wednesday and realized this wasn't just a bad dream," said Montelongo Hernandez.\u000a\u000aAcross the country, there are 65 DACA-protected students enrolled in medical school and just under 12 in residency programs, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\u000a\u000a"[They] will now face uncertainty about completing their degrees, paying their student loans, and serving patients," James Madara, chief executive officer of the American Medical Association, wrote in a letter to Congressional leaders.\u000a\u000aSeparately, the Association of American Medical Colleges warned that ending DACA would leave these students in limbo and exacerbate the physician shortage in the United States.\u000a\u000aMontelongo Hernandez's DACA permit will expire next September. Unless Congress comes up with a permanent solution to protect Dreamers, his medical school training could be in jeopardy.\u000a\u000a"I have one year left of protection," he said. "Right now, I am pinning my hopes on Congress."\u000a\u000aHis DACA status also gives him employment authorization. He needs this because the stipend he gets from Loyola, which he uses for living and other expenses, is paid as a salary. The work permit will also be critical for his clinical training and for his residency in a few years.\u000a\u000a"Once my employment authorization expires, I can't be paid," he said.\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump ends DACA but gives Congress window to save it\u000a\u000aOut of its 600 medical students, Loyola has 32 DACA status students and most of the them are supported by three outside loan programs.\u000a\u000aOne major condition of these loans is that these students later serve as physicians in a part of Illinois that is experiencing a doctor shortage after they complete their training, said Mark G. Kuczewski, chair of the department of medical education at Loyola's Stritch School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aIf DACA expires, these students will no longer qualify for the loans.\u000a\u000a"We'll have to find over $1 million in new funding to keep them in school. It would be a crisis situation," he said.\u000a\u000aMontelongo Hernandez was the first student with DACA status to be accepted into Loyola's MD-PhD program.\u000a\u000a"It felt like so much of what I had done until now had finally paid off," said Montelongo Hernandez.\u000a\u000aWhen he was a child, Montelongo Hernandez's parents would typically spend summers on a temporary U.S. visa employed as migrant field workers in New Mexico. After they decided to overstay their visas, his parents explained what it would mean to be undocumented in America.\u000a\u000a"I remember my dad said we were breaking rules and our lives wouldn't be normal. I understood I was giving up my freedom," he said.\u000a\u000aAt first, the family lived in a trailer with 15 other people. "Later, we moved to our own trailer, but there were still 10 people with us," he said.\u000a\u000aMontelongo Hernandez attended public school. He was quiet, leading many of his teachers to think he wasn't very bright.\u000a\u000a"During recess I would just sit by myself," he said. "[I] kept to myself because I felt sad. In some ways I guess I was depressed."\u000a\u000aBut after he received high marks on some exams, he was put into the school's gifted student program and things started to turn around.\u000a\u000aRelated: Ending DACA hits U.S. economy where it hurts\u000a\u000aHe graduated high school third in his class, earning a full scholarship to New Mexico State University. "My parents were pretty shocked and proud," he said. "But with their elementary education, I'm not sure they understood everything I accomplished."\u000a\u000aHe applied to Loyola because it was the first university to accept DACA-status students into a medical school. He was accepted -- and again, received a full scholarship.\u000a\u000aMontelongo Hernandez has six years left in medical school. But his future is uncertain. While both of his parents were able to get permanent residence status through green cards, he and his sister remain in limbo.\u000a\u000aIf he's allowed to stay, he wants to finish the program, become a practicing physician and research ways to improve diagnostic tools for doctors.\u000a\u000aBut he is not getting his hopes up. "I've been in this circumstance so often in my life in America," he said. "I've almost conditioned myself to get through it somehow."

Here, two stout gray-haired men dressed as pilgrims. Over there, a pair of bearded dudes in lederhosen, hoisting trays stacked with mugs of beer. Even the baby girls in the two-seat stroller, sporting Steelers onesies, are spitting images.\u000a\u000aThis double-vision spectacle is Twins Days, an annual festival that brings thousands of twins from around the globe to northeastern Ohio to celebrate their twin-ness. The festival bills itself as the largest annual gathering of twins in the world.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also one big petri dish for scientists, who flock to the festival every summer to study twins\u2019 genetics and behavioral differences.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a club you can\u2019t buy your way into,\u201d says Katie Barry, 32, of New York City, who has been coming to Twins Days with her twin sister Kristy every year since they were 7. She gazes around at the carnival of costumed couples with a smile, searching for the right words.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s this oasis of twin love.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Where\u2019s your twin?\u2019\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s almost too perfect that Twins Days is held in Twinsburg. The Cleveland suburb is named for identical twin brothers who helped settle the town and died of the same ailment in 1827, within hours of each other.\u000a\u000aThe festival got off to a quiet start in 1976, when 36 sets of twins showed up. It grew fast. This year, the event attracted more than 1,900 sets of twins, along with a smattering of triplets and at least one set of quadruplets. They come from almost every US state and from as far away as Australia.\u000a\u000aThe event has a county fair feel and includes a parade, look-alike contests, a talent show and an enormous group photo \u2014 a human blanket of twins \u2014 taken in a field from atop a crane.\u000a\u000aTwin humor is abundant. Siblings stroll the grounds in T-shirts that say, \u201cThing 1\u201d and \u201cThing 2,\u201d \u201cThe Good Twin\u201d and \u201cThe Evil Twin,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not Steven\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not David.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoshua and Jacob McClelland, 16, pose on opposite sides of a \u201cmirror\u201d at the festival.\u000a\u000aMore than a few have rhyming names, like Bernice and Vernice, Carolyn and Sharolyn and Jeynaeha and Jeyvaeha.\u000a\u000aIt may be the only place in America where you can stroll into a hotel and be asked by a staffer, \u201cWhere\u2019s your twin?\u201d\u000a\u000aFor many identical twins, who spend the rest of the year drawing stares and enduring stupid questions \u2014 actual example: \u201cDo you have the same birthday?\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a rare chance not to stand out.\u000a\u000aTwins say they enjoy profound bonds that few \u201csingletons\u201d \u2014 as non-twins are called here \u2014 fully understand.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome people bring spouses or boyfriends, and it\u2019s a terrible mistake,\u201d says Barry, \u201cbecause they feel isolated.\u201d\u000a\u000aKatie and Kristy Barry, 32, of New York City, in homemade costumes inspired by \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn exclusive club\u000a\u000aAbout 33 in every 1,000 human births in the US are twins, a rate that has climbed in recent decades as more women marry later and take fertility drugs or employ in vitro fertilization. Identical twins are an even more exclusive club \u2014 roughly 4 in every 1,000 births.\u000a\u000aThey are formed when a single fertilized egg splits in two after conception, creating two embryos with the same genetic makeup and DNA.\u000a\u000aScientists love to study them because they help answer the age-old question about nature vs. nurture. Because identical twins share the same genes, any differences between them \u2014 say, more wrinkled versus less wrinkled skin \u2014 must be the result of their environment.\u000a\u000aTake Laura and Linda Seber, 41, from Sheffield, Ohio.\u000a\u000aThe pair tied for 8th in their high school class of 404 students, attended the same grad school \u2014 \u201cIt was great to buy one set of books,\u201d Linda says \u2014 and now share a home while working as physical therapists.\u000a\u000aJade Huynh participates in facial-recognition research with scientists from West Virginia University.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we\u2019re genetically identical, I should be able to do everything that she does,\u201d says Linda. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s difficult being compared to each other. Because if I can\u2019t achieve what she achieves, it\u2019s like \u2026 why? Why can\u2019t I do that?\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, it is hard to underestimate the mysterious psychic forces that bind one twin to another.\u000a\u000aDon and Dave Wolf, 59, have identical graying beards that hang halfway down their chests. The identical twins live in Fenton, Michigan, and do long-haul trucking, sharing turns at the wheel during marathon cross-country drives.\u000a\u000aThe pair recall waking up one morning as boys, age 11 or 12, to discover they had just had the same dream. A few years later, Dave suddenly became overwhelmed with concern for his brother only to learn from their dad that Dave had just broken his collarbone in a motorbike crash.\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t explain it. I didn\u2019t feel any pain,\u201d Dave says. \u201cBut I just knew something had happened.\u201d\u000a\u000aDon and Dave Wolf, 59, share a home in Michigan and drive a tractor-trailer together.\u000a\u000aIn the name of science\u000a\u000aIn a long white tent on the festival grounds, a long row of twins sit at tables before trays of color-coded food flavors: milk, potato chips, artificial sweeteners. Wearing nose clips to mask aromas, they uncap each sample, take a taste and then spit into a plastic cup before taking a swig of water and tasting the next. They record their opinions on an iPad.\u000a\u000aThese twins are serving as volunteer subjects for the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a nonprofit research institute in Philadelphia whose sponsors include such food giants as Coca-Cola and General Mills.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur question is whether some people are taste-blind and if so, to what? Our interest is whether this is a genetically determined trait,\u201d says Danielle Reed, a Monell behavioral geneticist. \u201cWe like to compare genetically identical twins to twins that are no more similar than ordinary siblings.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis can help food scientists understand which traits \u2014 say, an affinity for bitter flavors \u2014 are most strongly determined by genetics.\u000a\u000aTara Louis tastes different types of milk as part of genetic research into food preferences.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can imagine if we look subjectively at their DNA we could predict what will taste better or worse to people,\u201d Reed says. \u201cSo you can tailor dietary advice to people's actual ability to taste and smell.\u201d\u000a\u000aMonell is just one of a handful of research groups that attend Twins Days. A few feet away at Procter & Gamble\u2019s Olay tent, scientists are studying twins to better understand the aging process and its effect on skin. Nearby, a forensics expert from the Los Angeles Police Department is collecting latent fingerprints from identical twins \u2014 yes, twins\u2019 prints are slightly different \u2014 to improve fingerprint-identification tools.\u000a\u000aAnd at West Virginia University\u2019s tent, biometric researchers take hi-res photos of twins and record them speaking to help computer scientists create better facial and voice recognition systems. The FBI has funded similar research here as well.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you can build a system that can differentiate between identical twins,\u201d says Jeremy Dawson, a WVU associate professor of computer science, \u201cthen it\u2019s a lot easier to tell the difference between (regular) people.\u201d\u000a\u000aPatrick M. Ketter and Paul R. Ketter Jr. sport patriotic outfits. One twin is liberal, the other more conservative.\u000a\u000aDoug and Jill and Phil and Jenna\u000a\u000aTwins Days is also about the science of attraction.\u000a\u000aNew kings and queens are crowned here each summer. But the closest thing to perennial festival royalty are the Malms.\u000a\u000aGregarious identical twins Doug and Phil Malm grew up in Idaho. Identical twins Jill and Jenna Lassen, both introverts, grew up in Michigan. Their father would address them as \u201csisters\u201d because he was too proud to admit he couldn\u2019t tell the girls apart.\u000a\u000aAll four were visiting the Twinsburg festival in 1991 when they met and sparks flew. Luckily, there was never a question over who would be with who.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was instant,\u201d says Phil, who chose Jenna. \u201cWe knew right away which one we were with.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhil, Jenna, Jill and Doug Malm. The foursome met at Twins Days in 1991 and were married here two years later.\u000a\u000aThe foursome now live in Moscow, Idaho, as members of a tiny subset \u2014 identical twins married to identical twins. Doug and Phil, 60, are retired carpenters, while Jill and Jenna, 50, work in day care.\u000a\u000aAll four share one home. Separate houses, even side by side, wasn\u2019t an option.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt never would have worked,\u201d Doug says.\u000a\u000aBut the couples have had to learn to solve domestic disputes as a foursome.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we fight, we can\u2019t work it out as just two of us. We have to work it out as four,\u201d Phil says.\u000a\u000aAnd yes, sometimes household confusion reigns.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I look at my wife and her sister, there are days when I cannot tell them apart,\u201d Doug says.\u000a\u000aHe has been known to come up behind Jill and give her a playful bite on the neck, only to realize he\u2019s nuzzling Jenna. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he says, \u201cwe get teased for a while.\u201d\u000a\u000aLauren and Allison Knight wear matching tops celebrating their Canadian heritage.\u000a\u000aA year\u2019s worth of data\u000a\u000aBack at the research tents, the twins line up, sometimes for an hour or more, to participate. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial arrangement.\u000a\u000aThe twins enjoy it because they get money or free samples. Many say they feel good knowing they are contributing to science.\u000a\u000aThe scientists like it because it\u2019s an efficient way to gather data from a hard-to-find group of people.\u000a\u000aThe Monell Chemical Senses Center expects to collect research on some 450 twins over the course of the weekend.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe collect a year\u2019s worth of data in four hours,\u201d Reed says.\u000a\u000aBraeden and Aaron Chulskiy, 2 1/2, are pulled in a wagon by their dad.\u000a\u000aThe saddest man at Twins Days\u000a\u000aAmid the procession of coupled siblings, one man wanders alone.\u000a\u000aShawn Riggins, 45, wears a T-shirt with images of his twin brother Shane\u2019s face and a festival badge bearing both their names. And he wears his heart on his sleeve.\u000a\u000aShane is not here. He died last September of colorectal cancer.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of emptiness that no words can describe,\u201d Shawn says. \u201cThere is a pain that\u2019s so deep you can\u2019t cry it out. You can\u2019t scream it out. You just need to walk through.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s not here in the physical, but I see him every day when I walk past a mirror.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe two brothers had been coming to Twins Days together for 20 years. They thought they were fraternal twins until 2002, when they took DNA tests at the festival and learned they were identical.\u000a\u000aShawn Riggins, center, talks with friends at his first Twins Days without his twin brother Shane, who died last year.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe looked exactly alike,\u201d says Shawn, who is a kindergarten teacher in Columbus, Ohio, and remains cancer free. \u201cWe did everything together. We had the same eyeglasses. We had the same facial hair. If we went to an event, we always had to walk in at the same time.\u201d\u000a\u000aShawn agonized for months about whether to come to Twins Days this year. But in the end, he decided the support of his fellow twins, many of whom knew Shane, made it worth the trip.\u000a\u000a\u201cI came back here because no one else but a twin can understand the enormity of what I\u2019m feeling,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aThe scientists, focused on sets of twins, no longer want to study Shawn. They can measure twins\u2019 DNA, but they can\u2019t fathom the depths of their grief.\u000a\u000aBut twins here, many of whom remember his brother, take him in their arms for tearful embraces.\u000a\u000aJust then, as if on cue, a woman approaches Shawn and gives him a long hug. He thanks her.\u000a\u000aFor now, he says, \u201cthe energy in this place has given me the strength to stay.\u201d\u000a\u000aRiggins takes a deep breath, pulls himself together and shuffles toward a passing throng of festivalgoers. He\u2019s ready for more hugs, two at a time.

aV(CNN) The most dismaying of Pew's findings is that the drop in regard for America goes well beyond Trump. Sixty-four percent of the people surveyed expressed a favorable view of the United States at the end of the Obama presidency. That has fallen to 49 percent now. Even when U.S. foreign policy was unpopular, people around the world still believed in America -- the place, the idea. This is less true today.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, I wrote a book about the emerging "Post-American World," which, I noted at the start, was not about the decline of America but rather the rise of the rest. Amid the parochialism, ineptitude and sheer disarray of the Trump presidency, the post-American world is coming to fruition much faster than I ever expected.

This commentary has been updated since its publication. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I just finished reading one of the most powerful things I've ever seen.\u000a\u000aIf you've already seen it, you likely feel the same way:\u000a\u000aIt is riveting. It's raw. I hung on every single word.\u000a\u000aIt is the 12-page victim impact statement written by a woman who was raped in January 2015 on the Stanford University campus after a night of drinking at a party.\u000a\u000aThe power of her words stood in stark contrast to those of the father of her attacker. He, too, wrote a letter to the judge who held his son's fate in his hands. It is deeply disturbing in its plainspoken and clueless banality, and tells you everything you need to know about why the crime of rape so frequently goes unpunished in America.\u000a\u000aThis is a case with no ambiguity. There were witnesses to her attack: two male Stanford students were riding their bikes across campus when they spotted Brock Allen Turner on top of a woman who wasn't moving. These men are among the heroes in her heartbreakingly sad story.\u000a\u000aThey chased him, tackled him and held him until the police came. The victim had no memory of the rape. She was unconscious behind a dumpster when Turner assaulted her. His defense: she consented.\u000a\u000aHe was convicted of all three felony accounts and will register as a sex offender. He faced 14 years in prison, and will only serve six months. (update: Turner was released from jail Friday after serving 3 months of his sentence.)\u000a\u000aAt the sentencing, the victim read her letter aloud and addressed Turner directly. In it, she gives a harrowing description of her rape and a jaw-dropping account of its aftermath. Reading it will expose you to the horror every rape victim faces as she is retraumatized over and over while society seeks "justice" against her rapist.\u000a\u000aI'm a parent. I was so moved that I printed out a copy. I wanted my family to read it. Not just our two daughters, but my husband and our son.\u000a\u000aThat's who should be reading this letter. Give it to your sons, your brothers and your mates.\u000a\u000aIf anything is going to change the culture of rape in our society, it will be a turnaround led by men like the two guys who stopped it that night and the Santa Clara county district attorney, Jeff Rosen, who called the sentence "unjust."\u000a\u000aRosen added that "the fact that the defendant preyed upon an intoxicated stranger on a college campus should not be viewed as less serious than if he assaulted an intoxicated stranger in downtown Palo Alto... Campus rape is no different than off-campus rape. Rape is rape."\u000a\u000aWe women know all too well about victim blaming, alcohol as an excuse for assault. It's not alcohol that's raping women; it is men.\u000a\u000aOur sons, all the young men in our lives need to be told: Alcohol is never an excuse\u000a\u000aAs the victim wrote: "Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked."\u000a\u000aIt's black and white: If a woman is drunk, she can't consent.\u000a\u000aAfter hearing from the victim, the judge also considered the appalling letter from the rapist's father, Dan Turner.\u000a\u000aIn it, he pleads with the judge for leniency for his son, explaining that his son should not have to go to prison for "20 minutes of action." The father describes how "this" has affected his son negatively\u2014he has lost his appetite and doesn't like eating "ribeye steak" anymore.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim?

MUST WATCH Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? 03:45\u000a\u000aHe writes, "The fact that he now has to register as a sexual offender for the rest of his life forever alters where he can live, visit, work, and interact with people and organization." He argues that his son's "life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve."\u000a\u000aIn the end, the judge sentenced Turner to six months in county prison, saying a harsher penalty would have a "severe impact" on the aspiring athlete. His sentence includes probation and his name in a sex offender registry.\u000a\u000aThat last part isn't to punish Turner -- it's to protect us all from him. You know why he has to register as a sexual offender? It's because he committed a sexual crime.\u000a\u000aEven after the trial. Even after the conviction, there is still denial -- Turner's dad writing that his son has "never been violent to anyone including the night of" the crime! Twelve jurors believed otherwise. And now the Turners will appeal.\u000a\u000aSocial media has been rightfully ablaze. The most compelling tweet I have seen is this one by Twitter user Jez Kemp, who edited the dad's letter to highlight the victim-blaming, swapping in female pronouns to illuminate the issue. Take a look:\u000a\u000aRape isn't a story about alcohol. It's one of choices. And every man has a choice. To rape or not. To rescue or ignore. To deliver justice or give someone a slap on the wrist.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that will change this is awareness by men. The good guys. That's why I'm asking you to share this letter with your sons, your brothers and your friends.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) There are few things more unpleasant than relitigating the 2016 Democratic primary. But more than a year later, it hasn't stopped, partly because the race touched on so many hot spots that continue to animate our politics: the way gender shapes how we perceive power, how class struggle collides with racial entitlement, what it even means to be "progressive" or to work outside the system.\u000a\u000aAnd now, there's something new to argue over: Hillary Clinton's forthcoming book, "What Happened."\u000a\u000aIn it, according to excerpts posted by a group of Clinton supporters, she criticizes her primary opponent , Bernie Sanders, for running to be the Democratic nominee while not actually being a Democrat, and for targeting her in a campaign of character assassination, instead of doing a deep dive into policy.\u000a\u000aPredictably, the response from the Sanders left and the Trump right has been about the same: Shut up and go away. This is after the demands that she "take responsibility" and "apologize." (Has any politician in the history of America been ordered to say she's sorry as often as Hillary Clinton?)\u000a\u000aIs the relitigation of the primary pleasant? No. Is a look at what happened, from the perspective of the only woman in American history to be a hair's width away from the presidency, a pretty valuable contribution? Yes.\u000a\u000aAnd while this will certainly take a few minutes away from a news cycle of North Korean nukes, horrific natural disasters and a growing list of Trump cruelties and blunders, there isn't really a better time: In a few months we'll be gearing up for the midterm elections, and after that, our insane election cycles will have us in presidential-campaigning mode. It seems likely that Sanders will again be one of the campaigners.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Clinton: I was thinking 'back up, you creep' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton: I was thinking 'back up, you creep' 02:07\u000a\u000aAnd so it's only fair to take a look at his previous efforts, and learn some lessons. Clinton is right: Sanders' attacks on her character fed the same narrative as Trump's. They hurt her in the general election. And she's right that running on the Democratic ticket when you're not a Democrat isn't just hypocritical, it can be incredibly damaging. For one thing, it gives a candidate a platform to trash the very party he says he wants to lead.\u000a\u000aOn the left today, the Sanders/Clinton divide remains. In some progressive circles, being a "neoliberal" is, as others have astutely observed , "the left's favorite insult," a handy catchall for everything that's wrong with the world. In their framework, Hillary Clinton is the epitome of neoliberalism, which is why she lost; Bernie Sanders is the bulwark against it, which is why he lost (funny how that works).\u000a\u000a"Neoliberal" unfortunately remains ill-defined -- in theory it means a social liberal who favors global capitalism and corporate-friendly policies at the expense of social welfare; in practice, it seems to mean anything from "a member of the Democratic Party" to "anyone who voted for Clinton" to "someone I am simply deeming less progressive than me" to "a description of actual right-wing Republican-crafted policies that are somehow getting blamed on Democrats."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Madden: Clinton book 'sucks up oxygen' for Dem party Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Madden: Clinton book 'sucks up oxygen' for Dem party 05:22\u000a\u000aThis is because among some factions of the left -- Sanders loyalists, newly minted socialists -- being a liberal is just as bad as being an anti-gay pro-gun anti-choice tax-slashing administrative-state-dismantling deep-red congressman who moonlights as a Breitbart columnist.\u000a\u000aIs that Sanders' fault? No. (And indeed, the ascendance of his brand of socialism in the United States is long overdue.) But his attacks on the Democratic Party helped set the stage for this thoroughly dysfunctional, and ultimately destructive discourse.\u000a\u000aOn the right, things are different. What's clear from the seeming millions of post-election dispatches from "Real America" (that is, working class white America; black and brown America somehow rarely makes the authenticity cut) is that a whole lot of conservative voters cast their ballots for Trump not because they share his values exactly, or because they were voting for anything, but because they hate liberals and wanted to give us the finger.\u000a\u000aA sophisticated right-wing propaganda machine has helped to sow this malevolence, and the GOP has reaped the benefits.\u000a\u000aToo much of the left has joined right in on the liberal-bashing. What too many on the left don't realize, though, is that the rest of the country \u2014 the nonleft -- doesn't make the distinction between liberals, progressives, socialists and so on. We're all just liberal elite scum. And that's why we're all losing -- from the far-left Bernie wing (whose policies I'm more inclined to support) to centrists (of whom Clinton, who ran the most progressive campaign in American history, was not exactly one).\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Sanders: Ending DACA most cruel, ugly decision Replay More Videos ...

For that, Sanders deserves a lot of credit.\u000a\u000aBut the Democrats lost, and, as Clinton points out, Sanders also deserves some "credit" for that. The reasons behind Clinton's loss are many, and Sanders was hardly the No. 1 cause. But he was no neutral force.\u000a\u000aThe fact is, if those of us who want to move our country to the left are going to win -- not just elections, but on a policy level and a cultural one, too -- we need to stop buying the right-wing lines about liberals and Democrats, and stop demonizing our closest allies and best chances of retaking any power at all.\u000a\u000aSanders has positioned himself as a leader for the future of the left, and his followers agree, with near-messianic worship. Embracing the whole left would be a good place for him to start.

aV(CNN) Many of us equate "sex" with "intercourse" and use those words interchangeably. Yet highly satisfying sex doesn't have to be limited to penetration -- and doesn't even have to include it at all.\u000a\u000aFor the study, Debby Herbenick, director of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University and a research fellow and sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, and her colleagues assessed data from 1,055 women ages 18 to 94 who answered a detailed online survey about their sex lives. "Our purpose was to understand more about women's experiences with ... the kinds of touch they find pleasurable and how clitoral and vaginal stimulation contribute to their orgasms," she explained.\u000a\u000aIn reading her results, I'm struck by the idea that the majority of women report that they often don't reach orgasm through intercourse alone. This flies in the face of the stereotype of intercourse as the be-all and end-all of sexual activity -- and suggests that couples should explore the whole range of pleasurable options for achieving climax. The study contained a few compelling findings worth enumerating.\u000a\u000aIntercourse isn't everything\u000a\u000aThis study found that only about 18% of women reported being able to climax during intercourse from vaginal penetration alone. About 36% said they needed clitoral stimulation in order to orgasm during intercourse, and another 36% said it enhanced the experience. Yet, many women still fake orgasm during intercourse, according to therapist Laurie Mintz, author of the new book " Becoming Cliterate ."\u000a\u000a"The main reasons they give for faking is that they want to appear 'normal' and want to make their male partners feel good," she said.\u000a\u000a"This is one of the saddest and most common problems I deal with in my clinical practice," added Anita Hoffer, a sexuality counselor and educator. "Women who either are uninformed or insecure and therefore easily intimidated by ignorant partners bear a great deal of shame and guilt at being unable to climax from intercourse alone. Many are greatly relieved when they learn that they are among the majority of women who engage in sexual intercourse."\u000a\u000aOrgasms vary\u000a\u000aDo some orgasms feel better than others? According to 78% of the survey respondents, the answer is yes. These so-called better orgasms aren't necessarily dependent on the length of an encounter. In fact, fewer than one in five women surveyed believed that longer sex contributed to better orgasms.\u000a\u000aInstead, the most common contributors to orgasmic bliss included spending time to build arousal, having a partner who knows that they like, emotional intimacy and clitoral stimulation during intercourse, said Herbenick. "A woman's general mood and stress level -- including the degree to which she is able to mindfully immerse in the sexual encounter -- can have an impact on orgasm quality too," Mintz explained.\u000a\u000a'Outercourse' matters\u000a\u000aThis term "outercourse" refers to sex that isn't intercourse and doesn't involve penetration. It can include kissing, touching, erotic massage and using sex toys, just to name a few options.\u000a\u000a"When we equate intercourse and sex and call everything that comes before intercourse 'foreplay,' we are buying into the cultural script that sex should proceed as follows: foreplay (just enough to get her ready for intercourse), intercourse (during which both women and men orgasm), and game over," Mintz said. But sex doesn't have to involve intercourse at all. Even when it does, other forms of stimulation can add to the experience and may improve the odds of reaching orgasm.\u000a\u000aHerbenick suggested that couples take a lesson from the early days of their relationship. "Sometimes, when people are first getting together, they spend time making out and touching each other's genitals long before they start having oral sex or intercourse with each other," she explained. "All too often, once oral sex and intercourse become part of their routine, the rest fades away -- which is too bad, considering how powerful genital touching can be."\u000a\u000aCommunication is key\u000a\u000aThe study found that 41% of women prefer just one style of touch. "This underscores how important it is to have conversations about sex and pleasure or even to show your partner what you like, since otherwise, the chances of just stumbling upon that one preference are pretty low," Herbenick said. "Couples should be having conversations about what they like, what they don't like, what feels good and leads to orgasm, as well as what feels good but doesn't necessarily lead to orgasm."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aOne good source of information about women's sexual pleasure that can help you get the conversation started is the website for OMGYES , which sponsored the study. The site, which states it's for 18-year-olds and older, contains a series of videos that demonstrate different types of touch that real women find pleasurable, including techniques labeled "edging," "layering" and "orbiting." There is a free preview but a cost to access all of them.

aVCambridge University Press has reversed a decision to censor hundreds of articles at the request of the Chinese government after a backlash from academics and activists.\u000a\u000aThe university press, which describes itself as the oldest publishing house in the world, had admitted to blocking online access in China to academic works on Tiananmen Square, the Cultural Revolution and Tibet.\u000a\u000aThe University of Cambridge said in a statement on Monday that its academic leadership and the publisher had agreed to reinstate the blocked content "with immediate effect" to "uphold the principle of academic freedom."\u000a\u000aThe censored academic articles appeared in the highly regarded journal China Quarterly. Its editor, Tim Pringle, said the reversal followed a "justifiably intense reaction from the global academic community and beyond."\u000a\u000a"Access to published materials of the highest quality is a core component of scholarly research," he said in a statement on Monday. "It is not the role of respected global publishing houses ... to hinder such access."\u000a\u000aThe decision to censor the articles drew condemnation from academics around the world.\u000a\u000aIt represented "a craven, shameful and destructive concession" to the Chinese government's "growing censorship regime," Georgetown University professor James Millward wrote in an open letter published over the weekend.\u000a\u000aBy Monday, an online petition threatening a boycott of the publisher and its journals had gathered hundreds of signatures.\u000a\u000aRelated: Facebook finds a way into China\u000a\u000aThe not-for-profit publisher had defended its action as necessary to ensure that China doesn't block "entire collections of content." It said it would never proactively censor its own content.\u000a\u000aBut many prominent academics blasted the move.\u000a\u000a"Chinese students and scholars reading a censored version of The China Quarterly will encounter only historical facts and scholarly analyses approved by political authorities," Greg Distelhorst of MIT and Jessica Chen Weiss of Cornell wrote in a letter to Cambridge University Press.\u000a\u000a"This censored history of China will literally bear the seal of Cambridge University," they said.\u000a\u000aThe Cambridge press, which has been operating since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century, has run into a challenge faced by other global publishers: obey China's censors or be locked out of its giant market.\u000a\u000aRelated: Apple's Tim Cook hopes China will ease VPN restrictions\u000a\u000aForeign authors who wish to publish books in China must allow their works to be altered by censors. Top news organizations like The New York Times have had their websites blocked in China for years after publishing articles that upset the ruling Communist Party.\u000a\u000a"Western institutions have the freedom to choose," said an English-language opinion article published Sunday by Global Times, a provocative but state-sanctioned Chinese tabloid. "If they don't like the Chinese way, they can stop engaging with us.

aVMichael D'Antonio is the author of the book " Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success " (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) To understand how President Donald Trump could rescind a program protecting nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants, it helps to recognize two of his strongest traits. The first is his conviction, as he explained it to me in 2014, that "most people aren't worthy of respect." The second is his profound fear of his fellow human being -- at least ones who don't resemble him.\u000a\u000aTrump spent the 35 years before he moved to the White House avoiding contact with anyone who wasn't invited into his presence. The symbol of Trump's anxiety was the 66th floor of the tower he built on Fifth Avenue. His penthouse apartment was separated from the world below by guards and several security barriers, and he didn't have to risk seeing anyone he didn't employ as he made his way from his home to the office below, which was also guarded by men with guns.\u000a\u000aAs much a gilded cage as it is fortress, Trump Tower is a testament to the man's fear of humanity. "Man is the most vicious of all animals," he told People magazine in 1981 as he embarked on a career of continual conflict over money, property and fame. It's no fluke that his TV catchphrase -- "You're fired" -- signaled a crushing blow to contestants he deemed to have failed on "The Apprentice." On the program, the tension preceding the verdict and the suffering of the condemned made for a depraved kind of exercise the host clearly relished.\u000a\u000aThe exclusionary exercise Trump enjoyed while firing people on TV reflected an approach to life he had taken since entering the family business. And in his insulated world, Trump's opinions were affirmed and reaffirmed until they hardened into a perspective that led him to observe conditions on the border with Mexico in stomach-churning terms. "Everything's coming across the border: the illegals, the cars, and the whole thing. It's like a big mess. Blah. It's like vomit."\u000a\u000aMonths after making the vomit remark, Trump began his presidential campaign on undocumented immigrants, claiming Mexicans were "bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists." A few weeks later he added, in germophobic eloquence , that "Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border." No evidence supports any of Trump's claims about crime or disease, but this hasn't stopped him from using them to encourage others to feel afraid, too.\u000a\u000aMuch of Trump's campaign was about establishing an "us vs. them" view of our times, which meant that Trump's side, made up largely of white Americans, was at war with the opposition, made up of Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, the press and foreigners.\u000a\u000aAmong those he promised to reject were the young people covered under President Barack Obama's Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which gave those who came to America with their undocumented parents legal standing to stay. He justified the exclusionary strategy as a patriotic imperative. "We either have a country or we don't," he explained on the campaign trail. "We have borders or we don't have borders."\u000a\u000aThat Trump was reportedly troubled by the decision to rescind DACA is not proof that his heart was divided. It's far more likely that he understood the politics of the matter and was comparing the benefits of fulfilling a campaign promise with the possibility of broadening his base by sparing the Dreamers. The decision may have been governed by the realization that he needs to reassure his core supporters that he is still the angry, anti-immigrant man they saw on the campaign trail. Besides, Trump lost everyone he might have won over by sparing the Dreamers when he pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Mayor of LA: Dreamers are "children of America" Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mayor of LA: Dreamers are "children of America" 06:42\u000a\u000aAlthough these undocumented individuals are generally upstanding members of society, they are haunted by Trump's campaign promise to deport them and by their dependence on action taken by the President's predecessor. And, unfortunately, Trump seems motivated by the singular goal of overturning everything the previous administration did. It was Obama who included Dreamers in the American tapestry, and so Trump is determined to exclude them.\u000a\u000aThere's something about exclusion -- the kind practiced by private clubs and luxury resorts -- that seems to please Trump at an elemental level. In the hours we spent together as I was writing his biography, he became most animated when discussing his pricey clubs like Bedminster, with its private helipad, or Mar-a-Lago, where membership is now $200,000 and dues are $14,000 per year.\u000a\u000aTrump clubs are not exclusive in the way that, say, an Ivy League college or the National Academy of Science are exclusive. Those august institutions value merit and reward achievement, talent and character expressed through service. In contrast, anyone with the requisite cash will be admitted into Trump's orbit.\u000a\u000aMembership logs at Trump's clubs are not public, but the press occasionally gets a peek . In January 2017, a notice welcoming new members to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach included 30 surnames, but not one was Hispanic. Another 30 names appeared on the welcome list in the summer of 2016. One is of Spanish origin.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aPeople with Spanish surnames are welcomed by Trump if they can afford the price of admission at Mar-a-Lago, but the DACA participants who want to contribute their lives to America are not welcomed by his administration. He rejects them out of fear. And because their humanity isn't enough to merit his respect, he shows them no mercy.\u000a\u000aIf you are wondering where this grim perspective originates, reflect on Trump's own experience as a youngster. When he was 13 years old, Trump was suddenly banished for bad behavior by his father, sent to a military academy where he was, by his own telling, treated brutally by the military veterans who ran the place. "They'd smack the hell out of you," he told me.\u000a\u000aWhat lesson could be taken away from this experience, other than that human beings are vicious and exclusion is a proper tool of social control? Now that he's the symbolic father of the American family, he's doing to the Dreamers what was done to him.

aV(CNN) Even if you've never heard of it, Helvetica has been part of your life.\u000a\u000aThis typeface is, very literally, everywhere: computer screens, billboards, buildings, street signs and posters.\u000a\u000aLook around you. It's likely that some manifestation of Helvetica won't be too far away.\u000a\u000aSince its launch in 1957, it's become the go-to type for company logos and transport hubs, making it one of the most widespread designs of all time.\u000a\u000aBut like every icon, Helvetica divides opinions, and many designers consider it unoriginal, uninspired and unattractive.\u000a\u000aSo why has it ruled the world for 60 years?\u000a\u000aThe right name\u000a\u000a"Helvetica has a complicated history. In fact, it was not called Helvetica until four years after it's release," American designer and design historian Paul Shaw explained over the phone.\u000a\u000aIt started its life as "Neue Haas Grotesk," a boringly descriptive moniker which included the name of its maker (the Haas foundry), its design type (neo-grotesque or realist) and the fact that is was new (or "neue" in German).\u000a\u000a"The original name sucked," said Shaw.\u000a\u000aThe name Helvetica, which means "Swiss" in Latin as a homage to its country of origin, was adopted in 1960 to make it easier to sell it abroad.\u000a\u000aAnd so it did: "Helvetica gets its first kick because the Germans come up with a great name and make it available in the two mechanisms of the day, machines and foundry type, so that anybody could buy it."\u000a\u000aIts design wasn't original: Helvetica was born out of a typeface from 1896 called Standard in the US and Akzidenz-Grotesk in Germany, which had been used as the avant-garde typeface from the 1920s, especially in Switzerland.\u000a\u000a"Standard as a name was brilliant, but it also caused problems, because people started saying 'We'll just use the standard typeface' and those who were not designers took that literally to mean whatever we've been using for everything else. That's how Helvetica accidentally slipped through the cracks," said Shaw.\u000a\u000aThe right look\u000a\u000aHelvetica's creators, graphic designer Max Miedinger and his boss, Eduard Hoffmann, wanted a neutral and versatile design. It had to be a modern-looking "sans-serif" type, without the extending features at the end of strokes that were common in the print world.\u000a\u000aIts lack of personality was not just intentional, but paramount. Legendary designer Massimo Vignelli , who used Helvetica for the New York Subway system, said in Gary Hustwit's eponymous 2007 documentary : "There are people that think that type should be expressive. They have a different point of view from mine."\u000a\u000aIts mix of features, or lack thereof, happened to be exactly what designers were looking for: "Helvetica showed up at the right place, the right time," said in an email Ellen Lupton, curator of contemporary design at the Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York.\u000a\u000a"It provided something that designers wanted: a typeface apparently devoid of personality. In contrast, other popular sans serif typefaces that existed at the time, such as Gill Sans and Futura , have stronger voices and more distinctive geometries. Helvetica met our craving for corporate vanilla," said Lutpon.\u000a\u000aThe right brand\u000a\u000aHelvetica wasn't an immediate hit in Europe, although it was available there first.\u000a\u000aFamed designer Bob Noorda doesn't use it for the Milan metro signage, choosing his own version of the Standard typeface instead: "He could have used Helvetica, but he didn't, and neither did the Dutch for Schiphol airport. Helvetica just didn't have the cachet it has today," said Shaw.\u000a\u000aBut it didn't take long before it became the standard for advertising and corporate branding in the US: "In 1967 it creeps into the design for the Yankee Stadium," said Shaw, "And by 1968 it's everywhere in America -- it is the typeface."\u000a\u000aVignelli chooses it for the American Airlines logo, which will remain untouched until 2013 -- one of the most enduring corporate identities of the 20th Century. It ends up -- sometimes with minor variations -- in countless company logos including those of BMW, Crate&Barrel, Fendi, Jeep, Kawasaki, Knoll, Lufthansa, Mattel, Nestlé, Panasonic, Scotch, Skype, Target, Texaco, Tupperware, and Verizon. NASA paints it on the side of the Space Shuttle. The US government redesigned its tax forms with it.\u000a\u000aThe classic American Airlines logo design by Massimo Vignelli.\u000a\u000aIn 1984, Steve Jobs puts it in the Macintosh: "This was a key move. If Apple didn't use it, Helvetica would have remained a designer's preference, same as Times New Roman. Instead, it becomes the default sans serif when sans serif fonts are becoming popular among the populous and not just avant-garde designers," said Shaw.\u000a\u000aThe world is conquered: "It's air, you know. It's just there. There's no choice. You have to breathe, so you have to use Helvetica," says influential German typographer Erik Spiekermann in "Helvetica," a 2007 documentary.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Helvetica at 60 Patrick Thomas \u2013 Spanish design studio Husmee pays tribute to the Helvetica typeface for its 60th anniversary with an original poster collection from 19 designers.

It was the system font on the original iPhone, and it remained part of iOS until 2015, when Apple replaced it with its own San Francisco.\u000a\u000aIt continues to inspire: the font used in this article and the rest of CNN's website is a close relative of Helvetica called CNN Sans . Microsoft's knockoff of Helvetica, called Arial, is one of Windows' most popular system fonts.\u000a\u000aIn Venice, Arial is replacing Helvetica in some Vaporetto signage, such as the word 'Rialto' here.\u000a\u000aHowever, it's not easy to get a kind word on Helvetica from designers: The fact that people didn't feel passionate about it in retrospect is interesting," said Shaw, "It's not a terrible typeface, it's just heavily overrated."\u000a\u000aAccording to Shaw, there was not a lot design-wise that made it better than either Standard or Univers, its great rival that was released in the same year.\u000a\u000a"I am not a big fan of Helvetica, but I admire its ability to spread and take root worldwide," said Lupton.\u000a\u000a"It is an invasive and drug-resistant species that may never be eradicated. Even designers who don't often use Helvetica in their own work take pride in the fact that it is such a persistent cultural icon."

aVElsa/Getty Images\u000a\u000aFOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2014 It is almost happy hour on Friday of the 18th week of the NFL season. After practicing earlier in the day, Patriots players are free to enjoy a weekend off. The lot outside Gillette Stadium where they park their cars is nearly empty. Snow is on the ground. A chill is in the air.\u000a\u000aTom Brady could be tickling his adorable kids in his Brookline mansion and listening to their sweet giggles. He could be feeling the warmth of the sun in a poolside cabana somewhere in Mexico, sipping an adult beverage from a poco grande glass with an umbrella in it. He even could be on Justin Bieber's party boat.\u000a\u000aInstead, the great Tom Brady is on the practice field in back of Gillette Stadium, passing footballs to Julian Edelman under the watch of throwing coach Tom House.\u000a\u000aBrady brought House to Foxborough for a mechanical evaluation and tuneup. House is observing Brady's passing from different angles. Is his arm at 30 degrees or 35 when he throws? Is his aim consistent? Is his foot placement enabling maximum hip drive? Is he effectively balanced?\u000a\u000aAt 39, Peyton Manning no longer could throw the way he used to. He missed seven starts with a foot injury and had a 67.9 passer rating\u2014easily the worst of his career. And he knew it was time to exit the arena.\u000a\u000aAt 39, Brady led the AFC in passer rating, yards per attempt and passing yards per game. The Patriots won 11 of his 12 starts, leading many to believe he was the league's MVP. And he dreamed of playing for another decade.\u000a\u000a"It is unbelievable to see a 39-year-old man play like he's 29," says Edelman, his teammate for eight years. "His body hasn't really changed. He may have lost some hair. Other than that, he's still the same."\u000a\u000aBrady isn't aging as much as he is evolving, and it is not by happenstance. His objective is not to avoid becoming Manning at 39. It's to become a better Brady.\u000a\u000a"I love the game, and I always want to improve," Brady says. "My college coach used to say, 'Better or worse: What's it gonna be?' I love to learn and to see improvement."\u000a\u000aThe season began for Brady with a four-game suspension resulting from Deflategate. While his teammates were winning three games and losing one, Brady was doing everything he could to make his body feel like he was playing football.\u000a\u000aWearing a helmet and pads, Brady went through the usual quarterback drills. Assistants batted him with padded arms and bags as he threw. Receivers, including former teammate Wes Welker, ran routes for him.\u000a\u000a"We trained harder than the sport itself demands," says Alex Guerrero, Brady's body coach. "The four weeks he was off, he worked really hard. He trained so when he came back it didn't look like he had taken four weeks off."\u000a\u000aWhen the suspension ended, it was almost as if it never happened. "Never mentioned the suspension," Patriots receiver Chris Hogan says. "There was no looking back for him, only looking forward."\u000a\u000aJim Rogash/Getty Images\u000a\u000aBrady's focus was on being a leader, not a martyr. He just started throwing touchdown passes. In his first four games, Brady had a passer rating of 133.9. He credits his quick acclimation to his work with Guerrero.\u000a\u000aBrady and Guerrero have been together for a dozen years, since Brady visited him on the recommendation of then-teammate Willie McGinest. In addition to being a team consultant who watches almost every game from the sidelines, Guerrero is a trusted member of Brady's inner circle. He is so involved in Brady's life that he often uses the pronoun "we" when talking about him. He is the godfather of Brady's son Benjamin, as well as Brady's business partner.\u000a\u000aTheir joint venture is TB12 Sports Therapy Center at Patriot Place, the open-air shopping and entertainment plaza adjacent to Gillette Stadium. With a giant picture of Brady on its exterior, TB12 sits between a spa and a new age workout studio, across from an art gallery.\u000a\u000aBrady and about 20 of his teammates regularly take the short drive from the player lot at Gillette up to the private parking area for TB12 and ring the bell to the back door. Mostly they get body work\u2014a form of manual massage\u2014from Guerrero.\u000a\u000aIn the morning, before practice and after, Guerrero works Brady's right arm and the muscles and tissues around it.\u000a\u000a"I think that arm gets rubbed and milked more than the entire cow population in the state of California," Edelman says.\u000a\u000aYears ago, Guerrero got into trouble with the Federal Trade Commission for making claims about products that had not been properly tested, but Brady and many of his teammates swear by him. And Brady's performance is a powerful testimonial to Guerrero's methods.\u000a\u000a"Tom takes it to heart, and it's definitely working," Edelman says. "He's so pliable and focused on the details of his body."\u000a\u000aWith guidance from his guru, Brady tries to be better through self-awareness (he meditates), rest and repair (he sleeps in special "athlete recovery sleepwear") and nutrition (he won't eat dairy, caffeine, white sugar or white flour).\u000a\u000aFor most of the year, Brady is a vegan. In the cold winter months, he adds some lean meat to his diet. A typical day's menu this time of year might include a breakfast smoothie\u2014made with almond milk, a scoop of protein, seeds, nuts and a banana\u2014a midmorning homemade protein bar, sliced up chicken breast on a salad with whole grains and legumes for lunch, a second smoothie as a snack and a dinner of quinoa with greens.\u000a\u000aUnlike 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had trouble maintaining his weight when he went vegan, Brady has had no problem maintaining lean mass. Guerrero says for the past several years, Brady has weighed 228 at the start of the season and dropped two to three pounds by the end. His body fat holds steady at about 10 percent.\u000a\u000aBrady's workout regimen also is nontraditional for a football player. About 90 percent of his training is with resistance bands, and much of it is high-rep. In the offseason, he trains with Guerrero six days a week, sometimes twice a day. During the season, it's three times a day.\u000a\u000a"It's unbelievable to see the consistency, how level-minded he stays and how he manages to raise the bar every year," Edelman says. "I don't think I've ever seen anyone like him\u2014no one even close."\u000a\u000aVia B/R's Dan Pompei\u000a\u000aAt the beginning of each season, the Patriots run their players through a battery of strength, speed and agility testing similar to combine drills. The purpose is to measure how the players are declining. But the damndest thing is happening with Brady. In each of the past three years, he improved his test scores in every category, according to Guerrero.\u000a\u000a"It seems he's actually gotten stronger and faster as he's gotten older," Guerrero says.\u000a\u000aBrady laughs it off. "I don't really correlate those numbers to being a better QB, but coaches and scouts like those things."\u000a\u000aBrady does allow, though, that "in every way" he feels better at 39 than he did at 29.\u000a\u000a"Really in my recovery and how my body feels each week," he says. "I basically always want to feel 100 percent for every practice and game. I know that is not always possible, but that is my goal. For the most part, I achieve that unless I sustain a big injury in the game. Then I have to work hard to be able to be ready for the game on Sunday.\u000a\u000a"You can only work as hard as your ability to recover. I am confident in my process, and I feel there is not another 39-year old in the world that can recover faster than me. I have been blessed to learn the right methods, through my nutrition, hydration, pliability and proper rest. It's really not that hard if you do the right thing."\u000a\u000aLast offseason, Brady made an honest evaluation of his play, as he does every offseason. Self-honesty has always come easy for him.\u000a\u000aHe thought he could make better use of downfield passing opportunities. He thought he could make more plays with his feet.\u000a\u000a"Those are things that [could] really help our offense," Brady says. "They really help any offense.\u000a\u000a"Hopefully we can make some big plays in the postseason, either throwing it deep or by extending plays. It takes pressure off of everybody if we can make two big plays per game. I have tried to improve those areas by focusing on how to improve them [and] working on my mechanics with my deep ball and my training methods for mobility. If you are working on the right things, the right way, I have no doubt I can continue to improve."\u000a\u000aBrady ran a 5.28 40-yard dash at the combine 17 years ago. He never is going to be an Olympian in track and field. But he moved well enough this season to make first downs on 35.7 percent of his runs. That was the ninth-best percentage among starting quarterbacks, according to Sporting Charts.\u000a\u000aHe also has improved at moving in the pocket and extending plays. On a 3rd-and-16 against the Jets in December, Brady was flushed left by Muhammad Wilkerson. He circled backward, reset and found Edelman on a cross route for a 28-yard gain. It was the kind of play no one ever expected from Brady at 29, let alone 39.\u000a\u000aIt would not have been possible if Brady had not imagined himself a quarterback who could move more like Aaron Rodgers and less like Manning.\u000a\u000a"He works on lower body quickness every day, doing band pulls," Edelman says. "He has someone hold the band for him to do his knee drives. He's taken that to heart to try to improve. He sees all these young guys move around with their legs, and he wants to show them he can do it too."\u000a\u000aElsa/Getty Images\u000a\u000aBrady's throws are supposed to be losing zip, but he averaged 12.2 yards per completion\u2014his highest average in five years and the third highest of his career.\u000a\u000aWhat made Brady's deep passing even more impressive is it didn't come with an offset of more turnovers. Brady's interception percentage of 0.5 was third-best all-time, and the Patriots set a team record for fewest interceptions thrown with two.\u000a\u000aBrady's passer rating on throws of 21-plus air yards was 117, according to STATS. That was the best passer rating on such throws of his career.\u000a\u000aAs he has aged, Brady's sense of measuring risks and rewards has become keener. Maybe more than any quarterback, he understands the importance of not turning the ball over.\u000a\u000aUsually, when a quarterback has new receivers to throw to, he becomes more prone to interceptions. But 40 percent of Brady's completions were to Hogan, Martellus Bennett and Malcolm Mitchell\u2014new teammates in 2016.\u000a\u000aBrady clearly has mastered the art of connecting quickly with new receivers.\u000a\u000a"Tom takes the time to talk to guys," Hogan says. "He makes sure when they are on the field together, they will be on the same page. He's an MVP, one of the best to ever play, and he's still trying to help guys. I've been able to learn a lot from him about playing my position. A lot is being able to read coverages and, in certain instances, how to run a route versus this coverage\u2014not looking at it through my eyes but looking at it through his eyes. Tom makes you understand what he is seeing. He explains he's going to feel good about throwing the ball if, for instance, I go inside a guy as opposed to going outside a guy."\u000a\u000aMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\u000a\u000aThere is another benefit to self-improvement for Brady. It is a means to improve others. "I enjoy watching my teammates grow and improve themselves personally and professionally," he says. "My motivation may be different than others. I want to be the best I can be for my teammates and coaches every day, and I never want to let them down."\u000a\u000aIt is one thing to achieve a greatness beyond what has been achieved in the past. It is another to sustain that greatness, and then to not be satisfied with it, and to reshape it and to build on top of it.\u000a\u000aIt is another thing still to do this as the oldest non-kicker in the league, after winning four Super Bowl rings and three Super Bowl MVP awards, after walking off the field victoriously more times than any quarterback in history, after making more than $196 million in football salary alone and after making one of the most gorgeous women on earth your bride.\u000a\u000aThis isn't really about arm angles, quinoa and fancy pajamas. It's about a deep, abiding hunger that very few of us could relate to.\u000a\u000aWhen Brady stands in front of the mirror, he doesn't see the GOAT. He sees the quarterback who began his college career at Michigan with six players ahead of him on the depth chart and the one who was forced to platoon with Drew Henson as a senior. He sees the skinny kid who was passed over 198 times in the 2000 draft.\u000a\u000aBrady was not born with football's silver spoon in his grasp. He went on a mission to find it. He stole it from Drew Bledsoe. He waged a war over it with Manning, and he refused to let it be taken by Jason Taylor, Bernard Pollard or Rex Ryan.\u000a\u000aAll of this has served him very well as he has turned his NFL run into an ultramarathon.\u000a\u000a"We don't train with the idea he is already the starting quarterback," Guerrero says. "Every year, he's working to be the starting quarterback, and he's got to work hard to do that. He always talks about it. Every year there is going to be somebody there that is going to outwork me if I don't continue to work hard. So in his mind, he has to keep working hard in order to continue to perform at the level he has or to improve."\u000a\u000aJimmy Garoppolo, the team's second-round pick three years ago, is young and hungry and gifted. Many teams would be thrilled to have him as their starter. Certainly, Brady could perceive him as a threat.\u000a\u000aIn training camp after the team cleared the field, Brady sometimes challenged Garoppolo to play "the bucket game," in which the participants try to land more passes in a bucket from the same distance, usually 30 to 40 yards. And when Brady lost?\u000a\u000a"Sometimes he wouldn't talk to me for a while," Garoppolo says with a grin.\u000a\u000aJason Miller/Getty Images\u000a\u000aBrady wouldn't be mad at Garoppolo, and eventually he would make that clear. He would be mad at himself.\u000a\u000aThat seems long ago now. Brady hardly is fading as he prepares for his greatest challenges of the season. After missing the first four games of the year and sitting out three practices the past month, he may be as fresh and focused as ever in January.\u000a\u000aAnd now is the time of year when Brady always seems to rise above us like a hot air balloon.\u000a\u000aAs he and Guerrero reflect on the Patriots' season, Brady's impressive numbers and his age at TB12, they laugh. "This is something that is not a shock for us," Guerrero says. "It's what we've been planning to, come to fruition."\u000a\u000aThis postseason is an opportunity for Brady to do something no player has done. He can play in his seventh Super Bowl. And he can do something no quarterback has done\u2014win his fifth.\u000a\u000aThis postseason also is opportunity for him to do something else, something that may be as just as important to him.\u000a\u000aThis postseason is an opportunity for Tom Brady to improve.\u000a\u000aDan Pompei covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.

aVJohn McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Language changes with the times, and when it comes to our conceptions of gender, the times are most certainly changing.\u000a\u000aWe are opening up to the idea that binary conceptions of gender are unnecessarily rigid and don't correspond to the self-image of a great many people, and even that people's sense of their gender may not correspond to their biological sex. In this new world, a bland opposition between "he" and "she" seems increasingly antique, and even insulting, to many.\u000a\u000aHowever, doing something about that is going to be a challenge. We are dealing not with merely giving new names to new things or actions, which is easy, but with using new pronouns, which is very hard.\u000a\u000aThis is hard because human cognition makes some parts of language more resistant to change than others. Nouns, verbs and adjectives, for example, are like software. It feels natural to add them, subtract them, revise them.\u000a\u000aWe expect them to change from era to era -- of course we now have blogs and twerking when we didn't 20 years ago; of course young people now call "fierce" what their equivalents long ago called "keen," "neat," "wicked," "rad," and so on. They are what linguists call open class words.\u000a\u000aPronouns, however, are closed class words. As shorthand for any thing or concept, pronouns are used so often and so unconsciously that they are more like hardware. A new object or practice is one thing -- but a new "you" or a new "him" or "her"?\u000a\u000aIt's harder to wrap our minds around changing something so cognitively fundamental, just as one does not pop up with new prepositions: You might wish there were a little word to indicate "on as in upside down on a ceiling, rather than on a wall or floor." But if you made one up it wouldn't catch on -- nouns and verbs are lightbulbs; prepositions are the wiring inside the walls.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Getting real: Explicit language on TV in the seventies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Getting real: Explicit language on TV in the seventies 02:51\u000a\u000aSix-thousand years ago, in the ancestor of most of today's European languages on the Ukranian steppes, while most of the language would have seemed like Hittite to us (because it sort of was!), its speakers were using pronouns that sounded roughly like "me," "you," and "we" (not to mention the "tu" familiar from French and Spanish). That's how hardy pronouns are.\u000a\u000aThis is why previous attempts to fashion gender-neutral pronouns haven't caught on (believe it or not, there were once calls for the blend hesh!), and why as clever as today's "ze" is, its evolution from in-house tradition to society-wide acceptance will be slow at least, and possibly ill-fated. Bias alone will play its part, surely, but even without it, new pronouns require a mental effort analogous to conceiving dimensions beyond the third.\u000a\u000aIf anglophones are to accept new pronouns for new times, two things will be necessary. For example, the truth is that one thing that helps people change their pronoun usage is shame. For example, of all the "blackboard grammar" rules that English speakers are schooled in, such as that two negatives mean a positive or that one must say fewer books rather than less books, only one has truly caught on to the extent that it is part of the grammar actual people use comfortably. It is the rule stipulating that one must say "Billy and I went to the store" rather than "Billy and me," because me is "wrong" as a subject.\u000a\u000aThis is a rule no one imposed on English until a couple hundred years ago, and is unheard of in many other languages like French and Swedish. However, for better or for worse, it has been so successfully drilled into our heads as a mark of basic intelligence and propriety.\u000a\u000aNow, I would hope that pronouns like "ze" would not be imposed with the knuckle-rapping and contemptuous indignation with which the Billy and I rule has been promulgated. However, there is room for presenting "ze" as a matter not of fashion, but of basic civility -- people must think of new pronouns as the proper thing to do, not as a stunt.\u000a\u000aTo the extent that societies change their pronoun usage, it tends to involve recasting old pronouns, or even expressions, into new functions. European languages like French, for example, use the plural "vous" to address a single person with respect. Spanish's respectful "usted" began as "your mercy," "vuestra merced," not as a brand new little word imposed by fiat. In this light, our own "they" could be handy as a new way to address people gender-neutrally. Many have called for exactly this.\u000a\u000aAnd not just recently -- English speakers have been using "they" in the singular for eons. In starchy old "Vanity Fair," William Thackeray writes "A person can't help their birth." Today, we spontaneously use sentences such as "Tell each student they should hand in the paper on Tuesday." However, this is another of those things that we are told is a mark of ignorance because "they is plural." However, our new times may require that we get past that notion, which shouldn't be a problem because it has always been absurd.\u000a\u000aAfter all, in French, vous "is plural," yet no one seems to mind. Once upon a time, you "was plural" while thou was used in the singular. Today, you "is" singular as well and no one bats an eye. In the same way, in our "hardware," "they" is both singular and plural. Our new conceptions of gender are a good time to get past the conservatism about singular "they."\u000a\u000aThe naysayers complain about the prospect of sentences like "They is upstairs," but this is a distraction: gender-neutral they should be used, as it has been forever, with plural verb forms: "They are upstairs" will mean that one person is upstairs as well as two or more. "But won't that be confusing?" one may ask -- upon which the answer is another question: When have you been confused as to whether "You are my favorite" referred to yourself or yourself and some other people? Context pulls a great deal of weight in how we communicate.\u000a\u000aAssessing the prospects of new pronouns like ze and recast pronouns like they, my bet would be on they, in terms of the chances that, in 50 years, everybody is on board and on to the next controversy. What we do know, however, is that we are at a point where anglophones will need to accept some kind of change in how we use the language. Call it a teaching moment --language not only never stops changing, but could not.

aV(CNN) Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has made her first public comments on the fate of her country's persecuted Rohingya minority since new violence broke out almost two weeks ago.\u000a\u000aSuu Kyi, who as Myanmar's state counsellor is the country's de facto leader, claimed during a phone conversation with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan a "huge iceberg of misinformation" about the Rohingya crisis was being distributed to benefit "terrorists."\u000a\u000aAccording to a readout of the call, she added her government was fighting to ensure "terrorism" didn't spread over the whole of Rakhine state.\u000a\u000aSuu Kyi has come under fire in recent days for failing to speak out against the mass killings and displacement of Rohingya by her government, particularly given her previous image as a champion of human rights.\u000a\u000aDuring the call, Suu Kyi said her government was already working to protect the rights of the Rohingya.\u000a\u000a"We know very well, more than most, what it means to be deprived of human rights and democratic protection," Suu Kyi said, according to a readout of the call.\u000a\u000a"So we make sure that all the people in our country are entitled to protection of their rights as well as, the right to, and not just political but social and humanitarian defense."\u000a\u000aAt least 123,000 Rohingya refugees have poured across the Bangladeshi border in just two weeks after Myanmar's military crackdown.

aVWow, so it looks like we have a budget deal in Washington. A debt ceiling and spending crisis has been averted. It\u2019s good news. But let\u2019s all calm down. It\u2019s only temporary. The agreement does not address the long-term fiscal problems we have. Problems that were mostly created by none other than the \u201cbaby boomer\u201d generation. Yeah, you know who you are.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re tanned and healthy and living way past average life expectancy. You\u2019ve got a defined benefit pension plan from a large company or government that was created years ago when people didn\u2019t understand how horribly these plans can go wrong and now can\u2019t afford to meet its liabilities, but you don\u2019t care as long as you get your check which you don\u2019t really need anyway. And your social security check. And your Medicare reimbursement check. You once hated the government. You smoked pot and protested against Vietnam and President Nixon. That was a long, long time ago.\u000a\u000aLife has been good for you. You\u2019re a baby boomer. You were born between 1946 and the early 1960\u2019s. You had Woodstock and the Stones in the \u201960s, discos and coke in the \u201970s, Wall Street in the \u201980s, Bill Clinton in the \u201990s and now you\u2019re retiring to Arizona and Florida on the backs of your stressed-out kids whose own children stay at home with them into their 20s because they have no jobs. Tom Brokaw once wrote a book about the greatest generation, those brave people who survived the depression and fought in World War II. Unfortunately that great generation spawned a generation of narcissists: the baby boomers.\u000a\u000aThe boomers have created liabilities that will take generations to pay off. Our national debt is now at around $17 trillion, larger for the first time in recent history than the size of our entire economy. And it\u2019s projected to continue to significantly grow over the next few decades unless something dramatic is done to reduce it. Boomers don\u2019t like to talk about fiscal responsibility or living within their means. They like their credit cards and government secured mortgages on overvalued properties. They enjoy their malls and their cars and their houses and as long as someone\u2019s willing to lend them the money to buy this stuff they don\u2019t seem to care much about how it will be one day paid. They still represent an enormous voting block and have no intention to have this lifestyle threatened. This is the real reason Washington can\u2019t create a long-term deficit reduction plan. The boomers love their safety nets.\u000a\u000aThese safety nets were created over the past few decades by boomers and for boomers, with little regard to the future. One of the major reasons our national debt is so high is because 40 percent of our government\u2019s spending goes to some type of insurance: social insurance, retirement, health benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. These systems are bankrupt. But they\u2019re needed to pay for the boomers\u2019 healthcare and pension plans. People that were born after 1965 are working hard to make sure that the boomer generation gets their retirement and disability paid for by the government. But it\u2019s still not enough. So our government has to borrow and print money. And our debts balloon. Who will pay these debts? Ah, who cares says the boomers. Not my problem.\u000a\u000aThey are the source of one of the biggest problems with Obamacare. Whether you support the Affordable Care Act or not (and I think there are lots of great things about it), one undeniable fact is that the cost of this new system is being put squarely on the shoulders of the young. People in their 20s need less health care than the boomers in their 60s and 70s. This is not only because younger people today have healthier lifestyles but because many boomers spent most of their young lives smoking, drinking sugary sodas and engaging in risky, unprotected sex. There are 34 million mostly young and uninsured people who will be required on January 1, 2014, to pay for health insurance just so the boomers can take advantage of the added benefits that health insurance companies have to now legally provide.\u000a\u000aThey are, thank God, the last reminders of our racist, homophobic, sexist past. When you look at those \u201cwhite only\u201d diners and drinking fountains in those photos from the 1960s you just can\u2019t believe it. Or how women were treated. And gays. But many of our beloved boomers were teenagers back then, living with parents who watched Ozzie and Harriet and were raised to believe that people who weren\u2019t white weren\u2019t to be trusted, women were meant to stay at home, and gays were sinners. Over time, these attitudes have changed, mainly because people in their 20s and 30s are smarter, better educated and more open-minded. Unfortunately, and although we now have a black President, the last remnants of the boomer generation who still wield power in their churches and companies are doing their best to keep women out of the corporate suite, protest against gay marriage and fight immigration reform.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re scrambling to fix the environment because of their excesses. For years, and despite warnings, the boomers refused to recycle and ran companies that spewed ozone-destroying chemicals into the air. There are countless plots of land that are unusable because of chemicals and pesticides dumped by this generation. I\u2019m no environmentalist, but even I have to shake my head at the destruction laid upon the planet over the past 40 years alone: decimated forests, extinct species, smog filled skies, islands of plastic floating in the ocean. Only recently are steps being taken by younger generations to attempt to reverse this trend.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that the baby boomer generation is quickly getting older. Ten thousand boomers are retiring each day. We can\u2019t ship them all off to an island, unfortunately. But I\u2019m optimistic that the next generation of leaders will not make the same mistakes. Governments will take care of people who are truly needy \u2014 not just because they turned 65 and have a car payment \u2014 and this will help fix our deficit problems. Racism will continue to decline as the world becomes smaller and more social. Our environment will improve because kids in elementary school are being taught to care about the planet. Ultimately, these generations will fix the problems that the boomers created. And we can soon bid farewell to that horrible generation.\u000a\u000aFollow @GeneMarks on Twitter.

aVPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged Pharrell Williams' boyish good looks -- as seen in February 2017 here at the 89th Annual Academy Awards Nominee Luncheon in Beverly Hills, California - had the Internet convinced in 2014 that he's secretly a vampire. He's not, obviously, but we understand why many can't believe that this 44-year-old superstar looks so young. Take a look back at Pharrell through the years and see if you can spot any aging: Hide Caption 1 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2002 \u2013 Here's Pharrell on the right with his band N.E.R.D. in August 2002. The producer/singer/songwriter's hats have gotten bigger, but his face has stayed the same. Hide Caption 2 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2003 \u2013 We know it's hard to tell, but Pharrell Williams, left, and rapper Bow Wow, center, actually aren't the same age. When this photo was taken in August 2003, Williams was 30 and Bow Wow was 16. (That's Williams' musical partner in crime, Chad Hugo of their production group The Neptunes, on the right.) Hide Caption 3 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2004 \u2013 By 2004, Pharrell had been outed as the music industry's go-to guy for a chart-topping hit. But even with the increased visibility and work, do you see a stress wrinkle on this guy's face? Because we don't. Hide Caption 4 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2005 \u2013 Maybe part of what makes Pharrell look forever young is his youthful approach to fashion, although we can't recommend you try this look at home. Hide Caption 5 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2006 \u2013 We'd have a glow, too, if we hung out with Mariah Carey, as Pharrell did in Paris in March 2006. The pair were shooting scenes for a music video to go with their single, "Say Somethin.'" Hide Caption 6 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2007 \u2013 With a nickname like Skateboard P, we know that Pharrell isn't averse to letting some physical activity put the blush in his cheeks. Hide Caption 7 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2008 \u2013 Seen here with T.I. in 2008, we bet you can't guess how old either of these music stars are. (Give up? T.I. was 28 while Pharrell was 35.) Hide Caption 8 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2009 \u2013 If we didn't know better, we'd think Pharrell was stuck in some sort of "Benjamin Button"-like aging process, wherein he was born looking 22 and then never ages at all. Hide Caption 9 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2010 \u2013 In 2010, Pharrell tried to trick us into thinking he was aging with a mustache and a fake gold tooth, but we can see under the mask, P. Hide Caption 10 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2011 \u2013 Pharrell insists that the secret to his dermatological success is simply washing his face, but we wonder if having an impressive hat repertoire has something to do with it. Hide Caption 11 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2012 \u2013 From what we know of maintaining good health (and skin), you have to find time to relax, which Pharrell appears to do here at a press conference in Hong Kong in April 2012. Hide Caption 12 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2012 \u2013 We'll bet you five bucks Jay Z was asking Pharrell about his skincare when they met up at the Barclays Center in September 2012. Hide Caption 13 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged 2013 \u2013 Pharrell celebrated his 40th birthday in April 2013, but we wouldn't believe it if he didn't say so himself. Hide Caption 14 of 16\u000a\u000aPhotos: Pharrell Williams has barely aged Pharrell hasn't aged in 12 years \u2013 He's been hailed for his impeccable style. He showed some of that off at the 2014 Elle Style Awards. Hide Caption 15 of 16

Mazie Hirono emotionally addressed the Senate regarding health care Thursday night\u000a\u000aWashington (CNN) Sen. John McCain was the focus of much media attention this week when he dramatically returned to Washington following recent brain surgery and cast the decisive vote scuttling GOP efforts to pass a health care plan early Friday morning.\u000a\u000aBut he wasn't the only senator battling late-stage cancer whose vote effectively saved Obamacare. On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, also voted against the "skinny repeal" bill.\u000a\u000aHirono announced she was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer in May. Her doctor noticed an abnormality on an X-ray and discovered that it was kidney cancer, which had already spread to her seventh rib. She had a kidney removed days after the diagnosis and later underwent surgery to remove a lesion on her rib in late June.\u000a\u000aAddressing the Senate late Thursday night, Hirono spoke out against the GOP's health care plan, emotionally discussing her upbringing in rural Japan, where she lost a 2-year-old sister to pneumonia and worried about her mother getting sick without access to medical care. She then talked about her own health.\u000a\u000a"When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer," Hirono said, "I heard from so many of my colleagues, including so many of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, who wrote me such wonderful notes."

aV(CNN) At a time when the United States is grappling with an epidemic of opioid-related overdose deaths , one state is turning to a very high-potency opioid for criminal executions.\u000a\u000aOpioids are a class of drugs that include some prescription painkillers as well as illicit drugs such as heroin and street fentanyl . The majority of drug overdose deaths nationwide involve an opioid, and about 91 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u000a\u000aNow, the Nevada Department of Corrections is preparing to use fentanyl in a three-part drug combination for an upcoming execution, it said in a statement August 17\u000a\u000aBuprenorphine is a opioid used as an alternative to methadone to help addicts recovering from heroin use. Buprenorphine is different from other opioids because it's a "partial opioid agonist," which means that when taken in proper prescribed doses, it should produce less euphoria and physical dependence, and therefore a lower potential for misuse. It's also supposed to have a relatively mild withdrawal profile. However, if abused by crushing and snorting or injecting, it can suppress breathing and cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death. Subutex, the brand name for buprenorphine, is taken as a tablet placed under the tongue and allowed to dissolve. The brand Suboxone is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Antagonists block the opiate receptors in the brain, keeping the narcotic from creating the high abusers crave.\u000a\u000aBuprenorphine \u2013 Buprenorphine is a opioid used as an alternative to methadone to help addicts recovering from heroin use.

It's most commonly known by the brand names Dilaudid, pictured here, and Exalgo.Liquid hydromorphone holds the dubious honor of being frequently mistaken for morphine in hospital "wrong drug" medication errors because of the similarity of the names and appearances.\u000a\u000aMeperidine is another narcotic analgesic, similar to morphine. It's often used to help put people to sleep before an operation and to provide pain relief after childbirth. The most common brand name is Demerol, which comes in both tablet and liquid forms. It is usually taken with or without food every three or four hours as needed for pain. As with all opioids, meperidine can cause drowsiness, so never drive a car or operate machinery after taking it until you know how you will react.\u000a\u000aMeperidine \u2013 Meperidine is another narcotic analgesic, similar to morphine.

This sounds like an article from the Onion," a news satire site, Bloom said.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, Nevada's decision didn't seem to shock Dr. Edward W. Boyer, a medical toxicologist who also teaches at Harvard Medical School.\u000a\u000a"Fentanyl itself is lethal. If you haven't heard about fentanyl-laced heroin and its impact on death rates in opioid users over the past several months, you might have been living under a rock," Boyer said.\u000a\u000a"Fentanyl is a drug that you can inject intramuscularly, dermally and a wide number of routes," he said. "The main problem with them from a clinical perspective is that they wipe out your ability to breathe. You simply stop breathing. It causes profound respiratory depression."\u000a\u000a'This specific chemical cocktail ... has never been used in this way before'\u000a\u000aThis fentanyl drug combination is to be used in the execution of 46-year-old Scott Raymond Dozier on November 14 at Ely State Prison in Ely, Nevada, according to the Department of Corrections' statement.\u000a\u000a"Dozier was sentenced to death after a first-degree murder conviction for the 2002 killing and dismemberment of Jeremiah Miller, 22," the statement said. "Miller's dismembered torso was found in a suitcase that had been dumped in a trash bin.\u000a\u000a"During the course of their investigation, police uncovered another victim of Dozier who was dismembered and buried in the Arizona desert.

"The use of the drugs that they have proposed are paralytics and an overdose of an opioid. So you're essentially trying to kill this person by paralyzing them to death, which sounds horrific, and it's certainly not in our perspective compliant with the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which is no cruel or unusual punishment."\u000a\u000aLast week, the ACLU of Nevada announced that it filed a public records request with the Department of Corrections in order to obtain additional details about Dozier's upcoming execution.\u000a\u000aThe Marshall Project cited experts who said they saw no obvious reason why Nevada selected this drug combination.\u000a\u000aThe fentanyl and diazepam "may be trying to block the experience of suffocation," Joel B. Zivot, an Emory University anesthesiologist who has served as an expert witness in legal challenges to execution protocols, told The Marshall Project.\u000a\u000a"The fentanyl takes away pain, and the Valium takes away anxiety. Both drugs are limited in their ability to do that, and of course neither is designed to block the pain or anxiety of death.

"This would legitimately be a humane lethal injection. Absolutely, no question, it would work, assuming they give enough fentanyl -- and it doesn't take much."

He's also the co-host of the " Politics & Polls " podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) There are some journalists and politicians who hope that the one bright spot from the disaster of Hurricane Harvey will be a shift to better politics this coming fall.\u000a\u000aWriting for the New York Times, Carl Hulse makes a strong case that the hurricane "utterly transformed the federal fiscal picture" since Congress must now focus on providing federal relief to the communities affected by the storm. Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, the head of the Freedom Caucus, has said that at least for the time being his group of legislators would not insist on the money President Donald Trump wants to build a border wall.\u000a\u000aIn the Washington Post, Sen. John McCain urged Congress to restore order by passing a budget that "realistically meets the nation's critical needs." Some congressional Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, are urging the President to resist the controversial proposal to dismantle the DACA program that allows undocumented young adults, who came here as children, to stay in the country, be educated and have work authorization.\u000a\u000aBut the odds are extremely poor that the horrific storm will fundamentally alter the explosive political dynamics in Washington.\u000a\u000aLet's remember that even the horrendous terrorist attacks against the United States on 9/11 only dampened political tensions for a few weeks before Washington resumed its fighting ways. Democrats and Republicans were battling over how to strengthen airport security, with Republicans attempting to use a privatized work force and Democrats insisting on public employees with civil service protections.\u000a\u000aThe 2002 midterm campaigns and then the 2004 presidential campaign witnessed vicious attacks from some Republicans against Democrats for being "weak" against terrorism.\u000a\u000aThis fall, the situation won't be any different. While we might avoid a total government meltdown, that standard sets the bar very low.\u000a\u000aAs for the rest, the outlook is not bright. The most important reason that we should not expect things to change is because of President Trump. We are not going to see any dramatic shift in his presidential style as a result of this disaster. The erratic behavior that he has exhibited since January, even in difficult moments such as the standoff with North Korea, and the basic political positions that he holds dearly, including his hardline anti-immigration stance, won't go away.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED WH responds to report on Comey Replay More Videos ...

He conducted a campaign style-event in Texas, focused as much on the crowd's size as on federal relief, and on Friday he was back to tweeting about how James Comey handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post published a story about how the President is bristling about the disloyalty of advisers who have been critical of him and how he has become frustrated with Chief of Staff John Kelly's efforts to contain him.\u000a\u000aAs the nation learned this morning of the North Koreans having conducted a test of what they claimed was a hydrogen bomb , the president quickly returned to the provocative tweets. " South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!"\u000a\u000aNot only will the immediate crisis of the hurricane subside, but the challenges with the relief effort will become more difficult during the cleanup in the coming months. There could also be more storms on the way. Hurricane Irma may be the next disaster to hit the US.\u000a\u000aTrump will continue to insert himself in an aggressive manner, threatening wavering senators and blasting his opponents.\u000a\u000aHis upcoming push for a steep, regressive corporate tax cut and his instructions to have federal agencies not enforce the Affordable Care Act will trigger immense controversy and fuel partisan divisions. Tension with North Korea, Iran, ISIS and Russia will continue to flare -- enticing Trump to make more provocative remarks and decisions. The Russia scandal, the issue that angers him more than almost anything else, is still very much alive. Robert Mueller's investigation is intensifying as he is working with the New York State attorney general as well as the IRS . The New York Times has reported that Mueller is in possession of a memo from Trump in which he outlined, to the consternation of his counsel, exactly why he wanted to fire James Comey.

The caucus might budge on this instance of big government spending but once that relief package is off the table, all the points of contention remain.\u000a\u000aAnd as we enter the fall, the November 2018 elections are coming into clearer focus. All across the nation, candidates are starting to go out on the campaign trail. Democrats understand that this is probably their best opportunity to retake control of Congress or severely cut into the size of the Republican's majority. With the President's approval ratings being so low, Democrats don't have much of a reason to work with the GOP.

Hide Caption 24 of 24\u000a\u000aThe boys' father, Christian McDonald, pulled the wagon as their mother, Nicole, walked with them. Both parents paused to hug almost everyone.\u000a\u000aThe moment stood in stark contrast to the boys' arrival on February 18. On that day, the twins were on a private flight to New York from Illinois. While in the air, Anias stopped breathing and turned blue. Nicole, a pediatric physical therapist, did everything she knew to try to rouse him and worried Jadon would soon be next.\u000a\u000a"It was a 10-minute period when all of this was happening where (Anias) was in and out of consciousness," Nicole said.\u000a\u000aThey were rushed to the emergency room immediately upon landing. It turned out Anias was suffering from a severe strain of the flu.\u000a\u000aAnd now, here the family was, leaving the same hospital amid such jubilation. They were headed to Blythedale Children's Hospital, a specialty facility in suburban New York where they will undergo months of rehabilitation, including physical, occupational and speech therapy.\u000a\u000a"It's the most exciting step for me, because I want to see what they can do," Nicole told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta moments before she left the twins' hospital room for the last time. "We've all come to agreement that it's not goodbye. It's just a see-you-later."\u000a\u000aAdded Christian, "I'm excited. No ifs, ands or buts about it. I'm just so glad. From this point on, we can actually be all together as a family."\u000a\u000aIt marked two months to the day since the 27-hour surgery to separate the boys ended on October 14 -- what their dad described as a moment of "hope and a chance for a normal life." It also marked one of the fastest such recoveries on record\u000a\u000aGoodrich, who earlier in the day performed craniofacial reconstruction surgery on a 9-month-old boy, acknowledged that he'd miss the twins.\u000a\u000a"Am I happy to see them go? No," he said. "But it's time to move on. It's time for the next stage."\u000a\u000a'They're so cute'\u000a\u000aThe day before, Jadon and Anias took a similar wagon ride. It was the first time they'd ever left their room for something non-medical. This time, the staff wanted to throw them a farewell party.\u000a\u000aAza McDonald, 3, crawls into the wagon next to his twin brothers before the party.\u000a\u000aThe wagon carries meaning for the parents. After they were born, the only way the conjoined twins could be moved was for their parents to pull them in a red wagon. As the months passed, the two could no longer fit in it. They had grown too long.\u000a\u000aAs they rode Tuesday, they looked up at their mother and held hands. Jadon's head was fully revealed, with none of the bandages that once covered his scalp. Anias, whose skull cap was removed following persistent post-surgical infections, wore a turquoise knit cap.\u000a\u000aAfter a quick elevator ride to the second floor, the boys made their way through a maze of hallways and into the hospital's Grand Hall banquet room.\u000a\u000aAwaiting them were more than two dozen staff members, from the nurses and doctors on the surgical team to those in the PICU who've gotten to know the boys best. There were tears and hugs, smiles and moments of glee.\u000a\u000aAnd photos. Lots of photos.\u000a\u000aGoodrich, the world's leading expert on craniopagus surgery and the boys' main surgeon, whipped out his iPhone and snapped commemorative shots.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Separated twins 'ahead of schedule' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Separated twins 'ahead of schedule' 03:50\u000a\u000a"It's a pretty emotional day, I've got to say," said Goodrich, who delivered homemade cookies and other treats to the twins' room before the party.\u000a\u000aAnother guest was Martin O'Malley, a longtime Bronx resident who lives across the street from the McDonalds. He's helped raise donations for the family, delivered them food and felt compelled to join the party.\u000a\u000a"It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing," said O'Malley, 83, whose twin sister died at birth. "It's hard to imagine just two months ago they were attached. I'm so happy for this family."\u000a\u000aDr. Carrie Stern, a plastic surgeon resident who took part in the surgery, glanced at the boys in the wagon and whispered, "They're so cute. It's just so amazing seeing them from beginning to end."\u000a\u000a'So many unknowns'\u000a\u000aA week before the party, Nicole and Christian tended to the boys in their room. They couldn't help but wonder about the future for Jadon and Anias.\u000a\u000aThey know about Carl and Clarence Aguirre, craniopagus twins from the Philippines whom Goodrich separated 12 years ago. With twins joined at the head, one is more dominant, his body working overtime to keep the other twin alive.\u000a\u000aCarl was the non-dominant child. He suffered a neurological decline a little over a year after surgery, resulting in permanent disabilities. He speaks only a few words and is confined to a wheelchair.\u000a\u000aWhen the McDonald twins were joined, Jadon was dominant. Since the surgery, Anias has suffered multiple seizures, in addition to having his skull cap removed. He will undergo another surgery when he is 7 to insert bone. For now, his skin is the only thing covering the top of his head, and he will have to wear a protective helmet.\u000a\u000a"There are just so many unknowns," Christian said. "We just don't know how it's all going to turn out."\u000a\u000aAdded Nicole, "Because we know other cases have had that regression, you just hope and pray that that doesn't happen in this circumstance."\u000a\u000aThe couple gave up their jobs in Illinois and moved to the Bronx to be close to the hospital. When the new year arrives, they'll face a $15,000 insurance deductible, plus whatever unexpected costs might arise. Their apartment lease is up in February, and they don't know whether to renew for another year, because it's unclear how long the boys will be in rehab.\u000a\u000aNicole and Christian McDonald with 3-year-old son Aza and the twins before surgery.\u000a\u000aThe couple started a GoFundMe page after the twins were born, but after donations swelled to nearly $300,000, the McDonalds told well-wishers to instead help a friend's child in need of a kidney transplant. With the long-term financial reality of their situation sinking in, they are once again receptive to people giving.\u000a\u000a"I feel like we've got a long ways to go," Christian said.\u000a\u000aHe noted that Anias will be cognizant by age 7, aware of the surgery he will have to face to repair his skull cap: "My heart already goes out to him."\u000a\u000aChristian and Nicole faced a decision no parent should have to make. Craniopagus twins occur in one out of every 2.5 million births. About 40% are stillborn, and another third die within 24 hours. Of those who survive, 80% die of medical complications by age 2 if not separated.\u000a\u000aMom and Dad said they have no regrets about choosing surgery.\u000a\u000a"When you walk into the room and Jadon throws his arms up and wants you to pick him up and you can! He looks at me," Nicole said. "He wiggles from side to side. He giggles. And I can just swoop him up and just hold him and feel his warmth."\u000a\u000aOf Anias, she said, "He has really come full circle and begun doing all the things he used to do. And that's been so encouraging, because I always had that worry about Anias."\u000a\u000aAs she spoke, the boys held hands on a bed where Mom spread them out. At one point, Jadon pulled Anias' hand to his face and then nibbled on his brother's finger. Mom quickly intervened to save Anias from being bitten.\u000a\u000aA sense of parental normalcy, when nothing is normal.\u000a\u000aAfter nine months, 'rebirth'\u000a\u000aAt the goodbye party, doctors, nurses and staff sat around tables, a buffet of chicken, salmon, green beans, mashed potatoes and salad behind them ready for the feast.\u000a\u000aAza bounced around the room, excited for the twins.\u000a\u000aAll eyes were on Dr. Steven M. Safyer, president and CEO of Montefiore Medicine, as he told Nicole and Christian how the 35,000 Montefiore employees have been rooting for their boys and consider them family.\u000a\u000a"I believe that for life, you're members of our world, and this is a wonderful world," Safyer said.\u000a\u000aHe noted that it's been nine months since he first met the family and that "in a way, this is a nine-month deal. This is the rebirth of these two guys."\u000a\u000aTepper, the lead plastic surgeon, told the crowd he was humbled by the fact that the "McDonalds chose us. They put their trust in us to take care of their boys."\u000a\u000a"Hands down, unquestionably, the two leaders of this team are Jadon and Anias," Tepper added. "It's their resilience, it's their determination that steered this voyage. There's a reason the world calls them 'The Little Warriors.' "\u000a\u000aGoodrich told the crowd he remembered speaking by phone with Nicole the first time, back when the boys were in utero and she was wondering what could be done to separate them. She told Goodrich she had just one question. Forty-five minutes later, they were still talking: "Totally in tune and all the right questions."\u000a\u000aThe neurosurgeon thanked everyone in the room, from hospital brass to his team in the operating room to Christian and Nicole. Then he held up a hand-written note he received from Ireland, "to show you how far this story went."\u000a\u000aIt was addressed simply:\u000a\u000aDr. James Goodrich, surgeon\u000a\u000aChildren's Hospital Montefiore Medical Center\u000a\u000aAmerica\u000a\u000aNo ZIP code. No city or street address. "Somebody in the postal system got this to me," Goodrich said.\u000a\u000aWhen it came time for the parents to speak, the room grew quiet. Many clutched tissues and dabbed their eyes.\u000a\u000aChristian told the group that as grateful as he and Nicole are, they will "never be half as grateful" as their sons.\u000a\u000a"Sixteen years down the road," he said, "they're going to be driving their car. They're going to be maybe out on a date. ... Just the fact that they'll be able to go to the bathroom and take a shower by themselves. They're not going to take those things for granted."\u000a\u000aIt's ordinary for people working their jobs, he said, to not fully grasp the significance of their work.\u000a\u000a"Maybe on one of those hard days," he told them, "when it may feel like another day at the office, please know ... you're going to change people's lives, not only individuals' lives for the better, but you're going to impact whole families' lives for the rest of their life. It's a huge thing."\u000a\u000aBefore the crowd broke into loud applause, Christian ended with a message from his boys: "If I may, I just want to be their voice and say, 'Thank you for giving us, Jadon and Anias, a hope and a chance for a normal life.' "\u000a\u000aThen it was Nicole's turn. She wept as she began. She said she had written three pages of material and then tossed it in the trash. "I decided to throw it away and to get up here and to look at you all in the face and tell you just how I feel."\u000a\u000aWhen she was pregnant, she told the crowd, she knew that her boys would be separated and that "this would be the outcome."\u000a\u000a"I knew that I would have a miracle. I didn't know how." She repeated, "I didn't know how."\u000a\u000a"I prayed every day for God to make the how happen, and you are all the how," she said through tears.\u000a\u000aShe said that she considered everyone in the room part of her family and that saying goodbye was extraordinarily difficult. "That is a huge testament to you that we don't want to leave here. That's an odd thing that somebody doesn't want to leave the hospital. Everyone is usually itching to get out. We want to stay. I want the boys to talk here first. I want you to see all that, because it was you that contributed to our miracle."\u000a\u000aShe compared her boys' transition to a caterpillar's metamorphosis into a butterfly.\u000a\u000a"Every one of you have been the fiber of that cocoon. You have been what has brought us to this moment: And now they will fly."\u000a\u000aThere wasn't a dry eye in the room. Nicole handed out gifts, from framed hand-drawn butterfly paintings to photo collages of the boys' progress over the months. Dad tended to Aza while Nicole's mom picked Jadon up and glided around the room with him in her arms.\u000a\u000aMany of the workers were on the clock. They scarfed down food quickly because, after all, there are more kids who need their care.\u000a\u000aThe featured dessert was a cake with white frosting decorated in black with the symbol for infinity, which is also used to represent conjoined twins and, now, the family's infinite love for the hospital team.\u000a\u000a"Anias and Jadon," read the black lettering. "God has answered + God has heard."\u000a\u000aPlastic surgeon Stern stepped up. Two months ago in the operating room, she was the surgeon who made the final cut that separated the twins.\u000a\u000aNow, she made the first cut of the cake that marked the next step of their journey.\u000a\u000aDr. Oren Tepper holds a thank you gift the McDonald family presented to him during the party.\u000a\u000aA new space\u000a\u000aThe boys' wagon ride on Wednesday took them to the lobby of Montefiore, where paramedics and EMTs transferred them to stretchers. Aza jumped onto the stretcher carrying Jadon. More staffers crowded the lobby to send them off.\u000a\u000aTwo ambulances awaited outside, one for each twin. Aza cried uncontrollably when he had to get off the stretcher as Jadon was being placed in his ambulance.\u000a\u000aIt was 2:58 p.m. when the twins left. The sun was shining bright over the Bronx on a beautiful 43-degree day.\u000a\u000aThe ambulances drove together at a steady 20- to 30-mph pace along New York parkways to Valhalla, arriving at Blythedale Children's Hospital at 3:45 p.m.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"It's almost surreal. I can't believe this is finally happening," Christian said as the boys were wheeled into the new facility. "It's such a big step in the right direction."\u000a\u000aUnlike their sendoff at Montefiore, their arrival at Blythedale was tranquil and peaceful.\u000a\u000aBy 3:49 p.m., the boys were in their new room, spacious and brightly colored, with two beds -- one for each boy -- and two sofas that can fold out into beds for Mom and Dad. It is this facility where the boys will learn how to eat, play and walk.\u000a\u000aNicole held Anias in her arms and marveled at Jadon as he settled into his new bed.\u000a\u000a"This is beautiful. I know that the boys will flourish here. It's an exciting step, and we're ready to take off."

aVWhen it comes to taxes, Rand Paul wants them simple and flat.\u000a\u000aThe blunt-spoken, Libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky, who won the 2016 presidential straw poll among leading conservatives, favors a flat tax: a one-rate income tax system with a minimum of tax breaks for individuals and businesses.\u000a\u000aBut Paul hasn't settled on what that rate should be.\u000a\u000aHe has publicly discussed 17%. An aide said if Paul does make a formal proposal, the rate would not be higher than 17% and could be lower.\u000a\u000aMuch would depend on which tax breaks Paul chooses to keep. Two would definitely remain: the standard deduction and personal exemptions. But both would be considerably larger than they are under today's code.\u000a\u000aThe Paul aide said the senator might also consider preserving in some form the tax breaks for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.\u000a\u000aPaul hasn't ruled out other types of tax reform if they "eliminate" complexity and regulation. But he has sketched out his views on a flat tax over the past few years.\u000a\u000a"What you'd have is an attrition if not an outright elimination of the IRS because it would be so simple that people would comply, and it would be very simple to know whether they complied or not," Paul told Fox News last year.\u000a\u000aUnder a Paul flat tax, an individual would owe taxes on his wages, salaries and pension payments. But fringe benefits at work would remain tax free to workers, as they are today. One example of that is the contribution employers make to pay for workers' health insurance.\u000a\u000aCapital gains, dividends and interest would also be tax free at the individual level, but would be taxed at the business level. Capital gains on owner-occupied housing would also be tax free.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Paul would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.\u000a\u000aRelated: Paul takes step toward White House run\u000a\u000aCould a flat tax no higher than 17% raise as much revenue as the current system? No. To do that you'd need to have a rate at least in the low- to mid-20% range, said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate of the Tax Policy Center.\u000a\u000aBut raising the same amount of revenue isn't Paul's goal.\u000a\u000aOn the contrary, Paul favors tax reform that would raise less revenue than today's tax code is projected to. At the same time, he wants to eliminate deficits within five years and proposes to do so in large part by reducing spending (as a percent of the size of the economy) every year over a decade.\u000a\u000aPaul asserts that his flat tax would be progressive since the net percentage of one's wages paid in taxes would rise along with income.\u000a\u000aHere's a simplified example of what that means: Say a married couple with two kids makes $100,000 in wages and is allowed to exempt $35,000 for their standard deduction and $6,500 for each dependent. Their total exemption would be $48,000.\u000a\u000aSo they would pay 17% on the remaining $52,000 of their income, or $8,840 in federal income taxes. That represents 8.84% of their gross income, which is their net effective tax rate.\u000a\u000aIf the same couple made $200,000 in wages, they would owe $25,840 in taxes for an effective tax rate of 12.92%.\u000a\u000aBut the overall effective rate could be lower still for high-income households because they are more likely to have investment income, which would be tax free under Paul's guidelines.\u000a\u000aRelated: Republican tax reform plan unveiled\u000a\u000aAnd, Rosenberg noted, the 15.3% payroll tax -- which is money that workers and their employers pay into Social Security and Medicare -- would still be the biggest tax bite for low-income households.\u000a\u000aA pure flat tax system wouldn't alter the payroll tax, although it's not clear whether Paul would like to.\u000a\u000aIdeally, he would prefer a flat tax in which no one pays more than they currently do. But he has implied, and his aide confirmed, that if the effective rates of the very wealthy go up to ensure that the income tax burdens on lower and middle-income families don't increase, he would be okay with that.\u000a\u000aUnless he puts out a detailed flat-tax proposal, however, it's impossible to say definitively who would be helped or hurt by the changes.\u000a\u000aOf course, if Paul decides to run for president in 2016, he would hardly be the first Republican candidate to call for a flat tax.\u000a\u000aSteve Forbes ran on a 17% flat tax in 2000. Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich ran on an optional flat tax in 2012. Their rival Herman Cain proposed a flat-ish tax called 9-9-9. And there have been plenty of flat-tax proposals introduced in Congress over the years.\u000a\u000aIt's not at all clear when Congress will take up the issue of tax reform seriously, or if a flat tax of some kind would ever garner sufficient support. Many believe not much will happen to overhaul the tax code until the next president takes office in 2017.\u000a\u000aBut should Paul make a run for the White House, you can expect to hear more about the flat tax over the next couple of years.

aV(CNN) He's a former alcoholic, an ex-soccer player and he doesn't have a university degree.\u000a\u000aMartin Schulz is not your average candidate for Chancellor.\u000a\u000aBut on September 24, the votes of millions of Germans will decide whether he will replace Angela Merkel, Germany's leader since 2005.\u000a\u000aLike America's Bernie Sanders and the UK's Jeremy Corbyn, he's a male social democrat taking on a more conservative female politician. And according to the polls, Schulz's chances don't look good.\u000a\u000aCould he do what Sanders and Corbyn failed to? Here's what you need to know about Merkel's challenger.\u000a\u000aSchulz the man\u000a\u000aSanders and Corbyn were both viewed as outsiders trying to break into and shake up mainstream politics. And Schulz's early life certainly doesn't look like that of a typical career politician either.\u000a\u000aA serious knee injury shattered his childhood dreams of becoming a pro soccer player. He struggled with alcoholism and never went to university, working in a bookstore instead and later becoming mayor of his local town.\u000a\u000aIt's a past he's happy to discuss. "When I left school early I really hit rock bottom," he said during a live YouTube interview with German voters on Tuesday. "That was the beginning of a crisis in my life."\u000a\u000aSchulz has been holding campaign rallies across Germany -- often attracting thousands -- in the run-up to the election.\u000a\u000aBut for the past six years he's been president of the European Parliament -- and was a member of it for 16 years before that.\u000a\u000a"He's not a Corbyn or a Sanders," says Charles Lees, professor of politics at the University of Bath in England. "It's difficult for politicians who are basically insiders to suddenly adopt the mantle of the outsider without looking inauthentic."\u000a\u000aHis campaign\u000a\u000aBut Schulz did play the outsider card at the start of his campaign -- and successfully.\u000a\u000aSupport for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) surged after he became its leader in January, and the party gained 20,000 members in the months that followed.\u000a\u000a"There was a huge amount of energy and hope among SPD supporters," recalls Andreas Jungherr, expert in political communication at the University of Konstanz in southern Germany. "Schulz was trying to use similar rhetoric to Sanders and Corbyn -- the rhetoric of hope and optimism."\u000a\u000aCountless memes were spawned, including a riff on the Obama "hope" poster and calls to "Make Europe Great Again."\u000a\u000aSchulz's election as leader of the SPD spawned the "MEGA" meme ("Make Europe Great Again"), riffing on President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.\u000a\u000aKey to the successes of Sanders and Corbyn was a strong grassroots campaign -- and that's vital to the SPD's efforts too.\u000a\u000aTobias Nehren, who heads up the SPD's digital campaign, spent several weeks in the US before last year's election, getting top tips from activists who worked for Sanders and his rival Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aIn recent months, he's been working to get the SPD's new online supporters out on the streets, knocking on millions of doors.\u000a\u000aAnd like Sanders and Corbyn, Schulz has raised most of his campaign finance from a huge number of small donations.\u000a\u000aBut lack of money is a problem and Schulz has lost his early momentum, falling back in the polls and turning away from visionary rhetoric towards more concrete policy proposals.\u000a\u000aIn Tuesday's YouTube appearance, it was the old Schulz who turned up -- idealistic and impassioned, relaxed and candid: "a man of the people," as one Twitter user wrote\u000a\u000a"Authentic, likeable, modern, competent, persuasive, with clear ideas and structure. @MartinSchulz you are my chancellor!" wrote another Twitter user Mc Fly.\u000a\u000aAuthentisch,sympathisch,modern,kompetent,überzeugend,mit klaren Ideen und Struktur. @MartinSchulz Sie sind mein Kanzler! #deinewahl @spdde \u2014 Mc Fly (@angelfredd) September 5, 2017\u000a\u000aHis opponent\u000a\u000aA big part of Schulz's problem is his opponent, argues Lees.\u000a\u000a"He's up against a much more accomplished political operator than Corbyn was at the last election and arguably also Bernie Sanders," he said.\u000a\u000a"Merkel has got fantastically attuned political antennae."\u000a\u000aShe rarely mentions Schulz's name on the campaign trail and is often accused of avoiding controversial issues and failing to present concrete policies.\u000a\u000aThose tactics also make it hard for Schulz to launch a successful attack.\u000a\u000aThe two candidates took part in a live television debate three weeks before the election.\u000a\u000a"There is plenty of substantive ground to criticize Merkel," argues Dan Hough, professor of politics at the University of Sussex in England.\u000a\u000a"But unless she does something to show her incompetence, Schulz will struggle," he says. "And the historical record shows she doesn't do that very often."\u000a\u000aA televised "duel" between the two candidates Sunday was widely seen as Schulz's chance to rattle his rival and position himself as a realistic alternative.\u000a\u000aBut the few blows he managed to land -- on Merkel's refugee policy, the diesel scandal and crime -- did little to unsettle her.\u000a\u000aThe voters\u000a\u000aSanders and Corbyn were both appealing to an electorate unhappy with the status quo, fed up with years of austerity and sharp-suited, silver-tongued career politicians.\u000a\u000aAlthough Schulz is preaching a similar message -- against inequality and worker exploitation, for state investment and social justice -- it doesn't seem to be cutting through.\u000a\u000a"Unlike in [other] Anglo-Saxon economies, ordinary voters are pretty content," argues Lees. "It's not an unhappy electorate."\u000a\u000aThere are problems, but they're not very apparent, he explains.\u000a\u000aMoreover, German voters "tend to have a strong aversion to political risk because of the country's history."\u000a\u000aGermany's post-war history seems to bear that out. The country has had only eight different leaders since 1949 -- and three of them have been in office for at least 12 years.\u000a\u000aThe system\u000a\u000aWhile both Sanders and Corbyn were essentially in a straight-up fight for power with their more conservative rivals, Schulz is working within a more complicated multiparty system.\u000a\u000aThat hampers him -- and his cause -- in two ways.\u000a\u000aGerman governments are nearly always formed by coalition -- and Schulz's Social Democrats have been ruling alongside Merkel's Conservatives for the past four years.\u000a\u000a"If he starts criticizing Merkel's government, he's criticizing his own party," Hough points out. "His room for maneuver is pretty slim."\u000a\u000aAn SPD supporter holds up a "Now Is Schulz" poster at a campaign rally.\u000a\u000aThe multiparty system also means that genuine political renegades are more likely to find homes in smaller, niche parties away from the center ground.\u000a\u000aThat's where discontented voters will be drawn too. "The existence of a left-wing party is something Corbyn and Sanders never had to deal with," explains Hough.\u000a\u000a"I cannot think of anybody in the SPD who would have a realistic chance of doing a better job than Martin Schulz," he says. But winning the election is a tough ask.\u000a\u000a"He needs to find an angle on Merkel that works. He hasn't done that so far."

aVStory highlights The report comes after Sessions moved to expand the program in July\u000a\u000aThe IG called on Tennessee to "remedy" the prohibited six-figure food expenses\u000a\u000aWashington (CNN) Tennessee law enforcement misused funds from a program involving seized assets, spending more than $110,000 on catering, a government watchdog report released Thursday found.\u000a\u000aThe report from the Inspector General for the Department of Justice came weeks after Attorney General Jeff Sessions moved to allow the asset forfeiture program to grow, which former Attorney General Eric Holder scaled back in 2015.\u000a\u000aLaw enforcement seizes property routinely under the suspicion it is obtained from or for illegal activity. Through the Department of Justice's equitable sharing program, the Justice Department's law enforcement partners can request and spend funds from the seizures for law enforcement purposes.\u000a\u000aThe report noted law enforcement cannot use the funds for bayonets, weaponized aircraft or food purchases, among other things.\u000a\u000aThe inspector general report released on Thursday said it had "identified several areas of improvement" with the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security's use of the program. Namely, the report took issue with $112,614 in funds spent on food with just over $110,000 spent on catering from March 2014-March 2016 based on funds from the program.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVHe also enjoys surfing, though finding the time to practice both to a high level can be a challenge.\u000a\u000aSo he's come up with a highly unusual solution -- to do both simultaneously.\u000a\u000a"Both music and sports have always been a part of my life," Santos tells CNN. "I've been into both since I was five-years-old."\u000a\u000aSantos' "home break" is at Nazaré, 75 miles (122 kilometers) north of Lisbon. Except it's not just any old break.\u000a\u000aNazaré is a mecca for surfers and where Garrett McNamara claimed a 100-foot ride in 2013, though that feat has not been ratified by Guinness World Records, which still recognizes the American's 78-footer from Praia do Norte in 2011 as its leading mark.\u000a\u000a'Water mountains'\u000a\u000aNuno's eureka moment to combine his two passions came roughly 10 years ago as he climbed some of South America's highest mountains.\u000a\u000aWherever he went, his violin went too and it was on these South American peaks that his 'Violin in the most unlikely places' challenge was born.\u000a\u000aHe eventually returned to his native Portugal and it was here that Nuno's project went viral.\u000a\u000a"The biggest mountains around here are water mountains," he explains. "But it was very straight forward to play the violin whilst surfing the giant waves of my home break, Nazaré.\u000a\u000a"This is an endeavor that requires the best of me in all levels, hence it's something that helps knowing myself as a person.\u000a\u000a"At the same time, it makes me understand the very fine balance between confidence and humbleness, between effort and patience and it reminds me constantly not to have too many expectations on the outcome, regardless of how much commitment I've put into the process."\u000a\u000aPlaying the violin while surfing giant waves may look like Nuno's most difficult challenge yet, but he says scaling mountains has really been his Everest.\u000a\u000a"To summit mountains over 6000m, I need to travel to very far locations and stay around several weeks or months in order to adapt to the altitude, meaning that this type of challenge can become very costly both in terms of time and money," he says.\u000a\u000a"After this, another challenge is preparing myself physically and mentally for it which requires a strict discipline together with a good training methodology to do so. However, this is my favorite part as I can put into practice all the knowledge and experience I have.\u000a\u000a"Big waves are also a big challenge, but because I have them on my backyard everything becomes easier."\u000a\u000aLife project\u000a\u000aNuno modestly describes his himself as "reasonably good" at music and sports when he was a 19-year-old. He went on to study sports science at university, eventually earning a PhD and becoming a university lecturer.\u000a\u000aHe lost faith in the education system and, subsequently, what he was doing and quickly returned to pursue music professionally.\u000a\u000aSurfing remains a hobby but Nuno has required professional dedication to reach the level he has.\u000a\u000a"Though I haven't had a relevant direct revenue from this effort, the reputation I've gained from it helped to relaunch myself as a musician," he explains.\u000a\u000aSo, what next for the violin-playing, big wave-surfing, mountain-climbing adventurer?\u000a\u000a"My life project for the next few years is to play the violin on the summit of the highest mountains of the seven continents, and surfing the biggest waves of the seven seas.\u000a\u000a"Easier said than done, although I know I'll get there eventually.\u000a\u000a"But space is the limit!"

aV(CNN) There is really just one salient question when it comes to today's decision by the Drug Enforcement Administration to expand the number of growers of research-grade marijuana, while still not changing the scheduling of marijuana: Will this decision make it significantly easier for scientists to study the medical benefits of marijuana?\u000a\u000aThe answer sadly is: unlikely. And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.\u000a\u000aUp until today, the University of Mississippi has been the only federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana in the United States. In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same. The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.\u000a\u000aWhile this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.\u000a\u000aImagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door. In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.\u000a\u000aMarijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.\u000a\u000aThat is the predicament of medical marijuana.\u000a\u000aBecause marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.\u000a\u000aPotential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research. Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance , institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive. There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place. Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press. This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.\u000a\u000aSisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.\u000a\u000aThen, after years of those bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock. Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself. Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.\u000a\u000aThe problem, however, is that last word in NIDA's name: "abuse."\u000a\u000aAccording to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary "Weed," the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine. Abrams makes an important point. Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.\u000a\u000aConsider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years. That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits. The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis," "Cannabis induced pancreatitits" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer." That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture of the harm-benefit ratio.\u000a\u000aContradictory policy\u000a\u000aThe road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.\u000a\u000aWhile the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.\u000a\u000aThe DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.\u000a\u000aThis is one of many quotes from his 1988 petition (PDF) to unschedule marijuana.\u000a\u000a"In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care."\u000a\u000aAgain, that was from a judge with the DEA itself. And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWhether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives. Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.\u000a\u000aWith regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts. The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi , whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.\u000a\u000aThat a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.

Neighboring structures appear flattened by mortars and bombs.\u000a\u000aThis is Raqqa, the capital of ISIS' caliphate in Syria, and the terror group's last major stronghold\u000a\u000aSDF forces advance through west Raqqa, where the threat of ISIS snipers is never far.\u000a\u000aPhotojournalist Gabriel Chaim has captured drone footage and photographs while embedded with the Syrian Democratic Forces -- part of the US-led offensive -- that give a rare look inside the city.\u000a\u000aFor the past three years, access to Raqqa has been extremely limited -- only smuggled videos and occasional satellite footage have provided a glimpse into the besieged city. Under ISIS' brutal regime, phones and cameras were banned and anyone caught with videos or images could have faced death.\u000a\u000aEven with parts of Raqqa liberated from ISIS control, photographing the city is still risky.\u000a\u000aRaqqa's remaining civilians -- up to 20,000 people, according to the SDF -- are trapped in their homes, fearful of fleeing because of snipers, air raids and street battles, according to SDF commander Haval Zargos.\u000a\u000aIn July, the UN estimated between 30,000 and 50,000 people were trapped in Raqqa, noting the difficulty in pinpointing exact numbers because of the difficulty of access.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to CNN from Raqqa's front line, Zargos estimates that around 1,500 ISIS militants remain inside the city, using an elaborate labyrinth of mines and civilians as human shields to stop coalition forces from advancing at speed.\u000a\u000aA SDF sniper targets Isis fighters in west Raqqa on August 25.\u000a\u000a"They have mines planted everywhere throughout the neighborhoods, so we have to clear every residence while we face occasional sniper fire," Zargos said, adding that the group is also using car bombs.\u000a\u000aPhotojournalist Chaim said ISIS is also using drones to halt the SDF from advancing closer to the city center. He told CNN he narrowly avoided injury when an ISIS drone exploded meters from a SDF vehicle he was embedded in.\u000a\u000aSDF forces monitor an ISIS drone hovering near the front line on Saturday.\u000a\u000aChaim's aerial footage shows Raqqa's paths and streets nearly empty, with less than a handful of SDF soldiers patrolling them in the bright sun.\u000a\u000aDuring the day, they carry out demining operations, moving with extreme caution because of the risk of ISIS snipers. From dusk, they navigate through Raqqa's east and southeastern neighborhoods -- areas where fighting has intensified in recent weeks.\u000a\u000aLocal residents refuel at an improvised gas station in a liberated area in west Raqqa on Friday.\u000a\u000aEven in the west, where the SDF has held large areas for nearly a month, coalition forces say they still face sniper fire, mines, and car bombs.\u000a\u000aWhen the clashes inside the city are at their most intense, SDF forces send word to coalition forces who respond from the air -- sometimes carrying out up to 20 airstrikes a day, according to Zargos.\u000a\u000aThe bombings have helped coalition troops advance, but many civilians have been killed in the strikes.\u000a\u000aThe SDF says the front line is currently located around just one kilometer from the city center. Two months after it began, the battle is far from over.

aVNot many banks have a cult following. Monzo is a rare exception.\u000a\u000aMore than 100,000 Brits have signed up for the smartphone bank that claims it will revolutionize banking.\u000a\u000aSeveral mobile-only banks have been launched in the U.K., including Atom and Tandem, but Monzo has quickly become the most popular.\u000a\u000aMonzo was founded two years ago by Tom Blomfield, a former Oxford law student who had previously co-founded GoCardless, a direct debit provider.\u000a\u000aDeeply frustrated with traditional banks, he decided he could do better.\u000a\u000aBlomfield said his cards would be blocked when he made payments abroad -- even though he had told his bank he was going on holiday. Fees were charged for cash withdrawals overseas, or for overdrafts he knew nothing about. And when his bank was suffering problems with its systems, there was a lack of communication.\u000a\u000a"It's just amazing that there's literally so much control and power at our fingertips and banking hasn't really adopted any of that," he said.\u000a\u000aMonzo offers something rather different to main street banks and their digital offshoots. It sends you a notification every time you make a purchase, and won't charge you when you travel.\u000a\u000aExchanged £90 at the post office and got \u20ac90.\u000a\u000aPaid for a \u20ac93 @Deliveroo whilst in Berlin and @monzo charged £79.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYES, MONZO LAD \U0001f91c\U0001f3fc \u2014 Emma Ware (@EmmaCWare) February 13, 2017\u000a\u000aIt allows you to track purchases in real time, temporarily freeze your card if you've lost it and help you stick to a strict monthly budget.\u000a\u000aEverything Monzo does seems like a no-brainer. Blomfield says that's because he had no experience in traditional banking.\u000a\u000a"Having the baggage of experience sometimes is a hindrance because you have this fairly rigid view of the status quo. (Monzo) started from scratch, so there's almost a value in that naivity and not having any preconceptions," he said.\u000a\u000aFor now, Monzo's limited banking license (granted in August 2016) only allows it to support pre-paid Mastercards that you have to top up using Apple pay or a bank transfer.\u000a\u000aBut Blomfield expects the restrictions to be lifted "very shortly." This would allow Monzo to offer classic checking accounts, starting in the next few months.\u000a\u000aDespite the limited services, Monzo is generating an enthusiastic following on social media.\u000a\u000aRecently signed up with challenger bank @Monzo - loving the simplicity and UX already \u2014 Francesca Russell (@FranRussel1) February 24, 2017\u000a\u000aFirst month using @monzo and I'm far too excited to manage my banking #amianadultyet ?\U0001f4b3 \u2014 Alice Wells (@wellsalice) February 23, 2017\u000a\u000aBy being open about how it develops its product, Blomfield says Monzo has been able to create a product people actually enjoy using and find valuable enough to tell their friends about it.\u000a\u000a"It's a virtuous cycle of reinforcement," he said.\u000a\u000aTo avoid being overwhelmed, the startup makes new customers wait a week for their hot coral debit cards.\u000a\u000aMonzo has yet to make a profit. But Blomfield says he expects that will change when it's able to offer full bank accounts -- particularly from overdrafts.\u000a\u000a"Monzo will tell you up front even before you've overdrawn that you're running out of cash. It'll tell you: Here's how much it'll cost you if you borrow -- you'll never be charged more than X pounds. Do you want to take this, yes or no?"\u000a\u000a@ianjamescox The second @monzo current accounts become available I'm switching. App, customer support is light years ahead of current banks \u2014 Callum Strong (@csscallum) February 23, 2017\u000a\u000aBlomfield's plan doesn't end with checking accounts. Ultimately he wants Monzo to allow users to file expense reports to their employers, split bills with their partner or roommates, and even check whether they're getting the best deal on gas and electricity -- all within one app.

aV(CNN) They have been raped, tortured and killed. They have been crowded on boats, ping-ponged between nations that don't want them. They have been forced into labor and have no rights to their land.\u000a\u000aIn the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, fierce clashes between security forces and Rohingya militants have left hundreds dead. In the past 12 days, around 123,000 Rohingya have fled the country and crossed into Bangladesh, UN figures show\u000a\u000aRohingya walk through rice fields after crossing over to the Bangladesh border on Friday last week.\u000a\u000aSatellite images released by Human Rights Watch showed entire villages torched to the ground in the ongoing violence.\u000a\u000aHow did it come to this? Here's what you need to know:\u000a\u000aWho are the Rohingya?\u000a\u000aThe Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic-minority group that has lived as a people in Myanmar for centuries.\u000a\u000aToday, more than a million of them live in the country, most in the western coastal state of Rakhine, where they make up around a third of the population. They speak their own language, which isn't recognized by the state.\u000a\u000aThere are regular clashes between the Rohingya and the country's security forces, as well as other ethnic groups in Rakhine, which are predominantly Buddhist. Rohingya militant groups are often involved in the clashes.\u000a\u000aEven Buddhist monks have been accused of inciting violence against the Rohingya there and led a boycott movement against them during deadly clashes in 2012.\u000a\u000aA community of Rohingya refugees also live in Bangladesh and some migrate to Malaysia, where they typically work illegally, the men often laboring.\u000a\u000aWhy aren't they recognized as Burmese?\u000a\u000aThe government in Myanmar refuses to recognize the Rohingya as citizens, claiming that they are Bangladeshi or Bengali. The UN refugee agency and human rights groups have in the past accused the government of ethnic cleansing through its repressive policies.\u000a\u000aHaving had such a long history in Myanmar, the Rohingya's ethnicity is more complex than the government makes out.\u000a\u000aThe government has argued that the Rohingya descend from farmers from what is now called Bangladesh. Many arrived in large numbers during British rule, from 1824 to 1948, when Myanmar was considered a province of British-administered India. The Rohingya were sent there as laborers, in what Britain considered an internal migration.\u000a\u000aRohingya migrant women cry, stranded on a boat drifting in Thai waters on May 14, 2015.\u000a\u000aMany Rohingya, however, say they are descendants of Muslim traders, who can be traced back to the 9th Century. In reality, there is likely to be a mix of ethnicities among them.\u000a\u000aWhen Myanmar gained independence in 1948, the Rohingya were able to apply for identity cards, which offered some rights, and some even served in Parliament.\u000a\u000aBut after a military coup in 1962, the Rohingya lost this status and were considered foreigners. They were granted foreign identity cards.\u000a\u000aIn 1982, a citizenship law only allowed the Rohingya to apply for citizenship if they could speak an officially recognized language and had proof their family had lived in the country before independence. But most Rohingya were never granted the paperwork to prove their roots, so they were effectively rendered stateless.\u000a\u000aWhat is life like for them in Myanmar?\u000a\u000aThe Rohingya have faced repression since the 1970s, but more intensively since 2011, when the government transformed from a military administration to a civilian one.\u000a\u000aThere had been hope at that time that their situation would improve, but their repression has only intensified. They remain left off a national list of 135 recognized ethnicities in Myanmar.\u000a\u000aNow, the Rohingya cannot access the same resources and services that Myanmar's predominantly Buddhist citizens can. Despite this lack of recognition, they are not allowed to leave their settlements in Rakhine without government approval.\u000a\u000aMany live in Rakhine in impoverished camps, and others spend periods in internally displaced people's settlements in other states after fleeing violence.\u000a\u000aRohingya refugees stand at a crowded camp in 2012 on the outskirts of Sittwe, Myanmar.\u000a\u000aWhat does Bangladesh say?\u000a\u000aBangladesh does not consider the Rohingya to be Bangladeshi.\u000a\u000aThere are varying estimates of how many live in the South Asian country, but it is believed to be in the hundreds of thousands. Amnesty International estimates around half a million undocumented Rohingya live there.\u000a\u000aThe country sometimes allows the Rohingya to live in camps on its border, but on other occasions, it simply sends them back to Myanmar. Those who stay, live as illegal immigrants, which usually means a life of poverty, without the right to work or access to education.\u000a\u000aOther countries in Asia have been just as unwelcoming. In 2015, groups of Rohingya were stranded at sea in Southeast Asia, as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia pushed them back and forth between each other, refusing to take them in. Indonesia even ordered its fishermen to stop rescuing them.\u000a\u000aIndonesians, however, have shown solidarity with the Rohingya, carrying out regular protests to support them. Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation and the Rohingya issue has resonated there.\u000a\u000aIndonesians protest against Myanmar and in support of the Rohingya, in the city of Surabaya on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aWhat's Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's role?\u000a\u000aNobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, seen as a national hero in Myanmar and the face of a free civilian government, has come under intense international criticism for failing to openly support the Rohingya.\u000a\u000aSuu Kyi has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses against the Rohingya, and in April denied to the BBC that ethnic cleansing was taking place.\u000a\u000aSome observers point out that the Rohingya issue is so heated in Myanmar that Suu Kyi would lose her popularity, and eventually possibly her position, if she backed the ethnic minority.\u000a\u000a"Over the last several years, I have repeatedly condemned this tragic and shameful treatment. I am still waiting for my fellow Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to do the same," Yousafzai wrote.\u000a\u000a"The world is waiting and the Rohingya Muslims are waiting."\u000a\u000aWhy are Russian Chechens protesting?\u000a\u000aTens of thousands of people have marched through Grozny, the capital of Russia's Chechen Republic. Like Indonesia, Chechnya is predominantly Muslim.\u000a\u000aProtests in Chechnya are heavily regulated and typically orchestrated by authorities.\u000a\u000aCNN's former Moscow Bureau Chief Jill Dougherty said that the protests could be an effort by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov to position himself as a global Muslim leader.\u000a\u000aOn his official Instagram account, Kadyrov labeled attacks on Rohingya as "genocide."

aV(CNN) There may have already been two large bridges connecting Lothian and Fife in Scotland, but now there is a third. And this one is the biggest yet.\u000a\u000aIn fact, towering 689 feet above the River Forth, the Queensferry Crossing is now the UK's tallest bridge.\u000a\u000aExpected to serve 24 million vehicles a year, the structure opened to traffic for the first time this week. It will be officially opened on Monday, marking the end of a decade-long engineering project involving 35,000 tons of steel, 23,000 miles of cable and 10 million man hours.\u000a\u000aA bridge for the times\u000a\u000aQueensferry Crossing, Scotland.\u000a\u000aWhen Queen Elizabeth II cuts the ribbon at the Queensferry Crossing, it will have been 53 years to the day since she opened the neighboring Forth Road Bridge. Structural problems facing the latter -- including the corrosion of some of its steel cables -- were behind the decision to build a new crossing at a cost of £1.35 billion ($1.75 billion).\u000a\u000aThe original road bridge will continue to carry pedestrians, bicycles and public transport. The adjacent railway bridge, which was completed in 1890 and has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, also remains in use.\u000a\u000aBut with an estimated design life of 120 years, it is hoped that the Queensferry Crossing will outlast both of its neighbors. To combat the threat posed by corrosion, individual steel strands within the bridge's supporting cables can be replaced at any time, without requiring the bridge to be closed to traffic.\u000a\u000aNew sensor technology has also been installed to identify potential structural issues, according to the project's technical director Dr. Mike Glover, who believes that the bridge could stand for up to 150 years.\u000a\u000a"About a thousand sensors have been installed on the Queensferry Crossing, carefully positioned to provide advanced warning of structural problems," he said in a press statement. "The data will tell the maintenance teams where to inspect and intervene to pre-empt potential issues.\u000a\u000a"This is the future of roads and bridge maintenance -- combining sensor technology and cloud-based data analytics to predict problems before they happen."\u000a\u000aA feat of engineering\u000a\u000aWhile the bridge is significantly shorter than the world's tallest -- a title held by the 1,125-foot-high Millau Viaduct in France -- it can boast two engineering records of its own. The new structure is both the longest three-tower, cable-stayed bridge in the world, and the longest free-standing balanced cantilever in the world.\u000a\u000aFirst announced in 2007, construction on the Queensferry Crossing began in 2011 and was led by a consortium of companies from Scotland, Germany, Spain and the US. The bridge's central tower was built on rock beneath the water's surface, while the other two are founded on a giant steel cylinder beneath the river bed.\u000a\u000aInnovations found on the structure include so-called "intelligent transport systems" that help manage traffic flow, and a line of 3.5-meter-high barriers to protect traffic from wind.\u000a\u000a"The Forth Estuary is no stranger to blustery conditions," Glover said. "(We have fitted the structure with) permeable screens that allow some of the air through and scoops the rest up and over the bridge, preventing severe turbulent wind conditions across the deck.\u000a\u000a"These wind shields will provide vehicles with protection from the frequent gale force winds -- reducing traffic incidents and keeping people safer."

aVOn this day 10 years ago, lines of Apple faithful formed outside of the company's stores across the U.S.\u000a\u000aSome had staked out their spots days before. They brought folding chairs, umbrellas, sleeping bags and, in San Francisco, one mattress. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) handed out bottles of water. People offered to sell their spots in line for hundreds of dollars.\u000a\u000aA few people were doing it for publicity, but many just wanted to be among the first to own the expensive new smartphone Apple had announced six months earlier.\u000a\u000aIt was the kind of dramatic frenzy any tech company would have killed for, and that Apple specializes in manufacturing. Luckily, its product would live up to the hype, selling more than a billion devices over a decade and changing technology forever.\u000a\u000aRelated: Inside Apple: How the iPhone almost never happened\u000a\u000a"I think that everybody was very, very relieved that when the iPhone ultimately launched at the end of June in 2007, that it actually worked," said tech journalist Fred Vogelstein, who wrote a book on the smartphone race between Apple and Google (GOOGL, Tech30).\u000a\u000aSince that day, Apple has grown the iPhone into its most popular and reliable product. It sold more than 50 million iPhones in the first three months of 2017 alone, bringing in $33.2 billion.\u000a\u000aLooking back at the first iPhone, its limitations seem quaint: It was expensive, starting at $499 for 4GB of memory; it only worked on AT&T's EDGE network; and there was no App Store to speak of.\u000a\u000aNow the company releases a new version of the device every year, sprinkling on new features like water resistance or a fingerprint sensor to entice people to upgrade. All of the specs have been radically improved over the years, from the chip to the camera resolution. And the original size looks quaint 10 years later -- Apple now sells versions that are nearly two times as big.\u000a\u000aThe iPhone's success has had a halo effect on other products and industries. Apple went on to make the iPad, a tablet version of the iPhone. It added an App Store to iOS in 2008. Developers have built careers and billion dollar companies on iPhone apps. Apple says developers around the world have earned more than $16 billion.\u000a\u000aThere's even a movie based on characters that were made famous in iPhone games (that flopped, but still).\u000a\u000a"It is truly remarkable that in the 10 year span of the iPhone being on the market, it has disrupted the telecom industry, the music industry, the television industry, the video industry, the computer industry, the communications industry -- and that's just a start," said analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies.\u000a\u000aNot all the disruption has been in Apple's favor. Released a year and a half after the iPhone, Google's Android mobile operating system has been the biggest competitor to Apple's iOS. Android phones accounted for 84% of the market in the first quarter of this year, according to Gartner.\u000a\u000aRelated: How Android beat the iPhone to world domination\u000a\u000aDespite the competition, people still look to Apple for the next big thing. And after 10 years, it's become restless.\u000a\u000aApple's strength lies in its ability to take existing features and refine, repackage and market them as if they are brand new, according to Tuong Nguyen, an analyst at Gartner. He said the next industries it could push forward are augmented reality and voice interfaces, places where other companies are already doing more work.\u000a\u000aFor now, Apple is focusing on a special version of the iPhone that's expected to come out this fall. It could have conductive charging and an edge-to-edge display. (CEO Tim Cook has blamed slumping iPhone sales on excitement for the new device.)\u000a\u000aWhatever its features when it's unveiled in September, whether mind-blowing or disappointing, people will still line up outside of Apple stores, excited to be the first to touch the latest creation.

aVEditor's Note: On April 23, Jacob Zurl completed his Cuba challenge, cycling 1450km in 58 hours and 48 minutes -- nearly two hours slower than his initial estimated time. The article below was first published on April 18, the day before the Austrian began cycling across the Caribbean island.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Sleep deprived, the mind begins to play tricks. Exhausted, the body begs for no more. But Jacob Zurl carries on. He must. Records can only be broken when the spirit refuses to bow.\u000a\u000aEnduring when the majority would quit is this Austrian's specialty.\u000a\u000aThe extreme cyclist lives to achieve the unthinkable: cycling across the Himalayas in a record 39 hours, setting world firsts in high altitude.\u000a\u000aThis month he is to cycle non-stop the length of Cuba, from east to west, on gravel and dirt tracks, in extreme heat, perhaps tropical rain. It will be humid. It could be 1450 kilometers (900 miles) of hell.\u000a\u000aNo one has attempted this round-the-clock feat. The 28-year-old hopes to complete his mission -- the equivalent of cycling from New York to St Louis in the Midwest -- in 57 hours. Experienced cyclists would normally take two weeks.\u000a\u000aHe will, he says, nap for a few minutes, weather permitting, and when nature calls he will hop off his bike. But essential functions will be brief. Time moves forward without rest and so must he.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Extreme Cuba: 1450km, 57 hours, 1 song Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Extreme Cuba: 1450km, 57 hours, 1 song 01:34\u000a\u000aFor a little over two days, Zurl will mainly be pedaling, relentlessly so, fighting the aches in the body, the manipulative voices in his mind and whatever the elements throw at him.\u000a\u000aIt is his inquisitiveness, as well as a love for adrenaline, which drives him.\u000a\u000a"When I look at the world map, for me, as an ultra cyclist, I see so many interesting projects," he tells CNN Sport.\u000a\u000a"Why hasn't someone done this challenge before? Cuba is such an interesting country.\u000a\u000a"I want to get in contact with the people, to know the country. I have endurance in cycling and the Cuban people have endurance in life."\u000a\u000aYoung men wait by the side of the road for the remains of former Cuban President Fidel Castro to pass by on their four-day journey across the country.\u000a\u000aThe Caribbean's largest island is experiencing an uncertain era following the death of Fidel Castro in November 2016.\u000a\u000aCastro, regarded as a revolutionary hero to his supporters and a ruthless autocrat to his enemies, was the man who created a communist state in America's backyard.\u000a\u000aBut earlier last year, Barack Obama became the first US President to visit the country in 88 years as relations between the Cold War-era adversaries thawed. It is yet unclear what policy US President Donald Trump will pursue, but it is possible he will harden America's stance towards the island.\u000a\u000aCuba, a country 90 miles off the Florida coast, is renowned for its color and spirit, but its vivacity will not shield Zurl from the agony he will undoubtedly experience as he forces his body to cover a daunting distance at rapid pace.\u000a\u000aRiding along, and up and down, rickety roads, his body will rattle as if riding on a pneumatic drill. Crouched for hours, his back will eventually feel as tight as old rubber and his muscles will be as hard as week-old bread.\u000a\u000aWhile the lights on his bike will guide him through dark nights, it is music -- and an iron will -- that will drive this son of a bank manager on when he is sucked into a black hole of physical suffering.\u000a\u000aCuriously, he will only listen to one song, a familiar beat, lyrics he can easily repeat. Sometimes, he may even sing along. Quietly, of course, for it is long-distance cycling, not singing, which is his forte.\u000a\u000a"I haven't decided what song it will be yet in Cuba," he laughs, revealing that his tune of choice during a recent training stint in Spain was Mumford and Sons' "Believe" before adding that he rode up the Himalayas listening to "Free" by Natalia Kills.\u000a\u000a"For the long distance projects, the music makes it easier," he says. "Once my support car drove over one of my MP3 players. That was s***."\u000a\u000aZurl is the sort of man who would feel lost riding without music.\u000a\u000aHe will take three portable music players to Cuba, a precaution against a repeat of the previous disaster.\u000a\u000aFor many, listening to the same song for hours, for days, seemingly forever on loop, would be as torturous as pedaling from one end of a country to another at 25 kph.\u000a\u000aBut when life on the saddle feels effortless, Zurl's mind drifts. He will contemplate about his yesterdays and make plans for his tomorrows. "I'm thinking about everything," he admits.\u000a\u000aHe hears the music, but doesn't listen. The music, he says, goes "under my mind."\u000a\u000aIt is when the adventure becomes a chore that Zurl refocuses on the beat of his favorite tune which will push him to achieve a feat no man or woman has done before.\u000a\u000a"It's always just one song. It's kind of spiritual. When it's getting hard and I want to listen to music and there is no music, it's a problem for me," says Zurl, who has been cycling an average of 20 hours a week in preparation for this ride, focusing on speed rather than endurance.\u000a\u000a"The worst thing to happen in this race would be if I lost my MP3 players."\u000a\u000aBut Zurl has experienced deeper misery than the crushing of his portable music player.\u000a\u000aIt was while in Cuba, before his first attempt to cycle across the island in 2015, that Zurl contracted dengue fever.\u000a\u000a"I felt suddenly not good," is his understated description of the day he was hastily taken to hospital, his temperature rising to 40 degrees.\u000a\u000aZurl says he fears catching dengue fever again during his ride along the country.\u000a\u000aIn nine days, he lost seven kilos. He says he caught the tropical disease, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, when cycling in heavy rain during a training session on the island.\u000a\u000aHe is better prepared for this his second attempt, though that does not mean he has forgotten easily about the fright of two years ago.\u000a\u000aAsked what he feared the most about the journey ahead, he gravely replies: "Catching dengue again."\u000a\u000a"There was a heavy shower and I didn't have the (mosquito) spray and, I think, that was the problem," says Zurl, regret still in his voice.\u000a\u000a"I did not think it was going to be so dangerous.\u000a\u000a"I took the plane back to Austria and for the next two months sport was forbidden and, after that, I started to cycling again, but in 2016 I fell ill so many times."\u000a\u000aIt is Zurl's experience with dengue which partly explains why his family will be close behind in a support car this time around.\u000a\u000aHis parents, Paul and Brigitte, a medical physicist, and girlfriend, Nina Almer, are the ones who will drive behind with food supplies, isotonic drinks, spare wheels and, of course, his MP3 players.\u000a\u000aThe mum who once told her then-18-year-old son he was "completely stupid" for spending a vast sum on shoes for his new two-wheeled hobby is now fully supportive of his long-distance expeditions.\u000a\u000a"First my parents were skeptical," admits Zurl, once a promising sailor of international class before cycling took hold.\u000a\u000a"It needed a lot of energy for me to convince them, but in the last two years or so it's easier and they know, for me, it's important.\u000a\u000a"If it's not too dangerous they will let me do it. In the past it was difficult because my father loved to sail and I'd sail in regattas.\u000a\u000a"That's all changed. Not only do my parents now cycle, but my uncle and aunt do too. Sometimes we cycle together and we have our own jersey. I made it for them with the family name on it."\u000a\u000aIt is perhaps fitting that Zurl's mum will be on hand to make sure her son eats properly, though he does not need his mother to remind him of the dangers of not consuming the right calories at the right time. Every engine needs fuel.\u000a\u000aEating for endurance, says Zurl, is a skill. "I really have to eat a lot," he says, sighing.\u000a\u000aExperience has taught him he will have to eat or drink 500 calories an hour to compensate for the minerals he will lose through sweating.\u000a\u000aEven food lovers would balk at the thought of consuming 30,000 calories in two-and-a-half days -- especially when presented with a diet of rice and potatoes, essential for this race against the clock.\u000a\u000aWill Zurl find fresh vegetables along Cuba's dirt tracks?\u000a\u000aHe says he would love to, but is unsure what will be available en route. Protein bars and drinks, he says, will suffice if fresh food cannot be found.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Ultra cyclist to cross Cuba in 57 hours Austrian ultra cyclist Jacob Zurl is planning to see Cuba like no person has ever seen before ...

aV(CNN) This time last year, CNN Opinion asked a group of commentators from around the world for their take on the US presidential election. One year later, Donald Trump is preparing to be sworn in as President of the United States. So, what is the world expecting -- and hoping for -- from a Trump presidency? Guest commentators from around the world weigh in. The views expressed are their own.\u000a\u000aRussia: A domestic win for Putin\u000a\u000aWhen Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, he received a round of applause in the Russian parliament. It was a pure, almost childish expression of joy.\u000a\u000aSince then, the "Russian factor" has loomed ominously over Trump's impending presidency. The Russian term " kompromat " -- compromising material -- is entering the English language, much like "sputnik" did more than 50 years ago. The American press debates -- in total seriousness -- whether the Kremlin is literally keeping the President of the most powerful country on Earth on its leash and shaping his policies. More importantly, the notorious hacking story is far from over. For many in Washington, Vladimir Putin has become the main trickster of the election.\u000a\u000aHowever, Russian officialdom was hardly expecting a Trump victory. Viewing the American election as a zero-sum game with the West, Putin planned for a likely defeat. Before Election Day, Russia's propaganda machine was warming up to announce that a flawed American political system would never let the anti-establishment candidate win. That was supposed to be Russia's consolation prize.\u000a\u000aThen, defeat suddenly turned into victory. Russia is beyond satisfied with this serendipitous turn of events. A happy and astounded Kremlin will now try to get the most from Trump -- from easing sanctions to making a deal on Syria and settling the Ukraine issue.\u000a\u000aIt is difficult, of course, to predict how Trump's administration will address these issues and what the result will be. But this uncertainty hardly undermines the feeling that Russian officialdom has been experiencing: a sense they have achieved a moral victory over the West and its values.\u000a\u000aSince the annexation of Crimea, the West has labeled Putin a pariah and a global threat. Yet now, Trump's win has made something clear: It is not Putin who is a weak outlier before the world's liberal order. Rather, it is the West that is divided and full of resentment. An outcast yesterday, Putin may now see himself as a major power broker in the emerging global Trumpworld.\u000a\u000aThe least that the Kremlin will now expect from the White House is a display of respect and equality. After what has been presented by Russian propaganda as years of unprecedented humiliation and offense from the West, Putin will easily sell his country's newfound parity with the United States to the Russian public for his own personal gain.\u000a\u000aTransforming Putin's moral triumph into a dramatic expansion of Russian influence on the global stage will be trickier. But from the Kremlin's point of view, it is probably doable.\u000a\u000aMikhail Fishman is editor-in-chief of The Moscow Times.\u000a\u000aMexico: Will Trump really pursue his 'Mexican agenda'?\u000a\u000aAna Maria Salazar\u000a\u000aThroughout his campaign, we all hoped he would tone down such rhetoric so as not to alienate the Hispanic vote (too much, at least). However, his rhetoric simply became more vitriolic -- and more threatening.\u000a\u000aSo President Enrique Peña Nieto invited him to Mexico , perhaps in hopes that the hospitality and reality of bilateral relations would change Donald Trump´s opinion about the southern border (and awkward facts such as there being potentially millions of jobs at stake -- on both sides of the border -- if he decided to scrap NAFTA).\u000a\u000aBut mere hours after returning from Mexico, not only did Trump NOT change his mind, but he engaged ( in Arizona of all places ) in some of his most anti-immigration rhetoric yet. Meanwhile, in Mexico there was a backlash against Peña Nieto's decision to invite Trump, forcing Finance Minister Luis Videgaray -- seen as instrumental in arranging the visit -- out of the Cabinet.\u000a\u000aAs the votes were tallied on election night, there was hope that Trump's rhetoric was campaign garbage and not genuine policy. But in the two months since the election, Trump has reiterated his calls for a wall, insisted that Mexico will reimburse the US for the cost and called for the renegotiation of NAFTA and a border tax for companies that invest in Mexico and wish to send their products to the United States.\u000a\u000aOn the back of all this, the Mexican peso has plunged, and there is concern that on January 20, the least popular person in decades to be sworn in as US President will deliver a speech that could be catastrophic for the Mexican economy.\u000a\u000aSince losing his role at the finance ministry, Luis Videgaray has been appointed foreign minister, and will head negotiations with the United States. Perhaps the President is hoping that Trump will now play and negotiate in an appropriate way. He likely is wrong.\u000a\u000aThrough his threats, tweets, and speeches, Trump may have left the President and his negotiators with no political wiggle room to sign any kind of agreement that requires ratification by the Mexican Senate. And the chances for a candidate from Peña Nieto's party will likely be scuppered in the 2018 presidential elections unless the President can convince Trump not to initiate massive deportations and to stop insisting on building the wall.\u000a\u000aBut if Trump believes his "Mexican agenda" helped get him elected, it is hard to imagine he will do anything but continue to insist on his beautiful wall, deportations and a new and "improved" NAFTA agreement.\u000a\u000aAna Maria Salazar worked at the White House as policy adviser for President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the Americas and was deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug enforcement. She writes, teaches and has anchored radio and TV news programs in Mexico since 2001.\u000a\u000aIsrael: Netanyahu breathes a sigh of relief\u000a\u000aYaakov Katz\u000a\u000aAfter eight years of hostility and tension with President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will let out a huge sigh of relief Friday when Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.\u000a\u000aFor Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition government, Trump's presidency is viewed as a new beginning when it comes to Israeli-US relations. One government minister went so far as to say that Trump's victory in November signals that "the days of the Messiah" have come.\u000a\u000aThat might be a stretch, but for Israel, Trump seems like the antithesis of the outgoing president.\u000a\u000aWhile Obama regularly pressured Israel to stop construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Trump's advisers have said they will not. While Obama refused to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, Trump has said that he will . And while Obama championed the Iran deal that Israel aggressively tried to prevent, Trump has raised the possibility that he will scrap it.\u000a\u000aWhile this all bodes well for the current government in Jerusalem, it remains to be seen what Trump will do when it comes to Israel's ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. Will he follow the longstanding US policy of pushing for a two-state solution or will he offer new options for a resolution?\u000a\u000aWill he stand strong against settlement expansion or will he allow Israeli annexation of settlements as some government ministers are advocating?\u000a\u000aSo far, Trump hasn't said much, although the announcement that his son-in-law Jared Kushner will serve as the president's Middle East envoy seems to indicate that he plans to take on the thorny issue.\u000a\u000aLike other countries in the Middle East, Israel is hoping to see a more engaged America playing an active role in the region. The presence of Russian military forces in Syria, for example, is believed to be directly linked to Obama's decision not to enforce his "red line" on the use of chemical weapons in that ongoing civil war and humanitarian disaster. Leaving a vacuum allowed Russia to enter the country.\u000a\u000aWill Trump re-engage the Middle East or will he prefer to remain on the sidelines and stay away from a region that has for decades frustrated consecutive American presidents?\u000a\u000aStarting on January 20, the world will begin to get some answers.\u000a\u000aYaakov Katz is the editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post and co-author of " Weapon Wizards: How Israel Became a High-Tech Military Superpower ."\u000a\u000aIndia: Did America get its Modi?\u000a\u000aSanjay Kumar\u000a\u000aOn the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, India is experiencing some of the same kind of anxiety it felt when Narendra Modi was about to become the country's prime minister, back in May 2014\u000a\u000aA right-wing Hindu leader with a controversial political past who cultivated an image as an outsider, Modi's rise to power disturbed the existing political equilibrium in the country, and his election brought with it a heightened sense of unpredictability and uncertainty among not just Indians, but overseas as well. Indeed, for many -- particularly the country's liberals -- it took quite some time for the reality of a Modi premiership to sink in.\u000a\u000aA sense of disbelief and uncertainty has gripped many people here again.\u000a\u000aWill the improvement in India-US relations continue with a Trump administration? How will Indians settled and working in the United States be treated? Will the protectionist measures that Trump is talking about impact Indians living abroad? Will such policies affect the outsourcing that keeps so many Indians in India working?\u000a\u000aThese are just some of the questions Indians have. But the questions also extend to international affairs -- how is India going to adjust if Washington decides to revise Obama's policy towards the Middle East and western Asia? Policymakers in New Delhi are already worried, for example, that reimposing sanctions on Iran would impact India's crude oil supply and delay the completion of Chabahar port that will create a new trade route for Afghanistan and drastically alter the trade dynamics in South Asia.\u000a\u000aIn addition, New Delhi is also keenly waiting to see how Trump goes about dealing with Pakistan. Will he continue the old policy of transactional engagement with the Muslim state or take a firm line over its support for terror groups?\u000a\u000aBut there is a more philosophical concern among liberals in India: The potential impact of a close political entente between Modi and Trump. The fear is that the political proximity between the two leaders, who have strong anti-Muslim, anti-minority images, will unleash and strengthen forces inimical to liberal and secular values. Such sentiment is already simmering in India since Modi assumed office in 2014 -- and his presence has contributed to keeping the Indo-Pakistan relationship on tenterhooks.\u000a\u000aMany on the Indian subcontinent see Trump as Modi's alter ego. Closer ties between them might prove to be a double-edged sword for our country.\u000a\u000aSanjay Kumar is a New Delhi-based journalist who writes on national and international issues with particular emphasis on South Asia.\u000a\u000aBritain: Trump creates a stir\u000a\u000aOn Monday, the British people learned that Donald Trump's late mother was an admirer of the British monarchy. "She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, 'cause nobody does that like the English," he told an interviewer\u000a\u000aA family weakness for the British nostalgia industry is unlikely to have much impact on his approval rating among a population deeply concerned about the President-elect's ethics, prejudices and mental stability.\u000a\u000aWhat did get the UK talking was the identity of the interviewer. Michael Gove, who recently left the British Cabinet after losing a leadership election, has returned to his role as a columnist for The Times of London. He remains a prominent figure in Westminster politics and has retained his seat in the House of Commons.\u000a\u000aMeeting with Trump in his capacity as a journalist, Gove is only the latest right-wing figure to irk the British government by flaunting a relationship with the President-elect outside official channels. Prime Minister Theresa May, who clashed frequently with Gove when they were Cabinet colleagues under David Cameron, has made clear that such freelance diplomacy will not hasten his political rehabilitation.\u000a\u000aEven Gove, however, failed to match the stir created when the President-elect was pictured with Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, before he had met representatives of the governing Conservative Party.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump then suggested on Twitter that Farage should be appointed ambassador to Washington, May was furious. In Britain, where ambassadorships are traditionally held by long-serving career diplomats, this was seen as unprecedented interference in the affairs of Her Majesty's Government. The Queen nominally appoints each ambassador and takes a close interest due to her contacts with other heads of state. If Trump shares his mother's fondness for the Queen's ceremonial role in British life, he would be well advised to respect her protocol.\u000a\u000aAs well as securing a scoop for The Times, Gove's main aim in meeting the President-elect will likely have been to impress on him the existence of prominent Brexiteers other than Nigel Farage. Farage has enjoyed high visibility on British TV, his divisive rhetoric delivering strong ratings. Unlike Trump, he has not succeeded in translating that into electoral success, having failed at seven attempts to win a seat in Parliament . He was excluded by the official "Vote Leave" campaign in the UK referendum, run by more mainstream members of the Conservative Party, and campaigned instead with a smaller, unregistered "Leave EU" team dominated by UKIP. The anti-European movement in Britain is riddled with personal divisions; Gove, who played a major role in "Vote Leave", will have bridled at Farage taking credit for the referendum.\u000a\u000aNone of these subtleties are likely to deter the British government from maintaining a formal alliance with the United States as long as it remains a world power. But the President-elect would be wise to avoid playing favorites with squabbling British politicians. Serious concerns remain about the future of the relationship with Britain; elements in the security services are concerned about the legal implications for the " Five-Eyes " intelligence sharing system should Trump authorize the use of torture by their American partners. In Scotland, he has long been an unpopular landlord, indulging in an ongoing feud with the ruling Scottish National Party over environmental and planning issues.\u000a\u000aDiplomacy by Twitter is not the British way. The Queen would not approve.\u000a\u000aKate Maltby is a theater critic for The Times of London and regular broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics. Her website is www.katemaltby.com\u000a\u000aGermany: Will Merkel confront Trump?\u000a\u000aAlmut Möller\u000a\u000aFrom a Berlin perspective, there is a particular irony in the inauguration of Donald Trump as the next US president. Today's Germany in many ways is a product of the post-World War II era in Europe on which the United States has spent so much time and resources over the past decades.\u000a\u000aLocking Germany into a collective European order has been key to pacifying the European continent, and has served Germany particularly well. Indeed, the principles that are so strongly rooted in this country are largely tied to the pacifist attitudes of the German public and a preference for an economic rather than a security role in foreign affairs. There is also a strong reflexive support among Germans for multilateral approaches aimed at building global institutions and international law, as well as for the need for Germany to have a predictable foreign policy.\u000a\u000aBut what Berlin has understood from the President-elect so far is that Donald Trump is not really very interested in any of these principles. Instead, his rhetoric runs counter to some of the most formative instincts of the political elite in Germany -- and of the public at large. The question Germans have now is how Berlin will react once President Trump actually starts to shape politics rather than talking about it?\u000a\u000aAnd there has been plenty in the talk so far to cause concern. For example, just last weekend, Trump gave a major interview with widely read German newspaper BILD Zeitung in which he called into question the role of NATO and the future cohesion of the European Union. Both institutions are fundamental pillars of German foreign policy.\u000a\u000aAngela Merkel gave a first glimpse of her mindset in a news conference with the prime minister of New Zealand in Berlin that same day. "I think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands," she said when asked about Trump's comments. By her usually cautious standards this was another remarkable statement following her initial reaction to Trump's election back in November.\u000a\u000aWhen President Barack Obama gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in the summer of 2013 , he called for an end to German complacency in international affairs. Developments in and around Europe over recent years have already seen a much more active Germany on the European and international stage. Berlin has understood that some of its vital interests -- both in economic and security terms -- have come to be challenged.\u000a\u000aTrump is going to ensure Germany accelerates along this path, a reality that will have major implications for Germany and Europe. Berlin has a realistic understanding of its power, and where the German government has the resources to punch its weight it will attempt to do so.\u000a\u000aBut how willing will Germany be to confront President Trump on fundamental questions over the future of the European and global order? Germany currently holds the G20 presidency. That might give us a sign about how much Merkel is willing to say.\u000a\u000aAlmut Möller is a senior policy fellow and director of the European Council on Foreign Relations' Berlin office.\u000a\u000aChina: Trump should avoid the Taiwan card\u000a\u000aShen Dingli\u000a\u000aWhile the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's incoming administration doesn't bode well for anyone, the instability ahead could begin to recede if the new executive branch is willing to learn and acts sensibly.\u000a\u000aFor instance, Trump has repeatedly demanded "fair trade". No one rejects the idea of fair trade, but if the focus is on "fair" rather than "unfair" trade, then the key issue is who decides what type of trade is fair or otherwise.\u000a\u000aAs long as the United States does not exit the World Trade Organization, America, like any other member of the WTO, is subject to the body's arbitration mechanism to settle trade disputes.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration may renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement or quit the Trans Pacific Partnership, but if it does, it will still be opting for negotiation and bilateral trade agreements with Asia-Pacific nations and other trade partners. In other words, Trump may not be a fan of globalism, but he still subscribes to bilateralism and even internationalism.\u000a\u000aChina, for its part, could well live with a China-US bilateral trade and investment framework, along with a WTO cap. The ongoing negotiation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty is an example. Trump wants "smart" negotiation, to which China has no objection. But if Trump refuses to settle disputes through negotiation, then China won't be happy.\u000a\u000aStill, China is wary of the possibility that the Trump team might try to play the Taiwan card as part of any bargaining. This would be unacceptable -- China may be willing to negotiate or renegotiate over trade, investment and currency levels, but it will in no way be willing to renegotiate the "One China" principle . This is one thing that China will never put up for sale.\u000a\u000aIf the Trump administration can understand this key point quickly, and if it acts in a diplomatic way, then Trump does indeed have a chance to make America truly great again.\u000a\u000aShen Dingli is professor and associate dean at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa: Trump brings a new style\u000a\u000aTinashe Chuchu\u000a\u000aSouth Africans in general were more inclined to support Hillary Clinton for president, but that did not happen. Why the support for Clinton? Because South Africans valued the longstanding relationship that their nation had developed with the Clintons, especially during the Mandela years.\u000a\u000aNow that the election is over and Donald Trump has won, South Africa -- like many other nations -- hopes that it will be able to secure favorable trade relations with the Trump administration. Of course, the signs from the Trump camp suggest that the incoming administration will take a tough stance on trade. And though Trump did not single out South Africa specifically for criticism, he did warn more broadly that deals would need to be rethought because the United States is always losing out on trade agreements.\u000a\u000aAnother issue that might be of interest to South Africans is US immigration policy toward South Africa. Again, Trump warned over the threat posed by certain kinds of immigration, which became a feature of his campaign. If he cracks down it could make it tougher for South Africans wishing to secure a US visa.\u000a\u000aBut it's not all trepidation. Some South Africans admire Trump's apparent success with his own businesses. They hope that he will enjoy similar success running the United States. Indeed, if Trump is successful and the US economy performs well under his presidency, countries like South Africa will likely benefit, too.\u000a\u000aAs John Stremlau, former vice president of the Carter Center, told Africa's News24 , it is still unclear what shape the Trump administration's foreign policy will take. However, as a businessman, it seems that Trump is determined to try his hand at making deals. It will be interesting to see what this new style means for business with Africa.\u000a\u000aTinashe Chuchu is a lecturer in the School of Economic and Business Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.\u000a\u000aEgypt: A lesson for Americans\u000a\u000aAdel Abdel Ghafar\u000a\u000aThe election of Donald Trump was welcome news in Cairo. The US President-elect and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met each other on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting last September. After that meeting, both expressed a mutual admiration for one another. Sisi remarked that Trump would make a strong leader, which Trump reciprocated by praising Sisi as a "fantastic guy." Sisi was reportedly the first Arab leader to congratulate Trump, and recently reportedly stated to the Egyptian press that he knew Trump would win as "his honesty touched the hearts of the American people."\u000a\u000aIt's not hard to imagine why these two men would get along. Both are not particularly fond of protecting human rights, and have demonstrated a deep disdain for the press. They abhor Islamists of all shapes and forms. Neither man handles criticism well, as demonstrated by their emotional outbursts. Both admire Vladimir Putin, who has spent time cultivating them both.\u000a\u000aOverall, they share an identical black and white world view, reminiscent of George W. Bush's "you are either with us or against us." There is no middle way in Trump and Sisi's world; only enemies to be annihilated or friends based on mutual interests.\u000a\u000aWith regards to Egypt and the Middle East, discourse on human rights and democratization will become background noise, as the Trump administration's foreign policy will likely focus on advancing US economic and security interests. Trump and Sisi began collaborating even before the President-elect assumed office: Trump reportedly called on Sisi to withdraw the U.N. resolution against Israeli settlements , which ultimately passed.\u000a\u000aConveniently, the Egyptian media has dropped the commentary from Trump about Muslim bans and registries from its coverage, while equating the President-elect with Sisi; a strongman who will bring stability in an age of turbulence. However, almost three years since Sisi's election, many segments of the Egyptian population feel disappointed in his leadership, as he has failed to bring stability or usher in the era of economic prosperity that he promised.\u000a\u000aGiven time, the American people, like their Egyptian counterparts, are also likely to find themselves profoundly unhappy with their new president.\u000a\u000aAdel Abdel Ghafar is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and the author of " Egyptians in Revolt: The Political Economy of Labor and Student Mobilizations 1919 -2011 ."\u000a\u000aPhilippines: Will Trump challenge Duterte?\u000a\u000aMong Palatino\u000a\u000aConsidering that there are, by some estimates , around 300,000 Filipinos living as undocumented migrants in the United States, the question for many here is whether President Donald Trump will be true to his campaign promise of being tough on illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aAs for the about 3.5 million Filipinos living in the United States , they join other Americans in hoping that the Trump presidency will deliver stable jobs, better health care, and safer communities.\u000a\u000aLike other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines wants to know whether Trump will continue to endorse the rebalancing of American forces toward the Asia-Pacific region. More specifically, Filipinos have two other questions on defense: What will Trump's policy be regarding the maritime dispute in the South China Sea involving China and its smaller neighbors? Will he uphold the mutual defense pact between the Philippines and the United States?\u000a\u000aIt is not only on defense that a Trump presidency raises questions for Filipinos. In terms of his economic program, for example, many wonder whether his vow to protect American businesses will mean less investment in the Philippines and the rest of Asia? They also wonder whether his call for the return of manufacturing and outsourced jobs to the United States will disrupt Asian economies.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, Trump is often compared to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Both are non-traditional politicians who achieved surprising electoral victories despite their controversial, divisive -- sometimes politically incorrect -- views.\u000a\u000aDuterte has frequently criticized the United States for its colonial crimes and political meddling, even making an unprecedented declaration of a "separation" of the Philippines and the United States. President Obama chose to ignore Duterte's rants. Will Trump do the same thing? Will he comment on the alleged American plot to destabilize Duterte's government\u000a\u000aBoth are interesting questions. But perhaps the biggest question mark is over whether Donald Trump will raise the issue of human rights with Duterte, whose war on drugs has, by many accounts, left thousands of civilians dead.\u000a\u000aFilipinos are extremely curious to find out what happens next.\u000a\u000aMong Palatino is a Filipino activist, blogger, and former legislator.

aV(CNN) When Ren Hang took his own life in February of this year, media reports were quick to depict him as a figure of controversy. The celebrated Chinese photographer was viewed not only through his work, but through the context in which it was created.\u000a\u000aObituaries addressed Ren's encounters with the police, his well-documented battle with depression and the sometimes uncomfortable contrast between the topics he explored -- sexuality, gender and the human body -- and socially conservative Chinese values.\u000a\u000aComposed largely of male nudes taken between 2010 and 2016, the new exhibition features some of the last Ren prints to be authenticated.\u000a\u000aBut the organizers of the first major posthumous exhibition of Ren's work are hoping to present a more nuanced account. The collection is on display from Friday as part of the annual Photofairs Shanghai . It is intended to demonstrate the photographer's technical and artistic prowess, according to co-curator Tim Crowley.\u000a\u000a"When you see what people have written about him since his death, it's very focused on him taking some kind of political stance through rebellion or (by photographing) nudes," Crowley said in a phone interview. "But when you look at his photographs as a whole -- and through conversations with him -- it becomes very apparent that he was non-political.\u000a\u000a"That angle has been pushed upon him, probably as a sales ploy more than anything else. Like a lot of (Ren's) generation, politics didn't really play a big role in his day-to-day art and images."\u000a\u000aA new perspective\u000a\u000aComposed largely of male nudes taken between 2010 and 2016, the new exhibition "19 Photographs" features some of the last Ren prints to be authenticated. The images were chosen from a larger show by the same organizers, "Beauty Without Beards," which had opened at Beijing's KWM Art Center two weeks before the photographer's death.\u000a\u000aPhotos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Two Men by Wang Ningde Hide Caption 1 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Cindy Crawford by Herb Ritts Hide Caption 2 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Christy and Mouse by Patrick Demarchelier Hide Caption 3 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Audrey Hepburn by Norman Parkinson Hide Caption 4 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Escuela d Romanos by Ouka Leele Hide Caption 5 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Naomi Campbell by Michel Comte Hide Caption 6 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Flower Seller at Dal Lake by Steve McCurry Hide Caption 7 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Andy Warhol by Pierre Houles Hide Caption 8 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 The fall by Denis Darzacq Hide Caption 9 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Empire State Building by Elliott Erwitt Hide Caption 10 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Spiagge Bianche Study 2 by Antonie Rose Hide Caption 11 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Embroidery on digital pigment print by JinHee Kim Hide Caption 12 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Two Men by Wang Ningde Hide Caption 13 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Asylum of the Birds by Roger Ballen Hide Caption 14 of 15 Photos: A look back at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai 2016 Portofino by Herbert List Hide Caption 15 of 15\u000a\u000aThe exhibition's curators say they turned to a range of new sources to better understand Ren's work. This included speaking with his mother and studying a barely-read film script that had been completed just before his death, according to co-curator and director of KWM Art Center, Zhang Yuling.\u000a\u000a"(Ren) told me that he takes himself more seriously as a writer than a photographer," Zhang said in a phone interview. "He'd just finished writing a film script, so he sent it to me and asked for my suggestions. Like every young writer, this (early output) is basically an autobiography, so the story told me more about him."\u000a\u000aThe images selected for "19 Photographs" feature tropes associated with the late photographer, including outdoor portraits and the use of living animals. But they also present a subtlety often overlooked in his output, according to Crowley.\u000a\u000a"If people are expecting to see very controversial works, then they'll probably be quite disappointed," he said. "The show's not really about that. It's a conscious attempt to give the audience a better idea of his process of making a photograph."\u000a\u000aFor Zhang, this process is characterized by the way Ren interacted with his subjects.\u000a\u000a"We wanted to choose photos that emphasize how Ren Hang used human body as a compositional element," she said in a phone interview. "We wanted (to offer) a perspective that shows his very special aesthetic."\u000a\u000aMore than legacy\u000a\u000aInstead of using professional models, Ren usually picked subjects from among his friends, family and Beijing's creative community. This included 30-year-old Hannie Yang, a "friend-of-a-friend" who modeled for him in 2010.\u000a\u000aWhile the photos featured in the exhibition contain tropes often associated with Ren's work, like the use of animals, the curators hope to shine a new light on the late photographer's work.\u000a\u000aFar from the provocative figure pictured in the media, Yang remembers a friendly, unpretentious photographer who made her feel at ease. While suggesting that Ren's work walked the fine line between art and pornography, she suggests that upsetting social norms was, if anything, an inconvenience.\u000a\u000a"We were doing one part of the shoot in front of the window," she recalled, "and (Ren) said, 'while you're posing, look around, because I've been in trouble so many times from neighbors seeing nude people and reporting me.'"\u000a\u000aOur posthumous understanding of Ren's work is not simply about his legacy, according to the director and CEO of the Australian Centre for Photography , Cherie McNair. Death has introduced the photographer's work to new audiences, with McNair claiming that the photographer was "largely unknown" in Australia before his suicide.\u000a\u000a"The (media coverage) following his death became more about the censorship debate in China than about his commitment to making his art, regardless of which political system he was in," McNair said in a phone interview.\u000a\u000a"I think a much more interesting discussion is about where his photography was going. His work was becoming more sophisticated -- like the locations, which moved from indoor images to these amazing outdoor shoots.\u000a\u000a"The posthumous positioning of his work and subsequent interrogation is interesting, particularly as the artist is no longer present to provide context."

aV(CNN) The Italian fans' seven-year wait for a Ferrari victory at Monza continues, after Lewis Hamilton cruised to victory in the sun to take the overall championship lead from Sebastian Vettel.\u000a\u000aWith the conditions a far cry from yesterday's wet and blustery qualifying rounds, it was a bad day for the Italian "tifosi" who, in truth, had very little to cheer on a day of Ferrari struggles.\u000a\u000aConversely, it was a veritable stroll in the park for Mercedes, the speed of both vehicles leading Hamilton to declare "the car was perfect today" in the drivers' room post-race.\u000a\u000aMind games with Vettel, perhaps, with the Brit also all too happy to announce he was "cruising" for large parts of the race.\u000a\u000aNo one does a podium ceremony quite like Monza \U0001f64c #ItalianGP \U0001f1ee\U0001f1f9 #F1 pic.twitter.com/Ju3mxOfIyR\u000a\u000aMercedes' perfect afternoon was rounded off by Valtteri Bottas coming in second for a team one-two.\u000a\u000aThe crowd below the podium -- a vast swathe of red shirts, flags and flares -- were all too delighted to make their feelings known as Hamilton began to speak into the microphone.\u000a\u000a"Mercedes power is definitely better than Ferrari power," he declared with a wry smile, enticing another cacophony of boos from the baying crowd below.\u000a\u000a"I love it here in Italy and I love the passion of the fans. They're fantastic. I'm happy, we did a great job, the team did an exceptional job. We owe it all to them.\u000a\u000a"It's been a great day and result for us."\u000a\u000aVettel has never lost a championship which he has lead at any stage, but he will need to come from behind to continue that record with Hamilton opening up a three point lead.\u000a\u000aIt also marked Hamilton's fourth win at Monza, putting him just one behind another of Michael Schumacher's records.\u000a\u000aThe race\u000a\u000aHamilton's race got off to a perfect start, defending his record 69th pole position under intense pressure from Esteban Ocon and Lance Stroll.\u000a\u000aBottas quickly set about moving up the field, taking very little time to pass three cars and eventually tuck in behind his teammate.\u000a\u000aUPDATED DRIVER STANDINGS \U0001f3c6@LewisHamilton is now leading the championship for the first time this season! #ItalianGP \U0001f1ee\U0001f1f9 #F1 pic.twitter.com/KantdrUHhx \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) September 3, 2017\u000a\u000aHamilton suffered a minor scare on lap 20, going a little too hard on the throttle, oversteering and dipping his left front wing into the gravel.\u000a\u000aThough that was the only incident on an otherwise quiet and straightforward afternoon, of which there surely won't be many more for the remainder of the calendar.\u000a\u000aVettel, meanwhile, struggled for pace from the start but did still manage to climb from sixth to third -- a position he held onto till the end.\u000a\u000aThe podium finish for the German will come as some consolation, though finishing 36 seconds behind Hamilton gives an indication of the struggles Ferrari faced.\u000a\u000a"It was entertaining," Vettel said on the podium. "My start was not so good and it took a while for me to trust the car. After that we were a bit isolated, we didn't have the pace of the leading two drivers.\u000a\u000a"Even if this race has been difficult, I know we have a strong car and will have a strong end to the season."\u000a\u000aBy the time lap 20 came around, Hamilton's lap times were almost a second faster than Vettel's, which also put the German in danger of being caught by Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo.\u000a\u000aStarted: P16\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFinished: P4 \U0001f44f\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYou voted @danielricciardo as your #F1DriverOfTheDay at the #ItalianGP \U0001f1ee\U0001f1f9 pic.twitter.com/m3jU8CXTUM \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) September 3, 2017\u000a\u000aAs he did last week, the Aussie put in a sensational drive, climbing 13 places inside the opening 15 laps to end lap 36 in third.\u000a\u000aVettel eventually regained the final podium place after Ricciardo's pit stop, but that didn't stop him from trying to wrestle it back.\u000a\u000a"Your lap time is one second faster than Vettel," was the information given to Ricciardo through his radio on lap 43. "He's 11 (seconds) up the road, let's get after him."\u000a\u000aIn the end, however, the race was just one lap too short for him to regain third.\u000a\u000aDespite barely breaking a sweat, Hamilton remained cautious when asked if taking the championship lead for the first time in 2017 now gave him the edge.\u000a\u000a"The last two races have been incredibly strong. We've just gone from strength to strength," he said, after recording the first back-to-back wins of any driver this season.\u000a\u000a"It's still close and a long way to go. Ferrari should be quick at the next circuit ... so the fight continues."

aVHow Immunotherapy Treats Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma By Marijke Vroomen Durning, RN\u000a\u000aWas this helpful? ( 30 )\u000a\u000aWe don\u2019t seem to hear a lot about kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), but it\u2019s among the 10 most common cancers in the United States. Over 60,000 people every year in the U.S. are diagnosed with it. Unfortunately, because most symptoms don\u2019t become obvious until the tumors are larger, many people are diagnosed with kidney cancer only after it has progressed to later stages, when it is called advanced renal cell carcinoma.\u000a\u000aFor many years, treatment options for advanced renal cell carcinoma were limited. Traditional chemotherapy isn\u2019t as effective on advanced renal cell carcinoma as it is on other types of cancer and when it is effective, the cancer often returns within a few years and is more difficult to treat.\u000a\u000a2017 Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. All rights reserved. May not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUsing Immunotherapy to Fight Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma\u000a\u000aImmunotherapy, also called biologic therapy or biotherapy, is a treatment that uses your immune system to fight a disease it normally might not recognize, such as cancer. The therapy can do this by stimulating your immune system to attack cancer cells or tumors, or by giving you specific immune system proteins that will act on the cells. One of the biggest advantages of immunotherapy over chemotherapy is immunotherapy attacks only the cancer cells without affecting the healthy cells in the body, reducing the number and severity of possible side effects.\u000a\u000aTypes of Immunotherapy\u000a\u000aResearch into different types of immunotherapy is ongoing. Currently there are four main types that can be used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma and even more are being studied.\u000a\u000aImmune checkpoint inhibitors: Tumor genes can express proteins that fool the immune system to think no threat is present. Immune checkpoint inhibitors help your immune system by blocking these proteins. The reawakened immune system can recognize the cancer cells and directly attack them. Because your immune system is looking for these specific tumor proteins, it doesn\u2019t attack healthy cells. There are different classes of checkpoint inhibitors, depending on what part of the cell they target. Checkpoint inhibitors currently used for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma include nivolumab (Opdivo) and iIpilimumab (Yervoy).\u000a\u000aAngiogenesis inhibitors: Some cancer tumors grow by developing new blood vessels, which allow the tumors to gather the nutrients they need. Immunotherapy agents called angiogenesis inhibitors stop the tumors\u2019 ability to do this. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is one of the angiogenesis inhibitors used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma.\u000a\u000aTargeted therapies: Targeted therapies allow drugs to directly block enzymes tumors use to grow and multiply. These targeted therapies include sunitinib (Sutent), pazopanib (Votrient) and everolimus (Afinitor), among others. While these are not technically immunotherapies, they are often put together in this group because of the way they target the cancer cells.\u000a\u000aTherapeutic vaccines. Most of us are familiar with the traditional vaccines we use to prevent illnesses, such as polio and tetanus. Therapeutic vaccines work differently and are given to patients who have a disease rather than to prevent it. When a therapeutic vaccine is given to someone with a disease like advanced renal cell carcinoma, it triggers the immune system to fight against it. These vaccines are still in clinical trials, but results are promising.\u000a\u000aImmunotherapy Side Effects\u000a\u000aAs with all medications, immunotherapy can cause side effects in some people. However because immunotherapy targets the cancer cells alone, the risk of side effects is lower than with chemotherapy. And if side effects do occur, they are generally less severe. Side effects can include:\u000a\u000aWas this helpful? ( 30 )

The bonus track premiered exclusively on Shazam, where fans could unlock the song for several hours on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aIt's no coincidence that the album is being released in the fall, just as Halloween is approaching.\u000a\u000a"The choice of tracks for SCREAM reflects The King of Pop's affection for this time of the year and its themes of costumes and disguise, darkness and light, character transformations and surprise," the press release said.\u000a\u000aIn addition to streaming, the album will also be available in CD and glow-in-dark vinyl (which will be available October 27), each containing a poster unique to the format. The poster and cover art conceal the first ever augmented reality experience created for a Michael Jackson project.\u000a\u000aRead More

"I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they're so committed to what they do. They're really devoted and hardworking."\u000a\u000aWhile those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style.\u000a\u000a"My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way," she said. "I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, 'I'd love a portrait of you and your cow,' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they're so passionate about what they do."\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) A Salt Lake City, Utah, detective who arrested a nurse after she refused to let officers draw blood from an unconscious patient has been fired from his job as a part-time paramedic.\u000a\u000aDetective Jeff Payne's July arrest of Alex Wubbels, the charge nurse at the University of Utah Hospital burn unit, was captured on bodycam video and later drew national attention, prompting apologies from Salt Lake City's mayor and police.\u000a\u000aGold Cross Ambulance said Tuesday that Payne's termination was effective immediately.\u000a\u000aThe Salt Lake City police has placed Payne and another officer on administrative leave pending the results of an investigation.\u000a\u000aPayne's firing from his paramedic job comes a day after the University of Utah Hospital announced a new protocol: Nurses will no longer be allowed to interact with law enforcement agents.\u000a\u000a"I need to make sure this never, ever, ever happens to another one of our care providers again," said Margaret Pearce, chief nursing officer at the hospital.\u000a\u000aInstead of interacting with nurses, law enforcement officers will be directed to health supervisors "who are highly trained on rules and laws," and those interactions won't take place in patient care areas, officials said.\u000a\u000aThe new protocol was implemented two weeks after the incident, and so far, 2,500 nurses have been trained in it, Pearce said.\u000a\u000aHospital CEO Gordon Crabtree described Wubbels as an "Olympic-sized hero," praising her for acting with the highest level of integrity and professionalism, even as she risked her own safety to ensure the privacy of her patient.\u000a\u000a"This type of situation won't happen again," he said. "We simply will not let Alex down."\u000a\u000a'I've done nothing wrong!'\u000a\u000aCiting hospital policy, Wubbels on July 26 refused to let officers draw blood from an unconscious crash victim who had been admitted to the hospital's burn unit in a coma. The man was not a suspect in the wreck, which killed another driver, but police asked for his blood to be drawn.\u000a\u000aWubbels presented the officers with a printout of the hospital's policy for drawing blood and said their request did not meet the criteria. Hospital policy specified that before obtaining a blood sample, police needed a judge's order or the patient's consent, or the patient needed to be under arrest.\u000a\u000aThe university and Salt Lake City police had agreed to the policy more than a year ago, but "the officers here appeared to be unaware of" it during the July incident, Wubbels' attorney, Karra Porter, said Friday.\u000a\u000aAfter the nurse's refusal, the video shows Payne walk quickly over to Wubbels, who backs away as he says, "Oh, please. We're done here. We're done. We're done."\u000a\u000aWubbels shrieks as Payne forces her out the door toward a police car. She screams for him to stop, saying, "I've done nothing wrong! I've done nothing wrong! Why is this happening? This is crazy!" She also asks why the officer is "so angry."\u000a\u000aPayne handcuffed Wubbels and placed her in a police car, where she sat for about 20 minutes, according to CNN affiliate KSL . She was later released without charge.\u000a\u000aIn a police report, Payne said that when he arrived at the hospital, Wubbels said he needed to get permission from the hospital administrators.\u000a\u000aAfter more than an hour of waiting, Payne said, he called his supervisor, who advised him to arrest Wubbels if she refused to let him draw a blood sample.\u000a\u000a"I told them we wanted to blood sample to protect him, not punish him," he wrote.\u000a\u000a'I stood my ground'\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Wubbels and Porter discussed how the confrontation unfolded on CNN's "New Day."\u000a\u000aWhile legal action is under consideration, "I think we're going to give everyone involved an opportunity to do the right thing without having to be dragged into court to do it," the lawyer said.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Shocking video shows nurse arrested on the job Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Shocking video shows nurse arrested on the job 02:19\u000a\u000aWubbels said she managed to get the bodycam video weeks ago but waited to release it until she felt composed enough to talk about what happened.\u000a\u000a"I feel pretty strongly in just having, sort of, a good strong ability to stand up without emotion. And I need to afford myself some time to feel OK and to be able to talk pragmatically about the situation without the emotion," she said.\u000a\u000aWubbels said she has no idea how the situation escalated.\u000a\u000a"What I can say is that I stood my ground. I stood for what was right, which was to protect the patient. As a nurse, any nurse, I think, would have done exactly what I did," she said.\u000a\u000aWubbels said she was "scared to death" at the time.\u000a\u000a"Obviously, I was very frightened, and I think that since this has happened, I've been able to, sort of, surmise that I feel betrayed," she said. "I feel betrayed by the police officers. I feel betrayed by my university police and security."\u000a\u000aWubbels asked hospital security for help "to have someone protect me because I felt unsafe from Officer Payne from the beginning," she said.\u000a\u000aHow did the university police and security respond? "By just standing there, looking at their phones," she said, "telling me that they couldn't protect me."

aVNew York (CNN) Kayla Mueller, Peter Kassig, Alan Henning, David Haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by ISIS in the past year.\u000a\u000aThe exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive. What we do know is ISIS holds at least one female aid worker, and possibly more. The International Federation of the Red Cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in October 2013 remain missing, but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them.\u000a\u000aAbductions and killings of aid workers are, unfortunately, nothing new, but the numbers are. According to Aidworkersecurity.org, at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013, a 121% increase on 70 recorded killings the year before.\u000a\u000aNot all were victims of ISIS, a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled Syria. In fact, according to the same report, it is the Taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers, in large part in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aHere's the difference: ISIS is changing the game. The Taliban may have many reasons for abductions (flexing their muscles, negotiating prisoner releases), but they also have a record of frequent hostage release. The need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters, or mattered.\u000a\u000aPhotos: The ISIS terror threat Photos: The ISIS terror threat Wounded passengers are treated following a suicide bombing at the Brussels Airport on March 22, 2016.

Abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income (ISIS demanded at least $6 million for Kayla Mueller, and reportedly $200 million for two Japanese hostages) or, failing that, their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness. So far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by ISIS is extremely low, save for those whose ransoms were paid. The freeing of 19 kidnapped Assyrian Christians shocked many, because release is not a common part of ISIS' playbook.\u000a\u000aThese tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide, who may look to emulate ISIS' model of abduction and violence. One example is West African extremist group Boko Haram, which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies, an approach disturbingly similar to ISIS'.\u000a\u000a"Humanitarian work has always been risky, but it's never been more dangerous than it is now," says Caryl Stern, president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF . "There used to be a time when an organization's flag provided a great deal of protection. That's no longer the case."\u000a\u000aThe response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of Syria and its environs altogether, but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers. Still, outside workers like Mueller, Kassig, Henning and Haines were inside Syria when they were taken, and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations. Not only that, but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency, local staffers become bait. Indeed, the majority of victims have been working in their own countries.\u000a\u000aISIS doesn't just target aid workers. Journalists, soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list. But in the Wild West that is Syria and its borders, few of these remain, save for aid workers. In a space devoid of government, refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities, the new front line in the war on terror, a sometimes unwelcome association. And as ISIS spreads beyond Syria's borders, the risks grow further afield.\u000a\u000aYet despite these risks, thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million. While some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection, many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit. Their security and locations for the most part are under constant review.\u000a\u000aWhen CNN approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences, and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level, many declined, in large part due to security concerns. For this reason, some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous.\u000a\u000aSenior relief director for NGO working in the Syria region\u000a\u000aIf I think back, I've been doing this work for about 20 years, and I remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection, some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much, much more difficult; we're asking people to put themselves in harm's way in some circumstances.

I'm very selective about where I say I go. I need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that's here, not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people I'm responsible for in this region.\u000a\u000aI don't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one, two, three times -- who don't see a future for their children... Someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security, and I mean that in the personal sense of a mother who, when she goes to sleep at night with her children, she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day.\u000a\u000aMark Ohanian, International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) director of programs\u000a\u000aFear is always there in the back of everyone's mind. We just need to continue what we're doing, stopping is not an option, halting our operations is not an option, and we are taking great risks, our staff are taking great risks.\u000a\u000aIt is a difficult thing to tell family, to tell colleagues. Oftentimes I just don't mention all the details of where I go because they just don't need to know. But it needs to be done, we also can't run an operation remotely. ... I'm not going to the front lines, I'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we're not adrenaline driven people. We want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks, but it's about calculated risks. We don't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger.\u000a\u000aIf we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security, morale, pressure from here, pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place. There's not going to be another organization that's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that IOCC may create, that's not going to happen. So that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization; we feel that responsibility that we've got to deliver on this thing.\u000a\u000aDima (last name withheld), aid worker, IOCC\u000a\u000aThere's an internal motivation that keeps you going. You feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance, and know it's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service. So yes, you need be of course strong, motivated, passionate, and of course feel the need to assist and deliver.\u000a\u000aMichael Bowers, senior director for strategic response and emergencies, Mercy Corps\u000a\u000aIt's an unprecedented time, and what we're calling the new normal ... as we've seen in the last year, the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups, who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we're not the U.S. Army, we don't have a physical ability to repel.\u000a\u000aThere may be in people's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance: like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car, you'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community. I think that golden age is more myth than reality, but regarding today's reality it's extremely dangerous it's so true. And your flag, your neutrality, your white car, all the good intention you have, that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies.\u000a\u000aThere's a phrase that the U.N. uses and a lot of NGOs use which is "stay and deliver," so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there, but we always have to be in a risk management role; we have to critically look at: do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get?\u000a\u000aThe fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends, and that has more of a toll, I think, with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly, sometimes I don't tell them till I'm already on my way so I don't have to have those calls before I even get on an airplane. It's hard; there are some areas where the family and friends don't understand why you're going there, and you re-articulate, "If not you, then who?" and you ask, "Would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened?"

For more visit Definitive Design.\u000a\u000aNew York (CNN) A one-stop inspiration shop for design lovers and neophytes alike, the website Sight Unseen (and its highly addictive Instagram profile) has a devoted, international following of the aesthetically inclined.\u000a\u000aSince its launch in 2009, the magazine has become a popular destination for discovering independent design talent. Meanwhile, its founders Monica Khesurov and Jill Singer have established themselves as trusted tastemakers credited with helping to reposition New York on the design circuit.\u000a\u000aThis is in no small part thanks to "Sight Unseen Offsite ," the website's annual design expo during NYCxDesign , which has become a coveted platform for both emerging and more established designers.\u000a\u000aNow in its fourth edition, this year's Offsite will showcase a slimmed-down selection of 25 designers (compared to 70 last year), in addition to a group exhibition of 21 international names. "We decided to mindfully shrink the show this year," says Singer, "We wanted to go back to something a bit more pure and focused."\u000a\u000aKhemsurov notes that while the duo has in recent years gained a reputation for having a "young, fun aesthetic, which mingled a bit with this Memphis design resurgence, shapes, squiggles, and bright colors," they never intended to be exclusively associated with one type of look.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVKate Williams is a professor of history at the University of Reading, the author of "Young Elizabeth" and a CNN royal commentator and contributor. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) In the early hours of August 31, 1997, the media began reporting that Diana, Princess of Wales, had been injured in a car crash in the Pont l'Alma tunnel in Paris. By 4:45 am, news channels were citing sources who claimed Diana had died .\u000a\u000aMembers of Britain's royal family were on their annual summer break at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. They issued a statement at 5:25: "The Queen and Prince Philip are deeply shocked and distressed by this terrible news. Other members of the royal family are being informed of the Princess's death."\u000a\u000aThey thought this would be enough.\u000a\u000aBut the royals made a grave error in how they reacted to the news of Diana's death -- one that lost them public respect at the time and has taken nearly two decades to regain.\u000a\u000aAs the news spread, a wave of grief swept across the world , taking everyone by surprise -- most of all the royals. Politicians struggled for the words to describe her death. Her brother, Earl Spencer, paid tribute from South Africa and talked about how it seemed as though the press had taken "a direct hand in her death." And Prime Minister Tony Blair began referring to her as the "People's Princess."\u000a\u000aThe royals, other than releasing an initial brief statement, stayed silent and remained in Balmoral.\u000a\u000aAs far as they were concerned, Diana simply wasn't part of the family anymore. She had divorced Prince Charles and given up the title of her royal highness. In their view, the routine and the behavior that would follow if a senior member of the royal family had died simply did not apply here.\u000a\u000aWhere the royals went wrong\u000a\u000aThe Queen 's attitude in moments of crisis has always been "keep calm and carry on." It has stood her well through a turbulent life -- her uncle's abdication, World War II, her father's early death and her abrupt accession to the throne.\u000a\u000aBut in this crisis, it was an error. People felt the royals were insulting Diana -- and even royalist newspapers, such as the Daily Express, demanded her presence in London. As they put it: " Show us You Care.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Prince Harry: They took photos as Diana was dying Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Prince Harry: They took photos as Diana was dying 00:58\u000a\u000aTo the public, Diana was a princess and mother of the future king. As many saw it, she had been poorly treated by the royals and Charles -- and the royal response to her death only made things worse.\u000a\u000aPoliticians and courtiers, who could sense the growing resentment, pushed the royals to take further action -- and a ceremonial funeral was planned.\u000a\u000aThe Queen went on television on the eve of the funeral to give a deeply emotional address, telling everyone how members of the royal family had been grieving, how they had been focusing on the princes.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Diana's influence on the HIV/AIDS battle Replay More Videos ...

It was an alien way of speaking for the Queen -- a war child who kept her emotions to herself.\u000a\u000aHowever, the most memorable words of the funeral and that period were not the Queen's, but the funeral oration of her brother, who spoke of his family's grief and talked of how Diana was "a symbol of selfless humanity" and a "standard bearer for the suffering."\u000a\u000aHe pointed out the horrific irony that the girl given the name of the Roman goddess of hunting "became the most hunted person of the modern age," and ended by telling the world her "beauty, both internal and external, will never be extinguished in our minds."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Diana's hands-on mothering broke royal tradition Replay More Videos ...

But there was no lying in state -- whereas the Queen Mother would lie in state for three days in Westminster Hall on her death in 2002 and more than 200,000 people visited.\u000a\u000aStrictly speaking, this was only for the monarch and the queen consort, or the wife of a king, as well as some prime ministers. However, many Brits thought Diana would one day have been the queen consort, and so she deserved it. Certainly, a lying in state, even for a day, would have gone some way toward appeasing the public anger. The princes were also told by the palace that they had to walk behind their mother's coffin. Earl Spencer objected to this order, saying, "Diana just would not want them to do this." But he was, as he said earlier this year, "'lied to" and told that walking was the princes' wish.\u000a\u000aPrince Harry reiterated as much and told Newsweek magazine this year, "I don't think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances."\u000a\u000aTwenty years later\u000a\u000aIn the immediate aftermath of Diana's death, the royal family had made a grave mistake -- and though the Queen's words on the eve of the funeral and the funeral itself helped to improve the royals' standing a bit -- it would take some time before the country could forgive them.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Prince Harry on how he dealt with mom's death Replay More Videos ...

But, even today, Diana is still present in the public imagination. And the royal family will always be seen, and perhaps even judged, in terms of her life and death.

aV(CNN) "I've been on the low / I been taking my time / I feel like I'm out of my mind / It feel like my life ain't mine / Who can relate?"\u000a\u000aThe opening lines of Logic 's most successful song to date are, quite literally, a cry for help. The title of the track, " 1-800-273-8255 ," is the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\u000a\u000aIn a series of tweets the week the song was released, the 27-year-old rapper explained the motivation behind his music. "Over the years so many of you guys have told me that my music has helped you through so many tough times," he wrote. "Many of you have told me its even saved your life. I'm beyond humbled. But I felt I haven't done enough. ... I made this song for all of you who are in a dark place and can't seem to find the light."\u000a\u000aOver the years so many of you guys have told me that my music has helped you through so many tough times.\u000a\u000aMany of you have told me its even saved your life. I'm beyond humbled. But I felt I haven't done enough.\u000a\u000aI made this song for all of you who are in a dark place and can't seem to find the light.\u000a\u000aLogic found himself in his "dark place" in late 2015, according to an interview with the New York Post.\u000a\u000a"I was so scared because I was thought I had to work, work, work, because I thought I might only be around for five years," Logic said. "I thought I wasn't good enough to last."\u000a\u000aLogic found his proverbial "light" by learning the power of one word to deal with his anxiety: no.\u000a\u000a"I turn down really well-paid shows all over the world because I want to spend more time with my wife and myself," he told the Post. "I could sit here and think, 'I got all these people around me that I need to pay,' which is true ... but ain't nobody getting paid if I'm dead."\u000a\u000aLogic performed Sunday night on MTV's 2017 Video Music Awards.\u000a\u000aThe first verse of "1-800" is sung from the perspective of a person who has given up on their life and is ready to end it. The second verse, fronted by Alessia Cara , showcases the response of a suicide hotline crisis worker.\u000a\u000a"It's holding on though the road's long / And seeing light in the darkest things / And when you stare at your reflection / Finally knowing who it is / I know that you'll thank God you did"\u000a\u000aThe song ends with a verse featuring Khalid , again from the perspective of the suicidal caller but who now realizes the endless possibilities of the future.\u000a\u000a"I don't wanna cry anymore / I wanna feel alive / I don't even wanna die anymore / Oh I don't wanna / I don't wanna / I don't even wanna die anymore"\u000a\u000aAs part of a contest to be featured on the cover of Logic's album "Everybody," fans submitted videos detailing how much the the rapper's music means to them. He shared some of them on Twitter.\u000a\u000aI'm excited to partner with @800273Talk on the release tonight. pic.twitter.com/GZhaBvaCKY \u2014 Bobby Tarantino (@Logic301) April 27, 2017\u000a\u000a"When I was alone with myself, the stress was unlike any other time of the day," said Faith Martinez, 18, fighting back tears. "I'd put my headphones in, and it would all subside, because I knew that there was someone out there that cared for their fans so much that if I took away my life the way I had thought about, he would be hurt, and somebody would care that I was gone.\u000a\u000a"I put it on until the end, and I stood up, and I kept going," she said. "His music helps people keep going, and I'll forever be grateful for that."\u000a\u000aJohn Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, said, "The impact has been pretty extraordinary. On the day the song was released, we had the second-highest call volume in the history of our service." Overall, calls to the hotline are up roughly 33% from this time last year.\u000a\u000a"We can certainly attribute and have seen call increases relative to tragic events and alarming portrayals of suicide in the media -- anywhere from (musicians) Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington 's suicides, and (the Netflix show) ' 13 Reasons Why ,' " Draper said. "But here's what's really important: Logic is generating calls with a song about getting help and finding hope. It's not focusing on tragedy or suicide. In fact, he's starting conversations about suicide prevention, as opposed to suicide."\u000a\u000aThe video for "1-800," released last week by Def Jam Recordings and Visionary Music Group , has racked up more than 15 million views on YouTube. The seven-minute short film illustrates the story of a young man, beginning when he is just a baby.\u000a\u000aHis happy childhood is followed by difficulties in high school -- extreme bullying and struggling to come to terms with his sexual identity -- which cause serious strife with his friends and family. One day, he decides he's had enough, collapses in tears and raises a gun to his head, ready to pull the trigger -- but he doesn't. Instead, he calls the suicide hotline.\u000a\u000aThe story flashes forward to the man's wedding, where his father is standing by his side. The plot comes full circle, ending with the birth of his own son.\u000a\u000aThe message: It gets better. It always gets better.\u000a\u000a"In many ways, Logic's video and song completely embody this message that everybody can take an action to prevent suicide," Draper said. "A lot of people think that it requires a professional or even a hotline. But the fact is that while those are extremely helpful -- and I would always counsel somebody to consider those options -- what we also know is that most suicides are prevented by people being caring with one another.\u000a\u000a"How, when a person in your life is in crisis, can you help them get through it?"\u000a\u000aLogic delivered a powerful performance of his hit song Sunday night on MTV's 2017 Video Music Awards . On stage with him were suicide attempt survivors, wearing T-shirts with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline's phone number and the message "You are not alone."\u000a\u000aThe lifeline reported a 50% increase in call volume after the show.\u000a\u000aIf you suspect someone may be at risk: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any \ufb01rearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

"We want to do more than remember these artists. We want to remind people that suicide is preventable and that there are ways to get help and feel better if you're struggling emotionally.\u000a\u000a"Logic's song '1-800-273-8255' is not only a phenomenal track, but it has struck a chord with its inspiring message of hope, and we are honored to offer the VMA platform so it can reach even more young people."\u000a\u000aDraper said, "It's not just about the calls; it's about increasing awareness about suicide, and suicide prevention in particular.

You can sign up for the Global Briefing newsletter here.\u000a\u000aWere it not for Donald Trump, the latest Pew Research findings would make dismal reading for Vladimir Putin.

The median score for those saying his country abuses civil liberties was 46%.\u000a\u000aEdward Lucas\u000a\u000aIn only three of the 37 countries surveyed did a majority of those polled have a favorable opinion of Russia -- Vietnam (83%), Greece (64%) and the Philippines (55%).\u000a\u000aThat is a dismal return on nearly 20 years of Kremlin efforts to increase its power and influence. Most of the world is not even scared of Russia -- in most countries, it ranks roughly alongside China as a major threat. In a Pew survey earlier this month , Americans named it the fourth biggest threat, behind ISIS, cyber attacks and climate change. Only in Poland and Jordan do people put Russia in the top three threats facing their country.\u000a\u000aThe good news for Russia, though, is that for many of those polled in Africa, Asia and Europe, the United States is seen as no better than Russia. In most countries, the man in the Kremlin is more trusted than the American President. In Germany, for example, Putin out-polls Trump by 25% to 11%.\u000a\u000aRead More

(When's the last time you heard him talk about Tiffany, his daughter with ex-wife Marla Maples, never mind trot her out before a crowd of voters?) Ivanka and her husband are official White House advisors -- and two of the President's closest.\u000a\u000aIvanka Trump presents herself on social media and elsewhere as socially progressive.

This was perhaps never more clearly seen than in her father's bumbling post-Charlottesville attack statements. After all, if ever there was a time for Trump's Jewish daughter to sway her father to moderation, it was then. Instead, he chose to defend the "good" people among the white supremacist crowd.\u000a\u000aBut then, how much pull could we actually expect her to have with a man who refers to himself as her "Daddy?" The moniker, used in relation to a person on one's senior staff, is unprofessional at best, demeaning and infantilizing at worst.\u000a\u000aTrump is known for off-the-cuff, ill-worded remarks, even when it comes to his daughter. ("If Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her," he declared in 2016. ) And if he does, in fact, view her as his eternal little girl in some way, it wouldn't be all that uncommon among fathers, even the most evolved of whom can have a hard time seeing their girls as women.\u000a\u000aOne could argue that sometimes, "Daddy" is just a name, a term of endearment -- not an indication of some perceived immaturity.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Ivanka Trump sits in for dad at G20 meeting Replay More Videos ...

Having a Commander in Chief refer to himself as the "Daddy" of a 35-year-old woman, having him assert that she -- one of his most important advisors -- pleadingly called him that as she asked be taken along on a trip, is off-putting to say the least.\u000a\u000aWe don't know how she felt about being a character in his "Daddy" story -- many daughters would be mortified. But by parading her in this way, he not only risks people not taking her, or women in general, seriously -- he does the same to himself. Behind every powerful woman is her ... daddy?

aVHow A Checkpoint Inhibitor Works to Fight Metastatic Melanoma By Erin Azuse\u000a\u000aWas this helpful? ( 11 )\u000a\u000aYour immune system has an important job. Not only must it attack harmful cells to protect you from getting sick, it must also recognize your body\u2019s own cells so it leaves them alone. In some cases, however, cancer cells can trick the immune system, so they escape the attack and continue to grow.\u000a\u000aA newer method of cancer treatment called immunotherapy hopes to change that. Researchers are learning how to help the immune system fight against cancer cells. For patients with metastatic melanoma, a cancer that usually starts on the skin and spreads to other locations of the body, a type of immunotherapy known as a checkpoint inhibitor has demonstrated some exciting results.\u000a\u000a2017 Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. All rights reserved. May not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aT cells contain the on/off switch for your immune response.\u000a\u000aT cells, or T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell and an important part of your immune system. As they circulate throughout your body, they help differentiate between normal and abnormal cells. When the T cell comes across an abnormal cell, it \u201cturns on\u201d the immune response and attempts to destroy it. Conversely, when the T cell comes across a healthy cell, the immune response is suppressed or \u201cturned off\u201d. This is known as a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d and is how your body protects itself from harming its own cells and tissues.\u000a\u000aYet some cancer cells are able to evade destruction by hacking these same checkpoints to inactivate the T-cell. They disguise themselves so that the T cell sees them as normal cells. This turns off or lessens the immune system\u2019s response to the cancer cells, allowing them to thrive.\u000a\u000aCheckpoint inhibitors help keep the T cells from turning off.\u000a\u000aCheckpoint inhibitors, a class of medications used to treat cancer, do just what their name implies. They block the cancer cells from using the checkpoint to turn off the T cells. This allows the T cells to see the cancer cells for what they truly are and helps the immune system mount a full attack.\u000a\u000aRight now, two types of checkpoint inhibitors are used to fight metastatic melanoma, PD-1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Each class refers to the specific checkpoint protein that the medication targets. Researchers are currently studying other checkpoints and trying to develop new checkpoint inhibitors to boost the body\u2019s immune response to cancer.\u000a\u000aThey do so with good reason. Historically, metastatic melanoma has had a very poor prognosis. Yet with the development of checkpoint inhibitors, studies have shown improvements in overall survival rate and tumor regression for many individuals.\u000a\u000aEffects of treatment are usually not immediate.\u000a\u000aIt is not uncommon for it to take 6 to 12 weeks or longer for the checkpoint inhibitors to begin to work. Additionally, some patients may even see an increase in tumor size early on in treatment. This may be due to the larger number of activated T cells and immune cells that are present. After some time, however, the tumor may begin to shrink or even disappear.\u000a\u000aThe immune system boost can sometimes be too big.\u000a\u000aIn some cases, the use of checkpoint inhibitors can cause the body to attack its own tissues as well, known as an autoimmune response. Patients should be monitored carefully and instructed to contact their doctor if any side effects develop. Usually this can be reversed with a round of steroids or a temporary break in treatment, but for some patients it can lead to serious complications.\u000a\u000aThere is not one right way to treat metastatic melanoma, or any form of cancer for that matter, since individual responses to different forms of treatment will vary. Yet it is exciting to see new therapies provide patients live longer and enjoy a higher quality of life. Don\u2019t hesitate to talk to your doctor if you would like to learn more about checkpoint inhibitors and other emerging treatments for melanoma.\u000a\u000aWas this helpful? ( 11 )

aVPresident Trump risks doing more harm than good with his latest rhetoric over North Korea.\u000a\u000aAfter Kim Jong Un's regime carried out its biggest nuclear test so far on Sunday, Trump fired off a series of tweets, including a warning that he's considering "stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea."\u000a\u000aThe extraordinary remark was clearly aimed at China, which accounts for roughly 90% of North Korea's international trade.\u000a\u000aExperts were quick to point out that halting commerce between America and China is virtually impossible.\u000a\u000a"This isn't even in the realm of the remotely plausible," said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who specializes in trade. "Even assuming trade with these countries could be cut off it would cause enormous damage to the U.S. economy."\u000a\u000aRelated: Trump's 'fire and fury' rhetoric met with defiance by Kim Jong Un\u000a\u000aBy issuing a warning that his administration couldn't enforce, Trump undermines the credibility of U.S. government statements on North Korea and other delicate issues, analysts say.\u000a\u000a"First rule of diplomacy is never make a threat you can't carry out," tweeted Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director for the Americas at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\u000a\u000aA $650 billion relationship\u000a\u000aTrade between the U.S. and China was worth nearly $650 billion in 2016. China is the U.S.'s largest trading partner in goods, supplying products such as iPhones and toys as well as machinery and parts vital for American industry. It also buys a lot of U.S. farm produce like soybeans and high value exports such as Boeing (BA) passenger jets.\u000a\u000aThe world's top two economies also do a huge amount of trade with other countries, and that would be thrown into chaos by any attempt to stop shipments between the U.S. and China.\u000a\u000aWhat's more, Washington depends on Beijing's cash: China is the American government's biggest creditor.\u000a\u000aRelated: What's left to sanction in North Korea after its big nuclear test?\u000a\u000aIn response to Trump's threat, China said Monday it was "unacceptable" and "not fair" to be sanctioned for trading with North Korea when it was working hard to "peacefully resolve" tensions in the Korean peninsula.\u000a\u000a"When the president makes such obviously fantastical statements, the rest of the world is left scratching its head as to the genuine intentions of the administration," said Alden. "The result is an increasingly dangerous uncertainty."\u000a\u000aTrump may believe that unpredictability can be used to pressure China and other countries to play ball on North Korea.\u000a\u000aAntagonizing an ally\u000a\u000aBut at the same time, he is reportedly considering pulling out of a free trade agreement with South Korea, a move that would stoke tensions with a key U.S. ally. On Sunday, he accused the South Korean government of wanting to "appease" North Korea.\u000a\u000a"This is no time to lecture South Korea or suspend free trade agreement. Best way to deter North Korea is to stand firmly with Seoul+Tokyo," tweeted Nicholas Burns, a veteran diplomat who served as under secretary of state for political affairs under President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aRelated: China can squeeze its neighbors when it wants. Ask South Korea\u000a\u000aTrump's bizarre threat to stop "all trade" with countries doing business with Pyongyang highlights his limited choice over how to respond to North Korea's advancing nuclear program.\u000a\u000aEconomic pressure doesn't appear to be having enough of an effect to make Kim change course.\u000a\u000aGoing after Chinese banks?\u000a\u000aRather than cutting off trade with entire countries, as Trump suggested, experts say he may have more success by stepping up his administration's efforts to punish Chinese companies and individuals that deal with Kim's regime.\u000a\u000aTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested Sunday that more such measures are in the works.\u000a\u000aRelated: Mnuchin says 'People need to isolate North Korea'\u000a\u000aTo make a real difference, some analysts argue that the U.S. needs to hit Chinese banks with significant fines for moving North Korean funds through the American financial system.\u000a\u000a-- Tim Schwarz in Beijing contributed to this article.

aV(CNN) Sometimes, you don't know the exact moment when your life has changed.\u000a\u000aFor Monica Schulman, 38, one of the first signs that her health -- her life -- had changed was so slight that it only began to bother her because it kept happening.\u000a\u000a"I was standing in the bathroom, and I kept noticing while I was brushing my teeth that my left side toes kept kind of curling under, and they were getting tense all of a sudden. And I really didn't think anything of it for months, but I kept doing this," said Schulman, of Atlanta, a part-time teacher and a mother of four. "And I was thinking: This is so weird. I don't know why I keep curling my toes under."\u000a\u000aThough it was unusual enough to make her pause, she did not go see a doctor. Schulman took that important step only after noticing another symptom.\u000a\u000aMonica Schulman, a mother of four, was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease when she was 37.\u000a\u000a"I was visiting my sister in New York, who at the time was going through chemo because she got diagnosed with breast cancer, and we would be walking a little bit through Manhattan," Schulman said. "And I kept telling her, 'My left arm is just not swaying!' "\u000a\u000aShe'd never thought about arm movements, but once she experienced it, she knew that something was off: "My arm was just kind of tight, and it was just laying there."\u000a\u000aShe also felt the barest shiver of a tremor that was unnoticeable to other people. She'd gone to the doctor some time ago about a tingling sensation, and he had run some tests -- "I think he was trying to see if I had (multiple sclerosis)" -- but he'd found nothing wrong. "You're fine, you're fine," he told her.\u000a\u000aAfter her trip to New York, she turned to Google before consulting a physician.\u000a\u000a"I pretty much diagnosed myself," Schulman said. "I typed my symptoms in, and everything that popped up that I read was Parkinson's-related."\u000a\u000aA neurological disorder, Parkinson's disease can bring tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, trouble balancing, problems walking and difficulty coordinating movement. These are the obvious symptoms and the reason why Parkinson's is sometimes referred to as a "movement disorder." Yet other symptoms are also common: Patients can experience depression, sleep problems, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\u000a\u000aAfter her Google search, Schulman turned to her family: "And everybody was like, 'You do not have Parkinson's. You're too young.' "\u000a\u000aMost Parkinson's patients are diagnosed around age 58.\u000a\u000a"They're like, 'You're crazy,' " said Schulman. "And I was like, 'I really think I do.' "\u000a\u000aAfter more research, she asked her husband, Jeremy, to help her get in to see In the face of disbelief, Schulman knew that she needed to find the best doctor to validate her self-diagnosis.After more research, she asked her husband, Jeremy, to help her get in to see Dr. Stewart Factor , a neurologist and director of the Movement Disorders Program at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. He is an expert in the field, and his appointment calendar is booked many months in advance.\u000a\u000aHer husband told office staff members, "she's really young; she's freaking out," and eventually they took pity and found a time for Schulman to see the doctor sooner rather than later.\u000a\u000aIn a waiting room filled with elderly people, Schulman gloomily observed the same symptoms she was experiencing: the rigidity, the tremors. Her name was called.\u000a\u000a"The first time Dr. Factor saw me, he was like, 'Wow, you're young,' " she said. Immediately, he explained that there's no "100% test" to tell somebody they have Parkinson's disease.\u000a\u000aStill, the news was grim. After a symptom check and neurological evaluation, he said he believed that Schulman had Parkinson's.\u000a\u000a"I was OK, but pretty hysterical," Schulman said.\u000a\u000aThe cause of Parkinson's\u000a\u000aPeople under the age of 40 make up about 15% of all Parkinson's cases, according to Factor.\u000a\u000a"We call that young-onset Parkinson's, while under the age of 20 is juvenile-onset of Parkinson's disease," Factor said. "That's much less common. The youngest person I've personally seen with Parkinson's had onset at age 18."\u000a\u000aWhy some patients develop Parkinson's at a very early age is not completely clear, explains Dr. Rebecca Gilbert, an associate professor of neurology at NYU Langone Medical Center. "But it does seem that patients who get it early tend to have a more prominent genetic component," added Gilbert, who is also a movement disorder specialist.\u000a\u000aMonica Schulman with her husband, Jeremy, recently enjoying a night out together.\u000a\u000aSchulman's genetic tests revealed a mutated LRRK2, one of the most prominent and researched Parkinson's disease genes.\u000a\u000aAccording to Factor, between 1% and 3% of all people with Parkinson's disease in the United States have this mutation. It's more common among some ethnicities, such as Ashkenazi Jews and North African Berbers.\u000a\u000aYet LRRK2 has only about a 30% "penetrance," Gilbert said: "If you inherit the abnormal gene, you have a 30% chance of developing Parkinson's."\u000a\u000aGilbert acknowledges that the genetics are "very complicated and getting more complicated every day." Oftentimes, she says, patients who develop the disorder at an older age have some genetic component.\u000a\u000aIn fact, a whole variety of genes either cause or are associated with or contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson's disease.\u000a\u000a"There are well over 20 genes that impact Parkinson's," Factor said. "There are five of them that are what we call causative -- in other words, the mutation causes the disease -- whereas the other genes just impact risk."\u000a\u000aAs he explains, the risk genes are teaching scientists about what systems (and symptoms) might be involved in Parkinson's. For instance, one risk gene regulates immune response, and it is well-known that inflammation in the brain is a symptom of the condition.\u000a\u000a"Some have thought that the progressive nature of the disease may be because of this ongoing inflammatory change in the brain," Factor said.\u000a\u000aHead Trauma\u000a\u000aSchulman, who has spent a good deal of time researching her illness, knows that a possible contributing factor -- or in some cases a cause -- is head trauma. (Sports legend Muhammad Ali's doctors believe that boxing-related brain injuries led to his Parkinson's diagnosis.)\u000a\u000a"There are some studies that have shown having a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness at some early time in your life can be associated with the development of Parkinson's later, but the impact it has on your risk is small," Factor said. "Muhammad Ali was a complex case."\u000a\u000aAli had young-onset Parkinson's diagnosed in his late 30s, Factor explains. Early in the course of his disease, some doctors said Ali looked like he had typical Parkinson's disease, with a tremor in one hand, but over time, his symptoms became compounded by effects from the trauma of his career.\u000a\u000a"People who were boxers that get pugilistic Parkinson's often don't respond to medications, and they have a different look," Factor said.\u000a\u000a"When I was 18 years old, I was in a really bad car accident in 1996 where I flipped my car seven times," Schulman said. "I broke high vertebra in my neck and had to wear a halo." She also began suffering from from anxiety and depression.\u000a\u000aToday, she wonders "if that impact is why what's happening now is happening."\u000a\u000aDopamine in the brain\u000a\u000aAt their first meeting, Factor recommended that Schulman get a DaTscan, a nuclear imaging test that looks at brain chemistry, specifically the integrity of dopamine cells.\u000a\u000aIf you have normal integrity of dopamine cells, you don't have Parkinson's, Factor explains, but if the test results are abnormal, "then you can have any one of these series of diseases that results in the death of dopamine cells, Parkinson's being the most common."\u000a\u000aThe scan showed "that I already had some dopamine loss on one side of the brain, on the right side, so that affects the left, and that's where my symptoms are," Schulman said.\u000a\u000aDespite the results, Schulman says, she "wasn't really convinced" and asked for recommendations for second opinions. Two other doctors reached the same diagnosis after they learned her symptoms and saw the DaTscan results.\u000a\u000a"So why do you have a lack of dopamine in your brain? You have a lack of dopamine in your brain because a certain cell that produces dopamine dies. There's degeneration of a specific type of neurons," Gilbert said.\u000a\u000aThough it's "more complicated than that" because the dopamine deficiency mainly accounts for motor symptoms of the disease, Parkinson's "affects a lot of different areas of functioning," including autonomic functions (such as blood pressure and breathing), cognition and urination.\u000a\u000aTreating Parkinson's, then, is a matter of producing dopamine in the brain.\u000a\u000aMedication\u000a\u000aA key of Parkinson's treatment is the drug levodopa , which is converted into dopamine in the brain and is "the cornerstone" of Parkinson's therapy, says Factor. Accordingly, he has prescribed it for Schulman along with a second drug, rotigotine.\u000a\u000aParkinson's patients experience "ons and offs," said Factor: motor fluctuations in response to the drug. These fluctuations appear as involuntary movements, known as dyskinesia. Actor and Parkinson's patient Michael J. Fox has this symptom and writes in his autobiography about overmedicating with levodopa early in his diagnosis to "cover" his symptoms and keep working.\u000a\u000aSome researchers believe dyskinesia is caused by medication flowing in waves or pulses in the brain. Some believe that taking too much levodopa causes dyskinesia.\u000a\u000aOne of the big discussions in the field is whether and when to start treatment with levodopa, Factor explained, since the drug contributes to dyskinesia. But it is not the only cause.\u000a\u000a"I personally believe that the progressive nature of each individual's disease predestines them to get it at some point," Factor said. "So if you delay the levodopa to try and prevent it, you're not going to prevent it, and you're going to lose a period of time when patients can have a really good response."\u000a\u000aHe tends to use it early, to give young patients the best opportunity to continue working. To limit the dose and delay fluctuations, he adds a second drug to the regimen.\u000a\u000aAnother reason for giving levodopa to young-onset patients is that they can undergo deep brain stimulation surgery once the fluctuations become troublesome.\u000a\u000a"Young people are the best candidates, because they are healthy and will have long-term benefits from the surgery," Factor said.\u000a\u000aAs Gilbert explains, delivery of medication is one of the most important areas of Parkinson's research right now. The goal is finding a way to deliver medication that stimulates the production of dopamine within the brain in a more continuous, sustained way. Among the new delivery systems, pharmaceutical researchers have developed infusion systems to pump medication directly into the small intestines.\u000a\u000aOne new class of drugs under development is chemically similar to caffeine, says Factor, because caffeine appears to lower the risk of getting Parkinson's disease in people with certain genes. Surprisingly, nicotine and other environmental toxicants may have a similar effect, lowering the risk for people with a certain genetic profile.\u000a\u000a"We very rarely see Parkinson's disease in active smokers," Factor said.\u000a\u000aFrom Schulman's perspective, all the research focused on medication is somewhat disappointing.\u000a\u000a"It's all symptom management," she said, adding that she doesn't expect a cure in her lifetime. Despite recent advances in neuroscience, a cure for this complex disease is not on the horizon.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, even though she knows "there's no reason to suffer and it's not necessarily going to get worse if you begin to take levodopa right now," she still has some worry about taking too much levodopa.\u000a\u000a"The tremor is annoying when I'm out at a restaurant with friends and my meds are wearing off," Schulman said. "I can feel myself moving, so I try to sit on my hand.\u000a\u000a"It's also hard taking all these meds regularly. It's like three times a day," she said. "But I'm dealing with it and functioning."\u000a\u000aPrognosis\u000a\u000a"Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick," Susan Sontag wrote in her book " Illness as Metaphor ," adding that sooner or later, each of us will count ourselves among the citizens in the country of sickness.\u000a\u000aBut not everyone in the kingdom of the sick believes the stamp on her passport.\u000a\u000a"There's still part of me that doesn't believe that I have Parkinson's," Schulman admitted. "I just have that percentage that still thinks they all got it wrong and maybe it's something else.\u000a\u000a"I'm trying to get over this denial phase, because I think I've been in it a little too long."\u000a\u000aIn January, she will leave her job as a preschool teacher and start focusing on "going to the gym every day and getting a trainer and start moving more and taking it a little more seriously."\u000a\u000aExercise is the best thing Parkinson's patients can do for themselves, according to Gilbert, who says, "lots and lots of things are improved when patients exercise." Many studies have showed that exercise improves symptoms of depression, helps with cognition and slows the progression of motor symptoms.\u000a\u000aAlthough Factor refers to her symptoms as mild, Schulman says, "to me, it's pretty not mild, because I feel them." She noticed that her tremor has worsened since her diagnosis in early 2015 and asked Factor if that meant she is progressing quickly.\u000a\u000a"It's slow and slower, that's what he said: People progress slow or slower," Schulman said. "They don't know how much I'll progress. They don't know if I'll stay this way and never get worse. They know to a point you do get worse, but everybody's different. Two years from now, I could be a lot worse or be where I'm at right now."\u000a\u000a"The hardest part for me is not even so much that I have Parkinson's disease, it's my kids," said Schulman, who has an 11-year-old son, a 10-year-old son, a 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son. Each knows in some way about their mother's disease.\u000a\u000a"My oldest is aware. I sat with him once, and I talked to him about it, and he started crying actually, and he asked me if I was gonna die, and I said 'no, I'm not gonna die,' " she said. "The other ones know, but they don't really know so much about it.\u000a\u000a"I cried a lot thinking now my kids are going to have a mom who is sick, someone who is not going to be able to do things they want me to do," she said. "I feel so bad for my husband. We've been married for 15 years, and now he has a wife with Parkinson's."\u000a\u000aMost people die with Parkinson's disease, not because of it, says Factor. Still, people with very long-term Parkinson's can develop dementia or lose their ability to walk and then may get complications of immobility, such as pneumonia or other infections.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"They say you don't die from Parkinson's, but ..." Schulman said with a laugh. "I sort of disagree."\u000a\u000aEverywhere on the groups she's joined -- a Facebook group and other chat rooms -- family members say their loved ones died from complications of the disease.\u000a\u000a"I just hope that I progress slowly enough that there will be better medicine to help," she said.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, she still finds it embarrassing to say she has Parkinson's, because "people envision an old person shaking and looking a little funny."\u000a\u000a"I want to be one of those personalities, those people who are like a fighter and gung ho and raising money and supporting the foundation and out there about it."\u000a\u000a"I want to be that way," Schulman said. "I'm just not there yet."

That\u2019s the lowest percentage since World War II, as you might have heard an Occupy Wall Street protester point out. (Not coincidentally, one in five young adults now lives below the poverty line.) Almost a quarter more people ages 25 to 34in other words, people who should be a few years into their independent livesare living with their parents than at the beginning of the recession.\u000a\u000aBeing young is supposed to mean you have the luxury of time. But in hard times, a few fallow years can become a lifetime drag on what you earn, sort of the opposite of compound interest. Because the average person grabs 70 percent of their total pay bumps during their first ten years in the workforce, according to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, having stagnant or nonexistent ­wages during that period means you hit that springboard at a crawl. Economist Lisa Kahn explained to The Atlantic in 2010 that those who graduate into a recession are still earning an average of 10 percent less nearly two decades into their careers. In hard, paycheck-shrinking numbers, the salary lost over that stretch totals around $100,000. That works out to $490 or so less a month, money that could go, say, toward repaying student loans, which for the class of 2009 average $24,000. Those student loans (the responsible borrowing option!) have reportedly passed credit cards as the nation\u2019s largest source of debt. This is not just a rotten moment to be young. It\u2019s a putrid, stinking, several-months-old-stringy-goat-meat moment to be young.\u000a\u000aEarlier generations have weathered recessions, of course; this stall we\u2019re in has the look of something nastier. Social Security and Medicare are going to be diminished, at best. Hours worked are up even as hiring staggers along: Blood from a stone looks to be the normal order of things going forward, to borrow the business-speak. Economists are warning that even when the economy recuperates, full employment will be lower and growth will be slowera sad little rhyme that adds up to something decidedly ­unpoetic. A majority of Americans say, for the first time ever, that this generation will not be better off than its parents.

aV(CNN) Jody Neal-Post has been reading about the health care law debate with worry these days.\u000a\u000aShe's worried about how the new health care law won't carry protections for all people with pre-existing conditions. She is relatively healthy, but before Obamacare, she had a hard time getting insurance because of what some companies considered a pre-existing condition: She is a domestic violence survivor.\u000a\u000aBefore Obamacare, some insurance companies used to consider medical treatment related to domestic violence and rape a pre-existing condition that would preclude survivors from getting insurance. Some states have banned that practice, but not all. Neal-Post worries that changes in the way insurance companies handle people with pre-existing conditions could hurt her fellow survivors.\u000a\u000a"I had really good counseling," Neal-Post said. "So the story of the abuse has now become a fact story for me, rather than an emotional one, but reading about this insurance debate prompted this memory of fighting for insurance that hadn't come to the forefront for me in a long while."\u000a\u000aIn 2002, Neal-Post's husband beat and tried to choke her. Her medical records at the time showed that he grabbed her so hard, there were fingerprints on her neck. The story of the abuse made the newspapers at the time. In 2006, when the Albuquerque lawyer tried to switch insurance plans, she ran into problems.\u000a\u000aThe insurance application asked for her medical history. She disclosed that she was the victim of a crime, had a severe concussion then and "was strangled momentarily to unconsciousness." She included that she got private counseling through a police department program for abuse survivors and, as part of treatment, was given a six-month prescription for Valium to help her sleep.\u000a\u000a"I would see his eyes when I was falling asleep, and I would see him choking me as if I was trying to get away from him again," Neal-Post said. "I couldn't sleep."\u000a\u000aThe insurance company rejected her application. By law, it didn't have say why, but she says she was otherwise healthy.\u000a\u000aShe did eventually get insurance, but under Obamacare, it would never have been a problem; currently, insurance companies cannot deny policies or charge people more based on any pre-existing conditions.\u000a\u000aNow, the bill under consideration in the House weakens the protections for those with pre-existing conditions. States would be allowed to get a waiver from the US Department of Health and Human Services to let insurance companies set premiums based on a person's medical background under certain circumstances. If the bill becomes law in its current form, that could mean survivors could face higher insurance bills.\u000a\u000aAt the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing to confirm Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania , asked Price about this issue. Would Price "commit to maintaining the protections that ensure victims of domestic violence will not be discriminated against when purchasing health insurance?"\u000a\u000aPrice responded said it's "absolutely vital" that such "victims" not be "priced out of the market."\u000a\u000a"I should have been more aggressive pinning him down on that," Casey said, in retrospect. "The nature of this is such that it would be a disaster for this administration to allow that policy to change," and if this "lapses into a 'Well, the states will take care of it,' that is wrong and wrong morally."\u000a\u000aInsurance industry changes\u000a\u000aThere has been movement in the insurance industry to prevent companies from making policy decisions based on someone's status as a survivor of abuse.\u000a\u000aThe NAIC Network Adequacy Model Act (PDF), revised and adopted in 2015, included a resolution passed by the professional association for state insurance regulators, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that prohibits "unfair discrimination by health carriers and insurance professionals on the basis of abuse status." This isn't a law like Obamacare, but it serves as guidance for states when they make insurance-related laws. Not all states, however, have adopted this policy.\u000a\u000aAmerican's Health Insurance Plans , the association that represents health insurance providers, said in an email that "of course survivors of domestic abuse and rape should be covered."\u000a\u000aSenior Vice President of Communications Kristine Grow pointed out that health plans follow the laws implemented by the ACA and the guidance set forth by the NAIC Model Act. And just because there isn't a law doesn't mean that's how insurance companies in those states operate.\u000a\u000aBut if the ACA is rolled back and states haven't adopted the NAIC Model Act, some survivors could be newly vulnerable again.\u000a\u000aShe said it's unknown how many survivors had been denied policies prior to Obamacare, because insurance companies didn't have to disclose why they turn someone down for a policy.\u000a\u000aIn 1994 , the House Judiciary Committee did an informal survey of 16 of the nation's largest insurers, representing about 50% of the market at the time. Eight of the 16 companies admitted using domestic violence as a factor to set premiums and to determine who should get a policy.\u000a\u000aMore questions for survivors\u000a\u000aThere are many other survivors' stories.\u000a\u000aWhen the National Women's Law Center launched a campaign to support its study called "Being a Woman is not a Pre-Existing Condition" in 2009, Borchelt said, it came across a story about Chris Turner.\u000a\u000aTurner was a health insurance agent who asked insurance underwriters she worked with whether rape survivors would get coverage. She said the underwriters told her no. Medical treatment associated with rape made the person too high a risk.\u000a\u000aThe question Turner asked was posed as a hypothetical, but it wasn't.\u000a\u000aTurner was a rape survivor. She'd been drugged and raped while on a business trip. Doctors put her on medication to prevent HIV as a precaution. When she had that general conversation with an underwriter, Turner had needed to switch insurance policies, but she now knew how difficult that would be.\u000a\u000aThe Affordable Care Act changed that. And it ensured that tests for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, plus domestic and interpersonal violence screening and counseling, would be completely covered by insurance companies.\u000a\u000aThat may not be the case in the future. Under the current bill, states could seek waivers that would let insurers sell plans that don't include all the essential health benefits mandated by the ACA.\u000a\u000a"We are really concerned that getting rid of the ACA will send us back to the day when insurance companies discriminated against women," said Borchelt, whose group opposes the repeal of Obamacare.\u000a\u000aNeal-Post also remains concerned, although she was eventually able to get health insurance, even before the Affordable Care Act. Her state, New Mexico, had a law that prohibited insurance companies from using domestic abuse as a criterion for denying someone health insurance.\u000a\u000a"Eventually, with the intervention of the (attorney general's) office and the consumer insurance division, I got insurance," she said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aShe knew, though, that she had a personal advantage in getting health insurance coverage, because she is a lawyer.\u000a\u000a"I had awareness and a skill set to push back to get myself covered, and I know a lot of women don't have that access," Neal-Post said. The recent Obamacare repeal efforts bother her.\u000a\u000a"For years, I had been freed from this angst" due to these legal protections. "Reading the votes in Congress made me think about this issue again, and I was immediately concerned for other women."

aV(CNN) President Donald Trump may have made a short-term deal this week to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling, but he's also placed House Speaker Paul Ryan in the crosshairs of the far-right members within his conference once again.\u000a\u000aIn a week that began with Trump punting the plight of 800,000 young immigrants to Congress and will end with a vote on major spending bill that Trump negotiated with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Ryan's job only seems to be getting harder.\u000a\u000a"We should have stayed here and put together a plan clear back in July on the debt ceiling," Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio and a member of the House Freedom Caucus, lamented Thursday about leadership's decision to go home for recess. "Lack of preparation sometimes puts you in a position where the choices aren't great. We should have prepared sooner that's why we said stay here not take the longest August recess in we've taken in 12 years in a non-election year."\u000a\u000aVirginia Rep. Dave Brat, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said on MSNBC Thursday that "everybody likes Speaker Ryan. It's just, we've got to aim at a target and hit it."\u000a\u000a"Paul, to his credit, is always a nice guy and a gentleman to everybody, right?" Brat said. "But we need to lead and like this vote coming up, it's going to be won with a majority of Democratic votes and 100 to 150 Republicans are going to vote against the big bill tomorrow."\u000a\u000aA senior congressional source maintained GOP leaders went united in pushing for longer extension of the debt ceiling increase and had the treasury secretary on their side but in surprising meeting, Trump sided with Democrats.\u000a\u000aDespite the fact it was Trump who cut a deal with Democrats, not Ryan, conservatives seem on edge with a speaker who some argue isn't cutting the conservative deals they hoped to get under a Republican President.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, the Republican Study Committee, a powerful conservative group in the House, announced its leadership would not support the debt ceiling and spending bill expected to come to the floor Friday.\u000a\u000aRSC Chairman Mark Walker questioned whether the package should even get a vote.\u000a\u000a"Should it even come to the floor? That's a leadership decision, not mine," Walker told reporters about the package to increase the debt limit.\u000a\u000aWalker also suggested Ryan could have put up more of a fight.\u000a\u000a"He didn't lead on it but at some point you either push back or you just kind of roll with it," Walker said about Ryan, adding, "I think we as a conference as well as our leadership could do more in pushing back sometimes to stay consistent with what we promised the American people."\u000a\u000aPressed if Ryan should have fought the President more on the deal, Walker admitted he wasn't in the meeting and wasn't sure how much the speaker was "blindsided" by what happened.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday evening, members of the House Freedom Caucus met with the speaker to outline their priorities. A source with knowledge of the meeting with the speaker confirmed it was a frank discussion of policy objectives. But, publicly, Republican members have tried to downplay any reports that Ryan's speakership is in serious limbo.\u000a\u000aAlabama GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne dismissed the reports and mocked the notion that some GOP critics were already floating replacement ideas.\u000a\u000a"It's not really happening and some of the names that are out there probably couldn't get 50 votes," Byrne told CNN.\u000a\u000aByrne noted he probably will vote against the debt and spending bill package, but asked about the speaker's history of maneuvering the internal GOP divisions, said, "he handles it very well with real grace and composure, and he's as strong today in the House of Representatives as he's ever been."\u000a\u000aBut the spending bill was only the most recent hiccup for Ryan this week.\u000a\u000aConservatives are also watching Ryan carefully now as the speaker forges ahead on the always-fraught issue of immigration. In 2013, immigration tore the House apart and only revealed deeper schisms between the base and House leadership. With the future of DACA recipients now uncertain after Trump's decision Tuesday to end the program in six months, Ryan told his conference Tuesday that he plans to try and bring an immigration package to the floor that includes protection for DACA recipients as well as border security.\u000a\u000aBut immigration has proven to be kryptonite for Republican speakers in the past.\u000a\u000a"Under these circumstances, we will see a speaker who I'll say is significantly more sympathetic than I am to the subject of this matter and less sympathetic to the rule of law," said immigration hardliner and Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King. "If this DACA thing comes forward ... you're gonna see a divided Republican conference."\u000a\u000aAllies of the speaker, however, say that Ryan's job is to govern not to cower in fear to those in the furthest flanks of his conference.\u000a\u000a"I've never know Paul Ryan to back away from a tough challenge. That's just not who he is. He came here to solve problems, not score political points. He's done that his entire career," said Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican and ally of Ryan's. "At the end of the day, Paul Ryan will do what he thinks the right thing is and I think he'll have enough people who are willing to follow him."\u000a\u000aThis story has been updated.

aVIn a corner room of Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, New York, Jadon and Anias had recovered for the past nine months of extensive rehabilitation after the surgery to separate the formerly conjoined twins.\u000a\u000aThe two boys captivated millions around the world when they underwent a 27-hour separation surgery in October . The twins, who were 13 months old at the time, had shared 5 centimeters by 7 centimeters of brain tissue, making the complicated surgery that much more difficult.\u000a\u000aJadon and Anias had known the world only from lying on their backs, and the surgery set them back to infancy in terms of speech and gross motor skills. In recovery, they learned how to use muscles they never knew they had. Just sitting up was a monumental task.\u000a\u000aDoctors feared that Anias might never be able to use his right side. Yet in rehab, he's begun using his right hand almost as much as his left.\u000a\u000aTheir final day at Blythedale is one Nicole and Christian had dreamed of since before the surgery. The family transported their lives from small-town Illinois to New York in February 2016 to prepare for the procedure.\u000a\u000aThe boys had been in the hospital almost constantly since then, first at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, where the surgery took place, and then Blythedale. They turn 2 years old on Saturday.\u000a\u000aGone are the fears of the surgery itself. The hour-long trips to the hospital. The longing to have their family under one roof.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Conjoined twins separated: New life, apart Anias, left, and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head, something only seen in 1 out of every 2.5 million live births.

Hide Caption 24 of 24\u000a\u000aNicole lifted Anias from his hospital crib. "Are you ready to go?" she asked, cradling him close to her heart.\u000a\u000aAcross the room, Christian picked up Jadon and told him that he'll soon "get to hang out at home."\u000a\u000a"You get to ride in a minivan," he said. "You get to be a normal little boy."\u000a\u000aThe boys were placed in a double umbrella stroller. Jadon sported a white helmet with a red Velcro strap; Anias wore a helmet with a blue stripe.\u000a\u000aDad pushed their stroller down the hall. Mom and their 4-year-old brother, Aza, accompanied them.\u000a\u000aIt was time to go home. Finally.\u000a\u000a'God works through people'\u000a\u000aThe McDonald home teems with activity. Nicole and Christian purchased the home in foreclosure in the spring. Nestled in New York's Orange County, with views of the Catskill Mountains, it was in need of extensive renovation.\u000a\u000aChristian worked almost around the clock to get it ready for his boys, ripping off siding and tearing up old carpet. A few weeks ago, four guys from Texas who are affiliated with their church showed up to help. In just 2½ days, they built front stairs, installed siding, replaced windows, refurbished the laundry room and renovated a bathroom.\u000a\u000aMost important, they ran an electrical circuit to the boys' room to handle all of their specialized medical equipment. Anias will need a feeding tube, as well as a breathing machine and a suction machine to aid in his care. The family will eventually have home nurses for 16 hours a day.\u000a\u000aLess than 24 hours before the boys' return, the split-level ranch home seemed more like the site of a renovation reality show, with Christian burning the midnight oil to complete the work. Aided by his minister and two church members, he pulled up carpet in the basement playroom and laid tiles.\u000a\u000aOn the wall, a quote from American philosopher and psychologist William James: "The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude."\u000a\u000aUpstairs, Nicole prepared a chili feast. She traveled back and forth between the hospital and home so much, it's rare to be able to cook dinner.\u000a\u000aShe had to fight back to tears while slicing onions. The tears, she said with a laugh, are "not from the onions." They're for the overwhelming excitement at the idea of bringing Jadon and Anias home. Earlier, she'd walked through their room. Their newly assembled cribs waited to be occupied.\u000a\u000a"My kids have never been home separate," she said. "I'm so excited, I can hardly stand it. It feels like it's not even real. We've never been home and each held a kid. It's going to be awesome."\u000a\u000aChristian joined her in the kitchen to reflect on the monumental journey the family has been on for the past year. He said the boys have been in hospitals for so long -- nearly 1½ years, counting the months before the surgery -- that feels like, in a weird way, Jadon and Anias have been wards of the hospital and less his own children. "It's almost like I get to be a dad to them for the first time," he said.\u000a\u000aThat's not to say he's not appreciative of everything the hospitals have done, from the surgeons at Montefiore who operated on them to the staff at Blythedale who worked tirelessly to get Jadon and Anias to this point.\u000a\u000a"I'm feeling pretty excited getting to hold my kids sitting on my couch and actually just hold one at a time," he said. "It's like I have my sons now, you know?"\u000a\u000aChristian and Nicole McDonald load their twins, Jadon and Anias, into the family van as they head home from rehab for the first time.\u000a\u000aThe last time the boys were home, Jadon and Anias were still connected at the head. Any time their parents needed to move them, they had to carry them together in a carefully choreographed way.\u000a\u000aThe family lived in a rental home in the Bronx. Now, they have their own home. They want to push the boys in strollers to the park. They want to take them to the local pizza joint. Simply put, they just want to be a family.\u000a\u000a"I can't wait to show them the world," Nicole said.\u000a\u000aMore than anything else, Christian said, "I'm just so excited for them. I'm sure they just want to come home and be with their family, and we want them to come home."\u000a\u000aBoth parents express gratitude for everyone who has reached out to them and prayed for their boys. Devout Christians, the parents say their faith has sustained them during this arduous journey.\u000a\u000a"Times like this really shows us that it is God's help," Christian said. "God works through people."\u000a\u000aAdded Nicole, "This strengthened my faith. If I didn't have God in my life, I would not have made it."\u000a\u000aA member of their church donated their minivan. Strangers generously gave more than $340,000 to the family's GoFundMe account -- money that has supported the family the past year, aided in the purchase of their home and helped pay off huge medical bills.\u000a\u000aThe journey has in no way been easy. The months since the surgery have seen both boys stave off seizures and serious infections that resulted in trips to the intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aBut the parents say they are prepared to handle whatever comes next.\u000a\u000a"We had miracle upon miracle upon miracle happen with these children to get them to where they are now," Nicole said. "We have our children coming home."\u000a\u000a'Motivated' boys ready to tackle the world\u000a\u000aThe boys' road to recovery was made possible thanks to the dedicated staff at Blythedale Children's Hospital. In additional to physical therapy, they received speech and occupational therapy five days a week. The boys will still return for three days of therapy a week for the foreseeable future.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED A 360° look inside the operating room during the boys' surgery Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A 360° look inside the operating room during the boys' surgery 06:16\u000a\u000aMara Abrams has worked with Jadon as his physical therapist and says his tenacity has been awe-inspiring. He loves books, he loves toys, and he loves life. She said he's learning to pull himself up on furniture and walking sideways along the furniture with a bit of help. He's nearly crawling, too.\u000a\u000a"The first step in a wonderful life is about to happen," Abrams said. "It's just so great that the hospitalization is over."\u000a\u000aJadon's progression is nothing short of amazing, she said. It was difficult and intimidating when he first arrived because he'd only known life from lying on his back.\u000a\u000a"All of a sudden, the whole world changed for him," she said. "I know it took so much time for him to visually accept that the world wasn't meant for him to lie down, that he had to come into a vertical position and figure out this is what the world looks like."\u000a\u000aA collection of family photos hangs in the dining room of the McDonalds' home.\u000a\u000aBut with help, Jadon took off. "Every day, he's always been a cheerful, happy guy. He throws his arms out; he squeals with delight. He loves going to therapy. I'm just so happy they're going to have real-life experiences."\u000a\u000aHer favorite moments are many, like the time he took a few steps toward his occupational therapist and grinned from ear to ear. Or the time he was on a tricycle working on reciprocal leg motion, and he suddenly saw his mom. "We started to go towards her. She squealed with delight, and he did. It was really wonderful."\u000a\u000aAnias has struggled the most, both before and after the surgery. With twins joined at the head, one tends to be more dominant. In this case, Jadon was the dominant one, whose body worked overtime to keep both of them alive. Anias has struggled with breathing and other issues, compared with his brother. Anias's body also rejected the skull cap that had been placed under his skin to protect his brain, and it had to be surgically removed. He will probably undergo another surgery for a new skull cap when he is 7 years old. Until then, he will wear a protective helmet.\u000a\u000aBut Anias' gains have been tremendous too, according to his physical therapist, Maureen Carroll. Although he is a few months behind Jadon's progression, he has made giant leaps.\u000a\u000aWhen Anias first came to physical therapy, Carroll said, he was scared of people and using only his left side. Now, he's kicking both feet and routinely using his right hand to stick his foot in his mouth. He's become social with his twin and older brother.\u000a\u000aAnias, who eats via a feeding tube, is 4 pounds heavier than Jadon now, weighing in at 28 pounds.\u000a\u000a"He wants to play. He wants to move -- and that's amazing," Carroll said. "The child who was afraid of people at first now wants to interact with the world. He's motivated, and that's huge."\u000a\u000aWhat excites her the most about Anias, she said, is that "he's excited to be here, and he's excited to move."\u000a\u000a"That's what makes my job so easy," she said. "I'm just going along for the ride. He's the one who is the hero and the miracle."\u000a\u000aMaking the family whole\u000a\u000aThe silver minivan pulled up to their home early Friday evening. Mom and Dad got out and prepared for the big moment. On the hourlong ride home, Jadon played with a ball while big brother Aza jabbered for much of the time. Both boys laughed and laughed. Anias was oblivious, asleep in his seat.\u000a\u000aThe family dogs, Taz and Tyson, greeted the minivan to inspect the new arrivals. Taz, a tiny Maltese/toy poodle mix, leaped into the back of the minivan and sniffed around. His tail wagged at the sight of the two boys.\u000a\u000aNicole gingerly carried Anias up the front stairs. Christian fetched Jadon and, on their way up the steps, pointed out his renovation handiwork to his son: new siding, stairs and windows.\u000a\u000a"I put you in a new window, Jadon, so you can have a clear view," he said. "This is it. This is your home."\u000a\u000aNicole McDonald comforts her crying son, Jadon, who was frightened by the family dog.\u000a\u000aSoon, the home buzzed with the hectic life of raising three boys under the age of 5. Aza ran about. Taz began barking. The environment was completely new to the twins.\u000a\u000aJadon trembled and cried every time Taz barked. The night before, the parents had talked of how they longed to sit with the boys on the couch.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWith Jadon screaming, Nicole took a seat on the living room couch and held him. "This is your home," she whispered. "Don't be scared."\u000a\u000aHis tears abated.\u000a\u000aA few hours later, Anias fell asleep first. Jadon soon followed. Both boys were asleep in their home.\u000a\u000aAs much as Nicole and Christian dreamed of the moment, they said, it was even better than they imagined.\u000a\u000aTheir family was whole again.

Drivers waited for hours at gas stations, some of which ran out of fuel. Travelers stood in line for hours at airports.\u000a\u000aBased on Irma's projected path, which includes Florida's heavily populated eastern coast , the enormous storm could create one of the largest mass evacuations in US history, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties combined have about 6 million people\u000a\u000aPeople wait in line at a Costco Gas Station in Miami on Thursday.\u000a\u000aPeople should get out now, Gov. Rick Scott warned at a Thursday news conference. If they wait until Saturday or Sunday, when high winds and rain are expected to lash south Florida, it will be too late.\u000a\u000a"We cannot save you when the storm starts," Scott said. "So if you are in an evacuation zone and you need help, you need to tell us now."\u000a\u000aThe National Hurricane Center issued hurricane and storm surge warnings for South Florida on Thursday night.\u000a\u000a"You do not want to leave on Saturday, driving through Florida with tropical storm force winds," CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said. He said the latest Floridians should evacuate is Friday morning.\u000a\u000a'Three lanes of red bumper lights'\u000a\u000aRoseanne Lesack, her husband and three children were among the evacuees.\u000a\u000aThey left Boca Raton on Wednesday and headed to Atlanta to stay with friends, she said. After encountering slow traffic, the family spent the night at a motel in Orlando and continued north Thursday morning, Lesack said.\u000a\u000a"What should have been another six or seven-hour travel experience is coming up on 12 hours," she said Thursday night while about 35 miles south of Atlanta. "It has been slow. Right now we're going about 20 mph. ... It's just three lanes of red bumper lights."\u000a\u000aLast year, the family stayed with friends in Florida and rode out Hurricane Matthew, she said. Lesack is glad they decided not to chance it this year.\u000a\u000a"Now there are a lot of people who are really nervous about staying but don't feel like they can get out," Lesack said.\u000a\u000aMandatory evacuations\u000a\u000aTourist Bjorg Aasen and Arne Forsmo walk to catch a shuttle to a shelter as Miami Beach announced a mandatory evacuation.\u000a\u000aIn Florida, mandatory evacuations orders included parts of Miami-Dade County, Broward County east of US 1, Palm Beach County, low-lying parts of Brevard County, and Monroe County, home to the Florida Keys. More than 30,000 people evacuated Monroe County alone, Scott said.\u000a\u000aMonroe County Administrator Roman Gastesi stressed to residents in the Keys they need to heed the evacuation order and leave.\u000a\u000aAll hospitals would be closed and ambulances gone as of Friday morning, including air ambulances, he said.\u000a\u000a"You might as well leave now, while you have a chance, because when you dial 911 -- you will not get an answer," he said.\u000a\u000aThe Florida Department of Transportation released traffic counts showing extremely heavy traffic on Thursday, such as 4,000 vehicles on I-75 northbound in Lake City, compared to a norm of 1,000. About 1,800 vehicles traveled on I-75 in Collier County, compared to a norm of 600. Other roads showed smaller increases.\u000a\u000aThough nobody knows exactly where Irma will make landfall, the governors of Georgia and South Carolina decided not to take any chances. They ordered mandatory evacuations of low-lying coastal areas around Savannah and Charleston.\u000a\u000aOther eastern Florida population centers could also see similar evacuations soon, depending on the path of the hurricane, which is expected to near Miami on Sunday.\u000a\u000a"Look at the size of this storm," Scott said Thursday. "It is wider than our entire state and could cause major and life-threatening impacts from coast to coast. Regardless of what coast you live on, be prepared to evacuate. Floridians on the west coast cannot be complacent."\u000a\u000aEvacuations cause gridlock on September 7, as residents of Port St. Lucie, Florida prepare for Hurricane Irma to hit the region.\u000a\u000aFinding more fuel\u000a\u000aFuel availability is a major problem. CNN's Miguel Marquez said about half the gas stations were open in Miami.\u000a\u000aAt a Marathon gas station in Miami, a line of cars wrapped around the corner. Two police officers on duty kept drivers in line and police tape kept them from entering the station the wrong way. Drivers had to wait at least an hour for fuel.\u000a\u000aIn a news release, Scott said he's taking steps to have more fuel delivered. Contractors have come up with 1.5 million gallons to deliver so far, he said. State police will escort fuel trucks heading to gas stations on evacuation routes.\u000a\u000aAbout 300,000 barrels of fuel were being unloaded from a ship in Tampa to resupply gas stations. A fuel ship from Mississippi was heading to the Port of Tampa and will be given a military escort, he said.\u000a\u000aScott also said he is suspending toll collections for the duration of the storm.\u000a\u000aLimited evacuation routes\u000a\u000aOne issue with a mass evacuation is that Florida relies on two primary highways that go north and south: I-95 along the east coast and I-75 further west. Those highways, as well as the Florida Turnpike, US-27 and other smaller roads that run north, will be "tremendously" clogged if the storm hits, Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said.\u000a\u000a"If this monster comes right up the peninsula of Florida, you're gonna have a mass out-migration from the south to the north, and it's gonna clog the roads something tremendously," Nelson said. "Therefore, if you are going to evacuate, once the evacuation order is given, don't wait around."\u000a\u000aAn evacuation could lead to mileslong gridlock, as happened with attempted mass evacuations during Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Rita in 2005.\u000a\u000aWhen Hurricane Harvey began threatening southeast Texas about two weeks ago, Houston officials decided not to issue voluntary or mandatory evacuations, partly because of memories of those problems.\u000a\u000aNowhere to hide\u000a\u000aHurricane Irma's cone of potential landfall currently includes the entire state of Florida, meaning that residents may not be able to flee to the state's Gulf Coast to avoid its wrath. Going north is the best choice.\u000a\u000aFlorida is relatively narrow. Fort Lauderdale on the east coast and Naples on the west coast are separated by just over 100 miles. Even in the central part of the state, only 130 miles separate Clearwater on the west coast from Melbourne on the east coast.\u000a\u000aFor comparison, tropical storm-force winds from Irma cover over 65,000 square miles -- about the size of the entire state.\u000a\u000aHurricane Floyd's traffic jam\u000a\u000aTraffic in all four lanes of I-16 westbound comes to a crawl as people evacuate the coast outside Savannah, Georgia, on September 14, 1999, ahead of Hurricane Floyd.\u000a\u000aMajor evacuations have created significant problems in the past when millions of residents took the roads at the same time.\u000a\u000aFlorida saw this in 1999 during Hurricane Floyd. The storm was headed toward Jacksonville, in the northeast corner of the state, and officials there ordered evacuations. The storm ultimately turned farther north and made landfall in North Carolina.\u000a\u000aIn all, about 3 million people across Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina attempted to evacuate, making it the largest evacuation effort in US history, according to a FEMA press release from 2000\u000a\u000aMany of those evacuees became stuck in gridlock in what FEMA charitably described as a "frustrating effort."\u000a\u000aHouston's non-evacuation\u000a\u000aMindful of past problems with mass evacuations, Houston officials last month told residents to hunker down in their homes until Hurricane Harvey passed. As the city flooded and residents became trapped in their waterlogged homes, Houston mayor Sylvester Turner defended his decision not to evacuate.\u000a\u000aThe alternative, he said, could have been worse.\u000a\u000a"You literally cannot put 6.5 million people on the road," Turner said last week. "If you think the situation right now is bad, you give an order to evacuate, you are creating a nightmare."\u000a\u000aHouston experienced that firsthand during Hurricane Rita in 2005, when officials issued mass evacuation orders.\u000a\u000aDuring that evacuation, a bus carrying elderly evacuees caught fire and exploded, killing at least 24 people and jamming a major evacuation route. Others died during the evacuation due to heat exhaustion, according to the National Hurricane Center\u000a\u000aAirlines adding flights\u000a\u000aFor Floridians who don't want to risk chaos on the highways, a flight out is another option.\u000a\u000aDelta Air Lines said it has added flights out of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Key West to Atlanta, its largest hub. The airline also is allowing passengers affected by Irma to rebook flights without paying a fee.\u000a\u000aPets, pets, pets!!! Every second passenger has pet on flights today \U0001f917\U0001f64f\U0001f436\U0001f431#miami #southbeach #hurricane #irma #\u0421NNweather A post shared by Elena Yampolskaya (@ellenworldwide) on Sep 7, 2017 at 8:25am PDT\u000a\u000aAmerican Airlines and United Airlines also said they are waiving change fees for passengers whose travel plans are impacted by Irma.\u000a\u000aHowever, American Airlines said it will wind down operations Friday afternoon at its Miami hub as well as other south Florida cities. Operations will be canceled throughout the weekend, the airline said.

aVThursday marks 34 years to the day since former France international Jean-Pierre Adams entered into a coma following a botched operation on his knee. His story is being republished to take into account the anniversary of his operation and his 68th birthday, meaning he has now spent half his life in a coma. The article was first published on 4 January.\u000a\u000aNimes, France (CNN) What present do you buy a man who has been in a coma for more than 30 years?\u000a\u000aThat's the question the family of former France international Jean-Pierre Adams, whose life was brutally turned upside down in 1982, asks itself every year on key anniversaries.\u000a\u000aThirty-four years ago the beefy footballer, then 34, walked into a Lyon hospital for some routine surgery to correct a troublesome knee.\u000a\u000aBy the time he left, he would never talk, walk or move any of his limbs again.\u000a\u000aHis wife Bernadette has tended to him ever since, barely missing a day's care over the last three decades.\u000a\u000a"No one ever forgets to give Jean-Pierre presents, whether it's his birthday, Christmas or Father's Day," Bernadette told CNN.\u000a\u000aThe 68-year-old can breathe on his own, without the assistance of a machine, and has his own room, where he spends most of the day in the type of modified bed normally found in a hospital.\u000a\u000a"We buy presents like a T-shirt or a jumper because I dress him in his bed -- he changes clothes every day," his wife explains at the family home near Nîmes, in the south of France, where Bernadette cares for Jean-Pierre.\u000a\u000a"I'll buy things so that he can have a nice room, such as pretty sheets, or some scent. He used to wear Paco Rabanne but his favorite one stopped so now I buy Sauvage by Dior."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Jean-Pierre and Bernadette Adams: A love like no other Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jean-Pierre and Bernadette Adams: A love like no other 03:13\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's disastrous surgery reduced a flamboyant character, who had risen from humble beginnings in Senegal, to one who has been in a persistent vegetative state ever since.\u000a\u000aA France international player in the 1970s, Jean-Pierre is now incapable of nearly all voluntary movement but can digest food as well as open and close his eyes.\u000a\u000aBernadette looks after her husband with an unfailing love -- dressing, feeding and bathing him, turning him over in his bed to avoid sores, and often losing her own sleep to ensure he gets his.\u000a\u000aIt's a measure of their bond that on the rare occasions Bernadette spends a night away from home, Jean-Pierre's carers notice his mood seems to change.\u000a\u000a"He senses that it is not me feeding him and looking after him," says his wife of 47 years. "It's the nurses who tell me, saying he is not the same.\u000a\u000a"I think he feels things. He must recognize the sound of my voice as well."\u000a\u000aThe period of enlightenment\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre and Bernadette may have been born in Senegal and France respectively, but their lives started to converge in the mid-1950s.\u000a\u000aThat was when Jean-Pierre's grandmother took him to Europe on a religious pilgrimage, enrolling the 10-year-old at a school in France as she did so.\u000a\u000aSoon adopted by a local French couple, his African existence rapidly started to disappear behind him.\u000a\u000aIt was in the late 1960s, that Jean-Pierre, then an amateur footballer, met Bernadette at a dance.\u000a\u000aIt was a time of change, with the uprising of May 1968 heralding a new era as students and workers altered France's cultural outlook as they challenged the conservative nature of General de Gaulle's government.\u000a\u000a"I can't hide the fact that it was very difficult for my family at the beginning," Bernadette recalls, reflecting on the challenges they faced as a mixed race couple.\u000a\u000a"At the time, a black man and a white woman being together wasn't well-regarded.\u000a\u000a"But we began to live together and then decided to marry. I wrote to my parents giving the news, the wedding date and an invitation, and my mother invited us to dinner.\u000a\u000a"After that, everything was fine and he was seen in a better light than me: 'Jean-Pierre, Jean-Pierre' -- they only spoke of Jean-Pierre!"\u000a\u000aThe couple first lived just south of Paris -- in Fontainebleu -- where Adams was helping the local side win its amateur championship, but shortly after their 1969 marriage, they moved to Nîmes as Jean-Pierre signed for the city's then first division side.\u000a\u000aWithin two years, not only had Nîmes finished runners-up but Jean-Pierre was playing for France -- one of the first black players to do so.\u000a\u000a"He was a force of nature, very strong physically, and he had great determination and willingness," Henri Michel, who played in Adams' first competitive France international in 1972, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"He was formidable, very patriotic and it was a pleasure to play with him," added a man who coached France at the 1986 World Cup. "He started as a forward but then played at the back."\u000a\u000aThere, Adams formed a central defensive partnership known as the "Garde Noire" -- "Black Guard" -- alongside Marius Trésor, a player the Brazilian Pele named, in 2004, among his 125 greatest living footballers.\u000a\u000a"Adams and Trésor have formed one of the best central defensive pairings in all of Europe," no less a figure than German World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer told French football magazine "Onze" at the time.\u000a\u000aArguably, along with previous black internationals like Larbi Ben Barek and Lucien Cossou, the "Garde Noire" helped pave the way for France's 1998 World Cup success. Key players such as Patrick Vieira, Marcel Desailly and Lilian Thuram were born in Senegal, Ghana and Guadeloupe respectively.\u000a\u000aIn total, Jean-Pierre won 22 caps and also played for Paris Saint-Germain and Nice, narrowly failing to win the French title with the latter (again), while also knocking Barcelona out of the 1973-4 UEFA Cup.\u000a\u000aLife was just good off the pitch.\u000a\u000aWith a love of music -- particularly from Brazil -- and a taste for cigars, clothing and bling, Jean-Pierre fully enjoyed 1970s life with Bernadette.\u000a\u000a"He was the 'joie de vivre' embodied in human form -- a laugher and joker who liked to go out," says Bernadette, who is dressed in an à la mode Desigual T-shirt and spotless white trousers on the day we met. "Really, a smile was always bursting out. He loved the good life and was loved by everybody as well."\u000a\u000aAs his career faded, dropping down the divisions, Adams decided he wanted to coach youths and one March day in 1982, he headed off to Dijon for three days of studying and training.\u000a\u000aHe damaged a tendon in his leg while there -- an innocuous injury that would ultimately cast a huge shadow over the Adams family.\u000a\u000aThe 'perfect storm'\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre traveled to the Édouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon for his X-ray.\u000a\u000a"From there, he was to come home," recalls Bernadette. "But he was walking along a corridor in the hospital -- where he knew no one -- when a doctor who knew all about football, since he looked after the Lyon team, walked past."\u000a\u000aStopping to talk, the doctor instantly offered to help and after an instant consultation, he decided upon surgery and booked Jean-Pierre in for an appointment: Wednesday 17 March 1982.\u000a\u000aWhen the date came around, there was a problem. The hospital staff were on strike.\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's case was far from urgent -- he could have soldiered on for a bit -- but the surgery went ahead nonetheless.\u000a\u000a"The female anesthetist was looking after eight patients, one after the other, like an assembly line," says Bernadette.\u000a\u000a"Jean-Pierre was supervised by a trainee, who was repeating a year, who later admitted in court: 'I was not up to the task I was entrusted with.'\u000a\u000a"Given it was not a vital operation, that the hospital was on strike, they were missing doctors and this woman was looking after eight patients, in two different rooms, someone should have called me to say they were going to delay the operation."\u000a\u000aThey never did -- and between the anesthetist and trainee, numerous errors were made.\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre was badly intubated, with one tube blocking the pathway to his lungs rather than ventilating them, meaning he was starved of oxygen whereupon he suffered a cardiac arrest.\u000a\u000a"I found him lying on a bed, tubes everywhere," she remembers after rushing to the hospital. "I didn't leave the hospital for five days. I thought he was going to wake up and that I needed to be there."\u000a\u000aWhen she felt fresh air again, the world had become a very different place.\u000a\u000aLife now\u000a\u000aAfter 15 months in hospital, local authorities suggested to Bernadette that the best place for her husband would be a nearby home for the elderly.\u000a\u000a"I don't think they knew how to look after him, so I said to myself: 'He will come home' and I've looked after him ever since," says Bernadette.\u000a\u000aEvery day, she wakes just before seven o'clock and has her breakfast -- precious minutes spent alone -- as she readies herself to care for her husband.\u000a\u000aIt's a mix of changing clothes, shaving, preparing food -- all of it blended -- and delivering it, which can take an hour, helping Jean-Pierre go to the toilet, while also helping the kinesiologist ensure his lungs are clean and his muscles exercised to avoid choking and atrophying.\u000a\u000aIf she is lucky her day finishes at eight, when Jean-Pierre might go to sleep.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes when the night goes badly, I'm up for the whole thing."\u000a\u000aThe round-the-clock care leaves little time to earn a living, but thankfully for the stoic Bernadette, she receives an annuity after a court ruled in her favor -- albeit after a decade-long legal battle.\u000a\u000a"The process lasted nearly 12 years. I think it's designed to discourage people," she ventures. "If I hadn't had the support of football, I would have been completely broke."\u000a\u000aThe French league, football federation and the Variety Club of France -- a club for former France internationals -- all rallied together to help with her legal fees.\u000a\u000aAlthough the accident occurred in 1982, it wasn't until 1989 that the medical staff were found guilty of 'involuntary injury' --- and even then, it still needed nearly five more years to decide the family's dues.\u000a\u000a"We've played five or six games over the years because we knew that Bernadette was in financial and psychological difficulty," Jacques Vendroux, the general manager of the Variety Club of France, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"Jean-Pierre was someone very appealing and deserved help. He is still alive and that is amazing."\u000a\u000aHe's also made to feel as much part of family life as possible, with his room adjoining the house's focal point, the kitchen-cum-living room.\u000a\u000a"I talk to him all the time -- about TV, what's in the mail, anything!" Bernadette says. "There is always movement around him. He is always next to us."\u000a\u000aWhen I ask whether she ever imagines conversations the pair might have had, the 72-year-old Bernadette momentarily chokes up -- a brief insight into the true cost of the accident for a proud and serene woman.\u000a\u000a"I don't know," she replied. "It's difficult to say. I say he doesn't understand my words but there might be moments when he has a flash. Perhaps for an instant, just an instant, he understands something."\u000a\u000aIt's unlikely though.\u000a\u000aGray hairs\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's brain was so starved of oxygen he suffered catastrophic brain damage, making the prospect of recovery very slim.\u000a\u000a"The more time that passes, the more bothered I get," she says. "His condition does not get any worse, so who knows? If one day, medical science evolves, then why not? Will there be a day when they'll know how to do something for him? I don't know."\u000a\u000aWhile she relentlessly hopes there is, she continues to preserve both his legacy and dignity.\u000a\u000aShe told me long before our meeting that no pictures of Jean-Pierre would be allowed and when I asked if I could photograph the entrance to his room, the answer was Bernadette pushing the door shut -- gently but firmly.\u000a\u000aBut she happily introduces me to Jean-Pierre, who turned 68 on 10 March, but he still looks very youthful -- with just a light sprinkle of gray hairs. He was sleeping, I was told, even though his eyes were open.\u000a\u000aOn his bed was a bright bedspread, a present from many years back, and in the corner a small TV.\u000a\u000aAt one point after he had woken up, Bernadette briefly left the room.\u000a\u000aI stood there awkwardly -- all notions of explaining how I once lived in Senegal pushed to one side as such inane conversation seemed so glib I fell into silence instead.\u000a\u000aWith Jean-Pierre's eyes unable to follow, I felt invisible and, given his situation, both sad and angry.\u000a\u000a"The hospital has never apologized," Bernadette had said just minutes earlier.\u000a\u000aFuture conditional\u000a\u000aJean-Pierre's wife is troubled at present. By the future.\u000a\u000a"Imagine if I die before him, then what would become of him?" she asks.\u000a\u000a"He'll die without being looked after. He needs me to be able to eat, to meet his primary needs. If I don't do it, who will?"\u000a\u000aWhen I ask whether her sons -- Laurent and Frédéric, who were 11 and four respectively at the time of the accident -- could help, she revealed that she was desperate to spare them such a fate.\u000a\u000aHad she ever considered euthanasia for Jean-Pierre?\u000a\u000a"What do you want me to do -- deprive him of food? Let him die little by little? No, no, no," she railed.\u000a\u000aThirty-three years ago as Bernadette drove to Lyon that was also a question that haunted her, terrified she would be asked to agree to switch off the life support machine Jean-Pierre was then on.\u000a\u000a"I try not to think about the accident every day but I have no choice," says Bernadette, who is now a grandmother of three. "Every time I look at him, it is present in my head."\u000a\u000aIn the mid 1990s, when the court adjudicated on the case, both the anesthetist and trainee were given what would appear to be relatively light punishments: a one-month suspended sentence and a fine that translates to some 750 Euros ($815) today.\u000a\u000aDecades on, the Adams family are still paying a far heavier price.

"All these activities we're building are very much nature-based."\u000a\u000aSoaring to new heights\u000a\u000aThe zip line will be longer than 28 soccer fields.\u000a\u000aThere is already a zip line in the region, courtesy of the Jebel Jais Via Ferrata mountain activity, which allows thrill-seekers to traverse more than one kilometer of the mountain.\u000a\u000aBut the new line will take the experience to a new level -- aside from the spectacular length, guests will also be able to fly through the sky face-down in a superhero position at speeds of up to 130 kph (80 mph).\u000a\u000a"The zip line is going to be much more dramatic as it goes through the canyons," says Mattar.\u000a\u000aThe RAKTDA says the zip line will consist of two lines -- allowing people to fly alongside friends and family.\u000a\u000aIt will be open to all ages -- so long as riders meet minimum weight of 35kg and maximum weight of 150kg, and a minimum height of 120cm.\u000a\u000aThe line will be designed to accommodate 250 people a day.\u000a\u000aAs well as private parking, the agency are also making plans to provide a helicopter transfer.\u000a\u000aEco-friendly focus on nature\u000a\u000aThe zip wire will be located on the UAE's highest mountain, Jebel Jais.\u000a\u000aAlongside the zip line, the RAKTDA says a new ice rink and hiking and mountain biking routes are in the works.\u000a\u000aThere will also be a new viewing deck 1,300 meters up Jebel Jais mountain. The terrace will showcase the mountain's spectacular views -- which stretch to the Arabian Sea -- but also promote and protect local flora and fauna.\u000a\u000aThe RAKTDA says it's determined to ensure all new developments are eco-friendly.

The manner of the death was pending as of Saturday evening.\u000a\u000aAt a press conference Monday, police said none of the six officers were placed on leave.\u000a\u000aThey said the teen was handcuffed with his hands behind his back. Officials would not say if the teen was patted down before being placed in the back of the cruiser.\u000a\u000aA memorial was set up in the street where the shooting happened. Friends stopped by to leave stuffed animals and candles.\u000a\u000aThose in the neighborhood said they were shocked because it's normally a quiet area.\u000a\u000aPolice say the teen was a suspect in an alleged robbery. They said two women were sitting in their van in the 2200 block of 10th Street at around 10 p.m. Friday, when they were approached by three males. One of them, police say, showed a gun and demanded money.\u000a\u000aAfter taking property from the women, the three males ran away.\u000a\u000aPolice later went to a home on 7th Street and arrested the three males, who were all placed in separate patrol cars.\u000a\u000aA short time later, a shot was heard from one of the vehicles. Officers rushed out to find a 17-year-old suspect "mortally wounded." A gun was found next to him, Akron police said in a news release.\u000a\u000aThe two other suspects, 18-year-old Matthew Allen and 18-year-old Anthony Criss, have been charged with aggravated robbery and are currently in the Summit County Jail.\u000a\u000aContinuing coverage here.

aV(CNN) Stranded outside in the rising waters of Hurricane Harvey, feverish and in great pain, 14-year-old Tyler Frank tried desperately to think of ways to get herself and her family to safety.\u000a\u000aCalling 911 didn't work. Begging for help on Facebook and Instagram failed, too.\u000a\u000a"I was like, 'Siri's smart enough! Let me ask her!' " Tyler said.\u000a\u000aAnd indeed, Siri was smart enough. With one inquiry to the Apple personal assistant -- "Siri, call the Coast Guard" -- Tyler got her whole family rescued after two days out in the storm.\u000a\u000aSickle cell crisis\u000a\u000aIt happened in the nick of time. Tyler has a genetic disorder called sickle cell anemia. When Harvey hit, she suffered a sickle cell crisis, as her stiff and oddly shaped red blood cells clogged up her blood vessels and prevented oxygen from reaching parts of her body.\u000a\u000aThe pain of a sickle cell crisis can be worse than the pain of childbirth, according to the National Institutes of Health\u000a\u000aTrauma or exposure to cold can trigger a crisis, according to Dr. Titilope Fasipe, Tyler's hematologist at Texas Children's Hospital. Tyler suffered both.\u000a\u000aIn the early morning hours of August 27, Tyler, her mother and three of her brothers awoke to water in their home up to Tyler's chest. Soon, the water was nearly over her head.\u000a\u000aTyler's oldest brother, Joseph, 18, carried her on his back to the roof. Her next oldest brother, Brayland, 16, carried their youngest brother, Jaquarus, 8, on his back.\u000a\u000aShivering in the cold, Tyler had only a towel to protect her. Then the towel got wet.\u000a\u000aConnecting to the Coast Guard\u000a\u000aThat's when she thought of asking Siri to connect her to the Coast Guard.\u000a\u000aShe gave the man on the other end of the line her family's location and explained that she was sick and scared for her life.\u000a\u000aThe man told Tyler she was a brave "guy."\u000a\u000a"I was like, 'I'm a girl!' And he was like, 'oh, you're one brave girl.' And I was like, 'thank you!' " she said.\u000a\u000aafternoon. Tyler's mother, Tameko Frank, A Coast Guard helicopter arrived the followingafternoon. Tyler's mother, Tameko Frank, recorded the scene on Facebook Live.\u000a\u000aOne of the rescuers descended from the helicopter and spoke with her. She said he asked whether anyone was sick. By this time, Tyler had a 103-degree fever.\u000a\u000a"I told him yes, I have a child with sickle cell, and she's very sick, and I need you all to take her," Frank said.\u000a\u000aShe said the rescuer told her he was taking only elderly people, and he would come back for others.\u000a\u000a"She was standing right there in front of him. And he turned around and got on the helicopter and left," Frank said.\u000a\u000aAs she watched the helicopter take off, Tyler said, she felt abandoned.\u000a\u000a"Why did they leave when we really need them?" she said. "It made me cry."\u000a\u000aIn a statement, the Coast Guard told CNN, "Coast Guard first responders were faced with an overwhelming request for assistance due to Hurricane Harvey. On-scene rescue crews made determinations based upon emergent factors (i.e. immediate, life-threatening situations) and the conditions faced on the scene."\u000a\u000aRescue by helicopter\u000a\u000aTyler, a straight-A ninth-grader at Forest Brook High School, was undeterred. She again called the Coast Guard number Siri had given her.\u000a\u000aThe next morning, a helicopter landed, and this time it took her to safety. Again, her mother posted it on Facebook Live.\u000a\u000aTyler was first seen by doctors in Pasadena, Texas, and then sent on to Memorial Hermann hospital in Houston. From there, she went by ambulance to Texas Children's Hospital, where Tyler has been treated since she was a baby.\u000a\u000aFasipe marvels at Tyler's resilience. On top of withstanding two days in the rain and two helicopter trips while sick and feverish, the teen has been in and out of the hospital all her life. At age 3, she had her spleen removed, and she's had six blood transfusions, the first when she was just 6 months old.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"She's got this great sense of humor. She just made us laugh," Fasipe said. "It's so impressive what she and her family dealt with. I don't think most of us can even imagine."\u000a\u000aTyler's challenges haven't ended.\u000a\u000aDischarged from the hospital on Friday, she and her mother and four brothers -- 15-year-old Brayveon wasn't at home when the storm hit -- are sharing one room at a Super 8 hotel off a Houston highway.\u000a\u000aThey have no place to live and no clothes except what's been donated to them. The family has set up a GoFundMe page\u000a\u000a"Our car is gone; our house is gone; everything's gone," Frank said. "We have to start over."

aVMichael Weiss is an international affairs analyst for CNN and author of "ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror." The views expressed are his own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Last month, the Pew Research Center released the results of a survey asking the citizens of 38 countries to name a major threat to their nation. This is the last in a special series of op-eds that also appear in Fareed's Global Briefing looking at the top perceived threats among Americans. You can sign up for the Global Briefing newsletter here.\u000a\u000aA common misperception about ISIS-related terror is that the group's fortunes exist in inverse proportion to the square mileage of territory it controls. Carnage on the streets of London, Istanbul, Brussels, Paris and now Barcelona, according to this conventional wisdom, represents the death throes of a medieval enterprise which is crumbling in Syria and Iraq.\u000a\u000aBy taking out ISIS's administrative centers, revenue streams and willing executioners -- and therefore the symbolic strength represented by all of the above to galvanize new members abroad -- exportation of jihad will similarly wither away.\u000a\u000aYet such thinking ignores the long history of ISIS's foreign operations, which have outlasted the ups and downs in its real estate holdings and have long predated the establishment of the so-called "caliphate."\u000a\u000aA decade ago, European security services uncovered and thwarted a number of Zarqawist plots to bring terror to the continent, even as the warriors of ISIS's predecessor network were escalating sectarian civil war in Iraq and nowhere near being strategically routed.\u000a\u000aAnd well before ISIS lost the Kurdish city of Kobani, in a campaign that marked the initiation of the US.-led coalition's war in Syria and the beginning of its military downfall, the organization had been dispatching agents into Europe for the purpose of building up cells and minting a new rank-and-file of Western-born operatives who needn't have ever stepped foot outside their native countries.\u000a\u000aThis campaign, essentially ISIS's foreign policy doctrine, was built on the initial success of its jihadist nation-building. And it was wholly in keeping with the group's well-advertised total war against the West -- a war that was always meant to be fought not only in the deserts of the Middle East, but in the boulevards of Europe and the United States.\u000a\u000aA defector from the Amn al-Dawla, ISIS's domestic spy service, told me in Istanbul two years ago -- weeks before the Paris attacks -- that he had personally trained two Arab-ancestry French foreign fighters who had subsequently been dispatched back to France. They had volunteered for this coalescing jihadist internationale and their new role was that of semiautonomous overseas assets who, for security reasons, were only be loosely answerable to ISIS HQ.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the true headquarters of ISIS's foreign operations planning, at least for attacks in Europe, was the Syrian city of al-Bab, in Aleppo province. The Turkish military, backed by Syrian rebels, retook it in February, a contingency that has not much disrupted the spate of knifings, bombings and vehicular homicides linked to known ISIS associations in Europe.\u000a\u000aThe now-dead ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, who was also the senior-most official in charge of Syria, issued his infamous injunction, instructing all true believing Muslims living the West -- sometimes known as the "gray zone" -- to murder American, European, Australian and Canadian innocents by any means necessary.\u000a\u000aYet while it's true that Adnani was looking to inspire those with no discernible connection to his organization, the "lone wolf" species of terror plot has actually seldom existed in Europe. What may first appear to be the work of a wannabe or fellow traveler individually radicalized by ISIS ideology, later turns out to have been more carefully orchestrated and staffed operation run by domestic networks that have existed for years.\u000a\u000aThis was certainly the case with the Christmas marketplace attack in Berlin last year, perpetrated by Anis Amri . It also increasingly seems to be the case with last week's Barcelona atrocity.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aAlexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, the research director at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, and a specialist on Islamist terror in the West, told me that "only six out of 38 plots in Europe between 2014 and 2016 were truly planned and carried out by lone actors."\u000a\u000aEven in the United States, he added, around one fifth of the 38 ISIS-inspired domestic plots and attacks between March 1, 2014, and March 1, 2017, involved some form of communication with what he calls "virtual entrepreneurs" -- online case officers employed by ISIS to instruct and provide logistical support for prospective attackers.\u000a\u000aISIS has also built up an array of offshore outposts, what it grandiosely calls wilayats, or provinces, to ensure its survival beyond the demise of its pseudo state. See Afghanistan, Libya, Russia, Yemen, the Sinai Peninsula, Indonesia and the Philippines. This means that despite the Pentagon's cheerleading, even the fall of Raqqa -- the group's so-called capital -- won't mark the end of the ISIS threat to Europe or the United States.

aVPittsburgh, Pennsylvania (CNN) For many Cambodians, a bar of soap is a luxury they cannot afford.\u000a\u000aYet children living in rural areas are vulnerable to disease simply because they are unable to wash their hands.\u000a\u000aAccording to UNICEF, diarrheal diseases alone account for one in five deaths of Cambodian children age 5 and younger, largely due to poor hygiene practices.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, as a college student, Samir Lakhani saw the issue firsthand while volunteering in a Cambodian village.\u000a\u000a"I remember quite vividly a mother bathing her newborn in a basin filled with laundry powder and water," said Lakhani, now 24. "It's an image I'll never get out of my mind."\u000a\u000aLakhani was staying in a hotel in Cambodia, and he realized that one solution to the problem was being thrown away: barely-used bars of soap.\u000a\u000aSo, he figured out a way to save this soap and give it a second life.\u000a\u000aWhile still attending the University of Pittsburgh, Lakhani started the Eco-Soap Bank. The nonprofit recycles discarded bars of soap from hotels in Cambodia and distributes it to people in need.\u000a\u000aWhile there are similar programs that recycle hotel soap, Lakhani's focus in Cambodia is unique.\u000a\u000aToday, the organization has four recycling centers across the country, providing jobs to 35 local women. The used bars are sanitized and remolded into new bars or melted down into liquid soap.\u000a\u000aSo far, more than 650,000 people have benefited from the group's soap and hygiene education.\u000a\u000a"What I love most is that we are killing three birds with one stone," Lakhani said. "We are keeping waste out of landfills, employing locals and spreading soap all over the country."\u000a\u000aCNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Lakhani about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: Why is it difficult for rural Cambodians to access soap?\u000a\u000aSamir Lakhani: First is affordability. If you're earning only $1.50 every single day, you're not going to spend $1 of your daily wage on an imported bar of luxury soap. They're going to prioritize feeding their families. And if they can afford soap, they will pick the least expensive option, which is usually detergent, which is so harmful and toxic on the skin.\u000a\u000aThe second reason is access. The demand is so low, shopkeepers and local markets have stopped stocking soap. The last reason is, very simply, because many Cambodians don't really understand where illness and disease come from, they don't really take the appropriate steps towards mitigating those effects. And that includes use of bar soap.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Heroes: From hotel soap to Eco-Soap Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Heroes: From hotel soap to Eco-Soap 01:48\u000a\u000aCNN: Eco-Soap Bank's work is based in Cambodia and largely run by Cambodians. What are the benefits of being in the same country you're serving?\u000a\u000aLakhani: (It) has a ton of benefits, the first one being able to very quickly respond to outbreaks, such a cholera and impetigo and other things like that. Almost immediately, we're able to use our stockpile of soap and critically address whatever crisis is present.\u000a\u000aAnother overlooked benefit is the opportunity to be able to hire local deserving employees who can immensely benefit from steady employment from our program.\u000a\u000aCNN: What's it like for the women you hire?\u000a\u000aLakhani: Our soap recyclers are all local women who were striving to find some source of reliable, predictable incomes. They face immense hardship. And unless someone is willing to invest in their future, it's hard to crawl out of that. The women that we employ currently have been able to provide for their entire families, pay down debt and resume education for their children.\u000a\u000aLakhani shares a light moment with staff at Eco-Soap Bank--which employs local women\u000a\u000aWe believe very firmly in the intellectual capabilities of our staff members. We provide them with free daily English classes and other business skills training.\u000a\u000aAnd the second type of employee can work from home or they can work from their own store. We give them a free supply of our soap to sell, generate incomes for them and their families, and also generally promote hygiene in the community.\u000a\u000aCNN: What does the future look like for Eco-Soap Bank?\u000a\u000aLakhani: Lack of hygiene is not something that's unique only to Cambodia. It's seen across the developing world. The developing world is also home to some of the busiest tourism centers in the world. We can assume that they're producing equally large amounts of used soap that should be redirected to the people who need it.\u000a\u000aWe're looking at seven countries to expand to. We've scratched the surface. Especially when you see it firsthand, you just realize you really have a lot to do.\u000a\u000aI did not expect to be so effective by such an early age, especially without the previous professional training (to run a nonprofit). If you have one part drive and maybe one part naivety or foolishness, you can do anything.\u000a\u000aWant to get involved?

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 The sun was blazing on the white sand of Dadonghai Bay when Stanley, an endangered green sea turtle, was slowly lowered back into the ocean to begin his new life.\u000a\u000aHe might not have made it there at all.\u000a\u000aStanley hatched prematurely when he was found by fishermen in the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, according to Frederick Yeh, founder of Hainan-based conservation group Sea Turtles 911\u000a\u000a"(He) just couldn't move ... Usually when they hatch they're very active, they're scrabbling across the beach really fast," he said. "It's like a frenzy and that's what gets them past all the predators."\u000a\u000aBut Stanley was different. Within a week of being found he was delivered to the sea turtle hospital and laboratory at Hainan Normal University in Haikou for treatment.\u000a\u000aDozens of other rare and endangered sea turtles just like Stanley have been rehabilitated at the hospitals and labs on Hainan Island, supervised by Sea Turtles 911's Yeh and Hainan Normal University Professor Haitao Shi.\u000a\u000aVolunteers and tourists visiting the turtle labs at the university, located in Lingshui village on the coast, or at the Ritz-Carlton Sanya in Yalong Bay, which teamed up with Sea Turtles 911 to build a Sea Turtle Shelter on the resort's grounds, get a chance to see the creatures up close and personal.\u000a\u000aIt's a rare opportunity, because tourists won't be seeing any of them on the island's beaches -- not anymore anyway.\u000a\u000aHainan Island, the southernmost province in China , has long been renowned in the country for its natural beauty and native wildlife, earning it the nickname "the Hawaii of China."\u000a\u000aBut with sea turtle meat and shells in high demand for years across China, in the past 30 years the animals stopped coming to Hainan to lay eggs.\u000a\u000aNow Yeh and Shi hope to bring them back by educating the population, raising awareness among tourists and rehabilitating and releasing seized turtles.\u000a\u000a"Historically, this is their motherland," said Shi. "So they should return back."\u000a\u000aSanya Bay beach in southern Hainan Island. Turtles no longer come Hainan's famous beaches, due to increased human activity and development.\u000a\u000aSaving Hainan's turtles\u000a\u000aBoth men discovered their passion to save the world's rapidly vanishing turtles and tortoises early in their careers.\u000a\u000aShi was working as a researcher in China's remote Xinjiang province when he realized the problems the reptiles faced.\u000a\u000aIn the 1960s, there were 15,000 Central Asian tortoises every square kilometer in some parts of Xinjiang, according to Shi. By the time he arrived in the 1980s, there were just six.\u000a\u000a"It (made) me realize that turtle species are facing this huge risk of extinction because (they're) very special. With a big shell, it's very difficult to escape, it's very easy to be caught ... those species will be very easy to be made extinct," he said.\u000a\u000aThe turtle laboratory and hospital at Hainan Normal University that houses both salt and freshwater turtles.\u000a\u000aFor Yeh, who was raised in the United States, his first sight of sea turtles on sale in a remote Hainan village deeply shook him.\u000a\u000a"I felt really hopeless at that time ... You would see land turtles and freshwater turtles (in the market) and some of those are legal, but when you see a sea turtle it's clearly not supposed to be there and that's shocking to see," he said.\u000a\u000aIt was in that same village, where he'd seen turtles for sale less than a year before, that Yeh set up his first "turtle hospital" in 2008 and began working to save the region's sea turtles.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't enough to save individual turtles though -- both men wanted to encourage broader change by teaching visitors and tourists about conservation.\u000a\u000aIn 2011 Yeh struck his first deal with a hotel to bring tourists to the turtle hospital in exchange for educating them about conservation.\u000a\u000aHe later opened the Sea Turtle Shelter inside the Ritz-Carlton close to Sanya, in Hainan's south.\u000a\u000a"We had to raise awareness to tell the tourists not to buy these turtle shell products ... It's just the tourists who are coming to Hainan and buying them and creating that market," Yeh said.\u000a\u000aBasketball Hall of Famer Yao Ming and Sea Turtles 911 founder Frederick Yeh release a sea turtle in June 2014 at Sanya, Hainan.\u000a\u000a'I'd never seen sea turtles this up close before'\u000a\u000aThrough the US China Ecopartnership , which began in 2015, young interns from both countries are now arriving by the dozen to work with the two men and their organizations to help protect sea turtles and learn about conservation.\u000a\u000aOne such student, Morgana de Partee from Hawaii, helped guide Stanley back into the ocean on June 16. Another, Elizabeth Liu from Kansas, spent her time caring for the turtles at the university.\u000a\u000a"I remember the first day I came in and saw the turtles," said Liu. "It felt surreal. I couldn't believe it, because I'd never seen sea turtles this up close before. Being able to work with them is something I could never imagine for myself."\u000a\u000aConvalescing inside the university hospital on a recent visit were endangered green turtles, two rare hawksbill turtles and even an enormous loggerhead turtle, rarely seen in the area.\u000a\u000a"It's our first one we've had," Liu said.\u000a\u000aSome came from illegal shipments, which had been seized by police, stuffed together so tightly their shells had chipped.\u000a\u000aOthers had been kept as pets, until they grew too large to keep, while the loggerhead was found stranded on a beach with parasites slowly devouring him.\u000a\u000aNow that the enormous turtle is almost healed, Yeh wants to attach a tracker to him before he's released.\u000a\u000a"Where they forage and where she goes is really important for the conservation of the species," he said.\u000a\u000aA juvenile sea turtle whose plastron was damaged and infected when he was kept as a pet in someone's house.\u000a\u000a'Eye opening'\u000a\u000aYeh said he wants to take classes around the world on virtual tours of the turtle laboratory, using Skype, to teach them about these giants of the sea and how best to help them.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile Sea Turtles 911's partnership with the Ritz-Carlton, Marriott and Sheraton hotels, among others, means tourists can get a rare opportunity to see sea turtles returning to the shores of Hainan, if only to leave for now.\u000a\u000aFor Shi, his dream has always been to pass on his passion for conservation to other people -- to hotel guests, to visitors to his lab and, of course, to his students.\u000a\u000a"Even some students when they graduate from my university, they don't work in sea turtle conservation.

aVStory highlights Women between the ages of 40 and 59 are more likely to experience issues of sleep quality and duration\u000a\u000aSleep and menopausal transition symptoms directly affect each other adversely\u000a\u000a(CNN) Women going through midlife aren't getting enough sleep, according to a new government report.\u000a\u000aMore than one in four middle-aged women reported experiencing difficulty falling and staying asleep four or more times during the week. More than one in three women reported getting fewer than seven hours of sleep per night, on average. Of those, perimenopausal women -- women who were no longer menstruating and on the verge of menopause -- were the least likely to sleep seven or more hours a night. This was followed closely by postmenopausal women.\u000a\u000a"I was surprised to learn that nearly one in two women (in the report) did not wake up feeling well rested four times or more in the past week," said Anjel Vahratian, author of the report and chief of data analysis for the National Center for Health Statistics.\u000a\u000aSleep experts suggest that women within this age range should receive seven to nine hours per night on a regular basis. It can prevent the increased risk for chronic conditions and other adverse health outcomes.\u000a\u000aMore than 2,800 female participants between ages 40 and 59 were asked questions about the duration and quality of their sleep in a 2015 National Health Interview Survey. The questions included how rested they felt upon waking, how short their sleep was and if they had trouble falling or staying asleep.\u000a\u000aRead More

aVStory highlights Jennifer Miller: Louise Linton's Instagram comment shows she is out of touch with the Americans she claims to sacrifice for\u000a\u000aAs the wife of a public servant, it would behoove Linton to be sensitive to the struggles of everyday Americans, she writes.\u000a\u000aJennifer Miller is the mother of three boys. She graduated from the University of Oregon in 1994 and earned an MBA in 2003. Miller has a full-time career as a health care product manager and volunteers with her sons' Boy Scout troop. The views expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) My friends and family will tell you that I have a big heart and am very caring, but that I'm also snarky and unafraid to call things like I see them. I did that to Louise Linton on Instagram the other day, referring to her post about her designer labels as "deplorable."\u000a\u000aI stand by that sentiment. To see someone in her position -- married to a wealthy former Wall Street executive who is now secretary of the treasury and affects national economic policy -- hashtag her luxury purchases when so many Americans are suffering economically is, well, deplorable.\u000a\u000aJennifer Miller\u000a\u000aShe chose to respond in a way that only clarified her privilege by extolling her wealth and position. In a follow-up post on Instagram, she said I was out of touch, which I find incredibly laughable. I don't think she has any idea what everyday Americans deal with, especially when it comes to economic struggles. Since her husband is secretary of the treasury, it behooves her to find out.\u000a\u000aAnd while she has since apologized for her insensitive post, nothing she says now can negate the fact that her initial response to my frustration was to continue bragging about her wealth and to allege that her contributions to society have been more significant than mine.\u000a\u000aAmericans are hurting -- some even dying -- as they struggle with racism, poverty and health care costs. And yet the wealthy Linton defends her boasting and derides me, a hardworking, taxpaying American, in the process. Her husband serves in the executive branch of our government. At the very least, she owes the American people the appearance of compassion and, to use her own word, humanity.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) In "The Deuce," producer David Simon tries to do for the sex trade and 1970s evolution of pornography what "The Wire" did for drugs. After a slow start, this engrossing, characteristically nuanced HBO drama mostly serves up aces.\u000a\u000aOddly, the show's two most marketable elements -- James Franco, and porn, albeit wrapped up in a classy drama -- represent relative weak spots. Indeed, during the opening installment it's easy to think that Simon's last project, "Show Me a Hero," had more sizzle, and the topic there was public housing.\u000a\u000aStick with it, though, and the pieces begin falling into place, adding layers and dimension as the sprawling cast of characters gradually intersects. That yields plenty of knockout performances, even if Franco's isn't among them.\u000a\u000aAs for the subject matter, "The Deuce" makes clear early on that it won't glamorize or sanitize this world of not so long ago. Yes, there's plenty of sex, both stark and graphic, but also the shadow of brutality that the women regularly endure.\u000a\u000aThe series begins in 1971, the year before "Deep Throat" had audiences lining up outside X-rated theaters. Drawing its title from a nickname for New York's 42nd Street in the grimy old days, the show assiduously introduces its roster of prostitutes, pimps, mobsters and police, whose enforcement efforts, or lack thereof, funnel sex off street corners and into new avenues of exploitation.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Architects have long turned to the past for inspiration. In this age of glass and steel, however, they're more likely to be looking for aesthetic influence than technical know-how.\u000a\u000aBut an ancient Chinese construction technique called dougong is a notable exception.\u000a\u000aConsisting of a series of interlocking brackets, this building innovation may be more than 2,500 years old. From Beijing's Forbidden City to Sichuan province's Bao'en Temple, it has helped many of China's oldest buildings withstand earthquakes and natural disasters.\u000a\u000aAnd now some of Asia's architects are looking to revive the ancient technique.\u000a\u000aBuilt to last\u000a\u000aMany structures built during the Tang and Song dynasties featured "curtain walls" which were, by definition, non-load-bearing. As a result, the unsupported wooden beams that shouldered the weight were prone to cracking and splitting.\u000a\u000aDesigners needed a technique which would more evenly distribute the burden across their structures. Their solution was dougong.\u000a\u000aTranslating as "cap (and) block," dougong is a system of wooden brackets that can support the overhanging roofs commonly found in Chinese architecture. The underlying physics are simple: The interlocking brackets transfer weight to vertical columns, lessening the strain on the horizontal beams. Nails or fasteners are not required.\u000a\u000aThis support system meant that even buildings made from latticework and mud could bear the weight of a heavy temple roof. It also meant that wooden frames became much more flexible while still maintaining their structural integrity -- even in structures of substantial height.\u000a\u000aAs well as giving the illusion that buildings are "floating" in their frames, this flexibility offers protection against the forces of nature.\u000a\u000aYingxian County Wooden Pagoda in Suzhou, China.\u000a\u000aThe famous Wooden Pagoda in Shanxi province's Yingxian County is one of countless buildings believed to have benefited from this architectural innovation. Built in 1056, the pagoda straddles the Datong Batin's seismic belt. Yet it has withstood countless earthquakes, even when newer nearby buildings have collapsed.\u000a\u000aHistorian Klaus Zwerger traces the origins of dougong in his book "Wood and Wood Joints: Building Traditions of Europe, Japan, and China."\u000a\u000a"The Chinese building system is based on ratios and proportions," he wrote. "It draws on thousands of years of observations, on which dimensional proportions were structurally suitable and practical, coupled with a growing understanding of which proportions were aesthetically pleasing."\u000a\u000aOver time, dougong has become as much about decoration as engineering, according to Nancy Steinhardt, professor of East Asian art at the University of Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000a"Decorative rather than functional components first appear in the 13th to 14th centuries," she said in an email interview. "As bracket sets became decorative, they also became smaller in comparison to the height of pillars which interlock with them.\u000a\u000a"As one of the most recognizable symbols of Chinese architecture, the use of dougong always references not just Chinese architecture, but China (itself)."\u000a\u000aBetween tradition and modernity\u000a\u000aCafe Kureon, Tokyama, Japan.\u000a\u000aEngineering has come a long way since dougong was last in fashion. But modern-day designers are now adopting the technique to produce stunning and sturdy works of architecture.\u000a\u000aAmong them is celebrated Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, who used dougong-inspired methods for two of his recent buildings: Yusuhara Wooden Bridge Museum and Café Kureon, a 2,120-square-foot restaurant in Toyama prefecture.\u000a\u000aThe China Art Museum in Shanghai -- which was built as the China Pavilion for the 2010 World Expo -- is another modern example. The $220 million-museum's top-heavy design uses dougong-style brackets to support its ever-widening -- and seemingly implausible -- upper reaches.\u000a\u000aChinese soldiers salute under the national flag in front of the Chinese pavilion at the World Expo 2010.\u000a\u000aAs in ancient times, the appeal is both structural and aesthetic, according to director and lead architect at Woods Bagot, Jean Weng. Her firm recently drew up concept designs for a 590-foot-high Beijing building called Dougong Tower, an angular design made from interlocking, stories-high blocks.\u000a\u000a"We appreciate the history and culture in our projects around the globe, (and) in China we always focus on functionality first," Weng said in a phone interview.\u000a\u000a"Beijing is a very historic city, and dougong holds up the Forbidden City. Aesthetics (plays a role) as well, because the shadowing and interlocking (of the brackets) translates well into the building form."\u000a\u000aFor architect Terrence Curry, the appeal of using ancient methods is about finding something that can "speak to craftsmanship and speak to traditional Chinese identity." His 2015 structure Dougong Cube, which now forms part of the School of Architecture at Beijing's Tsinghua University, was constructed using traditional-style brackets and more than 2,000 laminated boards.\u000a\u000aDougong Cube, Beijing, China by Terrence Curry, Wu Chaoyun, He Shen and Cheng Kun.\u000a\u000a"We had to put screws into the joints," he said in a phone interview. "Normally, we wouldn't do that, but we were (using plywood, which is) different from solid wood. It doesn't expand and contract the way that wood does.\u000a\u000a"It has the fundamental structures of dougong, but we (just) aren't using it in the way that it was intended to be used. We're really pulling it out -- emphasizing the beauty and complexity of it, and the intricate way it distributes weight in a very complex way.\u000a\u000a"The shape and function of dougong is directly related to the properties of wood, and the extraordinary ability of the craftsmen who made these great buildings. In this way, there is little need for 'decoration' because the structure and the proportion of the building give it its distinctive look."

"You can see how a castle was built and then rebuilt and expanded, how the walls changed, how it passed back and forth and finally became obsolete."\u000a\u000aPeeling back the layers offers a captivating peek into the past.\u000a\u000aTake Spis Castle, in Slovakia. It started life as a Romanesque fort in the 12th century, before taking on a Gothic turn a century later.\u000a\u000aIn the 15th century, the castle was completely rebuilt. Later, new owners transformed it into a Renaissance family residence. It eventually burnt down in 1780, but remains a relic of these different architectural styles.\u000a\u000aWorldwide influence\u000a\u000aGenoese tower, Saint Florent, Corsica, France\u000a\u000aConnolly's favorite story concerns Mortella Tower in Corsica.\u000a\u000a"It was built in the 16th century, when Corsica was part of the Republic of Genoa, to defend against pirates," he explains.\u000a\u000a"It was later blown up by the British during the Napoleonic Wars, but the structure and design of the tower impressed the British."\u000a\u000aThe design includes a circular tower with a flat roof, ideal for mounting artillery.\u000a\u000a"They took that design and it became the Martello Tower, which is seen all across the British empire," Connolly says.\u000a\u000a"So even though they destroyed the first one they ever found, they liked the idea of it and it became known all across the British empire. The fact that the spelling is different is apparently, I understand, simply a misspelling by the British."\u000a\u000aArresting ruins\u000a\u000aIreland's Ballycarbery Castle is slowing being absorbed by the natural world.\u000a\u000aOther highlights in the book include Ballycarbery Castle in County Kerry, Ireland.\u000a\u000aSituated on a dramatic location on the edge of the North Atlantic Ocean, all that remains of this 16th century fort are the stone walls.\u000a\u000aThe castle was damaged by English Civil War militarian Oliver Cromwell's troops, during his infamous Irish conquest.\u000a\u000aNow this atmospheric fortress is being slowly absorbed into the natural landscape. The walls are clad in ivy and the first floor is covered in grass.\u000a\u000a"It's an interesting idea, how nature reclaims these things," remarks Connolly.\u000a\u000aAnother striking spot is Golconda, near Hyderabad in central India.\u000a\u000aGolconda Castle was the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty (from 1518-1687).\u000a\u000aBuilt in the 16th century by the Qutb Shahi dynasty, the fort formerly housed the infamous Koh-i-Noor diamond -- later owned by Queen Victoria and now on display in Britain's Tower of London.\u000a\u000aThe citadel once included four individual forts, mosques, temples, royal apartments and gardens, now it's an arresting ruin.\u000a\u000aWorlds gone by\u000a\u000aAbandoned forts including Minard Castle, in Ireland, are a gateway to the past.\u000a\u000aSo why are photographers around the world so fascinated by ruins?\u000a\u000aConnolly thinks it's because abandoned places are a meeting place for the past and the present.\u000a\u000a"Abandoned places touch a nerve with people," Connolly says. "We're interested in worlds gone by, forgotten worlds."

aV(CNN) Every 66 seconds this year, an American will develop Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association annual report , released Tuesday.\u000a\u000aBy the year 2050, that number is expected to double to one every 33 seconds.\u000a\u000aThose startling statistics are mirrored worldwide. In 2016, the World Alzheimer's Report estimated that 47 million people around the globe had dementia. To put that in perspective, it's a bit more than the current population of Spain.\u000a\u000aAnd because nine of 10 people with dementia in low- and middle-income countries and half of those in high-income countries are not diagnosed, the global number of people diagnosed is expected to triple by 2050.\u000a\u000a"What is driving these numbers is that there is no disease modifying treatment, no prevention and no cure," said Ruth Drew, director of family and information services for the Alzheimer's Association . "And while U.S. deaths from Alzheimer's have doubled in the last 15 years, an increase of 89%, deaths from other major diseases have been declining."\u000a\u000aFor example, said Drew, deaths from heart disease, the No. 1 killer of Americans, have declined by 14% over the same period while HIV deaths have dropped by 54%, stroke deaths by 21% and prostate cancer deaths by 9%.\u000a\u000a"Other diseases have declined because of significant investments in research that produce treatments and techniques to reduce risk, sometimes even a cure," Drew said.\u000a\u000a"The issue is mainly funding," agreed Rudy Tanzi , a Harvard professor of neurology who also heads up MassGeneral's Genetics and Aging Research Unit. "We are a knowledge-rich yet budget-constrained field. We have many clues about how to stop Alzheimer's, especially from recent genetic studies, but insufficient funds to explore how."\u000a\u000aThe cost to society\u000a\u000aExperts point out that without additional funding and a breakthrough, Alzheimer's could be the disease that breaks the nation's health care bank. In 2017, for the first time, total costs for caring for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias hit $259 billion -- over a quarter of a trillion dollars.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Toll of Alzheimer's Caregiving: Sandy's Story Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toll of Alzheimer's Caregiving: Sandy's Story 03:20\u000a\u000a"Already, Alzheimer's consumes one in every five Medicare/Medicaid dollars," Tanzi said. "With 71 million baby boomers headed toward risk age, this will go to one in three, perhaps in the next decade, at which point Alzheimer's will single-handedly collapse Medicare/Medicaid."\u000a\u000a"It will also impact the work force and our economy," Drew added. "Because every family affected will be making caregiving choices they will have at home. They will be absent more for doctor visits ... and other caregiving duties."\u000a\u000aThere's more. The association's report adds another startling statistic, the hidden cost of caregiving: In 2016, those who took care of loved ones with dementia provided an "estimated 18.2 billion hours of unpaid assistance, a contribution to the nation valued at $230.1 billion."\u000a\u000aAnd that's just the monetary impact of caregiving. Experts say no one can put a number on the emotional and health impact of caring for a loved one with dementia.\u000a\u000a"Alzheimer's is like a leaky boat in a hurricane," said Huntington Potter, director of the Rocky Mountain Alzheimer's Disease Center . "We have to both bail like mad and fix the leaks. Researchers are working hard to fix the leaks, but it will take time; for now, the main load is carried by the bailing caregivers. They are on the front lines in this war against Alzheimer's."\u000a\u000aToll of caregiving\u000a\u000aKristen Beatty is one of those fighting on the front lines. She and her brother, Doug Rider, are caring for their 78-year-old father, Ray, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about 10 years ago.\u000a\u000aRay and Susan Marie Rider at daughter Kristen's wedding in 2004.\u000a\u000a"My father was a lifer in the Air Force, a colonel, a fighter pilot and a Vietnam veteran," Beatty said. "My mom, Sue, was a proper military wife, and between them, they had a 'don't ask, don't tell' attitude about informing us kids about his illness."\u000a\u000aIt wasn't until they took over their dad's care that they learned just what their mother had been going through.\u000a\u000a"He developed a sense of paranoia and thought people were stealing from him and believed everyone was out to get him," Beatty said. "He would go to bed early but then get up and was up all night long, arguing with mom.\u000a\u000a"They would have conversations and arguments over and over again. She wasn't getting any sleep. She was exhausted with the constant care and pressure. But she never once complained. She didn't want us to be scared."\u000a\u000aBut in 2012, after five years of caregiving, Sue Rider dropped dead of a heart attack.\u000a\u000a"We say that she died of a broken heart," Beatty said. "Died from the stress of caring for him. She was eating super healthy, walking every day, taking very good care of herself. So I truly believe it was the stress.\u000a\u000a"It's awful, just awful," she said with a catch in her voice. "My brother and I feel so guilty, because we could have supported her, but she would not ask for help; she would not consider moving him into a facility; she would not go to support groups."\u000a\u000aDoug Rider with dad Ray, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 10 years ago.\u000a\u000aToday, Beatty works with the Alzheimer's Association to call attention to the burden of caregiving. She points people to the resources available to them online and stresses that no one should feel as if they are alone.\u000a\u000a"My mom was the glue of the family, a genuine sweet and amazing soul. It's painful, really painful. What I do today is all powered by supporting her, so that it wasn't in vain," Beatty said. "We collectively as a nation need to step up, because Alzheimer's is an epidemic, and our health care system is not set up to support caregivers."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe cost of Alzheimer's, including caregiving, is a reality that will soon affect everyone, say experts.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people think that 'Alzheimer's doesn't affect me because I'm not old' or 'I don't have it in my family, so it's really not my problem,' " Drew said. "What we've come to understand is, if you have a brain, you're at risk for Alzheimer's disease."\u000a\u000a"If we all live to age 85 -- and who doesn't hope to live at least that long? -- almost half of us will have Alzheimer's disease," Potter said, "and the other half will be caregivers. No one is immune."

aV(CNN) The end is coming. A marvel of this sporting age is one championship away from retirement, 30 seconds or so from consigning himself to history.\u000a\u000aThe age of Usain Bolt is nearly over and so the present must be cherished.\u000a\u000aBolt, the fastest man in history, one of the greatest sportsmen to have ever lived, will run his last race at the World Athletics Championships in London.\u000a\u000aHe will retire having left his mark on history: the first man to win three 100m Olympic titles, the world record holder in both the 100m and 200m, a winner of 23 major gold medals.\u000a\u000aUsain Bolt of Jamaica salutes the crowd after winning 100m "Salute to a Legend " race during the Racers Grand Prix at the national stadium in Kingston\u000a\u000aHis legacy is assured. No man has run with such speed or enjoyed such longevity. The 30-year-old's extraordinary achievements will be looked back upon with wonder by future generations.\u000a\u000aThey will watch replays of the young Bolt of Beijing, hushing the crowd on the starting blocks before bang... history -- his arms raised, thumping his chest, clocking a barely believable 9.69 seconds to shatter the 100m world record.\u000a\u000aThe 21-year-old's speed was jaw-dropping, the other eight men in a distinguished field left trailing in his wake.\u000a\u000aThey were in a different race and this 6ft 5in newcomer was from another planet.\u000a\u000aTwo more gold medals followed on the Chinese capital's lightning-quick track, his 2008 coronation as sprint king complete.\u000a\u000aHearts and imaginations were captured and he has been loved ever since.\u000a\u000aBolt wins the 100m Olympic gold in Beijing\u000a\u000aThe irreplaceable joker-in-chief\u000a\u000aThere have been so many glorious moments.\u000a\u000aBerlin in 2009, when the Jamaican reduced his 100m and 200m world records further; London 2012 when all three of his Olympic sprint titles were retained.\u000a\u000aBack to Beijing in 2015, older, ailing, but managing to fend off the challenge of twice-banned Justin Gatlin to retain his grip on 100m and 200m world titles.\u000a\u000aThen there was Rio last summer, his Olympic farewell ending in further triumph.\u000a\u000aThose who will live in a Bolt-less sporting age will wish they had been there, just as we all want to be inside London's Olympic Stadium on Saturday when the history-maker lines up in the 100m final for his last competitive individual race.\u000a\u000aThe 4x100m relay on August 12 is likely to be his grand encore. The final act of this gilded athletic tale.\u000a\u000aThere is little point asking who will take over once he is gone. No-one can clown around on the start line and execute excellence like track and field's joker-in-chief.\u000a\u000aAs the eight-time Olympic champion himself said this week, it will take more than one athlete to fill his vibrant void.\u000a\u000aSavor him now because Bolt is irreplaceable.\u000a\u000aBolt of Jamaica celebrates winning the Men's 4 x 100m relay at the Rio Olympics\u000a\u000a"It's a simple formula that doesn't actually work," says Michael Johnson, whose 200m world record was thought unbreakable until Bolt broke it ... twice.\u000a\u000aWe asked him how his sport will cope without its showman.\u000a\u000a"The idea that you have an athlete who's the best there's ever been in the sport, who just happens to have an electric personality as well," explains Johnson, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, "you're not going to replace that.\u000a\u000a"That's not going to come around again. It would be ridiculous to look for it and, I think, the sport has made a mistake by relying on that for the last eight years because he was never going to last forever."\u000a\u000aBecoming a legend\u000a\u000aHoping that the show would go on and on is perhaps forgivable. It is easy to forget that even the seemingly superhuman age, just like the rest of us, no matter how effortless and enjoyable they make winning seem.\u000a\u000aA showman supreme, a magnetic personality, he has been likened to Muhammad Ali, though he has stayed away from politics.\u000a\u000aHe has continued to compete because he knew only sustained success would see him ranked alongside the three-time heavyweight champion and Pele, regarded as the greatest footballer of all time.\u000a\u000aHe wanted to be "among the greatest," he said before going on to achieve an unprecedented "triple-triple" of Olympic sprint golds in Rio, though he has lost the 4x100m relay gold he won in Beijing as a result of team-mate Nesta Carter's positive doping test.\u000a\u000a"I am a legend," Bolt has said a number of times, after winning three golds in London, and again in Rio.\u000a\u000aIt would be braggadocio from anyone else but, as he himself has explained, he has proved himself to be the best for nearly a decade.\u000a\u000a"I feel that if you have done something, it is not bragging," he has said.\u000a\u000aBut even Ali, like most in life, had to comeback from lows. It added to his legend. Bolt, however, has excelled at major championships no matter what his form or fitness. His only failure was a false start in the 2011 World Championships 100m final.\u000a\u000aYes, he has slowed over the years and the frequency of injuries have increased. At times, the country boy who began racing to buy his mother a washing machine has also struggled for motivation after achieving more than he ever dreamed.\u000a\u000aBut even Bolt beyond his peak has always managed to be better than the rest.\u000a\u000aThe iconic image of Bolt while competing in the men's 100m in Rio\u000a\u000a"He's just a phenomenally talented athlete," says Johnson.\u000a\u000a"He's absolutely been tested. I don't think that you could discount anything that he's done over the years. Some of the fastest times in the 100m and 200m have come about during his career."\u000a\u000a'You have blessed us with Usain Bolt'\u000a\u000aBolt salutes the crowd after running his final race in Jamaica\u000a\u000aThe sprint freak from a remote Jamaican village has already said his goodbyes to his own; a five-hour farewell in the national stadium in Kingston, a celebration which started with prayers from an ordained minister.\u000a\u000a"We thank you God, for you have truly been good to Jamaica," it began. "You have blessed us with doctor, the honorable Usain St Leo Bolt, the embodiment of sportsmanship, who remind us of the gumption and indomitable spirit of the Jamaican people."\u000a\u000aThirty-five thousand people watched their most famous son run his 84th and last race on home soil. Bolt, so those on the inside say, would have preferred for that to have been his farewell.\u000a\u000aHe is most comfortable at home, living as ordinary a life as a millionaire superstar can. He trains in a public gym, dances in nightclubs. There is no need for private security.\u000a\u000aIt is when he steps onto foreign soil that people become agog by his presence, which means life on the road is mostly spent in hotels.\u000a\u000a"In Jamaica you take it for granted that you can see him every day," says Colin Reid, a photographer who has followed Bolt's career with the Jamaican Observer.\u000a\u000a"In the international fraternity, they're awestruck. But he's just like one of us. He lives in Kingston. He's approachable, he's amiable, I see him around a lot."\u000a\u000aWhat you see is what you get, says Reid, something Bolt has also repeated in numerous reports. He enjoys partying, he is still the boy a teacher once described as being full of "tricks and stories."\u000a\u000aBolt the thinker, the intellectual\u000a\u000aHidden behind the tomfoolery on the track, however, is a thoughtfulness, a keen athletics brain and an intense competitive streak.\u000a\u000aHe is a smiling assassin. His desire to be the best is such that he no longer plays Call of Duty as he cannot cope with not being as good as he used to be.\u000a\u000a"He's much different when he's in a much closer setting," says Johnson.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, I don't think the world has been able to see that he is very thoughtful, highly intellectual about athletics, about sprinting.\u000a\u000a"Most people think that he goes out there and that it's easy and he doesn't really care if he wins or loses, that he's just having fun."\u000a\u000aBolt has said he allowed a film crew to follow him in the year leading up to Rio for the movie "I Am Bolt" so people could see how hard he worked; vomit-inducing track sessions, suffering in the gym, early-morning wake-up calls.\u000a\u000aEd Moses, a two-time Olympic champion who dominated the 400m hurdles in a 122-race unbeaten decade, calls Bolt a mathematician, though when later asked his agent Ricky Simms admits he has never heard his client described as such.\u000a\u000a"He's an intellectual guy," says Moses.\u000a\u000a"He's thought a lot about what it's going to take to get him through the first 40m. He had the tools and resources to put it together and that's why he's great."\u000a\u000aUnlike many of history's great talents, Bolt has been appreciated in his own time. For nearly a decade he has radiated in a sport darkened by doping.\u000a\u000aNine of the 30 fastest 100m times, including the top four, are Bolt's. The other 21 marks on that list have been run by athletes who have, at some point, tested positive for doping.\u000a\u000aQuestions have been raised about Bolt, especially when he first emerged in Beijing. After all, athletes as tall as him are not supposed to run that fast, but the man himself is not bothered by such talk.\u000a\u000aHe is different, a speedster whose long levers allow him to cover the 100m in just 41 strides when others need a few steps more and a little more time.\u000a\u000aAnd so, in under 30 seconds, or 132 steps, Bolt's career will be over. He will be out of sight, as he has been to his competitors for most of his career.\u000a\u000aThere will be no fooling around, no celebratory "To Da World," no electrifying nights under the floodlights.\u000a\u000aIt will never be the same again.

aV(CNN) Banknotes aren't really as distinctive or alluring as they once were.\u000a\u000aBlame it on the advent of plasticization, single currencies or the rise of digital money. But many paper currencies remain deeply idiosyncratic, patriotic displays of the wealth and culture of a nation, adorned with great faces and timeless moments.\u000a\u000aBut what if banknotes came not just from countries, but companies as well?\u000a\u000aMany brands and corporations have greater GDPs, more assets and a higher headcount than some small countries -- so perhaps it makes sense for them to print their own money.\u000a\u000aGraphic and motion designer Jade Dalloul has gone one step further, by imagining what these company-currencies might look like.\u000a\u000aIn a new set of illustrations entitled "Brand Currency," the French designer conjures up a future where the likes of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg have become the new Darwins and Franklins.\u000a\u000a"Banknote aesthetics are really linked to the richness of culture, history and personalities of their countries," he said in an e-mail interview.\u000a\u000aBelow, Dalloul discusses currency, capitalism and cash.\u000a\u000aCNN: Jade, how did the idea come about?\u000a\u000aJade Dalloul: Seeing countries electing CEOs for presidents, and countries behaving like companies was the genesis.\u000a\u000aCNN: How important is aesthetic in designing a banknote -- what is this visual language telling us?\u000a\u000aJD: Banknote aesthetics are really linked to the richness of culture, history and personalities of their countries. On top of that, you have the anti-counterfeiting elements that take (up) a lot of space.\u000a\u000aCNN: What do banknotes tell us about the countries they come from?\u000a\u000aJD: A banknote is a unique object where all the values of a country is summarized. With this starting point, doing a branded banknote is about being coherent with all the values of a brand as if it were a country. Using mission statements as if they were a state or motto.\u000a\u000aCNN: As a European, what do you read into the imagery on a Euro note?\u000a\u000aJD: The Euro note is a great example of embracing imagery to suit all the countries that will use it. Using bridges instead of personalities is a remarkable way to avoid conflicts between different cultures while at the same time symbolizing unification.\u000a\u000aCNN: And how does it differ to the old French franc?\u000a\u000aJD: The old French franc follows the traditional pattern of a national currency: using history, personalities.\u000a\u000aCNN: This project is all about brands -- what role do you think brands play in modern society? Are they growing in importance?\u000a\u000aJD: I'm a daily customer and a user of services and products like Facebook, Gmail and Apple, so I started asking myself if I could stand a single day without using any of these brands. It's getting more difficult day after day.\u000a\u000aCNN: What do you think about this modern generation of superstar CEOs?\u000a\u000aJD: In a way they give hope to younger generations -- they show that it's possible to achieve a lot being young.\u000a\u000aCNN: Which company or personality intrigues you the most?\u000a\u000aJD: Answering the previous question, I had in mind Elon Musk. He has had a great career path, from Paypal to Space X through Hyperloop... and he's still only 46.\u000a\u000aCNN: Are there any that you find particularly worrying?\u000a\u000aJD: I'm both fascinated and worried about Google, because they manage almost every step of Internet services. But the most surprising fact is that they started only 19 years ago.\u000a\u000aCNN: Who do you think we'll see on the banknotes of the future?\u000a\u000aJD: I think the future of banknotes will (see) more and more anti-counterfeiting features like the transparent part on the new British five pound note. I wouldn't be surprised to see some influential young entrepreneurs becoming part of history of their countries.\u000a\u000aThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.

aV(CNN) With the June arrival of their twins , actor George Clooney, 55, and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, 39, reignited a conversation about what it means to be an older dad.\u000a\u000aDespite growing awareness of in-vitro fertilization and aging mothers -- such as Janet Jackson, who gave birth in January at 50 -- some of the science and social impacts of aging fathers are less clear. But that isn't deterring hopeful dads from growing their families.\u000a\u000a"It's very well-documented: Men are having children later into life," said Dr. Mary Samplaski , a male-fertility specialist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California. "It's become so much more mainstream."\u000a\u000aMen's fertility does not drop as sharply as women's as they age, said Samplaski; many can have biological children long after they're old and gray without the need for technology to intervene. But some of Samplaski's patients have questions about the risks of fathering later in life.\u000a\u000aIVF success and struggle\u000a\u000aOne risk for older would-be dads is the potential success of in vitro fertilization, a medical procedure where the woman's egg is fertilized by a man's sperm in a test tube and then introduced into her womb.\u000a\u000aAmong couples requiring IVF to conceive a baby, the likelihood of a live birth is reduced with a father's increasing age, according to a new study presented at a medical conference recently. This is the first study to show that the father's age is a factor in IVF success.\u000a\u000aHarvard researchers analyzed nearly 19,000 IVF cycles performed for 7,753 couples at a Boston area reproductive center between 2000 and 2014. After stratifying the female and male participants into age groups, they compared the ages to successful births.\u000a\u000aLive birth rates were lowest in couples where the female partner was between ages 40 and 42, the researchers discovered. In these circumstances, the male partner's age, whether old or young, did not impact the results. However, when the female was younger than 40, the likelihood of a live birth declined with the increasing age of the male partner.\u000a\u000aFor example, a woman under 30 partnered with a man between 40 and 42 years old suffered lower birth rates (46%) than same-aged women whose partners were between the ages of 30 and 35. Paired with a younger man, nearly three out of four of these young women successfully gave birth.\u000a\u000aThe same was true even among women in the next older age group, between 35 and 40. In these cases, women whose partners were under 30 experienced a nearly 30% improvement in their odds of a successful birth compared to women paired with men between age 30 and 35, the authors said.\u000a\u000aKnowing the risks\u000a\u000aSwedish study in 2014 added to the evidence that dads older than 45 are more likely to have children with schizophrenia, autism and other psychiatric disorders. Still, even for these fathers, the absolute risk was found to be very low -- well below 1% for certain conditions.\u000a\u000aFor one man who saw the study, the findings pushed him into action.\u000a\u000a"I reported on a big study that came out in 2014, and I thought a lot about it, and a few months later, I went and banked my own sperm," former CNN producer William Hudson said in August.\u000a\u000a"I banked my sperm because I wanted to have the option of using younger sperm later in life."\u000a\u000aTo explain the link between mental illness and paternal age, researchers have pointed to the mutations that accumulate in sperm DNA as men get older, which may be inherited by their sons and daughters.\u000a\u000aThere are no genetic tests for psychiatric illnesses such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, Samplaski said.\u000a\u000aHowever, last year, another study in Nature Genetics took an opposing view: Spontaneous mutations in sperm DNA were not largely to blame for the increased risk of psychiatric illness. The researchers found that genes might contribute to this risk, but only a small portion of it -- about 10% to 20%.\u000a\u000aA closer look at the data shows that mental illness isn't just linked to older fathers; there's a risk among younger fathers , too. Some researchers say the focus on mutations could be a red herring. According to the authors of the Nature Genetics study, fathers with a heritable mental illness may simply be more likely to have children at the extremes of age -- perhaps because they socialize or take risks differently.\u000a\u000aThough a similar trend has been found for IQ scores, other studies have refuted those results by taking into account paternal intelligence.\u000a\u000aA number of other conditions have been linked to late fatherhood. One of the most common is a type of dwarfism called achondroplasia, for which there is a genetic test. For men over 50, the risk of achondroplasia is only slightly more common than 1 in 2,000 births.\u000a\u000aHowever, no strong data exist to suggest that children of older parents actually live longer. Some doctors have proposed that aging sperm may come with a benefit: longer telomeres . Telomeres are the tips of chromosomes that protect DNA while it's being copied -- like the aglet at the end of a shoelace that prevents it from fraying. Many scientists believe that longer telomeres signify longevity.However, no strong data exist to suggest that children of older parents actually live longer.\u000a\u000aSamplaski said the risks that concern her patients are not always genetic. For many, it's a simple numbers game.\u000a\u000a"If you're 55 when you have this baby, you're going to be 65 when this kid is 10," she said, adding that people's numerical age may not always be the best predictor of their life expectancy.\u000a\u000a"Most of the couples that are having babies later in life are taking care of themselves."\u000a\u000aToo old for this?\u000a\u000a"I got tons of blowback about it," said freelance writer and television producer Philip Lerman, who has written about his decision to become a father at 46.\u000a\u000aAfter the Clooneys' news spread on social media, some on Twitter compared George Clooney to a grandfather. Lerman said the reactions he received mirrored that.\u000a\u000aIn one Humans of New York photo that drew more than 70,000 responses, a young woman with a 78-year-old father said that it's "hard to be this young and watch them go that way already."\u000a\u000aWhile some children of older parents commented about the difficulties caring for sick and aging parents, others spoke of the valuable lessons they had learned from parents with more life experience.\u000a\u000aAnother story that drew strong responses was a 2011 New York Magazine cover story featuring a white-haired model who was digitally altered to look pregnant placed next to the headline, "Is she just too old for this?" In response to the article, which addressed both men and women, some readers called out aging parents for being "selfish," lamented not having grandparents in the picture and expressed worry about older parents' mortality.\u000a\u000aLerman, now 61, has a 14-year-old son named Max, whom he and his wife conceived using a donor egg. People told Lerman he was "too old" to have a child for many of these reasons. Some suggested that he would have trouble keeping up with a kid and that he might put his future son at risk for genetic diseases.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"I took a chance on having ... a child with problems," Lerman said, adding that it's important to think about the alternative.\u000a\u000a"What if I had listened to them?" he added. "What if ... Max didn't exist, and he didn't get to play Little League, and he didn't get to be the star in the school play last year?"\u000a\u000aLerman admits that he "can't do the things that a younger man can" but said children like Max benefit from parents who have taken time to become more emotionally and financially stable. Where some have criticized his age, Lerman believes that older parents are just one manifestation of the diverse American family.\u000a\u000a"Max has an older dad; his friend has two dads," Lerman said. "We've got adopted kids, multiracial kids. It's a beautiful, wonderful mix in our school."

aV(CNN) For the past two months, I have been a changed man. It is hard to fully describe, except to say my mood is mostly sunny and more patient than usual.\u000a\u000aIn the past, my family and friends would've typically described me as pleasant but hurried. My baseline restlessness and edginess, however, have now nearly vanished.\u000a\u000aWithout difficulty, I have sustained attention when my young children spend time with me. Instead of constant surveillance of my phone, there is an ability to quickly hyper-focus on the task is at hand and a corresponding joy of living in a distraction-less world.\u000a\u000aThis change seems to have started the end of last year, after I spent a morning meditating with the Dalai Lama.\u000a\u000aFirst off: Yes, I do feel a little ridiculous writing a line like that, and I didn't feel worthy of his invitation at the time. Even though I meditate, I've never been sure whether I was using proper technique or whether there was an acceptable way to meditate in the presence of His Holiness.\u000a\u000aIf he was looking forward to a good meditation partner, I worried he was unlikely to find it in me. Even my posture is terrible when sitting cross-legged on the floor. My back starts to hurt, followed by my knees. Thus, my breathing, which is supposed to drive my focus, sounds raspy and uneven. All this makes my mind race instead of slowing down and calming.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Mindful meditation with the Dalai Lama Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mindful meditation with the Dalai Lama 00:50\u000a\u000aJust thinking about meditating with His Holiness was making me anxious.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, who says "no" to a chance to meditate with the Dalai Lama? I agreed to join him early the next morning at his private residence.\u000a\u000aA practice that begins at 3 a.m.\u000a\u000aAt 81 years, old, the Dalai Lama keeps a very active schedule. I met him in Mundgod, India, at the Drepung Monastery, where he was overseeing a symposium bridging Buddhism and science.\u000a\u000aThe monastery itself is a dazzling bejeweled structure built 600 years ago. Inside, there are enormous golden Buddhas standing next to ornate walls. The discussion hall itself is grand but warm, with doors and windows open to the hot South Indian sun.\u000a\u000aFor three days, his Holiness moderated sessions on weighty metaphysical topics such as the criteria for valid reasoning, the fundamental constituents of the universe, origins of life and the subjective experience of the mind.\u000a\u000aIt was fascinating and mind-bending -- but also mentally exhausting. It was difficult to stay awake, let alone keep up with the rapid-fire debate between the Buddhists and the scientists. Yet his Holiness was mentally engaged and inquisitive throughout, even more remarkable given more than half the comments were being translated for him.\u000a\u000aThe Dalai Lama typically wakes about 2:40 a.m. and starts his daily meditation routine at 3 a.m., even as most of his staff is still snoozing.\u000a\u000aThis was the backdrop when one of his senior staff members picked me up outside the monastery early one morning. We drove in a three-car convoy to the gates outside his private residence.\u000a\u000aFrom there, several more staff members escorted us to a small conference room where his security detail was slowly waking and drinking their morning tea. Finally, his chief of staff walked me just outside the personal quarters of the Dalai Lama.\u000a\u000aMeditating is hard for him, too\u000a\u000aThere were a few minor instructions before we entered. Eye contact is not a problem, and shaking hands is acceptable if you use two hands, not just one. Try not to turn your back to him when leaving the room, and instead walk backward, as much as possible facing him. When sitting cross-legged on the floor, don't point your feet at the Dalai Lama. And the correct address is "your holiness."\u000a\u000aShortly after, the doors opened, and I nervously walked into a very modest room where the Dalai Lama was sitting on a raised platform, already deep in meditation. I slipped off my shoes, sat cross-legged at a slight angle on the floor to avoid my toes being pointed in his direction, closed my eyes and started to focus on my breathing.\u000a\u000aAll my meditation insecurities immediately started to kick in. After a few minutes, I heard his deep, distinctive baritone voice: "Any questions?"\u000a\u000aI looked up and saw his smiling face, starting to break into his characteristic head-bobbing laugh.\u000a\u000a"This is hard for me," I said.\u000a\u000a"Me, too!" he exclaimed. "After doing daily for 60 years, it is still hard."\u000a\u000aIt was at once surprising and reassuring to hear him say this. The Dalai Lama, Buddhist monk and spiritual leader of Tibet, also has trouble meditating.\u000a\u000a"I think you will like analytical meditation," he told me. Instead of focusing on a chosen object, as in single-point meditation, he suggested I think about a problem I was trying to solve, a topic I may have read about recently or one of the philosophical areas from the earlier sessions.\u000a\u000aHe wanted me to separate the problem or issue from everything else by placing it in a large, clear bubble. With my eyes closed, I thought of something nagging at me -- something I couldn't quite solve. As I placed the physical embodiment of this problem into the bubble, several things started to happen very naturally.\u000a\u000aThe problem was now directly in front of me, floating weightlessly. In my mind, I could rotate it, spin it or flip it upside-down. It was an exercise to develop hyper-focus.\u000a\u000aLess intuitively, as the bubble was rising, it was also disentangling itself from any other attachments, such as subjective emotional considerations. I could visualize it, as the problem isolated itself, and came into a clear-eyed view.\u000a\u000aToo often, we allow unrelated emotional factors to blur the elegant and practical solutions right in front of us. It can be dispiriting and frustrating. Through analytical meditation, His Holiness told me, we can use logic and reason to more clearly identify the question at hand, separate it from irrelevant considerations, erase doubt and brightly illuminate the answers. It was simple and sensible. Most important, for me -- it worked.\u000a\u000aMeditation for skeptics\u000a\u000aAs a neuroscientist, I never expected that a Buddhist monk, even the Dalai Lama, would teach me how to better incorporate deduction and critical thinking to my life -- but that is what happened.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aIt changed me. And I am better for it. I practice analytical meditation every day, usually early in the morning. The first two minutes are still the hardest, as I create my thought bubble and let it float above me. After that, I reach what can best be described as a "flow" state, in which 20 to 30 minutes pass easily.\u000a\u000aI am more convinced than ever that even the most ardent skeptics could find success with analytical meditation.\u000a\u000aOver the holidays, I spent as much time as possible relaying the Dalai Lama's teachings to my family and friends and teaching them basic principles of analytical meditation. This was the gift I most wanted to share with them. And now with you.

aV(CNN) How tall you are might hold clues to your risk of various health problems, such as blood clots, according to a new study.\u000a\u000aHeight can be an independent predictor of your risk for venous thromboembolism , or VTE, also known as blood clots, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics\u000a\u000aThat blood clot risk was lowest among the shortest women and men and appeared to increase with height, the research showed.\u000a\u000a"Height is not something we can do anything about," lead study author Dr. Bengt Zöller, associate professor at Lund University and Malmö University Hospital in Sweden, said in a news release\u000a\u000a"However, the height in the population has increased, and continues increasing, which could be contributing to the fact that the incidence of thrombosis has increased," he said. "I think we should start to include height in risk assessment just as overweight, although formal studies are needed to determine exactly how height interacts with inherited blood disorders and other conditions."\u000a\u000aIn the United States, blood clots are thought to kill about 60,000 to 100,000 people annually, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u000a\u000aAcross Europe, there are an estimated 500,000 deaths related to blood clots each year, according to a 2014 review paper in the journal Thrombosis Research\u000a\u000aheart problems, The risk of blood clots isn't the only health concern that has been tied to height: Cancer gestational diabetes and even longevity have been linked with stature.\u000a\u000a'Body size in general is an important factor'\u000a\u000ain the developed world. The new blood clot study involved data on more than 1.6 million Swedish men who enlisted in the military and were born between 1951 and 1992, and data on more than 1 million Swedish women who had a first pregnancy between 1982 and 2012. Pregnancy can increase the risk of blood clots, which is among the leading causes of maternal death\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED How dangerous are blood clots? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How dangerous are blood clots? 01:26\u000a\u000aUsing the Swedish Multi-generation Register , the researchers identified siblings of different heights. They also used the national Swedish Hospital Register to track hospital inpatient and outpatient diagnoses of blood clots between 1969 and 2012.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that the risk for blood clots decreased 69% for women shorter than about 5-foot-1, compared with women about 6 feet and taller. The risk dropped 65% for men shorter than about 5-foot-3, compared with men about 6-foot-2 and taller, the researchers found.\u000a\u000aAmong men, an association with height was found for risk of blood clots in the lungs, called pulmonary embolism, as well as in the legs and other locations. Among women, only the risk of blood clots in the legs was significantly associated with height.\u000a\u000aStill, "these clots are deadly because they can break free from the vein and travel to the lung ," said Dr. Mary Cushman, professor of medicine and pathology and director of the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Program at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont, who was not involved the new study.\u000a\u000a"If the clot is big enough, that can cause death, which is sometimes sudden," she said.\u000a\u000aThe researchers also found that the strong association between blood clot risk and height remained among the siblings.\u000a\u000aThe strengths of the new study are its large sample sizes and its utilization of siblings, said Dr. Nesochi Okeke-Igbokwe, an attending physician of internal medicine at NYU Langone Health in New York, who was not involved in the new study.\u000a\u000a"Overall, it is a solid study with good research methodology used," Okeke-Igbokwe said.\u000a\u000a"The bottom line regarding this recent study, whether you are a taller or shorter individual, you must be aware of all the additional lifestyle factors that may increase your risk for blood clots, such as smoking or a sedentary lifestyle," she said. "We have no control over our height, but we certainly can all take the appropriate measures in making healthy lifestyle choices to reduce the risk of various conditions."\u000a\u000aOne limitation of the study was that the researchers did not have information on the participants' childhoods, home environments and diets. However, they used educational level as a measure of lifestyle factors.\u000a\u000aAll in all, "this study adds to growing evidence that body size in general is an important factor to consider in determining the risk of VTE. It also gives us information about why VTE occurs in the legs more often than elsewhere, like the arms," said Cushman, who also serves as editor-in-chief of the journal Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis.\u000a\u000a"Basically, the blood has to travel up a vein against gravity, and when there is a longer distance to travel, there is more opportunity for the blood to clot abnormally," she said. "This is not the case in the arms, for example, where arm movement allows blood to more easily flow out of the limb with the help of gravity."\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to the new study, the "robust" design could be replicated to determine whether height correlates with other health problems, said Ulhas Naik, professor of medicine and director of the Cardeza Center for Vascular Biology Research at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, who was not involved in the new study.\u000a\u000a"Being tall, there are benefits in some ways in some diseases, (and) there is the opposite in some other diseases," he said. "This kind of a study is a good starting point to now look at other diseases."\u000a\u000aCancer risk goes up with height?\u000a\u000aA systematic review paper published in the journal Plos Medicine last year, in which 63 studies on the association of height with cancer risk were analyzed, provided evidence for a potential link between adult height and the risk of colorectal and lung cancers.\u000a\u000aThe paper also suggested that certain genetic factors and biological pathways affecting adult height may affect the risk of those cancers.\u000a\u000aA separate study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2015 provided strong evidence that adult height can be a risk factor for breast cancer in women.\u000a\u000aAs with the Plos Medicine study, the researchers behind the 2015 study pointed to certain genetic factors and biological pathways affecting height as having an important role in the development of breast cancer.\u000a\u000aIs short stature tied to gestational diabetes risk?\u000a\u000aHeight also has been linked to gestational diabetes , which occurs when high blood sugar starts or is first diagnosed during pregnancy.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Gestational diabetes affects mom, baby Replay More Videos ...

aVFreetown, Sierra Leone (CNN) "It happened as if it was a dream," says Gabriel Fattah Manga, recalling the day his world came tumbling down around him, and his life changed forever.\u000a\u000aEarly last Monday morning Manga, 25, was preparing to head to work as a carpenter in the Regent area of Freetown, Sierra Leone, when he realized something was badly wrong\u000a\u000a"The land was trembling and the whole area was trembling with me," he tells CNN, his eyes still red-rimmed with emotion. "I came out to see what was happening. I saw water going down ... When I moved up to three meters, I saw this whole mountain coming."\u000a\u000aA massive mudslide, sparked by heavy rains and flooding in an area that has suffered years of deforestation, was speeding down the slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, towards his home in one of the makeshift shanty towns that dotted the hillside.\u000a\u000aManga survived, but an entire generation of his family was swept away in the devastation.\u000a\u000aGabriel Fattah Manga holds a poster showing the family members he lost in the mudslide that hit Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.\u000a\u000a"I lost my mother Kumba, who I love so much," he says. "I lost my brother John -- I was in love with my brother. I lost his wife Jeneba, their baby Daniel, who is five months old. My elder brother also lost his two children."\u000a\u000aManga now sleeps on a bench outside the single-story brown building his surviving family members call home. Pasted on the wall above the bench is a picture of his mother and the members of his family he has lost.\u000a\u000a"I lost my family, I lost my people. I lost my place," he says, a weary, resigned look on his face. "All has gone."\u000a\u000aHundreds still missing\u000a\u000aManga is far from alone. According to the latest death toll, 499 people, including more than 150 children, were killed in the Regent mudslide.\u000a\u000aHundreds more remain missing, and relatives are losing hope that their loved ones will be found alive.\u000a\u000aHawa Marah and her grandson. She lost three of her five children, and her home in the disaster and doesn't know where she and her family will live going forward.\u000a\u000aMariama Koroma, 23, sits across the street from Manga's home, outside the small building where she and some 50 other women and children are sheltering, clutching a photograph of her five-month-old niece Mariatu.\u000a\u000aMariatu and her mother, Koroma's older sister Fanta, 35, have been missing since a tide of sodden red earth swept away their home. The family has been unable to find any sign of them where their house used to stand.\u000a\u000a"When I go there, I didn't see her house. We've driven everywhere and we can't find her body," she says. "The bodies are under there. My mother is now unconscious. I'm worried that she will not make it."\u000a\u000aInside the dark, cramped shelter, Wuiatu Kondeh sits on a still-wrapped mattress. Clutching her two-year-old daughter, she weeps as she tells of how she escaped from the mudslide, only to realize she couldn't find her husband, Lansana, 25, a motorbike taxi driver.\u000a\u000aWuiatu Kondeh weeps while holding her daughter Antoinette. She lost her husband, uncle, sister, and her sister's children in the mudslide.\u000a\u000a"We saw the hill coming down and we ran away," she says, remembering fragments and details of that day. "Someone carried my child. I didn't have my slippers."\u000a\u000a"Later, I looked for my husband and I didn't see him," she says, sobbing quietly, her face etched with pain. "I didn't see my uncle ... my sister, she lost two of her children.

aVKatie Hunt, CNN \u2022 Updated 7th July 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 A skull pokes out of a coffin made out of roughly hewn planks of wood, its smooth white surface catching the reflection of the winter light flooding into the dark cave.\u000a\u000aIt's one of about 30 caskets anchored on a limestone rock about 30 meters (almost 100 feet) up the side of a cave in Guizhou province in southwestern China. It could date back hundreds of years. The coffins, inside and out, are littered with fragments of clothes, bones and ceramics.\u000a\u000aFor three decades, Wong How Man, a Hong Kong-based explorer, has been hellbent on chasing coffins like these in gravity-defying graveyards across China in an attempt to discover more about this unusual burial custom.\u000a\u000aWong, who began his career as a journalist with National Geographic, first came across a group of coffins perched 90 meters (300 feet) up a cliff face in southern Sichuan, to the north of Guizhou, in 1985 during an expedition to track the Yangtze River from mouth to source.\u000a\u000aA life-long obsession was born.\u000a\u000a"At first, it was simply how the hell did they get there and then I couldn't stop thinking about why," he says. "And there're so many theories."\u000a\u000a"Hanging coffins" rest in a cave in Guizhou, southwest China.\u000a\u000aCoffin-chasing\u000a\u000aHanging coffins, as they're known, are found across a swathe of central China -- mostly in remote valleys to the south of the mighty Yangtze River, which flows from the Himalayan foothills to China's eastern coast.\u000a\u000aThe coffins rest in a variety of formations, sometimes barely visible from the ground below. They're lined up in the crevices in the cliff face, balanced on wooden cantilevered stakes, placed in rectangular spaces hewn in the rock face or stacked high up in caves like those Wong saw on his latest coffin-chasing expedition to Guizhou.\u000a\u000aThe oldest are said to be in the eastern province of Fujian, dating back 3,000 years. There's no clear reason why this practice took place.\u000a\u000aAncient literature from the Tang Dynasty suggests that the higher the coffins were placed, the greater the show of filial piety to the deceased. Others say the reasoning was more practical: It prevented animals from poaching the bodies and kept land free to farm.\u000a\u000aNew sites are still being discovered. In 2015, the People's Daily newspaper reported that a total of 131 hanging coffins were discovered in the central province of Hubei, placed in man made caves in a cliff 50 meters wide and 100 meters high.\u000a\u000a"Experts haven't figured out how ancient people managed to transport the coffin, body and funeral objects -- together weighing hundreds of kilograms -- to the cliff caves," the report said.\u000a\u000aMany questions, few answers\u000a\u000aIntent on discovering more about this extraordinary practice, Wong began to amass a library of what little scholarly research had been carried out on the practice. He published his first paper in 1991 in a US archeology journal.\u000a\u000aHowever, it wasn't until 2000, once Wong had founded the non-profit China Exploration and Research Society (CERS), that he was able to get up close and excavate one of these high-rise cemeteries -- at a site named Washi in northern Yunnan not far from the first site Wong laid eyes on.\u000a\u000aThe site in Washi, Yunnan where Wong's organization conducted an archeological excavation.\u000a\u000aHe and his team rapelled down the cliff face to assess the coffins, which rested on rotting stakes of wood. They then built bamboo scaffolding to secure the most vulnerable coffins, which also allowed them to examine and document the contents.\u000a\u000aWhat he found raised more questions than it answered. The oldest coffins dated back to the Tang dynasty but many contained bones from multiple bodies. Wong believes the bodies would have been buried first and the bones put in the hanging coffins once the bodies had decomposed.\u000a\u000aThe coffins, which were dug out of a solid piece of wood, were then packed with sand -- making them enormously heavy. "They must have known they would eventually fall down," says Wong.\u000a\u000aRapelling down a cliff to get a look at the coffins.\u000a\u000aWong's research has tied the burial custom to the Bo people -- a rebellious minority tribe that once inhabited the border between today's southern Sichuan and northwestern Yunnan provinces.\u000a\u000aIt's thought they disappeared in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), persecuted by military expeditions led by China's Imperial Armies. But Wong believes some remnants of the tribe assimilated into other local minority groups and may have survived secretly until today. His research formed the basis of a 2003 Discovery Channel documentary on the hanging coffins, where they attempted to recreate how the caskets would have been transported up the cliff face.\u000a\u000aSome believe they were lowered down from above while others believe they were raised up via scaffolding.\u000a\u000aIt's not just the mind-blowing effort it must have taken to erect the coffins that makes the cliff and cave burials so fascinating. The custom seems so at odds with underground burial and cremation -- the way most modern societies, including China's, handle death.\u000a\u000aBut the open-air burials do have something in common with other funerary practices in China's borderlands. Tibetans and Mongolians practice sky burials -- where bodies are chopped up and offered to vultures or other animals.\u000a\u000aIn more recent years, Wong's obsession has taken him to Sagada, Luzon, in the Philippines, where cliff burials were practiced as recently as 2007.\u000a\u000aCliff burial site in Sagada, Luzon in the Philippines.\u000a\u000aNo protection?\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, I inadvertently rekindled Wang's interest in China's hanging coffins when I shared some photos of the caskets in a cave in Guizhou I came across unexpectedly during a trip to the province in 2016.\u000a\u000aNever having heard of hanging coffins in this area, Wong set out from his China field office in Kunming in the neighboring province of Yunnan with a small team to find out more. The cave where the coffins are located is only accessible by river, which emerges from the spectacular limestone cave where the coffins are stacked.\u000a\u000a"I like when information comes to me like this in a personal way," says Wong. "The Internet, there's so much information available. It takes away the joy and the reward for big effort. I like the footnotes."\u000a\u000aThe Guizhou cave with the coffins is only accessible by river, where bamboo rafts are the traditional form of transport.\u000a\u000aLi Fei, a researcher at the Guizhou Provincial Institute of Archaeology, says that there were up to 100 cave coffin sites in the province and the burial practice was followed by Yao and Miao minorities in the region. Most of the coffins date back to the Ming or Qing (1644-1912) dynasties, he adds, though some date back to the Tang dynasty.\u000a\u000aThe Guizhou site Wong and I visited, like others, wasn't well-protected. Reluctant to scramble up the rocky sides of the caves I didn't get close, but Wong said that while some of the 30 or so coffins were intact, most were falling apart -- bones and disintegrating clothing visible.\u000a\u000aWong was told that there used to be more than 300 coffins in an elevated part of the cave but a fire destroyed them.\u000a\u000aBanknotes have also been left by more recent visitors to the site, a superstitious offering for the dead, though not all visitors are respectful -- one skull had a cigarette jutting out of its jaw. In a steep gorge down river, local tourist authorities have erected fake hanging coffins -- perhaps an effort to satiate tourist curiosity and preserve the existing site.\u000a\u000aThe stunning karst scenary near the Guizhou cave.\u000a\u000aLooting\u000a\u000aIn 1999, at one of the most famous hanging coffin sites in Matangba, Sichuan, which Wong had first visited in the 1980s, he discovered that many of the coffins had been looted -- despite being some 90 meters above the ground and being protected as "national cultural relics." The swag allegedly included ancient swords and other valuables, says Wong.\u000a\u000a"Going back 20, 30 years, yes China had different priorities and limited funding, but today China has such influence and (protecting these sites) would be small change. It's about the integrity of the their culture and cultural identity. "\u000a\u000aAn event held by the Chongqing Cultural Heritage Research Institute.\u000a\u000aXu Jin, a researcher at Chongqing Cultural Heritage Research Institute, studies a hanging coffin site at Longhe, near Chongqing, where coffins are grouped by families. He's held educational events to teach people about the coffins.\u000a\u000aHe says in a karst region where caves and cliffs are plentiful, burying the dead at a height might have seemed a better option than in land that erodes easily and is prone to sinkholes.\u000a\u000aLittle studied\u000a\u000aArcheology in China is a well-funded and well-regarded field but the study of the suspended coffins appears to have been neglected.\u000a\u000aAnke Hein, an archeologist at Oxford University, who has studied burial customs in western China, says the phenomenon straddles different time periods, geographical regions and even disciplines -- falling between archeology and anthropology.\u000a\u000a"I'm sure if someone really wanted to do this they could," says Hein. "But you would need the cooperation of difference provinces and local governments, which is difficult, and requires a lot of energy."\u000a\u000aBamboo scaffolding erected to allow a CERS team to excavate the coffins in Yunnan.\u000a\u000aMost expertise seems to be regional, confined to provincial bureaus that focus on individual sites rather than the practice as a whole.\u000a\u000aThe earliest mention of them in Wong's library is an account by a US missionary in the 1930s. The most comprehensive study in Chinese is by a scholar named Chen Mingfang, who was colorfully profiled by the Los Angeles Times in 2001 . Now likely in her seventies, CNN was unable to track her down.\u000a\u000aWong's spent much of his career exploring, documenting and trying to protect traditions like these in China's borderlands but he doesn't think the mystery of exactly how or why people chose to bury their dead in this way will ever be known.

The remaining 55% is drawn from the national grid.\u000a\u000a"The long-term plan is to have the airports generate their own energy," says ACSA corporate affairs senior manager, Senzeni Ndebele.\u000a\u000aThe company intends to "greenify" all its airports and achieve carbon neutrality by 2025, Ndebele explains.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1 / 23 The Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, Mpumalanga: Claimed to be the world's largest green canyon, the reserve is home to a 33-kilometer gorge, abundant wildlife and dramatic landscape.

aV(CNN) Editor's Note: Generation whining has become nearly a national pastime. Millennials say they have it the worst. Generation X feels neglected. Baby boomers are tired of being called narcissistic. In articles and cartoons everywhere -- from CNN to The New York Times to Gizmodo and beyond -- critics call out this generation's sense of entitlement, that generation's self-absorption . We invited writers, activists and CNN contributors from different generations to hash it out.\u000a\u000aJeff Yang: Generation X is bitter\u000a\u000aI belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We're the cohort everyone skips over \u2014 the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.\u000a\u000aYet, despite our generation's small size and overlooked status, we've nevertheless been handed the job of being America's cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we're raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution. In return, the world called us slackers. Is there any wonder we're bitter?\u000a\u000aJeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including PRI's "The Takeaway" and WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show." He is the co-author of "I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action."\u000a\u000aPaul Begala: Boomers, worst generation ever\u000a\u000aSixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire , "The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history."\u000a\u000aNearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I'd like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever\u000a\u000aPaul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.\u000a\u000aIn the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds -- in blood and treasure -- has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)\u000a\u000aI'm at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 60 iconic moments from the 1960s 60 iconic moments from the 1960s \u2013 Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll defined the 1960s.

We've seemingly made " changing the world " with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world -- we're upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).\u000a\u000aDasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000aBut in dismantling old models, we're also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It's harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won't necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.\u000a\u000aThis is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.\u000a\u000aOf course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.\u000a\u000aWe're faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.\u000a\u000aSo, take some pity on us when you're judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it's that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn't sit right.\u000a\u000aWe're the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.\u000a\u000aDasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global, a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.\u000a\u000aPepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation\u000a\u000aFor me, it's a tale of two cities.\u000a\u000aOne city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women's liberation.\u000a\u000aPepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.\u000a\u000aMost of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights -- we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.\u000a\u000aBut there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a "cocktail," general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.\u000a\u000aOur generation was mixed. But I've been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.\u000a\u000aPhotos: 70 historic moments from the 1970s Pop culture and politics collided on December 21, 1970, when the King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley, visited President Richard Nixon in the White House Oval Office.

I've been told I don't text back fast enough to be a millennial -- but I also don't have Kurt Cobain's death circled (in black) on my calendar, so maybe I'm not so gen X. I can quote "Reality Bites," a staple of the 30s to 40s set, but I also use Snapchat.\u000a\u000aI'm both and neither. Generation-adjacent.

Which is to say that we're not boomers -- or anything the boomers say about us. They're so en-TITLED, so NEEDY, so stuck in their little gadgets or whatever. You've heard that junk for years. It's almost trite to repeat. But since boomers run the media and the job market, there seems to be no shortage of "trend piece" drivel about the vapid millennials and our shoddy work ethic. If the boomers took 10 minutes to listen, they'd notice that young people today have it worse. The job market's better but still rough; part-timing's the norm. This is the age of inequality, climate change and anti-immigrant sentiment. We millennial-adjacents may seem wayward and indecisive -- but we're light years ahead on all those issues.\u000a\u000aIt's the boomers holding us back. I mean -- it is, right?\u000a\u000aJohn D.

Then someone hiccuped and historians went generic: gen X, gen Y and gen Z.\u000a\u000aIf I were a member of generations X, Y or Z, I'd be miffed. Candidly, it's a wonder they don't suffer from an identity crisis. On top of bearing names as sterile as a supercomputer lab, they have to hear how they're all "me, me, me," and (further) will be the first generations to do worse in America than their parents. All I can say is that I will take the blame for the world that generations X through Z inherited from us. But, please do remember, we have not only lived through the traumas of our times, but yours as well.\u000a\u000aFor all our faults, any generation that produced Dolly Parton, Elvis, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen -- not to mention Steve Jobs and Bill Gates \u2014 has to be considered the best.

Cable news and the Internet didn't exist. Most music came from static ridden AM radios.\u000a\u000aIn school sports, not everybody made the team. Parents didn't "helicopter" their kids. College students traveled between home and school by hitchhiking to save money. We didn't believe in haircuts or the Vietnam War. Everyone was afraid the Russians were going to nuke us. People under 25 feared getting drafted into the military if they didn't volunteer. A lot of my friends did and many got killed.\u000a\u000aPaul Callan, from his Boston College Law School ID in 1975, when he was 25 years old.\u000a\u000aIn 1975, the starting salary for district attorneys in New York was $11,500 per year. When I began my legal career at the Brooklyn DA's Office, I didn't get a paycheck for six months because of New York City's financial crisis. The crime rate was three times higher than it is now and was handled by one-third the number of assistant district attorneys. We often worked nights and weekends for no extra pay. Didn't matter since we weren't getting paid anyway.\u000a\u000aAt work, there were "typewriters," "carbon paper" for making copies and "white out" to correct errors. Spellcheck had not been invented. You had to get it right the first time or you would look like an idiot to the judge because of all the white out on your document. Public telephone calls were made from "phone booths": the place where Clark Kent changes into his Superman costume.\u000a\u000aCigarette smoke hung in the air everywhere as smoking was permitted in offices, bars, restaurants, buses, movie theaters, airplanes and even in courtrooms and hospitals.\u000a\u000aPeople who owned cars put "No Radio" signs on them because thieves smashed car windows and stole radios all the time. Replacing the glass was more expensive than the radio.\u000a\u000aIn 1977, New York's power system failed for over 24 hours and the city descended into a night of terror and looting. A serial killer called "Son of Sam" was still on the loose that night. But we survived.\u000a\u000aWe boomers are tough, resilient, hardworking and creative.

It's pretty clear, for instance, that every generation wishes it could claim Bob Dylan. Boomers win on that one. Debating which generation had it tougher, however, depends.\u000a\u000aMatthew Segal providing testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in 2009.\u000a\u000aTo a certain extent, there have always been throngs of poor youngsters who work for minimum wage, toil as unpaid interns, or slog through as chronically underemployed baristas. What's alarming these days is the acute degree of income inequality Americans face: the highest since 1928. The house you are born into is much more likely to dictate your socioeconomic status than just about anything else.\u000a\u000aThe cost of college also matters -- a lot. Since 1978, university tuition has ballooned over 1000%. The notion of higher education has shifted. Ben Franklin, for example, saw it as a public good. Now it's seen more as a private commodity, financed largely through student loans. These loans are holding America back: A $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis means houses, cars and goods are less affordable for young Americans, and that in turn drags down our entire economy.\u000a\u000aMaybe we should compare ourselves to other countries where college is virtually free, or our friendly neighbors up north where upward mobility is on the rise, rather than previous or future generations in America.\u000a\u000aMatthew Segal is the co-founder of Attn.com and OurTime.org , advocacy organizations for young Americans.\u000a\u000aSarah Burris: Well, we all dislike Congress\u000a\u000aThe real reality that bites is that every generation was screwed by the economic dip, but every generation has an opportunity to try to fix it.\u000a\u000aMillennials are lucky in that we have nothing like the Great Depression or the World Wars.\u000a\u000aSarah Burris, third from left, in Chinatown with her friends.\u000a\u000aWe are the most diverse generation in American history. We are also incredibly progressive.\u000a\u000aWe are creative and have used our ideas to make new things. Boomers invented the Internet, generation X improved it, and millennials found how to bring people closer through it. Even though we join all other generations in hating the nonsense that is the U.S. Congress, we remain optimistic that government can be used as a tool to help people, or, if you're a "Daily Show" fan, something to laugh at.\u000a\u000aLike those who came before us we're neither better nor worse, good nor bad. We're different, and we bring different experiences and understanding to the table. There's no competition. We're in the same boat trying to do what we can with what we've got to make a better world.\u000a\u000aSarah Burris is a former editor at Future Majority.

aVSister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of " Dead Man Walking ." The views expressed are her own.\u000a\u000a(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.\u000a\u000aAs I was writing "The Death of Innocents," I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was "taking him on" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, "And I'll be right back at ya!"\u000a\u000aIn "Innocents," I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams , whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the "machinery of death."\u000a\u000aScalia's experience of the "meaning" of capital punishment, as he described it in one of his dissenting opinions, couldn't have been more different from my own. In the marble confines of the court, he argued interpretation of Constitutional texts, while I, in state killing chambers, accompanied real human beings -- six of them -- to their deaths, which were a direct result of Scalia's interpretations.\u000a\u000aIn grasping the "meaning" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.\u000a\u000aOne thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his "originalist" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.\u000a\u000aAfter all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal "experts," every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?\u000a\u000aPhotos: Death row's nun Sister Helen Prejean has been on a mission to end the death penalty for three decades.

Hide Caption 13 of 13\u000a\u000aI have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.\u000a\u000aAs for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.\u000a\u000aGiven what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.\u000a\u000aIn 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.\u000a\u000aI say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in"The Death of Innocents," taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.\u000a\u000aThree years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented . In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on "cruel and unusual punishments."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes 02:04\u000a\u000aIn his dissent , Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of "idiot" as "such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is." According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's "idiot" test.\u000a\u000aMy second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.\u000a\u000aThese stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by "modern trends," as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Women of death row Kelly Renee Gissendaner was executed by lethal injection on Tuesday, September 29.

Statements such as these:\u000a\u000a-- "It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States."\u000a\u000a-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, "The powers that be are ordained of God," to mean: "Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy."\u000a\u000aDemocracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.\u000a\u000aWhere was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking "an eye for an eye," to pray for and forgive our enemies?\u000a\u000aIn Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.\u000a\u000aIn this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem "enemy."\u000a\u000aIt seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.\u000a\u000aI also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom "equal justice under law" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.

aV(CNN) An experimental blood test can accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia , according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Though still in development, the test may someday be used to diagnose other degenerative brain disorders and even mild cognitive impairment resulting from head injuries.\u000a\u000aThe researchers say that using the test, they were able to identify Alzheimer's patients with up to 86% sensitivity and specificity. (Sensitivity refers true positives identified by the test, while specificity refers to true negatives.) The test also differentiated Alzheimer's from dementia with Lewy bodies , a related condition, with 90% sensitivity and specificity.\u000a\u000aThe new test's "accuracy is markedly higher than other tests being developed," said senior study author Francis Martin , a professor in the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Central Lancashire in the United Kingdom. "For such a simple test to be so predictive is very exciting."\u000a\u000aThat said, he himself was surprised by the accuracy, given that other researchers have not achieved similar results using more sophisticated approaches, Martin wrote in an email.\u000a\u000a'Life-changing' diagnosis\u000a\u000aToday, there's only one conclusive test for Alzheimer's diagnosis: a postmortem examination of a patient's brain.\u000a\u000aYet while a patient is alive, doctors diagnose the disease based on a careful evaluation that includes brain scans and in-depth mental testing, according to the website for the Alzheimer's Society , a registered UK charity that funds research.\u000a\u000a"Current methods of diagnosing dementia can be slow and expensive, so finding a cheap, quick test that can accurately identify if someone has dementia is a top priority for researchers," said Doug Brown , director of research and development at Alzheimer's Society. The society did not fund the new study, and Brown did not participate as a researcher.\u000a\u000aA diagnosis of dementia is life-changing. With early detection, medical interventions have the best chance of slowing the progress of disease, according to the society.\u000a\u000aFor the study, the researchers enlisted the help of 347 participants with neurodegenerative diseases, plus 202 healthy people serving as a comparison group. Participants ranged in age from 23 to 90. The researchers took blood samples from all the volunteers and analyzed the samples with infrared spectroscopy.\u000a\u000aThis is "a sensor-based technology that has at its core a diamond," Martin explained. "Light is passed through the diamond and bounces off the surface of the diamond. As it does so, the light interacts with chemical bonds in the sample and these vibrate at a frequency that is detected."\u000a\u000aThese frequencies reveal the chemical bonds in the blood, which indicate whether the blood contains traces of a neurodegenerative disease -- and, if so, which kind, he wrote.\u000a\u000aUsing this test, Martin and his colleagues correctly identified early cases of Alzheimer's disease with 80% sensitivity and 74% specificity and later stages of the disease with up to 86% sensitivity and specificity when using other patient data.\u000a\u000aBeyond a clinic or laboratory's initial outlay for instrumentation, equating to about $50,000 -- "not much really" -- recurrent costs for individual patient tests would be "negligible," Martin noted.\u000a\u000aEveryday people and athletes, too\u000a\u000aFor people with signs of mild cognitive impairment, the test could help doctors "monitor disease progression, tailor treatment based on disease classification and predict progression," Martin said.\u000a\u000aNot only would the general public benefit from this test, Martin said, it could be used as a post-injury diagnosis for athletes, including football players and boxers.\u000a\u000a"We have now gone well beyond pilot studies," Martin said of the new test. "The appropriate validation studies are next -- these will take five to 10 years."\u000a\u000aBrown agreed that more time and study are necessary before the new test can be used by doctors.\u000a\u000a"The accuracy is not yet high enough and would currently lead to mis-diagnoses," he wrote in an email. "More development is needed to improve the accuracy before the test could reach the clinic." More study is also need "to ensure these results can be reproduced and replicated."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Along with detecting dementia early, this approach has the potential to differentiate between different types of dementia," he wrote, adding that the study is not unique.\u000a\u000a"Blood tests are being widely investigated as a potential way to identify people with dementia," Brown wrote. "Alzheimer's Society is also funding studies that identify a wide range of biological signals through cerebrospinal fluid, brain scans and saliva to better detect who is at risk of developing dementia."

aVJen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. She also was a consultant for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Follow her: @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers\u000a\u000aThey typically include scripted remarks, and they last for about 24 hours -- or less. Just a few minutes into his speech at a rally in Phoenix Tuesday evening , the clock ran out. And it quickly went off the rails.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't just a speech lacking structure, or focus, or message. It was an unhinged rant from someone who is supposed to be leading our country and bringing us back together after one of the toughest weeks of his presidency\u000a\u000aIf the goal was to fire up his base and throw red meat -- ranging from attacks on the media to a threat to shut down the government over building a transparent border wall to a wink and a nod about pardoning the divisive ex-Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, a man who was still a birther even after Trump had stopped making the claim -- well, they got that job done. But for what?\u000a\u000aEven with a slight dip among Republicans in some recent polls , President Trump's biggest challenge is not to fire up his base or to worry about his re-election campaign in 2020.\u000a\u000aHe has no legislative legacy-building accomplishments under his belt -- beyond his former friend Sen. Mitch McConnell successfully pushing through Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court . And for the first time in modern American history, there are legitimate questions, prompted by no one other than Donald Trump himself, about whether the President of the United States sympathizes with white supremacists.\u000a\u000aThe words President Trump used in his Afghanistan speech on Monday night were a dramatic improvement from last week (putting aside the fact that no President in modern history has ever felt the need to begin a prime-time address by disavowing racism because the country he leads had doubts.) Still, at Fort Myer on Monday, Trump appealed to the country to be unified.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump: Our movement is built on love Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Our movement is built on love 00:51\u000a\u000aThat was never going to mend the hurt and anger from the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, because words alone rarely do, and they didn't even calm the fears many people in the country have about the sitting President's racial bias -- because we know Trump well enough now to know that a one-off set of scripted remarks rarely represents his overall point of view and thinking. But it was a small step in the right direction.\u000a\u000aNo surprise he took a flying leap in the other direction in Phoenix on Tuesday night, and delivered a speech that was all about division.\u000a\u000aHe spent several excruciating minutes reading from his own statements of last week and defending them. It was the media's fault -- not Donald Trump's, he said. It was as if he was not aware that there is a record, a well documented one, of what was said last week, when he suggested that there was fault on "many sides" for the violence and that there were "very fine people" associated with the white supremacists as well as the counter-protesters.\u000a\u000aAnd because that wasn't enough -- and because alienating the African-American community last week was not enough -- he decided to raise the possibility of pardoning former Sheriff Arpaio, a man who has been accused of racially profiling Latinos.\u000a\u000aI am not a Trump supporter. But I found myself rooting for him at the beginning of the speech to read the teleprompter, to stick with the message of unity, to swallow his bile and recognize as a human being that this moment required something bigger than he typically was capable of delivering.\u000a\u000aInstead, my jaw was on the floor, like many people watching. I guess I should stop being so surprised.

aVJeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) It's important to politicize Hurricane Harvey. Not politics in the sense of political parties, or politics to win elections. Politics to protect America.\u000a\u000aThe priority in the next hours and days is to save lives and reduce suffering, without hesitation and without question of costs or politics. But then must come the reckoning.\u000a\u000aOnce the immediate crisis ends, the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, should resign with an apology to his state and his country. Then the Texas delegation in Congress should make a public confession. They have lied to their constituents for too long, expecting the rest of America to keep bailing them out.\u000a\u000aThe reason is this. Texas politics aims to bring profits to the oil and gas industry, but it does this at high cost and dire threat to Texas residents and the American people.\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey was a foreseeable disaster. Indeed, a massive hurricane strike on Houston, followed by massive flooding, was widely anticipated.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Hurricane Harvey slams Texas Downtown Houston is reflected in the flooded Buffalo Bayou on Wednesday, August 30, five days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas.

Hide Caption 74 of 74\u000a\u000aAbbott, for example, was the governor to sign a new law in 2015 that prevents cities and municipalities in Texas from setting their own regulations that might rein in oil and gas drilling activities. On his watch, Texas supported withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.\u000a\u000aOver many years, he has raked in millions in campaign contributions from the oil industry, including in his former role as Texas attorney general , where he sued the Environmental Protection Agency repeatedly over rules designed to curb carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aAnd the state, under Abbott's direction, has taken no significant steps toward flood protection, despite the recognized risks of a mega-hurricane and flood.\u000a\u000aThe problem is not about his crisis management this week. I can't judge that. It's about his long-standing relentless opposition to environmental protection, including his blind eye to global warming and the grave dangers it poses.\u000a\u000aThe Texas Tribune and ProPublica published a 2016 award-winning report on "Hell or High Water, " explaining why Houston is a "sitting duck for the next big hurricane." In 2015, Inside Climate News wrote that "as weather extremes like flooding batter Texas, its refusal to prepare for an even more volatile climate leaves residents at risk, experts say."\u000a\u000aOn June 16 of this year, citing the city's widening concrete sprawl and deaths from flooding in recent years, the UK Guardian wrote that "Houston fears climate change will cause catastrophic flooding: It's not if, it's when."\u000a\u000aThere were countless reasons to fear the worst with Harvey, in addition to the obvious fact that Houston is a low-lying coastal region situated deeply within the Gulf of Mexico's hurricane strike zone. Houston has been growing rapidly without attention to flood risk. Houston has experienced several serious floods in recent years. Houston narrowly dodged a bullet in 2008 when Hurricane Ike swerved away from a direct hit on the city just before landfall.\u000a\u000aMoreover, climate change is making it all worse. The rise in the sea level, roughly a foot during the past century, means more flood surges. The warming of the Gulf of Mexico means more energy for hurricanes. The global warming also means more moisture in the atmosphere, enabling the catastrophic rains now inundating Houston and environs.\u000a\u000aSo, what has been the policy response in Houston and Texas more generally in terms of prevention, resilience, and preparedness? Almost nothing until disaster hits. Then the response is to ask for federal bailouts.\u000a\u000aIn other words, Texas is the moral hazard state.\u000a\u000aHere is what has not happened: There has been little or no effort at zoning protection to keep development clear of floodplains; little or no offshore and onshore infrastructure for flood protection; no discernible heed paid to the scientific evidence and indeed the growing practical experience of catastrophic flood risks; and of course, relentless, pervasive climate change denia l, the mother's milk of Texas politics.\u000a\u000aSo, here's the deal. Those of us elsewhere in the US also suffering from flooding and other disasters from warming temperatures, rising sea levels, and more intense storms (such as New Yorkers who are still rebuilding from 2012 Hurricane Sandy) want truth from Texas politicians and the oil industry.\u000a\u000aWe are bearing the costs of your lies. We are tired of it. More importantly, we are in pain and solidarity with the good people of Houston who are losing lives, homes, and livelihoods because of your lies.\u000a\u000aGov. Abbott, we would like to bid you a political adieu. Perhaps you can devote your time to rebuilding Houston and taking night classes in climate science. Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, you will soon be asking us for money to help Texas.\u000a\u000aMy answer will be yes, if you stop spewing lies about climate dangers, agree to put US and Texas policy under the guidance of climate science, back measures to lower carbon emissions and stay in the Paris Climate Agreement. Then, of course, let's help your constituents to rebuild.\u000a\u000aAnd to ExxonMobil, Chevron, Koch Industries, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, and other oil giants doing your business in Texas: You put up the first $25 billion in Houston disaster relief. Call it compensation for your emissions. Tell the truth about growing climate threats. Then, as citizens seeking the common good, we will match your stake.

aVJen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. She also was a consultant for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Follow her: @jrpsaki . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The news that President Trump struck a back-slapping deal with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi (with photo evidence ) attaching a three-month debt limit increase to funding for Hurricane Harvey -- followed by remarks on Air Force One just hours later reaffirming his commitment to Dreamers -- prompted speculation that perhaps the President was switching strategy to align himself not with members of his own party, but with Democrats.\u000a\u000aDon't hold your breath.\u000a\u000aJust to clear this up: No, we are not headed toward a blissful and cooperative relationship between Donald Trump and Democratic leadership for the next three-plus years.\u000a\u000aFirst, President Trump has made no secret of his love of deal-making, once saying on Twitter (where else?): "Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully or write poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks."\u000a\u000aThe agreement to a three-month extension of the debt limit, instead of the 18 months Republican leadership smartly wanted to get this past the 2018 congressional election, was a bad deal for Trump.\u000a\u000aThere is not a lot of power in the hands of minority leaders, but what the deal guarantees is another bite at the apple for must-pass legislation in December. In other words, it's an opportunity for Pelosi and Schumer to attach an authorization of the DREAM Act or another priority important to Democratic leadership to the next debt ceiling extension.\u000a\u000aDespite that, in Trump's eyes, it was a still a deal. And for an hour or two he could bask in the glow of striking his first deal in quite some time.\u000a\u000aSecond, he is not exactly thrilled with the leadership and work of House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000aWhile President Trump may not score well on a test about how a bill becomes a law, it was understandable that he was stunned, not unlike many Democrats, that seven years after Obamacare passed, the Republicans did not have a viable plan on the shelf for repealing and replacing. And was less than pleased that attempts to repeal his predecessor's signature achievement failed not once, but twice.\u000a\u000aSo did he poke McConnell and Ryan in the eye on purpose? Maybe, but we probably won't know until he tells us during his next press availability.\u000a\u000aThird, even the White House is not spinning the deal with Schumer and Pelosi as the beginning of a new strategy to reach across the aisle. They were in the unenviable position of explaining why their boss agreed to a proposal made by the Democratic leadership, that the Republican speaker of the House called, "ridiculous and disgraceful" just hours earlier. And their answer? According to the White House director of Legislative Affairs, the deal will "clear the decks" for tax reform.\u000a\u000aThat might have merit, if... there was a tax reform package, not just principles, that had been heavily litigated through the web of tax lobbyists, interest groups, and members of the Republican caucus who viscerally disagree on rates, how to pay for the tax cuts and which loopholes should be on the chopping block. None of those things have happened.\u000a\u000aAnd finally as a heavy consumer of media, President Trump is unlikely to be pleased by how his Wednesday morning deal-making is playing -- as a big victory for the people he negotiated with. Even that alone will be a big deterrent to going down the road of deal-making with the Democrats anytime soon.\u000a\u000aAnd all of this is bad news for a DACA deal. For Democrats, immigration advocates, and people with a shred of a soul, President Trump's comments about DACA on Air Force One were encouraging. "Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I.\u000a\u000a"I think they're going to make a deal. I think Congress wants to do this."\u000a\u000aBut here is the rub.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aIf Schumer and Pelosi have their way, there would be a clean authorization of DACA. There would be no funding for a wall on the Mexican border attached to it. In fact, it is hard to believe they would accept funding for a wall in any form given that it would be perceived as a big victory for Trump and a promise delivered. And the scope of other "border security" options that would be acceptable to Democrats and pro-wall building Republicans is narrow at best.\u000a\u000aTrump ran as the law and order, anti-immigrant candidate who wanted to build a wall and round people up to kick them out of the country. And there is a faction of the country that voted for him as a result. Trump can't and won't be the arbiter of a deal on DACA. He may hold his nose and sign it, but he won't be striking a deal on it. His politics won't allow it.

aVIn a corner room of Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, New York, Jadon and Anias had recovered for the past nine months of extensive rehabilitation after the surgery to separate the formerly conjoined twins.\u000a\u000aThe two boys captivated millions around the world when they underwent a 27-hour separation surgery in October . The twins, who were 13 months old at the time, had shared 5 centimeters by 7 centimeters of brain tissue, making the complicated surgery that much more difficult.\u000a\u000aJadon and Anias had known the world only from lying on their backs, and the surgery set them back to infancy in terms of speech and gross motor skills. In recovery, they learned how to use muscles they never knew they had. Just sitting up was a monumental task.\u000a\u000aDoctors feared that Anias might never be able to use his right side. Yet in rehab, he's begun using his right hand almost as much as his left.\u000a\u000aTheir final day at Blythedale is one Nicole and Christian had dreamed of since before the surgery. The family transported their lives from small-town Illinois to New York in February 2016 to prepare for the procedure.\u000a\u000aThe boys had been in the hospital almost constantly since then, first at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, where the surgery took place, and then Blythedale. They turn 2 years old on Saturday.\u000a\u000aGone are the fears of the surgery itself. The hour-long trips to the hospital. The longing to have their family under one roof.\u000a\u000aPhotos: Conjoined twins separated: New life, apart Anias, left, and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head, something only seen in 1 out of every 2.5 million live births.

Hide Caption 24 of 24\u000a\u000aNicole lifted Anias from his hospital crib. "Are you ready to go?" she asked, cradling him close to her heart.\u000a\u000aAcross the room, Christian picked up Jadon and told him that he'll soon "get to hang out at home."\u000a\u000a"You get to ride in a minivan," he said. "You get to be a normal little boy."\u000a\u000aThe boys were placed in a double umbrella stroller. Jadon sported a white helmet with a red Velcro strap; Anias wore a helmet with a blue stripe.\u000a\u000aDad pushed their stroller down the hall. Mom and their 4-year-old brother, Aza, accompanied them.\u000a\u000aIt was time to go home. Finally.\u000a\u000a'God works through people'\u000a\u000aThe McDonald home teems with activity. Nicole and Christian purchased the home in foreclosure in the spring. Nestled in New York's Orange County, with views of the Catskill Mountains, it was in need of extensive renovation.\u000a\u000aChristian worked almost around the clock to get it ready for his boys, ripping off siding and tearing up old carpet. A few weeks ago, four guys from Texas who are affiliated with their church showed up to help. In just 2½ days, they built front stairs, installed siding, replaced windows, refurbished the laundry room and renovated a bathroom.\u000a\u000aMost important, they ran an electrical circuit to the boys' room to handle all of their specialized medical equipment. Anias will need a feeding tube, as well as a breathing machine and a suction machine to aid in his care. The family will eventually have home nurses for 16 hours a day.\u000a\u000aLess than 24 hours before the boys' return, the split-level ranch home seemed more like the site of a renovation reality show, with Christian burning the midnight oil to complete the work. Aided by his minister and two church members, he pulled up carpet in the basement playroom and laid tiles.\u000a\u000aOn the wall, a quote from American philosopher and psychologist William James: "The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude."\u000a\u000aUpstairs, Nicole prepared a chili feast. She traveled back and forth between the hospital and home so much, it's rare to be able to cook dinner.\u000a\u000aShe had to fight back to tears while slicing onions. The tears, she said with a laugh, are "not from the onions." They're for the overwhelming excitement at the idea of bringing Jadon and Anias home. Earlier, she'd walked through their room. Their newly assembled cribs waited to be occupied.\u000a\u000a"My kids have never been home separate," she said. "I'm so excited, I can hardly stand it. It feels like it's not even real. We've never been home and each held a kid. It's going to be awesome."\u000a\u000aChristian joined her in the kitchen to reflect on the monumental journey the family has been on for the past year. He said the boys have been in hospitals for so long -- nearly 1½ years, counting the months before the surgery -- that feels like, in a weird way, Jadon and Anias have been wards of the hospital and less his own children. "It's almost like I get to be a dad to them for the first time," he said.\u000a\u000aThat's not to say he's not appreciative of everything the hospitals have done, from the surgeons at Montefiore who operated on them to the staff at Blythedale who worked tirelessly to get Jadon and Anias to this point.\u000a\u000a"I'm feeling pretty excited getting to hold my kids sitting on my couch and actually just hold one at a time," he said. "It's like I have my sons now, you know?"\u000a\u000aChristian and Nicole McDonald load their twins, Jadon and Anias, into the family van as they head home from rehab for the first time.\u000a\u000aThe last time the boys were home, Jadon and Anias were still connected at the head. Any time their parents needed to move them, they had to carry them together in a carefully choreographed way.\u000a\u000aThe family lived in a rental home in the Bronx. Now, they have their own home. They want to push the boys in strollers to the park. They want to take them to the local pizza joint. Simply put, they just want to be a family.\u000a\u000a"I can't wait to show them the world," Nicole said.\u000a\u000aMore than anything else, Christian said, "I'm just so excited for them. I'm sure they just want to come home and be with their family, and we want them to come home."\u000a\u000aBoth parents express gratitude for everyone who has reached out to them and prayed for their boys. Devout Christians, the parents say their faith has sustained them during this arduous journey.\u000a\u000a"Times like this really shows us that it is God's help," Christian said. "God works through people."\u000a\u000aAdded Nicole, "This strengthened my faith. If I didn't have God in my life, I would not have made it."\u000a\u000aA member of their church donated their minivan. Strangers generously gave more than $340,000 to the family's GoFundMe account -- money that has supported the family the past year, aided in the purchase of their home and helped pay off huge medical bills.\u000a\u000aThe journey has in no way been easy. The months since the surgery have seen both boys stave off seizures and serious infections that resulted in trips to the intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aBut the parents say they are prepared to handle whatever comes next.\u000a\u000a"We had miracle upon miracle upon miracle happen with these children to get them to where they are now," Nicole said. "We have our children coming home."\u000a\u000a'Motivated' boys ready to tackle the world\u000a\u000aThe boys' road to recovery was made possible thanks to the dedicated staff at Blythedale Children's Hospital. In additional to physical therapy, they received speech and occupational therapy five days a week. The boys will still return for three days of therapy a week for the foreseeable future.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED A 360° look inside the operating room during the boys' surgery Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A 360° look inside the operating room during the boys' surgery 06:16\u000a\u000aMara Abrams has worked with Jadon as his physical therapist and says his tenacity has been awe-inspiring. He loves books, he loves toys, and he loves life. She said he's learning to pull himself up on furniture and walking sideways along the furniture with a bit of help. He's nearly crawling, too.\u000a\u000a"The first step in a wonderful life is about to happen," Abrams said. "It's just so great that the hospitalization is over."\u000a\u000aJadon's progression is nothing short of amazing, she said. It was difficult and intimidating when he first arrived because he'd only known life from lying on his back.\u000a\u000a"All of a sudden, the whole world changed for him," she said. "I know it took so much time for him to visually accept that the world wasn't meant for him to lie down, that he had to come into a vertical position and figure out this is what the world looks like."\u000a\u000aA collection of family photos hangs in the dining room of the McDonalds' home.\u000a\u000aBut with help, Jadon took off. "Every day, he's always been a cheerful, happy guy. He throws his arms out; he squeals with delight. He loves going to therapy. I'm just so happy they're going to have real-life experiences."\u000a\u000aHer favorite moments are many, like the time he took a few steps toward his occupational therapist and grinned from ear to ear. Or the time he was on a tricycle working on reciprocal leg motion, and he suddenly saw his mom. "We started to go towards her. She squealed with delight, and he did. It was really wonderful."\u000a\u000aAnias has struggled the most, both before and after the surgery. With twins joined at the head, one tends to be more dominant. In this case, Jadon was the dominant one, whose body worked overtime to keep both of them alive. Anias has struggled with breathing and other issues, compared with his brother. Anias's body also rejected the skull cap that had been placed under his skin to protect his brain, and it had to be surgically removed. He will probably undergo another surgery for a new skull cap when he is 7 years old. Until then, he will wear a protective helmet.\u000a\u000aBut Anias' gains have been tremendous too, according to his physical therapist, Maureen Carroll. Although he is a few months behind Jadon's progression, he has made giant leaps.\u000a\u000aWhen Anias first came to physical therapy, Carroll said, he was scared of people and using only his left side. Now, he's kicking both feet and routinely using his right hand to stick his foot in his mouth. He's become social with his twin and older brother.\u000a\u000aAnias, who eats via a feeding tube, is 4 pounds heavier than Jadon now, weighing in at 28 pounds.\u000a\u000a"He wants to play. He wants to move -- and that's amazing," Carroll said. "The child who was afraid of people at first now wants to interact with the world. He's motivated, and that's huge."\u000a\u000aWhat excites her the most about Anias, she said, is that "he's excited to be here, and he's excited to move."\u000a\u000a"That's what makes my job so easy," she said. "I'm just going along for the ride. He's the one who is the hero and the miracle."\u000a\u000aMaking the family whole\u000a\u000aThe silver minivan pulled up to their home early Friday evening. Mom and Dad got out and prepared for the big moment. On the hourlong ride home, Jadon played with a ball while big brother Aza jabbered for much of the time. Both boys laughed and laughed. Anias was oblivious, asleep in his seat.\u000a\u000aThe family dogs, Taz and Tyson, greeted the minivan to inspect the new arrivals. Taz, a tiny Maltese/toy poodle mix, leaped into the back of the minivan and sniffed around. His tail wagged at the sight of the two boys.\u000a\u000aNicole gingerly carried Anias up the front stairs. Christian fetched Jadon and, on their way up the steps, pointed out his renovation handiwork to his son: new siding, stairs and windows.\u000a\u000a"I put you in a new window, Jadon, so you can have a clear view," he said. "This is it. This is your home."\u000a\u000aNicole McDonald comforts her crying son, Jadon, who was frightened by the family dog.\u000a\u000aSoon, the home buzzed with the hectic life of raising three boys under the age of 5. Aza ran about. Taz began barking. The environment was completely new to the twins.\u000a\u000aJadon trembled and cried every time Taz barked. The night before, the parents had talked of how they longed to sit with the boys on the couch.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWith Jadon screaming, Nicole took a seat on the living room couch and held him. "This is your home," she whispered. "Don't be scared."\u000a\u000aHis tears abated.\u000a\u000aA few hours later, Anias fell asleep first. Jadon soon followed. Both boys were asleep in their home.\u000a\u000aAs much as Nicole and Christian dreamed of the moment, they said, it was even better than they imagined.\u000a\u000aTheir family was whole again.

The company said it found no evidence that consumers in other countries were affected beyond the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\u000a\u000aWhat information was accessed?\u000a\u000aThe hackers accessed personal information such as names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, credit card numbers and the numbers of some driver's licenses.\u000a\u000aWhen did this happen?\u000a\u000aEquifax said the breach happened between mid-May and July. It discovered the hack on July 29. It informed the public on September 7.\u000a\u000aHow did this happen?\u000a\u000aEquifax said criminals "exploited a U.S. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files." A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.\u000a\u000aWho was behind the breach?\u000a\u000aThe company hasn't clarified but noted an investigation is ongoing.\u000a\u000aAm I at risk, and what is Equifax doing to help?\u000a\u000aEquifax is proposing that customers sign up for credit file monitoring and identity theft protection. It is giving free service for one year through its TrustedID Premier business, regardless of whether you've been impacted by the hack.\u000a\u000aTo enroll and/or check whether you were affected, visit www.equifaxsecurity2017.com and click on the Check Potential Impact tab. You'll need to provide your last name and the last six digits of your social security number. Once submitted, you will receive a message indicating whether you've been affected.\u000a\u000aThen, you have the option to enroll in the program, but you can't actually sign up for the service until next week. Each customer is provided an enrollment date starting earliest on Monday.\u000a\u000aCan I sue Equifax?\u000a\u000aYou may limit some of your rights to sue if you sign up for Equifax's offer of free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring. You must notify Equifax within 30 days of signing up that you do not agree with its demand to submit disputes to arbitration. But there are attorneys who argue that even if you don't opt out that way, the arbitration provision does not cover suits related to this breach.\u000a\u000aIt seems like cybersecurity hacks are happening a lot. Is this the biggest ever?\u000a\u000aThe Equifax breach is one of the largest breaches ever. Some other high-profile examples include two breaches at Yahoo -- the bigger one involved 1 billion accounts, the lesser impacted 500 million -- and a hack at Myspace that involved 360 million accounts.

aVColin Trevorrow is no longer directing the next chapter of the Skywalker saga.\u000a\u000aThe "Jurassic World" director has left the helm of "Star Wars: Episode IX," Disney and Lucasfilm said on Tuesday in a statement published to the Star Wars website.\u000a\u000a"Lucasfilm and Colin Trevorrow have mutually chosen to part ways on 'Star Wars: Episode IX,'" the statement read. "Colin has been a wonderful collaborator throughout the development process but we have all come to the conclusion that our visions for the project differ."\u000a\u000aLucasfilm then wished Trevorrow the best and said that they would be "sharing more information about the film soon."\u000a\u000a"Star Wars: Episode IX" is currently set for release on May 24, 2019 and will be the follow up to the upcoming "Star Wars: The Last Jedi," which opens in December.\u000a\u000aThe news is the latest behind the scenes shakeup in the "Star Wars" galaxy.\u000a\u000aIn June, Lucasfilm announced that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were leaving next year's "Star Wars" Han Solo spinoff film. The two were replaced by veteran director Ron Howard.\u000a\u000aThis followed production issues and reshoots during 2016's "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" as well as director Josh Trank exiting from a "Star Wars" spinoff film before production took place in 2015.\u000a\u000aDespite Trevorrow's major success with 2015's "Jurassic World," which currently stands as the fourth highest-grossing movie of all time, some fans and critics were concerned with Trevorrow directing the next 'Star Wars' film following the director's latest film, June's "The Book of Henry," which was panned by audiences and critics.\u000a\u000a"After the disastrous reviews that greeted 'The Book of Henry,' there was a collective questioning, among 'Star Wars' cultists, of whether Trevorrow was really the right person to steer their sacred franchise," wrote Owen Gleiberman, Variety's chief film critic. "I'm not a 'Star Wars' cultist (far from it), but to a degree I get their trepidation."

She never did.\u000a\u000aI'd eat breakfast on the way to the pool and I'd do two hours training before school.

They got their revenge; these days they call me "golden boy."\u000a\u000aBut there were sacrifices, for both my family and me, and that will be the same for the current crop of elite swimmers.\u000a\u000aThe one that still haunts me 25 years on is missing my sister's wedding.\u000a\u000aAt the time, there was a competition that was offering money and we agreed as a family that I'd compete.\u000a\u000aLooking back, did the money make much difference to my life? Maybe not but it seemed important at the time.\u000a\u000aMark Foster won six world championship gold medals between 1993 and 2004.\u000a\u000a'It's hardly going down a coal mine'\u000a\u000aAs for other sacrifices, I have never looked at swimming like that.\u000a\u000aI was 11 years old when I competed at my age group championships, winning five out of six events.\u000a\u000aI looked at similar results in the US, China and Australia in the Swimming Times and compared myself to the fastest in the world, which was pretty cool.\u000a\u000aAnd as I grew older and eventually turned professional, my morning starts, mercifully, became later -- 8am, which was very manageable.\u000a\u000aAnd when people talk about sacrifices, I used to go to Australia every January for a six-week training camp. It's hardly going down a coal mine, is it?!\u000a\u000aI didn't know any different.

Much has changed from the early part of my career but a lot is still the same, too.\u000a\u000aThey still work in a four-year Olympic cycle and, outside of that, there are national, European and World Championships as well as the Commonwealth Games.\u000a\u000aAnd the current generation still have the same goals. Much of the day-to-day stuff remains the same and is still every bit as grueling.\u000a\u000aWhen I was younger, the training I struggled with most was swimming something like 60 or 80 kilometers in a week.\u000a\u000aI had a short attention span -- I still do -- so that's why sprinting suited me. It also played to my physiological strengths.\u000a\u000aI loved doing 25 or 50-meter sprints, then having a break before going back in.\u000a\u000aI know long-distance swimmers think the sprinters are lazy because it looks like we're standing around the pool talking a lot. Sure, that did happen, but in between short, intense bursts.\u000a\u000aFoster won his final world title in the 50m freestyle at the 2004 championships.\u000a\u000aTraining on the track with a world-class hurdler\u000a\u000aMy obsession was doing anything to get quicker.\u000a\u000aI would run on the track. World and Olympic champion hurdler Colin Jackson trained me for a time and I would run 200 meters in 25 seconds, not dissimilar to what I was doing in the pool.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, there's a greater sacrifice involved in being a distance swimmer, pounding length after length of the pool -- or "counting tiles," as I used to refer to it.\u000a\u000aI'm sure all distance swimmers would like to be sprinters but, if your body isn't made that way, there's not much you can do about it.\u000a\u000aTo me, all that mattered was 32 strokes in 21 seconds -- that's what my event was about.\u000a\u000aSo, I needed to get as much power as I could any way I could.

aVDanae Mercer, for CNN \u2022 Updated 29th August 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 In the glimmering Middle Eastern city of Dubai , where luxury is good and over-the-top opulence is even better, there's no shortage of fancy restaurants.\u000a\u000aSome are more decadent than others. Here are our top 10 stops on Dubai's fine dining circuit.\u000a\u000aBe prepared for exquisite dishes by Michelin-starred chefs, with price tags to match.\u000a\u000a1. Billionaire Mansion Dubai\u000a\u000aThe view from a table at Billionaire Mansion Dubai , the newly opened venue owned by Italian F1 boss Flavio Briatore, is a bit like going on safari.\u000a\u000aLong-legged women roam in packs while men peacock in name-brand clothing.\u000a\u000aAnd absolutely everything -- from the white-suit-black-tie staff to the tree growing in the middle of the restaurant -- is meant to catch the eye.\u000a\u000aLocated downtown in the Taj Dubai, this swanky spot doesn't really pick up until after 9 p.m. when the brief performances -- like silk ribbon dancing or sultry jazz singing -- start.\u000a\u000aThe menu is split into Japanese and Italian. Dishes (like a tuna tartare with white truffle sauce or salt-crusted baked sea bass) are larger and less fussy than you would expect.\u000a\u000aAs the evening moves on, diners should be prepared for sparkler-equipped dancers or bull-masked hoverboard-riding staff to wind between tables.\u000a\u000aJust like on safari, the more exotic animals come out at night.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: 125 grams of Beluga Volzhenka Caviar ($640).\u000a\u000aWorth the splurge: The wasabi prawns with mango and golden passion fruit salsa. This lightly battered dish is salty, sweet, crunchy and, with five large prawns, just the right size ($40).\u000a\u000a2. Cavalli Club Dubai\u000a\u000aCavilli Club Dubai: Zebra stripes and Italian food.\u000a\u000aChandeliers made of Swarovski crystals hang from the ceiling of this purple-lit late-night venue where a large screen projects fashion shows on the wall.\u000a\u000aIt's not subtle -- but given that it's done in collaboration with over-the-top designer Roberto Cavalli, that's no real surprise.\u000a\u000aEven the elevators are lined with zebra print fabric walls and the gold women's bathroom is dotted with private back-lit makeup mirrors.\u000a\u000aWhile Cavalli Club is definitely a party destination, it still offers a solid four-course Italian dinner.\u000a\u000aMains, like meaty monkfish tail poached in squid ink or Mediterranean sea bass wrapped in zucchini, are visually gorgeous if a little under-seasoned.\u000a\u000aBy 11 p.m. the DJ's music will be pumping.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: 850g of Wagyu grade 9+ New York steak ($681).\u000a\u000aWorth the splurge: A dish of red prawns carpaccio with celery, cheese and watermelon soaked with Aperol spritz ($41).\u000a\u000a3. Social by Heinz Beck\u000a\u000aHeinz Beck, the chef behind Rome's three-Michelin-starred restaurant La Pergola, has brought his unconventional brand of Italian cuisine to Waldorf Astoria Dubai Palm Jumeirah.\u000a\u000aWith pristine wooden floors, retro photos and glass-fronted kitchen, the decor of Social by Heinz Beck is classic luxury with a modern twist -- a mantra that also extends to the menu.\u000a\u000aExpect to find Italian staples such as tiramisu and carbonara turned completely on their heads.\u000a\u000aThe interior goes for a European high society feel.\u000a\u000aThere's more of a typical Dubai vibe, from the terrace which offers a vista over the resort's grounds and the sci-fi Marina skyline across the water.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: The indulgent five-course tasting menu paired with wines from around the world ($226 per person).\u000a\u000aWorth the splurge: The Heinz Beck signature, Fagottelli Carbonara. Delicately soft pasta parcels filled with hot pools of buttery sauce ($23).\u000a\u000a4. Pierchic\u000a\u000aPierchic: Over-water ostentation.\u000a\u000aLocated at the end of a pier, this romantic over-water destination offers epic views of the sun setting across the Arabian Gulf.\u000a\u000aCorner tables on the terrace enjoy uninterrupted views of the "seven-star" sparkling Burj Al Arab Jumeirah.\u000a\u000aThe food here is fancy and elaborate -- and has the price tag to match.\u000a\u000aOysters, caviar and lobster, topped with flourishes like truffle and foie gras, dominate the Mediterranean menu.\u000a\u000aPortions are pleasantly large.\u000a\u000aA rich starter of Alaskan king crab topped with caviar and saffron-infused hollandaise could easily be a main, while an elegant main of Chilean sea bass with smoked sweet potato could serve two.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: 50 grams of Beluga Imperial Caviar ($776), whole line-caught sea bass ($245), or a seafood tower with oysters, lobsters, prawns, crab, salmon and more ($245).\u000a\u000aWorth the splurge: The venue's smoky sweet potato. Served alongside a dish of Chilean sea bass, it's rich, sweet, caramelized and incredibly decadent ($68 for complete dish).\u000a\u000a5. Nobu Dubai\u000a\u000aAsk Dubai locals for a great Japanese restaurant, they'll mention one of the holy three: Okku, Zuma or Nobu\u000a\u000aAll are equally impressive, but Nobu, located in Dubai's castle-shaped Atlantis hotel on the city's man-made Palm Island, wins by location alone.\u000a\u000aThis chain restaurant (one of 33 around the world) is well-established for fantastic food.\u000a\u000aAbsent are traditional sleek and minimalist Japanese-style interiors.\u000a\u000aEverything in this popular dining spot is decorated in mesh screens and curved wooden beams, creating the feeling of being caught in a giant fishing net with a hugely sexy twist.\u000a\u000aFood is a rich take on Japanese fusion with Arabic touches, ranging from a spicy salmon miso taco to a creamy cheesecake with yuzu sorbet.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: The Grade A9 Australian Wagyu Beef ($223) is incredible. Diners can choose from a range of styles but "anticucho" is highly recommended.\u000a\u000aWorth the splurge: Nobu is famed for its Black Cod Miso ($60); while this will never disappoint, the lighter lobster quinoa ceviche salad ($53) is fantastic.\u000a\u000a6. At.mosphere Burj Khalifa\u000a\u000aAt.mosphere Burj Khalifa: Super slick, super views.\u000a\u000aIt's hard to miss the Burj Khalifa , the world's tallest tower, during any Dubai visit.\u000a\u000aWhile most folks head up to the viewing platform (from $35) for amazing views of Dubai from the sky, a more luxurious option is to book a dinner at At.mosphere.\u000a\u000aThis fine-dining restaurant is as super slick and expensive as you might expect.\u000a\u000aTables by the floor-to-ceiling windows offer urban sunsets while a multi-course tasting menu lays on the decadence.\u000a\u000aThere's wasabi roots from Japan, Australian Wagyu beef, lobster and more, all offered alongside suggested wine pairings.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: The seven-course experience tasting menu with wine pairing will set you back a steep $436 per person.\u000a\u000aWorth the splurge: A hand-cut beef tartare served with caviar is deliciously rich (part of a tasting menu at $185 per person).\u000a\u000a7. Enigma\u000a\u000aTheatrics and incredible food star at Enigma , a newly opened venue in the luxurious Palazzo Versace Dubai which is creating a real buzz.\u000a\u000aChefs change every four months, bringing with them set menus that are revealed on the night.\u000a\u000aFirst there was Quique Dacosta (whose Spanish restaurant has three Michelin stars) whipping up smoking truffle creations.\u000a\u000aUntil June 20, 2016 it's Bjorn Frantzen (famed for the fine-dining Restaurant Frantzen, which was awarded two Michelin stars after only two years of operation) with a 12-course Nordic-inspired tasting menu.\u000a\u000aDishes are elaborate, decadent and incredibly creative.\u000a\u000aMeals can take upwards of three hours.\u000a\u000aFor extra indulgence, cocktails can be grabbed on the column-lined terrace while the sun sets over the Dubai Creek.\u000a\u000a"It's essentially a pop-up in a five-star deluxe hotel with chefs changing four times a year," says Samantha Wood, founder of restaurant review website foodiva.net.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: The "full story" 12-course tasting menu costs $231 at weekends.\u000a\u000aWorth the splurge: The beautifully presented scallop in its own shell served with dried roe on a bed of a fir tree (not priced individually).\u000a\u000a8. La Cantine du Faubourg\u000a\u000aLa Cantine du Faubourg: Inviting cafe vibe.\u000a\u000aPopular with Dubai's in-the-know crowd, this French restaurant is one of those places where folks go to see and be seen.\u000a\u000aBillowy white fabric and high ceilings create an inviting cafe vibe.\u000a\u000aIn cooler months, the venue's terrace is packed with high-heeled well-groomed fashionistas.\u000a\u000aLike Le Petite Maison, another posh cafe beloved by locals, Cantine features French cuisine done well.\u000a\u000aDishes include smoked salmon blinis with caviar and buttery sea bass served on a bed of black quinoa.\u000a\u000aOptional supplements of seared foie gras ($16 for 30gr), black truffle ($19 for 2gr) or caviar ($20 for 5gr) allow for customizable amounts of decadence.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: Enjoy 250gr of Imperial caviar ($1,361) or order the 500gr chateaubriand steak ($133).\u000a\u000aWorth the splurge: "Les coquilletes de mon enfance," an elaborate mac 'n' cheese dish with truffles and gruyere ($25).\u000a\u000a9. Al Muntaha\u000a\u000aAl Muntaha: Skyline dining.\u000a\u000aLike the Burj Khalifa, the ostentatious "seven star" Burj Al Arab Jumeirah is one of those properties that defines the Dubai skyline.\u000a\u000aWhile the reservation-only venue's launched a few new offerings lately (including an outdoor terrace beachfront restaurant and Gold on 27, an incredibly decadent bar with foie gras-infused whiskey cocktails), its staple for luxury dining is Al Muntaha\u000a\u000aThis contemporary European venue sits 200 meters above sea level, providing amazing views of the Arabian Gulf alongside deliberately fancy food.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is subdued, all clinking silverware and sophisticated diners. A new summer menu, launching mid-June, features dishes like Alaskan king crab served with lemon and caviar, or roasted veal fillet with foie gras.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out (and worth the splurge): The menu is currently under renovation, but expect to pay several hundred dollars per person.\u000a\u000a10. Qbara\u000a\u000aArabic food is given a modern twist in Dubai's homegrown Qbara restaurant.\u000a\u000aLocated beside Raffles Hotel near the Dubai Creek, this funky venue is intimate in reds and golds, draped in shadows and subtly sexy.\u000a\u000aA cool DJ and rotating artwork projections add to the buzzing vibe enjoyed by an Emirati and expat crowd.\u000a\u000aFood spans everything from salads to small hot dishes, but the thing uniting it all is the edgy take on traditional Middle Eastern cuisine.\u000a\u000aThere's scallops seared with sumac (a tangy lemony spice) served with pomegranate onions or lobster kibbeh (a fried wheat parcel stuffed with flavored meat) with avocado labneh (a soft cheese).\u000a\u000aDates, pine nuts, hummus and more dot the expansive menu.\u000a\u000a"If you have one night only in Dubai, then this restaurant is a must -- and ultimately my favorite restaurant in this emirate," says Samantha Wood.\u000a\u000aCredit card max-out: Out-pricing even the tasting menu ($136 per person) is the hefty mixed grill. This star of Arabic cuisine features pure-bred Angus sirloin, tiger prawns, Syrian lamb kofta, grilled lamb cutlets and more ($204).

aVStory highlights Alice Stewart: Trump's decision to visit Texas, away from rescue efforts, was the right call\u000a\u000aHis trip alone goes a long way to mobilizing resources to areas in need, she says\u000a\u000aAlice Stewart is a CNN political commentator and former communications director for Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Hurricane Harvey is historic, not just in its size and scope, but in its significance as Donald Trump's first natural disaster test as President. His "darned if you do, darned if you don't" decision to visit South Texas on Tuesday, away from the rescue efforts, was the right call. Trump is demonstrating he has the compassion and commitment to meet the needs of victims of the deadly storm.\u000a\u000aAlice Stewart\u000a\u000aCritics blasted Trump for not meeting with victims directly to offer his personal condolences. Look, there's plenty of time for the powerful photos showing comfort, but now is the time for action -- not optics. These people are in the rescue and recovery mode, which can only be hampered by the distraction of a presidential visit. They need homes, not hugs; they need structure, not selfies, and they need funds, not a presidential flyover.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, every president has been forced to lead this country through natural or man-made disasters and faced the challenges of serving as consoler in chief: President Barack Obama had the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings; President George W. Bush had 9/11; President Bill Clinton met the challenge after the Oklahoma City bombing. All rose to the occasion.\u000a\u000aLikewise, Trump is stepping up to the challenge, reassuring storm victims that resources are on the way.\u000a\u000aThis first trip to Texas was an opportunity for the President to meet with local leadership, first responders and relief organizations in Corpus Christi. He also got a firsthand look at the state's emergency operations center in Austin.\u000a\u000aRead More

This article is adapted from the conclusion to "Why Trump Won." The views expressed are his own. Watch "Why Trump Won" Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The real question of the 2016 presidential election isn't so much why did Donald Trump win, as why did he even get close?\u000a\u000aAfter all, Trump was a totally unconventional candidate who broke all the rules and did things that would have destroyed anyone else running for president. So why did he break through?\u000a\u000aHere's the answer: America is now divided along four lines, each one reinforcing the others. Call them the four Cs.\u000a\u000aFareed Zakaria\u000a\u000aThe first is capitalism. There was a time when the American economy moved in tandem with its middle class. As the economy grew, so did middle class employment and wages. But over the last few decades that link has been broken.

aVDouglas Brinkley is professor of history at Rice University in Houston and author of The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) As the floodwaters rush and rage around greater Houston, as thousands of people a re trapped in their homes, as the Coast Guard fights the torrential rain and fierce winds to rescue the stranded, more Texans with boats need to spring into civic-minded action. Right now. No urban drainage system can handle this type of deluge.\u000a\u000aFlooded communities can't wait for help to materialize from Washington. That is a terrible mistake. The magic cavalry doesn't always arrive after a hurricane makes landfall. Houstonians have to save Houstonians now (as they're already courageously doing).\u000a\u000aThis is especially true because President Donald Trump seems preoccupied with tweeting about NAFTA, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and transgender bans, and shamelessly hawking a sheriff's memoir on Amazon instead of being fully engaged as Emergency-Manager-in-Chief.\u000a\u000aAs a survivor of Hurricane Katrina, I saw firsthand how recreational boats \u2014 used for fishing, hunting and waterskiing \u2014 can become a kind of People's Navy. All boats in South Texas and Lousiana that Hurricane Harvey didn't damage or destroy, those anchored in the marinas of Clear Lake City and Baytown, should be deployed into action.\u000a\u000aThis must be done, of course, after checking in with state, local and federal authorities about how your vessel can be best utilized -- extremely important for both safety reasons and to avoid duplication of effort.\u000a\u000aA patchwork flotilla of recreational boats \u2014 including dinghies, canoes, kayaks and inflatable rafts \u2014 needs to be continually dispatched to rescue scores of citizens trapped in apartments, hospitals, assisted-living homes and scrub-land farms.\u000a\u000aWith darkness and the worst flooding yet to come, traumatized victims need to get to high-and-dry ground quickly. Right now 600 boats are being used for rescues \u2014 that needs to increase to over 1,000 -- to quickly rescue those in harm's way -- operating on an around the clock basis. Victims shouldn't have to wade through floodwaters and risk being exposed to toxic chemicals, dangerous sharp objects, water moccasins, alligators and rats.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Flood rescuer saw call for help on Facebook Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Flood rescuer saw call for help on Facebook 02:01\u000a\u000aA grassroots Lone Star Navy \u2014 like the Cajun Navy of Katrina \u2014 needs to patrol the hazardous bayous, lakes and rivers of the city, and monitor pocket communities cursed with 2 to 4 feet of water. The more helping hands the better. More neighbors helping neighbors. This is essential to minimize the death toll.\u000a\u000aI learned from Katrina that there is a 72-hour window in the wake of catastrophic flooding to avoid unnecessary loss of life. Electrical blackouts will endanger people who need respirators and dialysis machines. Many paraplegics and elders with Alzheimer's left alone will be in dire straits. Diabetics will need insulin. Forgotten Houstonians with heart, kidney and other serious medical conditions will be crying out for help.\u000a\u000aIn coming hours, the danger of natural-gas leaks, which cause fires and explosions, greatly increases. Basement flooding will cause electric power systems to short-circuit.\u000a\u000aAnd the worst is still ahead. There have already been more than 100 tornado warnings in South Texas, and more are likely. A staggering 25 more inches of rain is expected.\u000a\u000aOne of the unsung stories of Katrina was how recreational boaters became true rescue-and-relief heroes. There will be plenty of time to blame Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner for not ordering a mandatory evacuation, and President Trump for playing ill-timed Twitter games while America's fourth-largest city drowned.\u000a\u000aBut now, as the roads have turn to rivers, and bayous bleed into strip malls, rescue boats are a desperately needed commodity. The overtaxed Texas National Guard and Houston police crews need citizen backup. In Houston, the Capital of Sprawl, the vulnerable are often hard to identify. Locals might know best where people are marooned.\u000a\u000aThe National Weather Service has now deemed the Great Houston Flood a catastrophic rain event "beyond anything experienced." History will mark this as a climate-change event. The panoramic helicopter view of Houston looks like a scene from "An Inconvenient Truth."\u000a\u000aThere is an absurd amount of high water everywhere. More than 250 Texas highways are now underwater. Exits on flooded interstates, however, can be used as boat launch sites. Recreational boat owners need to deputize themselves and become first-responders. Mayor Turner needs to keep giving locals proper emergency guidance. More 911 operators are urgently needed.\u000a\u000aOut-of-state help is welcome in Texas. The bell of history has rung, and direct citizen action is needed.

Career government employees told CNN they're deeply disturbed by silence or what they perceive as weak statements from the Cabinet members who lead their agencies.\u000a\u000aThe mother of Heather Heyer , the woman killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, said she is not interested in hearing from Trump because she believes he equated her daughter with white supremacists.\u000a\u000a"I'm not talking to the President now," Susan Bro said Friday.\u000a\u000aAndrew Shurtleff/Pool/Getty Images\u000a\u000aThousands of people, many of them students, gathered Wednesday night for a peaceful candlelit vigil at the University of Virginia following the violent clashes at the white supremacist rally last week. The crowd sang songs such as "We Shall Overcome" and "This Land is Your Land."\u000a\u000aJason Lappa/The New York Times/Redux\u000a\u000aRepublican lawmakers and administration aides found themselves weighing the costs and benefits of remaining loyal to the President, with some top GOP senators opting to call Trump out by name.\u000a\u000aSen. Bob Corker slammed Trump's handling of Charlottesville, saying the President "has not demonstrated he understands the character of this nation."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham feuded with the President on social media over Trump's remarks, with Graham urging Trump to "please fix this," and Trump accusing Graham of lying about his Charlottesville response.\u000a\u000a"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists," Trump tweeted, "and people like Ms. Heyer.

aV(CNN) Men who took high doses of vitamin B6 and B12 supplements had a higher risk of lung cancer, and the association was highest among current smokers, according to a study published Tuesday .\u000a\u000aThe study found a 30% to 40% increased risk of lung cancer among men taking these vitamins from individual supplements -- not from multivitamins or diet alone. But the effect seemed to be driven by current smokers who far exceeded the recommended daily amounts of the vitamins, according to study author Theodore Brasky , an epidemiologist in the division of cancer prevention and control at the Ohio State University College of Medicine.\u000a\u000a"I think these results point to a synergism" between high-dose B vitamins, smoking and lung cancer risk among men, Brasky said.\u000a\u000aCurrent male smokers taking the highest levels of vitamin B6 had triple the risk of lung cancer over six years, compared with those who didn't take supplements. For vitamin B12, that risk nearly quadrupled. These levels were more than 11 times the recommended daily amount of B6 and 23 times that of B12.\u000a\u000a"If you look at B-vitamin supplement bottles ... they are anywhere between 50-fold the US recommended dietary allowance (to) upward of 2,100-fold," Brasky said. B12 injections have also become "in vogue" in recent years, he said.\u000a\u000aIn smaller quantities, these vitamins are involved in several vital processes in the body, including DNA replication. But many high-dose supplements, he said, claim to boost energy and provide other unproven benefits.\u000a\u000a"That's marketing. That's not science," he said.\u000a\u000aThe study was limited to roughly 77,000 Washington state adults, ages 50 to 76. This included 139 cases of lung cancer among more than 3,200 current male smokers. Over 93% of participants were white.\u000a\u000aThere were too few cases of lung cancer among nonsmokers to include them in the full analysis. An increased risk of lung cancer was not seen among women or with the vitamin B9, also known as folate.\u000a\u000aOther researchers have found different results. Some studies linked vitamin B6 with lower lung cancer risk , and another found that B12 had no impact on risk. The authors of the new study said that the discrepancy could be because some of these studies measure B vitamins in the blood and not through dietary surveys, like they did. Or it may be that lung cancer itself raises levels of these vitamins in the body.\u000a\u000a"I think it's hard to say" why these studies contradict each other, said Elizabeth Kantor , an epidemiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who has studied dietary supplements and cancer risk. She was not involved in the latest research. "Is it the disease process that affects the blood levels? I think that the door remains open on that."\u000a\u000aA focus on B vitamins may not be the most effective way to protect against lung cancer, experts warn.\u000a\u000a"Combustible tobacco smoke is the No. 1 most important factor, not just only in lung cancer but in many cancers," Brasky said.\u000a\u000aCigarette smoking is a factor in 80% to 90% of lung cancers in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from it than nonsmokers. Lung cancer kills more Americans than any other kind of cancer.\u000a\u000a"When we're talking about what to be concerned about most: If you're a male smoker and you want to take B vitamins, you can stop smoking," Brasky said.\u000a\u000a"Smoking is the most important thing here, and that's preventable."\u000a\u000aTo B or not to B?\u000a\u000a"In the average person in this country, it's tough to be deficient" in B vitamins, Brasky said.\u000a\u000aThose who are -- those with anemia or celiac disease, for example -- will feel tired and run down. For them, supplements might help.\u000a\u000aBut taking "megadoses" of these supplements doesn't do much for the average healthy person, Brasky said, nor does it cause immediate harm. The body tends to get rid of excess vitamin, he said.\u000a\u000a"There's always this black box between what people say they eat or take and what is actually absorbed," said Regan Bailey , an associate professor of nutrition science at Purdue University and a former nutritional epidemiologist with the National Institute of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements. She also was not involved in the new study.\u000a\u000aStomach acid and digestion, Bailey said, are able to "rip out" B12 from food so that the body can absorb it. Some synthetic supplements, however, may be more easily absorbed.\u000a\u000aVitamin B12 is found in animal products like meat, eggs and milk. Americans get most of their B6 from fortified cereals, beef, chicken, fruits and starchy vegetables.\u000a\u000aToo little of these vitamins is thought to carry cancer risk, too. Errors can happen when building new strands of DNA, causing them to break. And genes responsible for cell division may be thrown off by these changes, the study authors said.\u000a\u000aIn high concentrations, however, the exact relationship between the vitamins and lung cancer is unclear. If the vitamins are indeed responsible for increasing the lung cancer risk, Brasky said, another question would be whether B vitamins are hastening the development of a lung cancer that's already there or leading to new cancers.\u000a\u000aBailey warned that we are nowhere close to claiming that these high-dose supplements cause cancer. She added that the dietary survey the researchers used -- which calculated the average daily intake over the prior 10 years -- can be imprecise. But Brasky said that adults generally recall which supplements they've taken, allowing researchers to get a good idea of their average doses.\u000a\u000aPeople mostly take dietary supplements because they think they will make them healthier, not because they are trying to add nutrients to their diet, Bailey showed in a 2013 study . And those who take vitamins may be hard to study, she said, because they fall into two very different categories.\u000a\u000a"In my mind, people take supplements because they're sick and trying to get better or because they're healthy and want to stay that way," she said.\u000a\u000aIn a study in October, Kantor showed that about half of American adults have consistently taken dietary supplements over the years. The use of B12 grew 40% from 1999 to 2012, while the use of B6 dropped by a smaller amount.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"There might be one reason why somebody takes something, but it can have other effects on our bodies," Kantor said. "We don't know the whole host of effects."\u000a\u000aThe good news, Bailey said, is that most people aren't taking the single-vitamin, high-dose supplements that go far beyond recommended levels.\u000a\u000a"Most people are taking multivitamins," she said, "and for that, there's really been no (cancer) association, which I think is a success story."

This one was more ominous.\u000a\u000aWhen the towering South African accidentally clashed heads with a teammate during a training session last year, it was the fifth concussion he had suffered in two years. For the sake of his long-term health, Hargreaves took the decision to retire from the game aged 30.\u000a\u000aOn the touchline of a quiet, North London sports pitch, it was hardly the ending any athlete dreams of.\u000a\u000a"It was a strange one because you don't see your career ending on the side of a field on a Monday afternoon," Hargreaves, who won four caps for the Springboks before joining English Premiership side Saracens, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"A pass came and we were both looking at the ball, and just bang -- a clash of heads, a bit of dizziness.\u000a\u000a"I got home that evening and was straight out for the count at about five o'clock. I fell asleep until 10 and woke up with a raging headache, and was in a dark room for the whole weekend. The writing was on the wall."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What is a concussion?

Doctors believe this causes nerve cells to become stretched, releasing chemicals that can alter, among other things, consciousness, memory, mood, or sleep.\u000a\u000aIn rugby terms, it can result from a big tackle, a heavy fall to the ground, or simply -- as Hargreaves found -- an accidental blow to the head. The symptoms vary from case to case, something that the former Saracens captain readily acknowledges.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes it's very obvious -- you're dizzy and you've got a headache for three or four days; you feel like you've got vertigo every time you get up off the couch," he says.\u000a\u000a"For me there's a lot of things that occurred, like when I was defending I felt that my peripheral vision just wasn't there. Guys would just be running past me.\u000a\u000a"Other times it's just a lingering feeling that you're a little bit off, 5% off. Like being in a fog.

Having won two Premiership titles and the European Champions Cup with Saracens, he admits that he's "incredibly privileged to have done what I've done." He now runs a craft beer business -- Wolfpack lager -- alongside former teammate Chris Wyles.\u000a\u000aHis concussion story is by no means unusual. Like Hargreaves, Wales international George North suffered his fifth concussion in two years earlier this season. In a decision that has been criticized by leading doctors, the winger was allowed to play on despite being knocked unconscious -- reason to remove a player permanently from the game.\u000a\u000aAll Blacks great Richie McCaw, who suffered six bouts of concussion, has admitted that he was "lucky" to end his career unscathed from long-term damage.\u000a\u000aA five-year law suit between the NFL and retired players concluded at the end of last year after ex-players claimed that the NFL had hidden the risks of brain injuries.\u000a\u000aAs of January 7, former players are eligible to claim settlements to help treat debilitating brain injuries -- which in some instances include Alzheimer's and the degenerative brain disease ALS. The sport also announced a $100 million initiative intended to support engineering advancements and medical research surrounding concussion in September last year.\u000a\u000aIn soccer, recent research has found a link between concussion and the heading of a ball.\u000a\u000aHargreaves made 79 appearances for English Premiership side Saracens\u000a\u000aTackling the issue\u000a\u000aIn rugby as in NFL, protocols that identify and treat concussion during games are constantly being honed and rewritten, but much of the issue owes to the fact that concussion treatment is still in its early stages of medical development.\u000a\u000a"It's recognized to be the most difficult sports injury to consistently recognize and diagnose," England Rugby's chief medical officer Simon Kemp told CNN.\u000a\u000a"This is the No. 1 player welfare issue in collision and contact sports at the moment ... The science around head injury and particularly around concussion in sport is relatively immature and evolving very rapidly."\u000a\u000aIn 2012, World Rugby introduced the Head Injury Assessment, an in-game protocol intended to help identify and manage concussion as soon as a knock to the head occurs.\u000a\u000a"The average assessment of a player in the 2015 World Cup was 64 seconds and done on-pitch where the player couldn't engage in the assessment," Kemp says.

The HIA supports the doctor's decision-making."\u000a\u000aThe HIA has received criticism from some leading officials, most notably when players (including North and Ireland international Conor Murray) were suspected to have been knocked unconscious but allowed back on the field. Hargreaves, however, praises the protocol, having experienced it first-hand.\u000a\u000a"It's a good system," he says. "I think they could probably improve what it actually entails, what questions you get asked in the changing room, how you deal with this, what's the prognosis for coming back to play, for recovery -- all those kind of things could be tweaked.\u000a\u000a"But it's a great starting point, and I'm really glad to see that they're taking this seriously."\u000a\u000aBreathalysers, proteins, and head gear\u000a\u000aThe science surrounding concussion is still evolving, and how it is applied to rugby is likely to shape how the game is perceived in the public eye. Players are getting bigger, hits are getting harder, but solutions are being sought out.\u000a\u000aAlex Corbisiero, for example, a former England international who took a sabbatical following multiple injuries and surgeries, has been working to develop the N-Pro -- a head guard he hopes will manage and reduce the effects of blows to the head in rugby.\u000a\u000aBut the N-Pro hasn't been medically certified and World Rugby has released a statement prohibiting its use because of insufficient trials in a playing environment.\u000a\u000aCorbisiero played professional rugby for 10 years.

He also knows of companies working to develop a breathalyser that measures chemical levels in a player's brain to assess whether they've sustained any damage.\u000a\u000aBut the problem won't go away anytime soon, and Kemp admits that officials will "still be looking at this problem in five, 10, 15 years."\u000a\u000aAs for Hargreaves, his experience won't stop him sharing his love for the game with his son -- who was an important factor in his decision to retire. But the former second-row forward does accept that work still needs to be done.\u000a\u000a"I don't want to be in a position in five years' time where I have to turn around and say to my kid, 'Actually, I think it's safer for you not to play,'" he says. "I think that would be devastating.\u000a\u000a"I love the game: I love its physicality, I love that it's aggressive, and I love that it's competitive.

But actions can always make a difference in just how bad a disaster gets, so it's worth looking at what led up to this event, in both the short and long term.\u000a\u000aHarvey first gained the attention of meteorologists and Texans last Wednesday. But the risk has been there for decades, at least, in the development patterns of the city. In neither case were the warning signs enough to prevent the disaster, though for very different reasons.\u000a\u000aThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) first predicted that the storm, newly reformed in the Gulf of Mexico after having dissipated a few days earlier, had the potential to become a tropical storm threatening Texas. On Thursday Harvey began to make national news, as it quickly strengthened and new forecasts predicted that it could make landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, the first to strike the US since 2005.\u000a\u000aThe most immediate hazard was to the coastline west of Houston, from intense winds and storm surge. But the forecast tracks showed Harvey's center dawdling after landfall, and many computer models predicted enormous rainfall totals for large areas on and near the coast -- including Houston -- as they envisioned the storm lingering into the middle of this week.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) Curtis McDaniel didn't used to like having his picture taken. Now, the 22-year-old from Bordentown, New Jersey, is bringing a bold new face to the modeling world.\u000a\u000a"It was something that just fell into my lap," he said.\u000a\u000aGrowing up wasn't always easy for McDaniel. When he was 11, he found a white spot on his skin that wouldn't go away.\u000a\u000a"I didn't know what it was, and it wasn't coming off. I told my mom, and she made a dermatology appointment," he said.\u000a\u000aMcDaniel was diagnosed with vitiligo, a disorder that causes patches of his skin to lose color. He's the only one in his family who has it.\u000a\u000a"I like being black, so I was freaked out," he remembered. "I didn't like it at all."\u000a\u000aKids at school made comments as more and more white speckles appeared on his skin.\u000a\u000a"They used to call me zebra, burnt lips, giraffe, Michael Jackson," he said. "I got into a few fights because of it. I got kicked out of class a lot."\u000a\u000aCurtis McDaniel began to lose his skin color in patches when he was 11 years old.\u000a\u000aMcDaniel said he went from being a happy kid to being angry and upset.\u000a\u000a"The hardest part about it was when you see something changing in your life and you have no control over it. Seeing my skin and all these new spots are coming in, and I had no way to stop it. That's what hurt me the most."\u000a\u000aMcDaniel tried to hide the spots on his skin with baggy clothes and makeup. He started to lose his self-confidence.\u000a\u000a"When people said I was ugly, I actually believed that," he said. "There were times when I was in my room when I was going through a lot, and I just wanted to commit suicide."\u000a\u000aBut at 16, a talk with his dad helped set him on a new path.\u000a\u000a"My father, he was struggling with certain addictions. He sat me down one day," McDaniel said. "He was like, 'No, I want you to be better than me. ... When you grow up, never put your hand on a woman. Never drink. Never smoke. Never do drugs. And above all things, put God first.' "\u000a\u000aSix months later, his father died.\u000a\u000aMcDaniel started going to church regularly. He found strength through religion and started to see his skin as a gift, not a curse. He stopped wearing makeup and started to love himself for who he was.\u000a\u000a"That's when everything changed. I started to establish that self-confidence," he said. "Before, when people used to want to take pictures with me, I would be like 'no.' But now, I don't mind taking pictures."\u000a\u000aCurtis McDaniel is a model and a full-time student at Rutgers University.\u000a\u000aMcDaniel was discovered as a model after uploading a selfie to social media in 2015.\u000a\u000a"People say I don't smile too much when I take pictures, so I was like 'Let me take a selfie of me smiling.' "\u000a\u000aHe posted the picture on Instagram before going to class.\u000a\u000a"When I was leaving school, I looked at my phone, and I see my Instagram is just going crazy," he said. "I got home and started searching, and a supermodel had posted my picture."\u000a\u000aAfter the picture went viral, photographers started reaching out to McDaniel to set up photo shoots.\u000a\u000aHis newfound fame led to an audition for the MTV documentary series "True Life." McDaniel appeared on the show this year.\u000a\u000a"I wanted my story to be known because maybe a kid who is just like me could hear my story," he said.\u000a\u000aMcDaniel enrolled in a community college, and now he's a student at Rutgers University, studying urban planning and design.\u000a\u000a"I'm going to continue to pursue my bachelor's, and I also want to get my master's in divinity," he said. "I'm going to pursue that and modeling."\u000a\u000aHe has also spoken about his vitiligo at schools and churches, spreading a message of self-love and perseverance.\u000a\u000a"This is who I am. This was part of my purpose," he said. "I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't for my vitiligo."

aV(CNN) Nearly two years ago Abby Holmes and her husband Jeremiah left their home and jobs in Brooklyn for Columbus, Ohio.\u000a\u000aBetween 45% rent hikes and hyper-competitive hunts for a preschool for their son, the couple were ready to leave behind the big city life.\u000a\u000aIn Columbus they had extended family, affordable rent and, they hoped, the promise of an easier life. But a little over a year after moving, the couple has struggled to find full-time work. Last year, they made about $26,000, which was hardly enough to support the family of four.\u000a\u000aAbby Holmes, her husband Jeremiah and their two sons, Harry, 4 and Eli, 6 months. The Ohio family counted on Medicaid to make ends meet last year.\u000a\u000aThey've counted on government-funded Medicaid to cover doctor's visits, medications and the birth of their second child, Eli. Her family hasn't needed it yet, but Abby knows they could also turn to food assistance and other benefit programs.\u000a\u000aTheir situation isn't the only thing that's changed in the last year.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration and Congress have signaled sweeping plans to remake programs that affect the Holmes' and millions of other families. Medicaid, food stamps and rental assistance are among them. These families could find themselves losing the help they depend on to visit doctors, stay in their homes or put healthy food on the table.\u000a\u000a"We would have to regroup in an entire new way," Abby Holmes said of losing Medicaid. "I would be forced to look for full-time work. My kids would see me less ... and our take-home pay would not change because all of that new money would have to go for healthcare, so it is kind of a lose-lose. ... We're living paycheck to paycheck as it is."\u000a\u000aWhile Republican leaders failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in March, President Trump's administration has vowed to cut billions in federal poverty and health care programs and his secretary of Health and Human Services has promised to give states more control over social programs, which typically means budget cuts and diminished regulation.\u000a\u000aHow successful the Republican party will be in reshaping decades of social safety net programs is unclear as the party is deeply divided. President Trump promised during the campaign to "save" programs such as Medicaid "without cuts," but has since changed his position since the election.\u000a\u000aA Republican-led Congress and the White House now appear aligned and eager to make the most drastic changes in generations to federal entitlement programs that help those in need.\u000a\u000aWhere are safety net cuts most likely?\u000a\u000aThe programs most likely to face cuts are Medicaid and SNAP, a nutrition program that provides healthy food for families, housing vouchers and home energy assistance. Changing these programs from federal to state control could create a patchwork of programs that can be confusing and hard to access because of changing eligibility requirements.\u000a\u000aSome estimate the changes could eventually cut as much as 30% to 40% from the multi-billion-dollar budget for Medicaid, while changes to food stamp programs and the health insurance rules might make it harder for families to afford groceries or visits to the doctor.\u000a\u000aMedicaid covers 70 million low-income children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and people with disabilities, and SNAP helps 43 million people put food on the table.\u000a\u000aBut the GOP has signaled its intention to shift them from being open-ended entitlements to more-restricted block, or per capita, grants.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED In 2015, Trump promised not to cut Medicaid Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH In 2015, Trump promised not to cut Medicaid 01:13\u000a\u000aEntitlements are unlimited reimbursements to states that expand to cover anyone eligible for help during times of need, such as a recession or disaster. However, block grants function like an annual allowance: The federal government offers states a fixed amount for program funding and states decide how to use that money. If there's more demand for social services, states must make up the difference or cut benefits.\u000a\u000aCongressional Republicans proposed block grant plans in their budgets last year and Trump discussed them during the campaign. In a March letter to state governors (PDF), Tom Price, head of the Department of Health and Human Services, promised to give states "more freedom to design programs that meet the spectrum of diverse needs."\u000a\u000aBlock grant reforms "end the misguided one-size-fits-all approach that has tied the hands of so many state governments," said House Speaker Paul Ryan in a statement on his website . "States will no longer be shackled by federally determined program requirements and enrollment criteria."\u000a\u000aBeyond just state budgets, block grants can also change the way the programs work. Government leaders could, for example, institute requirements that Medicaid recipients have jobs, end federal rules that states pay for programs to help pregnant mothers quit smoking, or create a wait list for insurance.\u000a\u000a"We would go from a scenario where the government helps to guarantee access to certain levels of benefits to support kids and families, to a 'you're on your own, first-come-first-served' scenario," said Kelly Hardy, senior managing director for health policy at Children Now, a California advocacy group.\u000a\u000aPushing for change\u000a\u000aRepublican and conservative thinkers have pushed to turn entitlement programs into block grants for decades. Ryan, 47, famously said in March that he'd been "dreaming" of cutting Medicaid since he was " drinking out of a keg ."\u000a\u000aThey argue that the free-spending entitlement approach to poverty and social services hasn't succeeded. The nation's poverty rate hasn't changed dramatically since the 1970s, when programs like SNAP and Medicaid were first introduced and the percentage of children in poverty hasn't declined since 1970 , five years after Medicaid and other "War on Poverty" welfare programs were first signed into law.\u000a\u000a"We don't know what works best," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute. "But we know what we're doing isn't working. Experimentation seems like a good idea."\u000a\u000aThat flexibility of block grants could let states tailor social service programs to the needs of their residents, supporters argue.\u000a\u000aFor example, under block grants, states could combine nutritional benefit money with healthcare funds to offer people at risk of obesity intense nutritional counseling early in life, before they require expensive treatment for diabetes or heart disease, said Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank that has pushed block-grant programs.\u000a\u000a"We tend to put things in silos," Miller said of the social safety net. "If your focus is on improving people's health you would think about what could be rearranged. How do we best assist the person in front of us, if you could reshape it and bundle together what the government is offering? Maybe housing is the thing that is going to make them healthy, not another doctor visit."\u000a\u000aMiller pointed to a 2015 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that gave disabled people on Medicaid cash allowances to spend money on in-home health services they thought they needed instead of trying to file for benefit programs. The study found that issuing cash allowances cost the government slightly more, but only because people more easily accessed the help they were entitled to in the first place.\u000a\u000a"States are the 50 experiments, the labs of democracy," said Tanner of the Cato Institute. "Right now we treat everything as an identical cookie cutter, but maybe a state wants to focus on housing, or the universal basic income, or increasing work requirements."\u000a\u000aDoing more with less\u000a\u000aBut critics say the talk of innovation distracts from the fact that block grants reduce federal spending.\u000a\u000a"Having looked at these proposals, it seems easy to determine that the decision that will be left to the states will be how to deal with less federal money," said Matt Broaddus, a research analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think-tank that specializes in welfare policy.\u000a\u000astudy by the nonpartisfan Urban Institute found. In West Virginia, where 53% of children are covered by Medicaid, a shift to per capita or lump sum block grants could leave state leaders with a $4 to $7 billion shortfall in federal spending over 10 years, astudy by the nonpartisfan Urban Institute found.\u000a\u000a"If that happens, then we have to figure out where to cut," said Renate Pore, interim executive director of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care. "Are they going to cut services, like dental care? Are they going to reduce the number of people eligible? People will have coverage that is less affordable, especially children."\u000a\u000a"These are all bad choices," Pore added.b\u000a\u000aDr. Lynda Young, a primary care pediatrician in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that if Medicaid funding was reduced, fewer doctors might treat Medicaid patients and parents could find it harder and more expensive to bring their children to the doctor.\u000a\u000a"When the money is gone, what is going to happen to the kids?" she asked. "They don't come for routine care, so we're talking about their general development and health. We look at lead when they come in, we look at anemia, we look at making sure they have enough to eat."\u000a\u000aIn Ohio, parents like Abby Holmes might find themselves without coverage while their children have less Medicaid coverage than they did before. Under Republican plans, Ohio could lose $22 to $40 billion in federal health funding from 2019 to 2028, according to the Urban Institute\u000a\u000aAnd while block grants may promise states a reasonable amount of money when first implemented, studies have shown that over time other social safety net block grants for housing and health insurance don't grow to account for inflation, rising costs or population changes, leaving states with less spending power each year.\u000a\u000aThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities studied 13 federal block grants for programs like child care, substance abuse and maternal health and found that between 2000 and 2016, federal funding fell an average of 26%. Few states could make up the shortfalls and instead reduced benefits or cut people from the programs.\u000a\u000aIn California, where 42% of children are covered by the state's Medi-Cal program, families could be forced to spend months on waiting lists before they get coverage.\u000a\u000a"We've done this before," said Hardy of Children Now, referring to of earlier California budget cuts. "At one point we had 90,000 kids on a waitlist for a program that overall had a million kids in it."\u000a\u000aCutting additional programs\u000a\u000aWhile cuts to Medicaid would be the largest and most dramatic changes to federal entitlements under the new Republican plans, they would also potentially cut millions of dollars for the federal government's food stamp entitlement program, which covers 43 million low-income Americans, almost 70% of whom are families with children.\u000a\u000aThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, called SNAP, functions much the same way a Medicaid entitlement does: Anyone eligible for the benefit will be covered and the federal government will reimburse states. But the program could be shifted to block grants, providing a fixed amount of money to states for those who need help buying food.\u000a\u000a"Let's assume the block-grant funding" stays flat, said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "That means that SNAP can't expand to meet needs if a state or even a community experiences a downturn, say if a plant closes."\u000a\u000aLike Medicaid, cuts to SNAP could mean fewer people would be eligible for benefits or might have to wait longer to receive them.\u000a\u000a"It becomes a real tension when benefits are cut, because SNAP is part of the household budget" Dean said. "At some point you're going to give up your house rather than allow your kids to go hungry."\u000a\u000aAnother program that could be changed to a block grant is Social Security Income, which provides as much as $733 a month in cash assistance to 8.4 million poor and disabled people, including 1.3 million disabled or blind children. Many of the children who receive SSI live with a single parent and receive special education.\u000a\u000aUnder block grants, states could make it harder for parents with disabled children to receive benefits or could cut the monthly amount of money they receive.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump and Ryan have made clear they hope to reduce federal spending by reforming Medicaid and rolling back the expansion of other programs that support children, the cost savings now could lead to higher expenses a few decades from now, advocates said. Children who have grown up without healthy food or easy access to doctors struggle with chronic, expensive health problems for the rest of their lives.\u000a\u000a"As people grow up without adequate medical care, that really is a big problem," said Marcia Lowry, head of A Better Childhood, which advocates for abused and neglected children. "It is going to have a big impact on the population, especially the poor population, as they grow up."

aVBut despite popular health claims about coconut oil, a report from the American Heart Association recently advised against its use , stating that it increases LDL cholesterol (a cause of cardiovascular disease) and has no known offsetting effects.\u000a\u000a"There are many claims being made about coconut oil being wonderful for lots of different things, but we really don't have any evidence of long-term health benefits," said Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\u000a\u000aHow exactly, then, does coconut oil rank among oils?\u000a\u000a"Coconut oil is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum in terms of types of fats. It's probably better than partially hydrogenated oils (which are) high in trans fats but not as good as the more unsaturated plant oils that have proven health benefits, like olive and canola oil," Willett said.\u000a\u000a"It's probably not quite as 'bad' as butter but not as good as extra virgin olive oil," agreed Kevin Klatt, a molecular nutrition researcher at Cornell University who is studying the metabolic effects of coconut oil.\u000a\u000aKlatt cautions that we should not develop too strong of an opinion about coconut oil without more data. "But at the same time, you have to be evidence-based ... and (currently), the evidence reflects benefits for olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds -- so that should be the focus in the diet."\u000a\u000aWhat's in coconut oil?\u000a\u000aCoconut oil is extracted from the meat of the fruit. It contains mostly saturated fat, which is also found in large quantities in butter and red meat. Like other saturated fats, coconut oil increases LDL cholesterol, the "bad" cholesterol associated with increased risk of heart disease. In fact, coconut oil has more saturated fat and raises LDL more than butter, according to Willett.\u000a\u000aBut coconut oil does a particularly nice job of raising HDL, the "good" cholesterol, especially when replacing carbohydrates in the diet. This may be due to its high content of a fatty acid known as lauric acid.\u000a\u000a"Coconut oil is half lauric acid, which is a little bit unique," Klatt said, as the acid seems to raise HDL more than other saturated fats and is rarely found in such high amounts in foods.\u000a\u000aStill, though the increase in HDL seen with consumption of coconut oil may offset some of the disease risk, it's still not as good as consuming unsaturated oils, which not only raise HDL but lower LDL, according to Willett.\u000a\u000aComplicating matters is the fact that we still don't know for sure what exactly a high HDL translates to in terms of health risk. "There's been debate about the role of HDL," Willett cautioned. "Partly because there are many forms of HDL which have different health consequences ... which has made the water murky."\u000a\u000aFor example, there are different forms of HDL that do different things. One role is to help take LDL cholesterol out of the bloodstream. "But some forms of HDL don't do that," Willett said, "so we don't know for sure that higher HDL is better."\u000a\u000aAnd while it's true that an elevated LDL level is only a risk factor for heart disease and doesn't always translate to heart attacks, it's still cause for concern. "High LDL is a risk factor, but it strongly predicts negative health events," Willett said.\u000a\u000aThere is extremely preliminary evidence that the increase in LDL may not be as pronounced if one consumes extra virgin coconut oil instead of refined coconut oil, according to Klatt. For example, polyphenols present in unrefined oils may help to blunt the effects on LDL. But "the effects of extra virgin compared to refined coconut oil and other common oils require further study," he cautioned.\u000a\u000aCoconut oil and weight loss\u000a\u000aSome research suggests that coconut oil may be helpful in reducing belly fat, at least in the short term. One study found that coconut oil was associated with reduced waist circumference (belly fat) compared with soybean oil. Participants also consumed a lot more fiber, followed a low-calorie diet and walked for about an hour each day.\u000a\u000a"Even if coconut oil does help reduce belly fat, it doesn't necessarily outweigh the concern about its effect on lipids, specifically LDL," Klatt said.\u000a\u000aOther research has touted benefits such as increased metabolism, reduced appetite or improved cognitive function associated with fats known as MCTs, or medium chain triglycerides, which are present in coconut oil.\u000a\u000a"You can't infer from ... studies what coconut oil will and will not do. We need better controlled trials," Klatt said. "Right now, the internet is jumping the gun and going way beyond the evidence."\u000a\u000aCoco-calories\u000a\u000aLike other oils, coconut oil is calorie-dense, which means consuming large amounts without reducing other calorie sources can lead to weight gain. Just one tablespoon has 120 calories, about the same as a large apple or four cups of air-popped popcorn.\u000a\u000a"Oil is a really easy way to increase the energy density of a food. Things like almonds have a lot of fat, but it's easier to overeat pure oil than overeat pure almonds," Klatt said.\u000a\u000aIn small amounts, however, coconut oil can have a place in one's diet.\u000a\u000a"It's not that you have to absolutely avoid coconut oil but rather limit coconut oil to where you really need that special flavor, like for Thai food or for baking a special dessert," Willett said.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"If you love using butter and need a hard fat, coconut oil may be a better choice and is certainly fine to consume occasionally, when a recipe calls for it," Klatt added.\u000a\u000aBut for day-to-day use, vegetable oils such as olive, canola or soybean oil, along with nuts and seeds, should be your primary fats. "These have better effects on blood cholesterol and long-term studies showing reduced risk of heart disease," Willett said.

But he has one quality that fuels all the others: Warren is the most upbeat, optimistic person we know.\u000a\u000aHe's optimistic about the country, about the future and about you. No matter where things are right now, he knows in the long run they're getting better. You doubt it? Don't bet against it; he's made billions investing in that belief. The great thing about Warren's optimism is you can't hear him share a story, tell a joke or say hello without picking up some of his optimism yourself.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Why Bill Gates is optimistic about the future Replay More Videos ...

He paints a very different picture of the actor he last spoke with at length five years ago.\u000a\u000aGalloway recalled Clooney being plagued with insomnia and, at times, lonely. Now, Clooney described his house as "filled with the warm sounds of babies crying."\u000a\u000a"I'm a very good diaper guy, which I didn't know I would be," Clooney said in the interview.\u000a\u000aWife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney revealed she doesn't anticipate the couple having more children.\u000a\u000aAt home with George Clooney in Italy: Amal, the twins, fatherhood, racism and an incendiary new movie with Matt Damon and Julianne Moore.

And when they're not having five-hour meals and playing basketball, Clooney and Obama have an ongoing exchange via text that sometimes gets "a little bit" colorful.\u000a\u000aBut, Clooney added, "Not Scaramucci-racy."\u000a\u000aHe's thinking about his 'third act'\u000a\u000aWith "Suburbicon," a drama that touches on racial tensions in the 1950s, earning awards buzz, Clooney is already working on two more projects, according to the article.\u000a\u000aNeither of them, however, are in front of the camera. Clooney, who hasn't acted in two years, said, "As you get older, the parts aren't as interesting. I'm not a leading man anymore. Nobody wants to see me kiss the girl."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, he sees directing as something that still "excites me."\u000a\u000a"But at some point -- which happens with everyone -- they take the toys away, put them in the box and take it away. And I know it will go away," he said. "I know how this works. I know how it ends.

It happened years ago at a restaurant. Clooney was recovering from neck surgery, and Trump offered to give him a recommendation for a doctor.\u000a\u000a"He wrote me a couple of times with the name," the actor said. "Then he went on Larry King Live and told him I was very short. I'm 5 foot 11 -- I'm not the tallest actor in the world, but I'm not short. That made me laugh."\u000a\u000aPolitics is largely no laughing matter for Clooney, however.\u000a\u000aAn outspoken opponent of Trump, Clooney told the magazine: "It would be best for the country if some of these Republicans -- and some of them I'm very good friends with, actually -- stood up [to him]."

aVDavid A. Andelman, a contributor to CNN and columnist for USA Today, is the author of " A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today ." He formerly served as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and Paris correspondent for CBS News. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman . The views expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) On December 12, French President Emmanuel Macron is gathering in Paris all the world's leaders who concluded the COP21 climate agreement two years ago, when the world unanimously agreed for the first time that it was necessary to slash greenhouse gas emissions and restrain global warming if human life were to survive on Earth.\u000a\u000aLeaders of virtually every country who signed this pact are expected to return to Paris in December -- except Donald Trump. His absence is particularly alarming as America becomes the target of two of history's most vicious back-to-back hurricanes , and two more on deck behind them, and becomes one of the world's biggest and most immediate victims of climate change. And then there are the wildfires burning across the far West, their smoke headed east as well -- more than 100 at last count, consuming more than 2 million acres and hundreds of homes -- attributed to tinder-dry lands and record high temperatures.\u000a\u000aHe should rethink his approach to climate change and go to the December meeting, if for nothing else, to make America great again.\u000a\u000aThe United States is getting a front-row seat this summer to what a warming Earth promises for the future of humanity \u2014 and sadly it's just a mild foretaste. In March, Kerry Emanuel, MIT's eminent professor of meteorology and co-director of the Lorenz Center, concluded in a remarkable paper for the American Meteorological Society that "Climate change potentially affects the frequency, intensity, and tracks of tropical cyclones."\u000a\u000aAnd, as a member of the World Meteorological Organization's expert team, Emanuel signed a statement on September 1 that observed, "Hurricanes in a warmer climate are likely to become more intense, and that it is more likely than not that the frequency of Category 4 hurricanes like Harvey will increase over the 21st century." And sure enough, a week later, along came Irma.\u000a\u000aIf there were any doubt about the impact of climate change on the frequency and intensity of what scientists generally call "cyclones" \u2014 known in Asia as typhoons and in the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico as hurricanes \u2014 that doubt is easily resolved by simply looking at some of their detailed research, using real-life hurricanes and vastly complex computer modeling. As Emanuel points out in his paper, the data seems to suggest "we would expect a significant increase in extremes of storm intensification, including those that happen just before landfall."\u000a\u000aBut there's still more. In the case of many hurricanes, such as Harvey, the principal damage is from water rather than the brute force winds of Irma. Harvey, in the course of its repeated passes through the Gulf of Mexico, drew new sources of water from the warming seas of the Gulf, dumping each load over southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.\u000a\u000aAs the WMO statement points out "the tropical atmosphere generally hold[s] more water vapor due to climate warming (about 7% more water vapor per degree Celsius sea surface temperature increase)." As the science appears to suggest, a 10 degree rise in the water's temperature could be expected to add 70% to what was available for Harvey to dump on Houston.\u000a\u000aThis phenomenon of more intense hurricanes, accompanied by more powerful and damaging rainfall, is hardly confined to North America. Last month Typhoon Hato caused more than $1 billion in damage, including severe flooding and multiple deaths.\u000a\u000aJohnny Chan, who also signed the WMO statement, is the director of Guy Carpenter Asia Pacific Climate Impact Centre at the School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong. He pointed out that "global warming is going to produce more heavy rain, simply because with global warming you have more evaporation getting into the atmosphere; so there is more moisture in the atmosphere. With more moisture in the atmosphere, the rains will be heavier."\u000a\u000aIt was, therefore, hardly surprising that the climate scientists who helped draft the COP21 document in late 2015, alongside diplomats and politicians from 175 countries, were intent on doing everything within their power to limit the warming of the Earth's atmosphere \u2014 and by direct extension, the warming of the waters that hurricanes pass over.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the COP21 agreement was a global wake-up call -- which will undoubtedly intensify as links become even clearer between global warming and the catastrophes of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma -- to every nation and a host of localities. Of particular concern, however, is efforts by the Trump administration, particularly the Environmental Protection Agency , to undermine the clear conclusions of atmospheric scientists monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and any future research that could confirm any conclusions already reached. Such efforts could have an equally serious effect on our ability to forecast and track the patterns of future storms.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aSo, it was not merely a fit of political pique that led President Macron, in a live broadcast from the Elysee Palace last June, to invite American climate scientists to France where they would find a welcome refuge to pursue their research, with the goal, in a clear swipe at President Trump, to "make our planet great again."\u000a\u000aFrench officials, who may see themselves privately as the godfathers of the COP21 process, are anxious for the December conference to begin to move the accord from a simple pledge by each of the signatories to a binding agreement in the form of a treaty , the most sweeping ever concluded.\u000a\u000aThere could be no greater tribute to those who lost their lives, homes or property in Harvey and Irma, than for Trump to join Macron in this crusade and accept the fact that climate change is a dangerous and real phenomenon.

aV(CNN) The race to the top has just gotten tighter, with two rising mega-towers in the Middle East battling to become the world's tallest.\u000a\u000aConstruction has now begun on The Tower at Dubai Creek Harbor , a vast waterfront development, with completion scheduled for ahead of Dubai's Expo 2020 world fair, which kicks off in October that year.\u000a\u000aPiercing through a canopy of clouds, The Tower, at 3,045ft (928m), aims to take the title of world's tallest tower, which the 2,723ft-tall (830m) Burj Khalifa , also in Dubai, has held since 2010.\u000a\u000aBut it's got competition. The Jeddah Tower , in Saudi Arabia, is also slated to finish in 2020.\u000a\u000aWhen completed, this gleaming vertical will be 236ft (72m) taller than Dubai's creation.\u000a\u000aIf The Tower in Dubai wants the world title, even for a short time, it has to open its doors before the Jeddah Tower.\u000a\u000aThe Tower will be the heart of Dubai Creek Harbour, one of the largest tourist and lifestyle developments in the world stretching across 2.3 square miles (6 sqkm).\u000a\u000aReady, steady, go!\u000a\u000aBoth of these towers are feats in modern engineering.\u000a\u000aThe Tower , in Dubai, is being constructed by Emaar, the real estate giant also behind the Burj Khalifa, and will anchor the Dubai Creek development, serving -- developers hope -- as a magnet for tourists.\u000a\u000aDesigned by Swiss-Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava Valls , it will feature The Pinnacle Room -- an observation point offering 360-degree views of the emirate -- and public vertical gardens, while 18 to 20 floors have been reserved for homes, restaurants, shops and a boutique hotel.\u000a\u000aIf construction runs to schedule, this $1 billion tower will have been thrown up in just three years.\u000a\u000aThe Jeddah Tower, in Saudi Arabia, will have taken a little longer.\u000a\u000aConstruction on this graceful arrow to the sky began on April 1, 2013, and was originally slated for completion in 2018, but its opening date has already been pushed back twice. Constructing it will require about 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel, according to the Saudi Gazette\u000a\u000aPhotos: These spiraling skyscrapers are some of the world's most eye-catching buildngs Twisting tall towers of the world \u2013 'The Eleventh' towers in New York will stand 300 and 400 feet tall on completion in 2019.

This $1.23 billion construction project is, however, already40 floors off the ground, with 212 left to build -- it's undeniably farther along than the Dubai Tower.\u000a\u000aBut to think Dubai could finish first is not "as farfetched as it sounds", according to Jason Gabel, communications manager for the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).\u000a\u000a"The Dubai project is an observation tower, and therefore won't require nearly as much lead time as a full-blown skyscraper," Gabel tells CNN. "2020 is a real possibility for completion."\u000a\u000aBecause less than 50% of The Tower's height is occupied by usable floor space, it is defined by the CTBUH as a "supported tower" rather than a "building".\u000a\u000aThis technicality precludes The Tower from achieving the distinction of being the world's tallest building. Rather, it would be the world's tallest man-made structure, or tower, until the Jeddah Tower is completed.\u000a\u000aThe power of a skyline\u000a\u000aHome to more than 65 highrises over 656 feet (200m) tall and counting, Dubai has become synonymous with futuristic skyscrapers, and has been a pioneer of this in the Middle East.\u000a\u000a"Historically, no Middle Eastern country has come close to building skyscrapers at the rate and height of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but notable pockets of high-rise development are occurring in Qatar, Israel, and Saudi Arabia," says Gabel. "The competitive situation we now see between Saudi Arabia and the UAE very unique."\u000a\u000aDubai's lofty intentions debuted in 1979, with the 39-story Dubai World Trade Center. It was the city's first high rise, and the tallest building in the Middle East.\u000a\u000aSubsequent iconic buildings, such as the Burj Khalifa and the Burj Al Arab , have given Dubai global notoriety.\u000a\u000aBurj Al Arab\u000a\u000a"Height produces iconicity and visibility on a global stage," says Gabel, explaining why Dubai has focused on building big. "Visibility is itself an asset that can have a positive impact on real estate valuation, investment flows, tourism numbers, and public identity.\u000a\u000a"Put simply, structures like this are very expensive upfront, but the benefits of having the 'tallest' are often worth the trouble -- as was the case with the Burj Khalifa."\u000a\u000aAric Chen, the design and architecture curator M+ visual culture museum in Hong Kong, tells CNN that for emerging economies a skyline can be a powerful communications tool.\u000a\u000a"These soaring profiles are in many ways symbolic," Chen tells CNN.\u000a\u000a"Places like Dubai and, to some extent, places like China, are still trying to put themselves on the map and prove that they have arrived as modern global and technologically advanced nations."\u000a\u000aTesting the tower\u000a\u000aThe rapid speed at which Dubai can throw up a mega-tower has not, however, escaped criticism.\u000a\u000aA series of fires in the past few years, including a blaze that tore through a luxury skyscraper on the Palm Jumeirah artificial island in Dubai this month -- have called into question the quality of some towers, and their fire-proofing.\u000a\u000a"Super tall buildings are not unproblematic and there are safety concerns," says Chen.\u000a\u000aValls, however, is confident that The Tower will not succumb to such issues.\u000a\u000a"Extensive studies were undertaken in preparation for the ground breaking, and the learning that we have gained from the experience will add to the knowledge base of mankind," he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aDevelopers have installed multiple damper and shock absorption systems throughout the building, to ensure its stability.\u000a\u000aThey also completed a series of wind tunnel, climate and seismic tests analyzing 12 scenarios across varying heights to check the behavior of the building under stressful conditions.\u000a\u000a"We need to have a balanced and careful look at skyscrapers," says Chen. "But they do serve to again push technologies, and push what's possible.\u000a\u000a"We can certainly learn from that experimentation."

aVIn 2014 the country opened the largest wind farm in Africa, valued at $1.4 billion, in the southwest near the city of Tarfaya. Then, in early 2016, it switched on the first facility of the world's largest concentrated solar plant, Noor-1 , on the fringe of the Sahara desert. When completed in 2018, it will power one million homes and make Morocco a solar superpower.\u000a\u000aAnd while the country is still heavily reliant on energy imports (90 percent in 2013, according to the World Bank ), it plans to generate 40 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020.\u000a\u000aFollowing this road has led to Morocco hosting the UN's 2016 summit on climate change, COP22 , in Marrakech. So what lies ahead?\u000a\u000aCutting the energy bill\u000a\u000aMorocco ranks seventh in the world in the 2016 Climate Change Performance Index , and is the only non-European country in the top 20.\u000a\u000aIt's also one of only five countries to have achieved a "sufficient" rating for its efforts to keep warming below 2°C in the Climate Action Tracker (no country has achieved the "role model" rating as of yet, so "sufficient" is currently the best grade).\u000a\u000aAn aerial view of the solar mirrors at the Noor 1 Concentrated Solar Power plant, 12.5 miles outside the central Moroccan town of Ouarzazate.\u000a\u000aHow did it get there? "We started with a question: How can we decrease our energy bill?" Said Mouline, director of the National Agency for the Development of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"Morocco is a very energy dependent country. In 2009, that bill amounted to $10 billion."\u000a\u000aSo, in 2011, Morocco altered its constitution to include sustainable development, stopped subsidizing fossil fuels to make renewables more competitive, and started welcoming private investments in the clean energy sector.\u000a\u000aEfficiency is key\u000a\u000a"This transition has two paths, and renewables are just one. The other is energy efficiency. Both need to be developed at the same time," Mouline said.\u000a\u000aOne key action is reducing waste: the electricity state utility, ONEE, has started a program to replace old incandescent light bulbs in Moroccan households with 10 million compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), which are far more efficient.\u000a\u000aTo offset the initial cost -- CFLs are six time more expensive -- the utility allows users to pay for them in installments through the bill, which itself is lowered by the better efficiency.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Environment Program estimates that by switching just 40 percent of households, power consumption would drop by 20 percent, cutting 2.74 million tons of CO2 emission by the end of 2021 -- as much as would be created by consuming 308 million gallons of gasoline, according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Calculator.\u000a\u000aAs part of its efforts for a greener future, Morocco has also started to transition its 15,000 mosques to renewable energy, and in July it banned the production, sale and use of plastic bags, of which it used three billion each year.\u000a\u000aA $3.5 billion economy boost\u000a\u000aMouline, who's also a member of the Steering Committee of COP22, says energy efficiency is the cheapest way for countries to meet their targets under the Paris agreement.\u000a\u000a"The government set some ambitious goals. Fifty two percent of our energy capacity must come from renewables by 2030, and by the same date we must achieve 20 percent better energy efficiency in all sectors: transport, housing, agriculture.\u000a\u000aThe wind farm in Melloussa, 21 miles from Tangiers in northern Morocco, has 165 turbines, with a production capacity of 140 megawatts.\u000a\u000a"That means that if our energy consumption doubles by 2030, we want to actually consume 20 percent less than that. We want to stop wasting energy," he said.\u000a\u000aAnd the country could run entirely on green energy by 2050, according to a study by Stanford University on the energy roadmap of 139 countries.\u000a\u000aThis would contribute about $3.5 billion to the economy and add over 88,000 permanent jobs, the study predicts.\u000a\u000aAn example for Africa\u000a\u000aAt an event held at COP22 in 2016 promoting solar energy in Africa, Morocco's efforts were used as an example of how Sub-Saharan Africa can capitalize on the highest irradiation rates in the world, even though solar power only makes up approximately 0.5% of energy production in the area.\u000a\u000aThe event highlighted the World Bank and International Finance Corporation's efforts to raise $16 billion for solar, hydro, and geothermal energy projects throughout the continent.\u000a\u000aAccording to Mouline, this transition will be inevitable: "We are switching, all over the world. Last year more money was invested in clean energy than fossil fuels for the first time. Look at how many new jobs renewables, energy storage and electric mobility have created."\u000a\u000aMorocco's wind farm in Tarfaya, which produces 850MW, has created an new industry in the country, as 70 percent of the spare parts for the turbines are manufactured locally.\u000a\u000a"Making electricity is only a part of a larger strategy."\u000a\u000aWater security\u000a\u000aAs a country made up of 78 percent desert or dry zones, according to FAO estimates , Morocco faces special challenges in the fight against climate change.\u000a\u000a"At the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, Morocco was one of the first countries to ratify the agreement on biodiversity, desertification and climate change," said Abdelâdim Lhafi, High Commissioner for Water, Forests and the Fight Against Desertification of Morocco.\u000a\u000a"Before 1992 and starting in the 1960s there were strong policies about water, and Morocco now has about 140 dams with a total storage of 18 billion cubic meters (635 billion cubic feet), which is crucial for a country that is severely hit by droughts."\u000a\u000aDue to increased demand, demographic changes and tourism, some areas of the country now experience water scarcity: "But we've made a lot of progress in the use of water, especially in agriculture which absorbs 85 percent of our supply. That's why we're looking at new technologies for our 1.2 million hectares of irrigated areas, to preserve our food security," Lhafi said.\u000a\u000a"We've done a lot, but we still have a lot to do in the coming years."

aVIt's been nearly 35 years since Rocky III premiered, but even now we are learning things about it that we never knew.\u000a\u000aThis weekend, Sylvester Stallone shared a photo from the set along with some fascinating details.\u000a\u000aApparently, the actor pushed his body to the extreme for the movie. Not only was his diet strict, but he also utilized some interesting techniques in order to do the fight scenes:\u000a\u000aJust for fun\u2026 A flashback from Rocky three. Between rounds I would get lightheaded and quite exhausted. I was on a very high protein diet which did not provide Much physical or mental energy. During the period I only ate very small portions of oatmeal cookies made with brown rice and up to 25 cups of coffee a day with honey and a couple of scoops of tuna fish. Sounds incredible right? At the time my body fat got down to 2.9 which is a really dangerous level. I may have looked pretty good on the outside but inside it was very dangerous thing to do. But I wanted the movie to be about change. How people have to adapt to different challenges because if they don't they will be conquered. I will always believe the adaptation is the key to survival and that's what this story was all about ... and while, getting smashed by Superstrong,CLUBBER LANG continuously four months of rehearsal plus the fight, tended to wear a person out so I would literally go to the corner between rounds, when I wasn't directing and try to get some blood back into my head so I could carry-on with the complicated fight choreography \u2026 It's funny, I never knew this picture existed!\u000a\u000aThat's intense.\u000a\u000aGiven the legacy the Rocky films created, Stallone can look back at all the hard work and say it was worth it.\u000a\u000a[Sylvester Stallone]

He formerly served as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and Paris correspondent for CBS News. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman . The views expressed in this commentary are his.\u000a\u000a(CNN) Not every campaign promise is worth keeping. But to please his base, Donald Trump may be about to scrap the main trade pact between the United States and South Korea, the first bilateral treaty he will have terminated as President. Smart? No. Not now, probably not ever.\u000a\u000aIsn't this the very moment when we should be doing all we can to support and strengthen South Korea, a nation that is our principal bulwark against a madman who boasts he now has a hydrogen bomb that can destroy civilization? Apparently not, if it means leaving yet another campaign promise to his base unfulfilled.\u000a\u000aDonald Trump made that promise as a candidate, back when North Korea was pretty far down on his list of global priorities, and a whole lot of other pledges seemed like better bets.\u000a\u000aBut one by one, each of his pledges to his base have come to naught. He hasn't managed to " repeal and replace Obamacare ," " build a wall and make Mexico pay for it ," scrap NAFTA or the " total and complete shutdown " of Muslims coming to our shores. But now, at the very worst possible moment, Trump seems hell-bent on touching off a trade war with one of our most critical allies and the very country we most desperately need to support just as it is facing an existential challenge from its arch enemy to the north, which has also threatened to unleash a nuclear Armageddon on America.\u000a\u000aNow President Trump has threatened to cut off trading ties with any country doing business with North Korea (which could halt US trade with China). He has also, according to a report in the Washington Post, instructed aides to get ready to withdraw the United States from the free-trade deal with South Korea, even as he and President Moon Jae-in have agreed "in principle" to revise a bilateral treaty that governs the South's ballistic missiles. At least three of his leading advisers on these matters oppose scrapping our trade pact. National security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, and Gary Cohn, his top economic counselor and former president of Goldman Sachs, are all said to be livid over the prospects of this latest, looming Trump tragedy. But that may not mean much, even though President Trump also said Sunday that he would be meeting with Mattis, his chief of staff John Kelly and other military leaders, ostensibly about the looming North Korea threat.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump apparently also believes the South Korean government needs more spine in its dealings with the North. Or as he tweeted at 7:46 Sunday morning: "South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!" One wonders how exactly weakening the tent-pole of South Korea's economy is going to put more spine and confidence in South Korea's dealings with the North.\u000a\u000aRemember how much the President loves bilateral trade agreements and hates big multinational pacts that he blames for giving away the store and destroying American jobs? Well, it's true, South Korea does ship more than $20 billion more goods to the United States than we send its way each year. But that includes a whole lot of Samsung televisions and smartphones, and cheap cars, that if both countries slapped on major duties would cost American consumers a whole lot more than they're paying now. Not to mention the output of American farms, whose exports to South Korea have soared, with beef exports alone more than doubling in the past six years. And then there's the $23 billion in investments South Korea has made in the United States. How many of these might now be put at risk? How well is all this going to go down in middle America?\u000a\u000aIt's worth remembering, too, that the new South Korean government is barely four months old, with liberal President Moon Jae-in coming to power after the arrest and impeachment of his predecessor amid a massive corruption scandal. Moon Jae-in said during his campaign that some accommodation with North Korea was essential and opposed deployment of the THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System, by US forces in South Korea. In the wake of North Korean missile and nuclear tests, however, he has now asked American permission to augment his nation's own missile forces and agreed to at least temporary deployment of a full THAAD battery in the South. Any effort to cut trade relations by the United States could only be viewed most darkly by this South Korean leader who has only just begun coming around to a more appropriate view of how the North should be treated.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aThe end of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact has left China very much in the driver's seat across much of Asia, and South Korea clinging to one reed still left to its prosperity \u2014 the trade pact with America. Now President Trump seems poised to snatch this from its outstretched hand, effectively ending with one stroke what is left of our amicable relations with South Korea.

aVSandakan, Sabah, Malaysia (CNN) With his wire-rimmed glasses and mild manner, Siew Te Wong could be described as a Malaysian Clark Kent.\u000a\u000aThis wildlife biologist is a Superman of sorts -- a tireless defender of the world's smallest bear species: the sun bear.\u000a\u000a"I often call the sun bear a forgotten species," Wong said. "When I first started, 20 years ago, no one has ever studied sun bears. Most people do not know that they even exist."\u000a\u000aAs he studied the animal and realized the threats it faced from deforestation and hunting/poaching, he knew the bears were in serious trouble.\u000a\u000a"The more I learn about them, the more I care. The more I care, the more I worry," he said. "I have to help them."\u000a\u000aToday, Wong's nonprofit, the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, is the only sun bear sanctuary in the world.\u000a\u000aWong -- known as "Papa Bear" -- and his team have rehabilitated and cared for 55 rescued sun bears since 2008. The group now also educates the public about these animals.\u000a\u000aSun bears are found in the rainforests of south Asia, and the small bears play a big role in keeping these woodlands healthy. Many plants and animals depend on them to spread seeds, create nesting sites and control the termite population -- functions that keep the ecosystems in balance. Healthy rainforests provide clean air and water to the entire world.\u000a\u000aBut the sun bear population has decreased by 30% during the last three decades. In 2007, the bear was officially classified as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u000a\u000aCurrently, 44 sun bears live at Wong's center -- all of them were orphaned by poachers or rescued from captivity. The center has also become one of the leading tourist destinations in the area, helping to raise awareness about the sun bear's plight.\u000a\u000aA sun bear explores the forest at the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre.\u000a\u000a"They can see how special the sun bear is and learn about how their survival (is) important to ours," Wong said, "so they can take some action when they go back to home."\u000a\u000aFor Wong, this work is simply his responsibility.\u000a\u000a"Sun bears became part of my family. When they're endangered, I care for them. When they are in trouble, I speak for them," he said. "I want to be the voice for the sun bear, to fight for the sun bear, to ensure the survival of the sun bear."\u000a\u000a"But my ultimate goal is to save the entire forest ecosystem ... that is so important to the survival of mankind."\u000a\u000aCNN spoke with Wong about his work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.\u000a\u000aCNN: How did you get involved with the sun bear?\u000a\u000aSiew Te Wong: I grew up keeping different pets and rescuing birds that fell from nests. I always wanted to be an animal expert or a veterinarian. After high school, I went to Taiwan to study veterinary science, and that's where I got involved with studying wildlife. In 1994, I came to the University of Montana to study wildlife biology and I met a professor, Christopher Servheen. He was looking for a Malaysian student to do a study on sun bears. I said, "I'm your man!"\u000a\u000aCNN: Tell me more about the threats these animals face.\u000a\u000aWong: Over the last 50 years, many of the tropical forests in this region have been cleared, and with deforestation, sun bears have lost their habitat. And even though sun bears are a protected species, they are hunted for their meat and their body parts, which are used in traditional Asian medicines. This is literally wiping out local populations.\u000a\u000aTheir babies are also kept as illegal pets. Their cubs are really cute, but people don't realize that this baby bear will turn into a destructive beast. In the end, they will either kill the bears or lock (them) in small cages. We are doing lots of educational awareness to make sure that people don't keep bears anymore.\u000a\u000aCNN: How do the animals spend their time at the center?\u000a\u000aWong: Every day after breakfast, we release the bears into the forest enclosure. This is where they learn to forage, climb trees, build nests and socialize. All of those activities help them get ready to be released and survive in the forest.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Siew Te Wong: Sun bears are not pets Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Siew Te Wong: Sun bears are not pets 02:43\u000a\u000aAt 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., we give the bears different fruits, and at 4pm, the bears come back and have dinner in the bear house. We keep them inside at night because this level of bear density in the forest is not natural. We also want to monitor their well-being. However, there are a few bears left out for the night, which is good. One day, they will live there all the time.\u000a\u000aCNN: How many bears have you been able to release?\u000a\u000aWong: We have released two bears so far, and this year we plan to release four more. There are many bears that we cannot release because they were in captivity for a long time. They lost their instinct to find food, they're habituated to people, and many that were rescued as adults cannot climb trees. There are also bears who (were) malnourished or who had their claws chopped off. They don't have the skills to survive in the forest, so they have to stay here for the rest of their lives.\u000a\u000aHopefully in the future, there'll be more bears ready to be released. I want bears to live in the forest and not in captivity. (That) is where they belong. It is their home.\u000a\u000aWant to get involved?

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) The calamity that has befallen the people of Syria has put the entire world to shame. The image of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi lying facedown on a beach, dead, after his family sought to escape the horrors of their country's civil war , has touched the world. But compassion without action is pointless.\u000a\u000aThousands of refugees are battling European governments. Today, it's Hungary . Last month, it was Macedonia . Desperate people are paying thousands of dollars to traffickers to take them to safety; scores have died of asphyxia after being locked in trucks that failed to reach their destination; thousands have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.\u000a\u000aWe are living in the worst refugee crisis since World War II , and yet the truth is that world leaders have failed to manage the crisis. They will, of course, answer to history. But in the meantime, the situation will only become worse without drastic action: More will die, more refugees will arrive unwanted, more countries will become destabilized and, if this goes on much longer, we will have a generation of Syrians who have grown up in the kind of conditions that perpetuate conflict.\u000a\u000aIt is too late to prevent the current crisis, but there is plenty we can try to do moving forward to try to ease it.\u000a\u000aWhat exactly?\u000a\u000aFor a start, world leaders should convene a top-level emergency gathering to focus on the key aspects of this crisis. The conference should be called by a group of countries, including Germany with strong backing from the United States, and should include the European Union, the United Nations and other world powers, Syria's neighbors, and also Russia and China. The objective should be threefold: to stop the killing, to help the refugees and to bring an end to the war.\u000a\u000aArab nations must play a major role in addressing the Syrian crisis. We are all responsible. But the people of Syria are their neighbors, their brethren. The conflict is in their midst, its impact close to home. To be sure, the neighborhood has not completely failed Syrian refugees. The overwhelming majority of those who have fled Syria -- millions of them -- are now living in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and Arab states have helped finance those costs. But more is needed.\u000a\u000aOnce convened, this international conference should work to develop a comprehensive international plan to help refugees, one that involves a much greater role for Arab and other Muslim states. Indeed, wealthy Gulf states should be encouraged to not just make an outsize financial contribution, but countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia should be pressed to welcome refugees.\u000a\u000aOf course, Europe and the United States should also receive more from among the millions of desperate Syrian refugees fleeing conflict. But so should thriving Muslim states such as Malaysia, Indonesia and of course Iran, whose support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad means it has additional moral responsibility for what is happening. (And speaking of Asia, this could be an opportunity for a country like Japan, with its demographic crisis, to boost its population, or at least do its part to share the burden of this major humanitarian emergency.)\u000a\u000aBut giving refuge to those who are fleeing the horrors of conflict is not enough -- the crisis also needs to be tackled at its source. So, to at least try to slow the killing, it is time to give serious consideration to the establishment of safe zones inside Syria, a proposal that is actually more complicated than it might sound.\u000a\u000aFor example, when Turkey proposed such an approach , some feared that it secretly planned to expel Syrian refugees from Turkish territory and send them back inside Syria to any safe zones. If the system is to work, these zones must come with an ironclad vow from countries hosting refugees not to force anyone to return to Syria before the war is over.\u000a\u000aSafe zones will, of course, require a military commitment to be effective, perhaps from the United States, NATO and other allies, to guarantee the "safe" in "safe zones." They will therefore need to become no-fly zones, with air patrols and anti-aircraft support on the ground. The betrayal of so-called safe areas in Bosnia's Srebrenica must never be allowed to happen again.\u000a\u000aAbove all, though, it is imperative to bring an end to the war, to defeat ISIS and -- just as crucially, although this point now often gets overlooked -- to bring an end to the regime of al-Assad, whose rejection of peaceful demands for democratic reform laid the groundwork for this epic human displacement and for the upsurge in extremism.\u000a\u000aAnd epic this displacement has truly been -- more than 320,000 people have been killed in the war, according to one monitoring group , and there is no end in sight. Before the war started in 2011, about 23 million people lived in Syria. Fully half of them have been displaced. Some 7.5 million are internally displaced . More than 4 million are registered with the United Nations, and many of those fleeing have not been. It is estimated that there are almost 2 million Syrian refugees in Turkey , at least 600,000 in Jordan and perhaps 1.1 million in Lebanon, where they now make up nearly a quarter of the total population.\u000a\u000aSuch an enormous movement of people is further destabilizing an already unsettled region, and bringing with it a level of disruption that could very well sow the seeds for another generation of conflict and extremism.\u000a\u000aThe West's initial approach, which effectively viewed the Syrian civil war as "their problem," has merely underscored how in reality there is no way to contain such conflicts within national boundaries -- this war has spawned ISIS, its videotaped beheadings and sanctioned sexual slavery , scattering its poisonous extremist ideology far and wide. And while an international gathering cannot undo the devastation that has been wrought, it can still be a positive first step toward winding down this conflict.\u000a\u000aThis is the moral and strategic challenge of our time. So far, the world has failed. But if its leaders can begin to publicly and materially empower those who stand for a pluralistic, tolerant and democratic Syria -- one that will eventually welcome back the millions of citizens who have fled -- then we might be able to turn the compassion we have seen in recent days into a more hopeful legacy for the country and its people.

King's speech marked a new epoch in American history.\u000a\u000aKing's most well-known speech mixed a radical critique of institutional racism and white supremacy with a defiant optimism for the future that resonates as much today -- in the aftermath of Charlottesville and other racially motivated conflicts -- as it did in his own time.\u000a\u000aPeniel Joseph\u000a\u000aAlthough not an official holiday, all Americans should embrace this anniversary as a day of service on behalf of social justice, what King characterized as a person's highest public calling. I plan to devote my time and energies that day working and dialoguing with students, community leaders and activists committed to fulfilling the promise of an event whose full title -- "The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom" -- remains the most important and unfulfilled challenge of the civil rights era.\u000a\u000aThe focus on King's "dream" buried some of the most important aspects of the speech. At the March on Washington, King successfully linked a black-led civil rights movement to the sacred texts that form the beating heart of American democracy.\u000a\u000aAfterward, no one could successfully accuse black protesters of being unAmerican or anti-patriotic, even though many would continue to try.

aVRepublicans in Congress have long vowed that they can make health care more affordable and accessible. Americans will now see if they can keep that promise.\u000a\u000aLawmakers have spent hours upon hours debating the GOP's Obamacare repeal bill, deflecting Democrats' attempt to delay the plan's advancement. Two House committees approved the bill on Thursday after marathon hearings.\u000a\u000aWhile the bill will likely change a lot before it lands on President Trump's desk, it's already possible to identify some winners and losers in the individual market and Medicaid.\u000a\u000aRelated: Republicans unveil bill to repeal and replace Obamacare\u000a\u000aTitled the American Health Care Act, the legislation calls for providing refundable tax credits based on a person's age and income. It keeps the Obamacare protections for those with pre-existing conditions, but it allows insurers to levy a 30% surcharge for a year on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse. It lifts the taxes that Obamacare had imposed on the wealthy, insurers and prescription drug manufacturers. And it loosens one of the law's strict insurance reforms so that carriers can offer a wider array of policies that pick up less of the tab for getting care.\u000a\u000aThe bill also eliminates the enhanced federal match for Medicaid expansion starting in 2020 and revamps the funding for the entire Medicaid program.\u000a\u000aRepublican lawmakers have repeatedly skirted criticisms that the bill will likely leave millions uninsured, but reviews of preliminary drafts by the Congressional Budget Office confirmed the problem, sources said. Also, a recent S&P Global report estimated that up to 10 million people could lose their coverage.\u000a\u000a"With Medicaid reductions and smaller tax credits, this bill would clearly result in fewer people insured than under the ACA," said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "The House GOP proposal seeks to reduce what the federal government spends on health care, and that inevitably means more people uninsured."\u000a\u000aExperts remain divided over the impact on the individual market. Some say insurers would flee or jack up their rates if millions of people drop out. Others contend that the Republican bill would stabilize the market and premiums because the reforms would give insurers more flexibility and entice more younger enrollees to sign up for coverage.\u000a\u000a"If we let the ACA continue on its current trajectory, people really will lose coverage," said Doug Badger, senior fellow at the Galen Institute, a free-market, health-care think tank.\u000a\u000aHere's who would likely lose under the Republican plan:\u000a\u000aLower-income folks could be left uninsured\u000a\u000aObamacare contains many provisions to help poor and lower-income Americans. It expanded Medicaid to cover adults who earn up to $16,400 a year -- some 11 million people in 31 states and the District of Columbia are now insured as a result.\u000a\u000aAlso, those with incomes just under $30,000 receive generous subsidies to lower their premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs on the individual market.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would reverse much of this. It would end the enhanced federal Medicaid funding for new enrollees starting in 2020. Those already in the program could stay as long as they remain continuously insured. But since up to half have a break in coverage each year, it's likely participation would fall off quickly, said Jocelyn Guyer, managing director at Manatt Health, a consulting firm.\u000a\u000aBut the Republican bill would go beyond just eliminating Medicaid expansion. It would overhaul the whole program, which covers more than 70 million people, by sending states a fixed amount of money per enrollee, known as a per-capita cap. This would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. However, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments.\u000a\u000aRelated: Higher-income Americans win under Republican plan to repeal Obamacare\u000a\u000aAll this could hurt not only poor adults, but also low-income children, women, senior citizens and the disabled.\u000a\u000aThe legislation also would eliminate the subsidies that reduce deductibles and co-pays for moderate-income policyholders on the individual market. And the tax credits it would provide would not go as far Obamacare's subsidies.\u000a\u000aFolks making $20,000 a year take the biggest hit at any age under the GOP plan, a recent Kaiser study found. A 27-year-old would get only $2,000, instead of $3,225 under Obamacare, on average, while a 40-year-old would get $3,000 versus nearly $4,150.\u000a\u000aHowever, the biggest loser would be a 60-year-old, who would receive only $4,000, instead of nearly $9,900 under Obamacare.\u000a\u000aOlder Americans could have to pay more\u000a\u000aEnrollees in their 50s and early 60s benefited from Obamacare because insurers could only charge them three times more than younger policy holders. The bill would widen that band to five-to-one.\u000a\u000aThat would mean that adults ages 60 to 64 would see their annual premiums soar 22%, or nearly $3,200, to nearly $18,000, according to a study by the Milliman actuarial firm on behalf of the AARP Public Policy Institute. Those in their 50s would be hit with a 13% increase, or just over $1,500, and pay an annual premium of $12,800.\u000a\u000aAlso, the GOP bill doesn't provide them as generous tax credits as Obamacare. A 60-year-old making $40,000 would get only $4,000 from the Republican plan, instead of an average subsidy of $6,750 from the Affordable Care Act, according the Kaiser study.\u000a\u000aThe sick could get coverage, but it could be more limited\u000a\u000aThe GOP plan actually provides stronger protections for those with pre-existing conditions than some prior Republican proposals. Like Obamacare, it requires insurers cover these folks and prevents carriers from charging them more because of their health.\u000a\u000aBut the Republican plan would lift the requirement that insurers cover a certain share of the cost of getting care. This change would allow carriers to offer a wider selection of policies, including more with higher deductibles and co-pays. That could make it more difficult to find plans with low deductibles that the sick often want.\u000a\u000a(However, the bill does not lift the Obamacare provision that limits how much enrollees have to pay out of pocket each year. For this year, the maximum is $7,150.)\u000a\u000aHere's who would likely win:\u000a\u000aYounger Americans could get cheaper plans\u000a\u000aObamacare was designed so that younger policyholders would help subsidize older ones. That would change under the Republican bill because it would allow insurers to charge older folks more.\u000a\u000aThis means that younger Americans would likely see their annual premiums go down. Enrollees age 20 to 29 would save about $700 a year to $4,000, on average, according to the Milliman study for the AARP.\u000a\u000aRelated: Full text: GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare\u000a\u000aThose under age 30 would also get a refundable tax credit of up to $2,000 to offset the cost of their premiums, as long as their income doesn't exceed $215,000 for an individual. It's more likely that younger folks who are earlier in their careers would fall under this cap.\u000a\u000aThe GOP tax credits would also likely be more generous than Obamacare's subsidies for these folks. For example, a 27-year-old making $40,000 a year would receive $2,000 under the GOP plan, but only gets a $103 subsidy from Obamacare, on average, a Kaiser analysis found.\u000a\u000aAlso, the bill keeps the Obamacare provision that lets young adults up to age 26 stay on their parents' insurance plan.\u000a\u000aThe healthy could buy less expensive policies\u000a\u000aUnder Obamacare, only enrollees under age 30 and certain other people could buy catastrophic plans, which had lower monthly premiums but higher deductibles. In 2017, catastrophic plans came with $7,150 deductibles, but Obamacare enrollees couldn't use subsides to pay the premiums.\u000a\u000aThe American Health Care Act would open up such policies to everyone and allow enrollees to use tax credits.\u000a\u000aThis change, however, may not have as big an impact since insurers already offer plans with high deductibles that are eligible for Obamacare subsidies. Republicans dropped a provision from a prior draft that would have allowed carriers to sell policies that covered fewer benefits, such as maternity and prescription drugs. That would have made more of a difference for healthy consumers because they could opt for skimpier plans with lower premiums.\u000a\u000aHigher-income Americans could get tax breaks and perks\u000a\u000aThe legislation would eliminate two taxes that Obamacare levied on the wealthy to help pay for the law. Nearly everyone in the Top 1%, who earn more than $774,000 a year, would enjoy a hefty tax cut, averaging $33,000, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. Those in the Top 0.1% would get an average tax cut of about $197,000.\u000a\u000aAnd the bill would allow folks to contribute more to Health Savings Accounts, which are primarily used by better-off Americans who can afford to sock money away for health care expenses.\u000a\u000aAlso, the Republicans would enable people higher on the income scale to claim the tax credit to help pay their premiums. Under Obamacare, an enrollee who makes more than $47,500 is no longer eligible for a subsidy. The GOP plan would let a policyholder making up to $75,000 claim the full tax credit. The benefit would phase out slowly until the enrollee hits $215,000 in income.\u000a\u000aInsurance companies could get a big tax break\u000a\u000aObamacare allowed insurance companies to deduct only $500,000 of their executives' pay as a business expense. The GOP bill would repeal that limitation, starting in 2018.\u000a\u000aTop insurers pay their leaders millions in compensation every year so this provision could mean a nice tax savings for the companies.\u000a\u000aCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated that the bill would allow insurers to sell plans without Obamacare's required health benefits, such as maternity and prescription drugs.

aVIn the wake of the president's decision to repeal DACA, lawyers have issued a clear warning to companies: Don't count on Congress to act.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump moved this week to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to live, work and study in the country without fear of deportation. Trump's order gives Congress six months, or until March 5, 2018, to create a law protecting the roughly 800,000 people known as "Dreamers" who participate in the program.\u000a\u000aBut legal experts who counsel businesses on employment issues are telling their clients not to expect a legislative fix.\u000a\u000a"Employers really should brace themselves," said Shin-I Lowe, an attorney who specializes in corporate immigration law at the firm Littler Mendelson.\u000a\u000aIf Congress doesn't pass a bill to protect or extend DACA, program participants would have to be laid off as their work permits expire. Currently, DACA work permits need to be renewed every two years.\u000a\u000aA recent study by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, and FWD.us, an immigration reform advocacy group, found that an average of 30,000 people will be out of work each month if the five-year-old program is repealed.\u000a\u000aCompanies should be aware if there's a chance they'll need to let some of their talent go, Lowe said.\u000a\u000a"Employers should look at work permits they have today and encourage renewals," she said.\u000a\u000aRelated: Dreamers forced to rethink their careers: 'I have plans for myself that I really want to fulfill'\u000a\u000aLowe is prompting businesses to go through their I-9 forms, which workers fill out to show they're legally authorized to work in the United States, to see who might be able to renew their status before the deadline. Trump has given Dreamers whose DACA permits expire before March 5, 2018 one month (until October 5) to apply for a renewal, which would be good for another two years.\u000a\u000aSome employers may not know they have workers who are DACA recipients, since the paperwork looks similar for a number of different work visas, said Shanon Stevenson, a partner at Fisher Phillips who focuses on immigration law for businesses in the IT industry.\u000a\u000aBut there's a larger number of affected companies than some would expect.\u000a\u000a"Looking at our client base and the immigration matters we handle, we have at least one [DACA] employee at each company," Stevenson said.\u000a\u000aIn a declaration of support for a multistate lawsuit that aims to block DACA's repeal, Amazon said at least nine of its employees are Dreamers. In similar letters, Microsoft said it has at least 39 employees authorized to work through DACA and Starbucks said it has at least 84.\u000a\u000aRelated: Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks support lawsuit to block DACA repeal\u000a\u000aPhilip Berkowitz, a lawyer who advises multinational companies at Littler Mendelson, said he thinks there will be a lot of political pressure on Congress to act, and that companies shouldn't take any "drastic action" in the interim other than to keep an eye on renewals.\u000a\u000aBut he conceded that everyone is in "wait and see mode" at this point.\u000a\u000a"This has created a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety, certainly for the people who are eligible for DACA, the people who thought they'd be eligible for DACA and the businesses that employ these individuals," Berkowitz said.\u000a\u000aCompanies have the discretion to decide whether they want to provide DACA employees with legal support or counseling, according to Justin Storch, who works with federal immigration agencies on behalf of the Society for Human Resource Management's immigration affiliate, the Council for Global Immigration.\u000a\u000aStill, firms should be careful how they go about identifying those who may need help, he said.\u000a\u000a"That doesn't mean employers should be asking people whether they're on DACA, because that could be considered discriminatory," Storch said.\u000a\u000aHe recommends sending out a company-wide email instead.\u000a\u000a"I would advise employers to be realistic about this," Storch said. "Counting on Congress to acts isn't always going to be fruitful. Employers should know as of today, the DACA program will end in six months."

aVStory highlights Democratic senators are starting to say whether they back a Bernie Sanders bill\u000a\u000aThe proposal concerns one of several plans described as 'medicare for all'\u000a\u000a(CNN) Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race:\u000a\u000aNext week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will introduce his long-awaited single-payer health care bill with a cadre of the Democratic 2020 prospects expected to sign on as co-sponsors. Not long afterward, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, another potential 2020 candidate, will propose an alternative: Allowing individuals and businesses to buy into Medicare.\u000a\u000aBoth ideas have, at times, been labeled "Medicare for all." But their differences also offer a glimpse at what's likely to be a defining debate within the Democratic Party in its next nominating contest: A full shift to a government health insurance system versus a partial step away from private markets.\u000a\u000aIt's possible for some Democrats to support both ideas. Murphy, in an interview with Politico , portrayed his bill as a more politically practical bridge to Sanders' goal. "We're not going to pass a single-payer health care bill any time in the next few years. And so we need to have a conversation about how we get there," he said.\u000a\u000aKamala Harris was the Elizabeth Warren The intra-party debate will heat up when Sanders' bill drops in the coming days. California Sen.was the first to announce she'd co-sponsor it. Massachusetts Sen. said Thursday in a fundraising email that she'd co-sponsor Sanders' bill, too. She wrote: "Medicare for All is one way that we can give every single person in the country access to high quality health care. Everyone is covered. Nobody goes broke paying a medical bill. Families don't have to bear the costs of heartbreaking medical disasters on their own."\u000a\u000aRead More

Hide Caption 11 of 11\u000a\u000aWhen Lady Diana Spencer was born in 1961, there was little to suggest she would shake up the British establishment. She was the youngest of three daughters of the future Earl Spencer, scion of an aristocratic British family that had been prominent since the early 16th century.\u000a\u000aBut her life was scarred early by family instability.\u000a\u000aHer father, like many of his class, craved a son and an heir. The pressure he put on her mother, Frances, with constant visits to fertility specialists, probably contributed to their divorce a few years after she finally gave birth to a boy, Diana's younger brother Charles.\u000a\u000aDiana was known as a shy child. A rare pleasure was ballet, but at 5 feet 10 inches, she grew too tall to be a professional ballerina. Earl Spencer put little stock in women's education, so Diana left school at age 16 without qualifications. She shone, however, with children, and moved to London to work as a nursery assistant while waiting for a suitable marriage.\u000a\u000aYears later, as a princess, she would be loved for the ease with which she greeted children at the many charities she supported.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Diana's influence on the HIV/AIDS battle Replay More Videos ...

By the early 1980s, the Queen's son Charles was facing unbearable pressure to find a publicly acceptable bride: Diana was well-bred, seemingly pliable, and a virgin. No matter that at 19, she was 13 years Charles' junior, or that he seemed to still be involved with his old girlfriend, the married Camilla Parker Bowles.\u000a\u000aCharles' great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, echoed establishment values when he wrote to his great-nephew, "The man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 1981: Diana hounded by press after date with Charles Replay More Videos ...

Diana responded, "Yes, of course." Charles merely muttered, "Whatever love means." Diana later recalled that this moment "threw me completely, it traumatized me."\u000a\u000aWithin a year of his marriage, Charles had taken Camilla as royal mistress.

aVThe world is watching China to see how hard it will lean on North Korea's economy. But Beijing's efforts to squeeze another country nearby are already clearly hurting.\u000a\u000aSouth Korean businesses have been suffering since early this year after the country angered the Chinese government with the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system.\u000a\u000aThe victims include companies in tourism and retail, but also Hyundai (HYMTF), one of the world's biggest automakers. It said Wednesday it had been forced to halt production in China for a week.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and South Korea say the missile defense system is meant to guard against the threat from North Korea, but China sees itself as the real target.\u000a\u000aHere's where Beijing's unofficial sanctions are biting:\u000a\u000aRelated: What's left to sanction in North Korea?\u000a\u000aCars\u000a\u000aHyundai's sales in China, its biggest overseas market, have been hammered since the South Korean government said in March that it would deploy the defense system, known as THAAD.\u000a\u000aIn the second quarter, the automaker's China sales plunged 64% compared with a year earlier. Its business in the country is a joint venture with a Chinese carmaker, but that hasn't stopped state media from calling for consumers to boycott its products.\u000a\u000aThe collapse in revenue was one reason given by Hyundai for the decision to halt operations at its Chinese factories after a dispute with a major supplier over late payments.\u000a\u000aRelated: China's 'unofficial' sanctions rattle South Korea\u000a\u000aHyundai's sister brand Kia has also seen sales plunge in China.\u000a\u000aThe South Korean automakers' difficulties have consequences for China's economy, too: falling sales and lower production mean less work for Chinese employees.\u000a\u000aTourism\u000a\u000aThe number of Chinese tourists visiting South Korea has plummeted since Beijing unofficially told travel agencies in March to stop taking groups there.\u000a\u000aArrivals from China nearly halved in the first seven months of this year, dropping to 2.5 million from 4.7 million in the same period in 2016, according to the Korea Tourism Organization.\u000a\u000aRelated: China is crushing South Korea's tourism industry\u000a\u000aThat's a massive problem for hotels, duty free stores and other travel industry businesses.\u000a\u000aChinese visitors accounted for nearly half of the 17 million arrivals in South Korea last year, and spend more per head than any other nationality.\u000a\u000aRetail\u000a\u000aOne company in particular has taken a particularly heavy hit from China's backlash over THAAD.\u000a\u000aLotte Group, one of South Korea's giant family-run conglomerates, was asked by the government to provide the land for the missile defense system.\u000a\u000aLotte's duty free business in South Korea has suffered from the plunge in Chinese tourists. Dozens of its retail stores inside China have been closed down by officials. And a project to build a theme park in the country has stalled.\u000a\u000aThe company said sales at its supermarket business in China nosedived 95% in the second quarter.\u000a\u000aRelated: Lotte says don't blame us for THAAD missiles\u000a\u000aElectronics escapes\u000a\u000aBeijing isn't pushing South Korea as far as it could, however.\u000a\u000aIt has refrained from going after its smaller neighbor's huge electronics industry, most likely because the hit to its own economy would be too severe.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea supplies more than a quarter of the microchips that China buys, according to Rajiv Biswa, chief Asia Pacific economist at IHS Markit.\u000a\u000aRelated: South Korea suspends THAAD deployment\u000a\u000a"Despite the significant negative shock of Chinese economic measures on South Korea's tourism industry, the overall economic impact has been mitigated by surging South Korean electronics exports due to a strong global upturn in electronics demand," Biswas said.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's new president, Moon Jae-in, has sought to improve ties with Beijing. His early moves included freezing additional deployments of THAAD launchers pending an environmental review.\u000a\u000aBut China wants the system to be completely removed from South Korea, a measure that appears highly unlikely given the simmering tensions over North Korea.\u000a\u000a-- K.J.

aV(CNN) Surrounded by farmland and plantations in the small village of Teluk Kemang Sungai Lilin in South Sumatra, a boy, just 8 years old, sits smiling with his mother.\u000a\u000aBut this boy has a tumultuous past and a reputation that precedes him, having undergone a recovery most children will never face.\u000a\u000aSix years ago, Aldi Suganda, also known as Aldi Rizal, was a 2-year-old chain smoker addicted to cigarettes, smoking packs each day. "It was hard for me to stop," he said. "If I am not smoking, my mouth taste is sour and my head feel dizzy.\u000a\u000a"I am happy now. I feel more enthusiastic, and my body is feeling fresh," he said.\u000a\u000aHe became a global sensation as the "chain-smoking toddler," with video clips of him puffing excessively on an endless cigarette supply watched by millions around the world.\u000a\u000aHis mother, Diana, thinks back to that period and recoils at the memory. Her son would get angry, she remembers, and throw tantrums if she withheld cigarettes from him or failed to give him money to obtain them. "He (would) start to smash his head to the wall. He was crazy, hurting himself if he didn't get a cigarette," she said.\u000a\u000aPeople would accuse her of being a bad mother and regularly question her parenting skills, she said. "I am a weak mom. He always threaten me if I didn't give him money. ... I (was) afraid he (was) going to die."\u000a\u000aAldi is the youngest of three boys born to Diana and her husband, who requested not to be named. But he is far from the only child who picked up the habit across the islands of Indonesia: More than 267,000 children there are estimated to use tobacco products every day.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED What tobacco does to your health Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What tobacco does to your health 01:07\u000a\u000aA childhood habit\u000a\u000aDiana believes Aldi's addiction began with peer pressure and exposure to smokers. He accompanied her each morning to the market where she sells vegetables grown on their land. People there could have taught him to smoke, and he could easily get cigarettes by asking at the market, she said.\u000a\u000aIn many regions of the world, this might seem unrealistic and like an excuse, but in Indonesia, it's highly likely. The country has the highest percentage of male smokers globally and among the highest rate of adolescent and child smokers in the world -- fueled by lack of control over advertising, relaxed sales and low prices.\u000a\u000aToday, Aldi is a healthy young boy who attends school and gets good grades, but to get here, it took years of rehabilitation with the country's leading child psychologist, Dr. Seto Mulyadi, chairman of the nation's National Commission for Child Protection. His road also didn't end with his tobacco cravings. Soon after his recovery, he replaced tobacco with food and began to overeat as a means of compensation, eventually becoming obese.\u000a\u000aBut a second bout of rehabilitation to tackle this overeating created the healthy, stable young boy sitting beside his mother today.\u000a\u000aMulyadi believes the one benefit of working with children who have an addiction is their mental agility. In Aldi's case, his age and intelligence meant he responded quickly to his treatment, in which Mulyadi distracted the 8-year-old with running, climbing and playing while slowly reducing the number of cigarettes he smoked each day. But treatment was intense and required Aldi to go to Jakarta for a few months to be with Mulyadi every day.\u000a\u000aAldi Rizal at his home in Indonesia.\u000a\u000a"He was just 3 years old, and he smoked four packs a day," Mulyadi said. "(But) I was confident because he is still very young. Psychologically, as a child, he is very flexible and easier to be cured."\u000a\u000aAnd cured he is -- at least for now.\u000a\u000a"I don't want to smoke anymore. I don't want to get sick," said Aldi, who now wants to help prevent other children going through a similar ordeal. "Please don't smoke. Don't even try it. It's hard to quit."\u000a\u000aIn 2013, more than 57% of men were reported to be smokers in Indonesia and more than 42% of teens ages 13 to 15, according to the Tobacco Atlas , compared with 17% and 8.2%, respectively, in the United States. It's estimated that more than 217,000 people die from diseases linked to tobacco use each year in Indonesia, including heart disease and respiratory conditions such as emphysema and lung cancer.\u000a\u000aWith smoking so commonplace and numbers remaining steady or even rising among some groups in recent years, Aldi's message could go unheard, believes Dr. Lily Sulistyowati, director of prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases at Indonesia's Ministry of Health.\u000a\u000a"I'm very worried about smoking in Indonesia," she said, especially among teens ages 15 to 19.\u000a\u000aNo sign of decline\u000a\u000aWhile rates in most countries fell between 2013 and 2016, the rate of smokers under 18 in Indonesia rose from 7.2% to 8.8%. In a population of more than 261 million, that means millions of youth continue to smoke today.\u000a\u000aBut more worryingly, among 10- to 14-year-olds, more than 3% were smokers in both 2013 and 2016 -- the majority of them boys -- and more than 18% of boys and more than 9% of girls 10 to 14 had tried a cigarette, according to Indonesia Basic Health Research data reported in 2013.\u000a\u000aThe research also found that 1.5% of boys and 1.4% of girls 5 to 9 years old had tried a cigarette.\u000a\u000aSulistyowati believes the problem is worse in rural areas and among poorer populations. "Poor people are spending their money on cigarettes," she said.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the richest fifth of the population used 7.1% of their monthly expenditures on tobacco and betel leaf to wrap tobacco, while the poorest fifth spent 12.5%, according to Indonesia's Central Bureau of Statistics. The poorest fifth spent similar proportions of their wages on grains and tobacco -- 15.5% and 12.5%, respectively -- and spent six times more on tobacco than on dairy and egg products.\u000a\u000aRural regions also tend to be populated with people with lower incomes. There, parents' priorities are working and earning money for their families, which can leave children vulnerable to influences such as smoking while parents are distracted. "(These areas) are a different situation. Parents focus on how to work and get money, not on the health of their children," Sulistyowati said.\u000a\u000aIn addition, children begin working young to earn money that they can then spend on cigarettes, said Dr. Aman Pulungan, president of the Indonesian Pediatric Society, who has been monitoring and working on the issue of childhood smoking for decades. "It's country life," he said.\u000a\u000aSmoking among children and teens is still a problem in the cities, highlights Silistyowati, but there, people know that the habit is bad for their health and children instead hide their addiction from their parents, she said. "They try it with friends," she said.\u000a\u000aThis was the case for Icha, 16, in the capital, Jakarta, who began smoking when she was 13 after a friend offered a cigarette to smoke together. "The first time, I felt dizzy and coughed a lot," she said. "But later on I (felt) the taste is good."\u000a\u000aIcha, 16, began smoking when she was 13 after a friend offered a cigarette to smoke together.\u000a\u000aIcha now smokes at least one pack of 12 cigarettes each day and says half of her classmates also smoke, some in front of their parents. Her own parents tried to ban her from smoking but after little success now just ask that she try to reduce her habit.\u000a\u000a"There is no parental control," Pulungan said."They just do it, because no one says no."\u000a\u000aPulungan added that many parents don't fully understand the risks associated with smoking and that its prevalence among adults helps that ignorance persist, particularly in rural areas.\u000a\u000aPart of the problem, Sulistyowati and other experts say, is the ease of access and pervasiveness of smoking in Indonesian culture.\u000a\u000aMarketing and image invasion\u000a\u000a"The problem is big," Pulungan said, adding that smoking has been an issue in Indonesia for more than 40 years. "But it's getting worse."\u000a\u000aHe believes that in addition to peer influence, the root causes of the epidemic include advertising, lack of laws -- or enforcement -- in public spaces, sponsorship of venues by big tobacco companies and the way cigarettes are sold.\u000a\u000aNonsmoking sections in restaurants are very small, he said. In addition, tobacco companies are still sponsoring sporting and musical events as well as public buildings or clubs. This sponsorship has come down in recent years, he said, but he now believes that hidden advertising is growing -- through TV and culture. "(Kids) think if you want to become a man, you have to smoke," he said.\u000a\u000aThe issues of advertising and masculinity linked to smoking faced many other countries just a decade or two ago, but while rates across the West declined, companies and efforts to boost tobacco interest transferred to countries where bans and laws did not prohibit their existence, such as Indonesia, Pulungan believes.\u000a\u000aIn rural areas, "the small shops, grocery shops, are sponsored by cigarette companies, and they can put adverts anywhere," he said. "No one controls this." He also mentions sports clubs that have tobacco companies as part of their names.\u000a\u000a"Advertising is of more interest to the youth," Sulistyowati said, adding that companies entice adolescents by associating cigarettes with success and fame. "Schools can get sponsorship" from big companies, she said.\u000a\u000aA board advertises a cigarette brand along a road in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2011.\u000a\u000aAgain, while many countries have had bans against this for some time, Indonesia has no national laws in place -- though some municipalities have introduced them, she said, including Western Sumatra.\u000a\u000aOf the big six global tobacco companies, Phillip Morris International dominates the market in Indonesia, according to 2013 data from the Tobacco Atlas.\u000a\u000aSampoerna, an affiliate of PT Philip Morris Indonesia and part of Philip Morris International Inc., said in an email to CNN that it is "firmly opposed to youth smoking," and that it does not intentionally market products to anyone under the age of 18 years old. The statement said it "makes every effort" to not place cigarette advertisements within 100 meters of educational facilities. The statement also said, "given the large number of retail outlets across Indonesia, mistakes can occur, but we do our absolute best to ensure that we are only communicating with adult smokers."\u000a\u000aThe company further commented that it supports "fair and balanced regulation at both the national and provincial/municipality levels," but that "the lack of harmonized regulation across the country causes confusion and difficulty in compliance for industry participants." In 2013, Sampoerna introduced a program that uses educational activities and materials to raise awareness among retailers and the public about preventing cigarette sales to children.\u000a\u000aOn the government side, the Ministry of Health is now working with the Ministries of Education and Communication to help prohibit sponsorship and advertising, as well as the Ministry of Transport to implement and enforce existing smoking bans on public transport.\u000a\u000aAlmost half of the country's municipalities have regulations in place for smoke-free areas, said Sulistyowati, and universities have committed to having smoke-free campuses through the Ministry of Education. Graphic health warnings were also introduced on cigarette packets in 2014 to put people off the habit.\u000a\u000aBut "it all depends on the commitment of the local head, or mayor, of a district," Sulistyowati said. "Indonesia is a big country," at more than 1.9 million square kilometers (more than 740,000 square miles).\u000a\u000aEasy access and affordability\u000a\u000aThe final hurdle is the cost and ease with which people can buy cigarettes: They can be bought individually -- which makes them more affordable to people with lower incomes -- and a pack of 12 can cost as little as $1 at most vendors and kiosks, said Sulitsyowati.\u000a\u000aAll 34 provinces have had regulations in place since 2012 to prohibit the sale of individual cigarettes, but enforcement has not been that effective.\u000a\u000a"They buy one cigarette, not a pack usually ... and everywhere you go, you can buy one cigarette, so it's easy," Pulungan said. "Shops easily sell them."\u000a\u000aOne kiosk vendor in Jakarta, who did not provide his name, said most children buy individual cigarettes from him even though selling them in this form is breaking the law. "Everyone sells cigarettes to them," he said.\u000a\u000aGlobally, experts agree that one of the strongest tobacco-control policies has been taxation. The rising cost of the habit, linked to higher taxes, has meant that many can no longer afford to smoke, and those who can smoke provide revenue for anti-smoking campaigns and quitting support services, to name a few options.\u000a\u000a"The evidence suggests increasing pricing is the single most effective way to reduce demand," said Vaughan Rees, director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in a previous report by CNN\u000a\u000a"In states where we see the highest tax rates, we see the lowest prevalence," he said, highlighting New York City, where former Mayor Michael Bloomberg introduced city taxes on top of state taxes in 2010.\u000a\u000aA billboard for Sampoerna cigarettes rises above traffic in downtown Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2005.\u000a\u000aIn Indonesia, "the price of cigarettes is very cheap," Sulistyowati said. "Everyone can buy them."\u000a\u000aPushing for change\u000a\u000aNow, the Ministry of Health is working to align with other ministries as well as international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, to tackle the appeal of cigarettes once and for all. This includes aligning with the WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative and its strategy to reverse the global tobacco epidemic, known as MPOWER , which features six policies that have been proved to make an impact, such as protecting people from smoke, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aThe ministry also hopes to provide greater support for people trying to quit smoking and to increase public awareness about tobacco's harms -- as well as push harder for the country to join the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control , a global public health treaty formed in 2005 to tackle the global tobacco epidemic. Today, 181 states have signed the convention. Indonesia is not one of them.\u000a\u000aWith all this eventually in place, Aldi's message may finally reach those who need to hear it: young children facing the allure of smoking tobacco.\u000a\u000aThough cases like Aldi's seem very rare on the surface, there are similar ones in Indonesia that don't get serious attention, said Mulyadi, who treated Aldi.\u000a\u000a"Aldi was very lucky because in his case, we get a fast response from the government and public. ... Local and international media give him big attention," he said. "Other children are not that lucky."\u000a\u000aThe Indonesian government is not strict enough, he said. "As long as cigarette ads are spread out massively on TV, radio, newspapers, outdoor signage, everywhere, the problem of child smokers will get worse and worse."

aV(CNN) In their long and storied careers, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have never played against each other in the US Open.\u000a\u000aAnd it won't happen this year, either.\u000a\u000aJuan Martin del Potro, who stunned Federer in five sets in the 2009 US Open final for his only major title, took the rematch as well, winning 7-5, 3-6, 7-6(8), 6-4 Wednesday night at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing, New York.\u000a\u000aDel Potro, seeded 24th, reaches his first major semifinal since 2013 at Wimbledon. He will face No. 1 Nadal -- who keeps the top spot with Federer's loss -- next, while the other semifinal pits No. 12 seed Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain against No. 28 Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\u000a\u000a"I think I played my best match of the tournament," del Potro said in his on-court interview. "I did everything well. I served so good. I hit my forehand as hard as I can. I think we played a great match, and I deserved to win in the end."\u000a\u000aDel Potro and Federer.\u000a\u000aIt's the second time the Argentine, now 28, prevented a Nadal-Federer clash in New York. In 2009, del Potro defeated Nadal in straight sets in the semifinal en route to facing Federer in the final.\u000a\u000a"Hopefully I can repeat the result," del Potro said of his upcoming rematch with the 31-year-old Spaniard.\u000a\u000aFederer-Nadal US Open semifinal thwarted\u000a\u000aNadal did his part on Wednesday, dispatching 19-year-old Russian Andrey Rublev 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 in the afternoon quarterfinal. Prior to the start of del Potro's match, Nadal was asked about the possibility of playing him.\u000a\u000a"Juan Martin is a top player, no?" Nadal said. "It's true that when he's playing well, it's difficult to stop him. Probably the forehand is maybe the fastest on the tour. And of course to win tonight, he should be serving well. If he serves well and hit well his forehand, he's a player that have the chance to win against, of course, everybody.\u000a\u000a"If I play against him, of course I have to play my best tennis. I need to be very focused with my serve and play aggressive, because if you let him play from good positions with his forehand, you are dead, because he plays super-aggressive, hitting so hard."\u000a\u000aTo get to Nadal, No. 3 Federer, 36, had to get through del Potro first -- no easy task for the Swiss. The Argentine entered Wednesday 5-16 against Federer, but all of those wins were on hard courts, including coming back from a set and a break down to deny Federer a sixth consecutive US Open title in 2009.\u000a\u000aFederer last won the US Open in 2008.\u000a\u000aThat moment eight years ago has been the biggest grand slam highlight for del Potro, who has undergone four wrist surgeries in his career.\u000a\u000a"I cannot believe to play another semifinal after all my injuries, after all my surgeries," del Potro said. "Especially to play here in New York is great. It's my favorite tournament, my favorite city to play tennis."\u000a\u000aThe dream Federer-Nadal US Open matchup has almost happened a few times. In addition to 2009:\u000a\u000a2008: Nadal lost to Andy Murray in the semis, who lost to Federer in the final.\u000a\u000a2010: In the semifinal, Federer held two match points, but he still lost to Novak Djokovic. Djokovic went on to lose to Nadal in the final.\u000a\u000a2011: Federer once again had two match points against Djokovic in the semifinal, but the Serb came through again, this time beating Nadal in the final.\u000a\u000a2013: Federer bowed out in the fourth round to Tommy Robredo, who lost to eventual champion Nadal in the quarterfinals.\u000a\u000aDel Potro: "Happy every time I play here"\u000a\u000aIn his previous match, a five-set win against No. 6 Dominic Thiem, del Potro, who lost the first two sets, contemplated retiring during the match. Del Potro said was ailing, saying he couldn't breathe or move well. But when he won the third set to stay alive, the crowd came to life, and it was one of the most energetic crowds seen at the second-year Grandstand court.\u000a\u000aWednesday's match at Ashe had a different vibe.\u000a\u000aThe first set lacked flair, as both players held serve until it was 5-5. A Federer double fault in the next game opened the door slightly for del Potro to break, and he comfortably served out the set.\u000a\u000aIn second set, Federer broke for a 3-1 lead and closed it the way his fans have been accustomed to seeing over the years.\u000a\u000aAnother Federer double fault -- this time on break point -- gave del Potro the early break in the third set. Del Potro later donated it back with a double of his own. The set went to a tiebreak, and Federer jumped to a 3-0 lead, but del Potro seized control late, winning it 10-8 for a two-set lead and generating a roar from the crowd.\u000a\u000aThe fourth set shifted del Potro's way when a Federer overhead smash attempt went into the net, setting up break point to give del Potro a 3-2 lead. The fans at Ashe eventually grew quiet.\u000a\u000aOn match point, a forehand winner, del Potro lifted his arms into the air in triumph.\u000a\u000a"You make me feel happy every time I play here," del Potro said to the crowd. "I love your support, guys."

aV(CNN) There's just no stopping Briton Adam Peaty, who won the men's 50 meter breaststroke Wednesday to claim his second gold medal at the FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.\u000a\u000aAlready a winner over 100m earlier in the week, Peaty came home in 25.99 seconds -- 0.53sec ahead of his nearest rival -- and just 0.04sec short of the world record time he set in Tuesday's semifinals.\u000a\u000aBrazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver, while South Africa's Cameron van der Burgh claimed bronze.\u000a\u000a"I think I have to retire and give it a few years and come back when he's older," the 29-year-old Van der Burgh told reporters.\u000a\u000a"It's really impressive," added the South African swimmer. "It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between (butter)fly and breast."\u000a\u000aIt's a stroke that enabled the 22-year-old Briton on Tuesday to break the world record twice in a day, becoming the first person to go under 26 seconds as he clocked 25.95 secs to reach the final.\u000a\u000aPeaty celebrates winning the men's 50m breaststroke gold medal.\u000a\u000aOut on his own\u000a\u000aThe worry for Peaty's rivals is that the Briton just keeps getting better and better.\u000a\u000aHe made such waves at the Rio Olympics , that Michael Phelps -- the most decorated swimmer of all time -- was opened mouthed at his world record-breaking performance in the 100m breaststroke.\u000a\u000a"It's one of the grossest swims I've ever seen. I'm just glad I don't have to race him," said the American, the owner of 23 Olympic gold medals.\u000a\u000aPeaty has some way to go to match Phelps' achievements, but the Englishman has made no secret of his desire to be the Phelps of the breaststroke.\u000a\u000aIn the final of the 100 meters in Rio, Peaty won by 1.56 seconds in a race often decided by a fingertip. A mere second separated the remaining seven swimmers in the final.\u000a\u000aFive-time Olympian Mark Foster believes his fellow Briton is so good, he will remain a dominant force in the pool until he decides to hang up his swimming goggles.\u000a\u000a"As long as he stays fit and injury free, I can't see anyone touching him until he retires," Foster told CNN ahead of the FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. "He's that good.\u000a\u000aPeaty set a new world record in a heat of the men's 50m breaststroke Tuesday.\u000a\u000a'A bit of a freak'\u000a\u000aIt was during London 2012 that Peaty and his coach Mel Marshall, who by then had been teaching the swimmer for three years, devised a plan to ensure he would be the best in the world in four years' time.\u000a\u000aFor Foster, he argues the talent was always there but the hard work was the missing ingredient.\u000a\u000a"He's obviously physiologically gifted," adds the former world champion. "He's not a coordinated athlete necessarily, but breaststroke was just what he was born to do and he works incredibly hard at it."\u000a\u000aAt 1.91 meters and with a monstrous wing span, Peaty is the perfect shape for elite breaststroke.\u000a\u000aBut he stands out because of what he does underneath the surface.\u000a\u000aAt major championships, he has grown accustomed to rival coaches following his every stroke from pool side. His body becomes an almost inverted bend from shin and knee, which he calls "a hyperextension of sorts."\u000a\u000aHe jokingly describes himself as "a bit of a freak," but his performances are other worldly and no one has even got within 1.3 seconds of his best 100m time. No small feat in an event which lasts 57 seconds.\u000a\u000aPeaty celebrates winning gold and setting a new world record in the men's 100m breaststroke at Rio 2016.\u000a\u000a'Who works hardest wins'\u000a\u000aPeaty might not have broken his 100m breakstroke world record in Monday's final at the ongoing World Aquatics Championships, but he easily retained his title.\u000a\u000aIn comparing Peaty with Ed Moses -- the 400m hurdler who won 107 consecutive finals between 1987 and 1997 -- Foster prophetically told CNN before the championships: "He'll win and he'll be quick, and he'll continue to make this his event. It's a bit like Ed Moses, really."\u000a\u000aOLYMPIC CHAMPION pic.twitter.com/l4Kjyj0UbE \u2014 Adam Peaty (@adam_peaty) 8 August 2016\u000a\u000aPeaty does not lack confidence but it stops short of arrogance.\u000a\u000a"My coach wouldn't let me get arrogant nor my family -- Mel shoots me down every day," he explains.\u000a\u000aHe likes to downplay his achievements in the pool by saying "I'm no good at anything else," but Britain's first medalist of the Rio Games can also talk for Britain.\u000a\u000aIn the immediate aftermath of Rio -- Team GB's most successful ever Olympics with a total of 67 medals -- people would congregate outside Peaty's family home, hoping to get a glimpse of the world record holder. He has since moved out, having bought a home of his own.\u000a\u000a"The hardest thing was adjusting to what I'd done," he says of the post-Rio haze, in which he took two months off and embraced his penchant for eating burgers.\u000a\u000aBut despite having achieved the long-burning ambition of Olympic gold, he insists he is as motivated as ever.\u000a\u000a"It's who works the hardest that wins," he says, downplaying his natural talent and freakish leg kicks. "You see people fall off after a Games, but that won't be the case for me. I think I can do it again."

aV(CNN) House Republicans unleashed their fury over President Donald Trump's deal with the Democrats at Steve Mnuchin, with conservatives calling the treasury secretary's appeal to them to "vote for it for me" insulting and inappropriate.\u000a\u000aMnuchin, along with Trump's budget chief, Mick Mulvaney went up to Capitol Hill shortly before a vote on the package, which included money for hurricane aid, a continuing resolution to keep the government open and a three-month extension of the debt ceiling.\u000a\u000aMultiple House Republicans emerged infuriated and dissatisfied that they addressed their concerns that the deal wasn't the right strategy to get some of the spending reforms they've been pushing.\u000a\u000aIn the closed-door meeting, Mnuchin appeared to exacerbate the anger of House Republicans who opposed clean debt limit extensions, as the treasury secretary appealed to members to do this "for me," according to two members in the meeting.\u000a\u000aFlorida Republican Ted Yoho told reporters one House Republican told the treasury secretary directly "you know what, unfortunately you don't get voted in or voted out and you can't vote for me."\u000a\u000aMost rank-and-file House Republicans don't know Mnuchin and more than one said they believed he was a Democrat, based on his previous donations to political candidates.\u000a\u000aA source in the room described Mnuchin's performance as one where the treasury secretary clearly did not understand the long-simmering frustrations among conservatives when it came to raising the debt ceiling without spending cuts. Mnuchin further irritated conservatives when he left the meeting because of other commitments with roughly a dozen members still in line waiting for him to answer their questions.\u000a\u000aRep. David Brat added Mnuchin's arguments were "intellectually insulting." Brat said members asked Mnuchin and Mulvaney for reassurances that the GOP have a bigger fiscal plan and got nothing in return.\u000a\u000a"Crickets," the Virginia Republican said, adding that House Speaker Paul Ryan could say nothing to assure them that Trump wouldn't repeat a deal like this in the future.\u000a\u000aThe frustration with Mnuchin stretched over to the White House later Friday, as one official there called Munchin's pitch amateurish and a sign of his relative unfamiliarity with Washington.\u000a\u000aMnuchin's urging that Republicans vote for the bill "for me" was not part of the administration's planned pitch, the official said, adding it isn't being well received in some circles at the White House.\u000a\u000aThe treasury secretary was not the only one who faced some tough questions.\u000a\u000aOther House Republicans reminded Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina and a strident conservative who once railed against clean debt ceilings, of his past votes and statements opposing debt hikes. However, one GOP member said it was mostly teasing.\u000a\u000aRepublican Rep. Jeff Duncan said he personally asked White House officials in the room for a plan on how they are going to tackle the debt ceiling in December and he said they didn't have a good answer.\u000a\u000aAngering Duncan who said it was supposed to be different under Trump.\u000a\u000a"This ought to be a lot more fun than it is, I promise you," he said.\u000a\u000aRepublican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker, was outraged by Mnuchin's move to make it about himself, and when asked if that helped in getting votes, said that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's wrap-up at the end of the meeting was meant to stem the damage.\u000a\u000aWalker told reporters that "if any votes were gathered it was McCarthy doing a great job to bring it back together at the end of it because it got very loose with Mulvaney and Mnuchin."\u000a\u000a"It was very uncomfortable for them and they didn't really have any answers to the many of the questions and Mnuchin's closing statement like that, any progress that might have been gained -- to say 'vote for the debt ceiling for me' -- that that just didn't register well at all," Walker said.\u000a\u000aAccording to a source in the room, McCarthy worked to get House Republicans on the page, after many were critical and surprised by the administration's presentation.\u000a\u000aThe California Republican told members, "This isn't the worst day we've ever had, and we will come together."

aV(CNN) Callan Kott's parents knew that something was wrong with their child when the 3-year-old looked pale and suddenly stopped singing karaoke at a Christmas party in December 2015. The New Orleans boy was usually the "life of the party" who loved to dance.\u000a\u000aConcerned that the pneumonia he had experienced around Thanksgiving had returned, they took him to the ER for a chest X-ray. Dr. James Hanley at Ochsner Medical Center in Jefferson, Louisiana, ordered some tests. A little while later, he sat down with Ross and Lisa Kott to break the news: Their son had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer.\u000a\u000a"We had no clue that he was as sick as he was, really no warning at all," Lisa Kott said. "It just came out of nowhere, just days before Christmas."\u000a\u000aCallan started chemotherapy treatment immediately. He responded well to it, and the staff at Ochsner worked to make sure the Kott family would be able to go home by Christmas.\u000a\u000aAlthough Callan handled those rough few days well, he was also too young to understand why the nurses had to keep poking him with needles and taking blood samples. He would cry and get upset.\u000a\u000aDesperate to keep him calm, his parents tried to distract him with videos. Before the nurses walked in with more needles, Ross Kott pulled up the trailer for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."\u000a\u000a"When Ross showed him that preview, he composed himself," Lisa Kott said. "It was the oddest thing. And I think we probably watched it a hundred times after that."\u000a\u000aAlthough Ross loved the "Star Wars" films as a kid, he had never shown them to his son or even mentioned the series. He was amazed to see Callan connect so strongly with a two-minute trailer. The boy's favorite characters became Kylo Ren and the rolling droid BB-8.\u000a\u000aCallan poses in a Chewbacca jacket with a poster of his favorite character, Kylo Ren.\u000a\u000aOver those four days in the hospital, his parents kept showing Callan the trailer every time needles were involved.\u000a\u000a"Then, his love of 'Star Wars' took on a life of its own," Ross said.\u000a\u000aCallan fell in love with "Star Wars" Legos and the "Clone Wars" animated series. "The Force Awakens" is the only film in the saga he has watched; his parents have tried to show him the others, but he lets them know when it gets too scary to continue.\u000a\u000aWanting to be sure the Kotts felt like they were in the right place, the staff at Ochsner played along, calling him "Star Wars Callan." At first, when he would show up for treatment, the Kotts would make sure that his room was full of "Star Wars" decorations. Then, the nurses surprised them with their own decorations.\u000a\u000aEvery time the boy had one of his 18 or so spinal taps, they brought him a "Star Wars" balloon.\u000a\u000aCallan's treatment was like a roller coaster: bouts of intense chemo followed by lighter weeks, inpatient one week and outpatient the next. The hardest part for the very social kid was not being able to be in school, play with his friends or be around other family members due to his depleted immune system.\u000a\u000aBut during the ups and downs, he would "train" with his light saber in the hallway, wear the masks of his favorite "Star Wars" characters, sing the "Imperial March" and hold out his hands to "use the Force" in fighting his cancer. He told other patients that they could use the Force to help their cancer, too.\u000a\u000aCallan practicing with his lightsaber.\u000a\u000aWhen Callan had to shave his head, Ross Kott did it too, telling him it was part of training to become a Jedi. Callan also shares his love of Star Wars with his 2-year-old brother Ari. Photos on the family's Facebook page show the two brothers wearing BB-8 beanies and playing with lightsabers.\u000a\u000a"It's a great outlet, it's wonderful for a kid with such a serious diagnosis to relate to that level of imagination," Lisa Kott said. "It's almost like you need that to get through it. You can't get through something so severe without really making it lighthearted for them."\u000a\u000aCallan received a door that is covered with the poster from his favorite movie, "The Force Awakens."\u000a\u000aRoss said the "Star Wars" theme has been a great distraction, bringing everyone at the hospital together and boosting morale, including their own. Even though the couple has struggled with the diagnosis, they remain positive and upbeat around Callan and encourage his love of the sci-fi/fantasy series.\u000a\u000aCallan started to improve without setbacks in August, and his hair grew back a couple months later. He was also able to return to school and be around other people. Now, he's in remission and maintenance phase. His treatment and observation will last through 2019.\u000a\u000aCallan's story is helping inspire other children and families through the St. Baldrick's Foundation , a charity that funds childhood cancer research and hosts events that bring together families affected by childhood cancer.\u000a\u000aAbout one in 285 children in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer before age 20, according to the foundation , and acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type . According to the American Cancer Society, more than 90% of children diagnosed with the disease survive.\u000a\u000asurrounded by his favorite costumed characters at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans. Callan will spend Thursday, "Star Wars" Day , at a May the 4th Be With You eventsurrounded by his favorite costumed characters at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans.\u000a\u000aHe's still fighting cancer every day, even though he looks like a normal kid, Ross Kott said. If his temperature ever appears higher than normal, they may have to take him to the ER.\u000a\u000aThe family looks forward, rather than back. They're grateful to the community that has supported them in every way throughout these difficult two years.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Watching your child suffering when you're helpless is one of the worst things you can experience in life," Lisa Kott said.\u000a\u000a"I know that death is on the doorstop. I'm not going to let him in, and he's going to be waiting there for a very long time. The difference between us and any other family is that they don't see him at the doorstep. I see him, and in true Southern fashion, I will give him a glass of iced tea while he waits. Because we're still going to dance and have fun in the presence of all that. It's not going to be doom and gloom in our house."

aVKate Springer, CNN \u2022 Updated 1st September 2017\u000a\u000a(CNN) \u2014 Off the coast of Xiamen, in southeast China's Fujian province, Kulangsu (also known as Gulangyu) is not exactly your average Chinese village.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the tiny island, with just 4,000 households, is completely free of cars and bikes, aside from the occasional tourist trolley.\u000a\u000aThen there's the 19th-century European mansions, leafy seaside promenades, white-sandy beaches and a legacy of classical music.\u000a\u000aAnd as of July, China's "Piano Island" -- so named for its piano music and musical prodigies -- is also a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site , chosen in the committee's 41st session.\u000a\u000aFrom the world's largest piano museum to peaceful colonial mansions, knobby banyan trees and cobbled alleyways, Kulangsu offers a unique journey through China's past.\u000a\u000aThe car-free Kulangsu is packed with leafy streets and 19th-century colonial buildings.\u000a\u000aAn international affair\u000a\u000aWhy the colonial architecture? Xiamen was, and still is, an important port for Sino-European trade.\u000a\u000a"During the Qing Dynasty, Amoy (now known as Xiamen) was one of the first great trading harbors of China. Along with Shanghai, it was one of the first points of contact between East and West," Robin Goldstein, tourism spokesperson for Kulangsu Island , tells CNN Travel.\u000a\u000a"Because of its natural beauty and positioning right in Amoy's protected main harbor, Kulangsu became the ideal destination in Amoy to live and set up trading business and became the location for customs."\u000a\u000aThroughout the early 19th century, this romantic settlement drew merchants, missionaries and diplomatic representatives from many European countries, including the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese.\u000a\u000aBy the mid-1800s the 0.75-square-mile island was dotted with consulate buildings, schools, community centers and music studios.\u000a\u000aPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the elite neighborhood, it was "the richest square mile on earth" by the 1920s.\u000a\u000aWhile Kulangsu lacks the glamor of its heyday, the island still holds vestiges of its international past, visible in the island's 13 foreign consulates and more than 600 heritage buildings.\u000a\u000aWith the world's largest piano museum and a popular organ museum (pictured here), it's no exaggeration to call Kulangsu China's music capital.\u000a\u000aMusic Island\u000a\u000aThe island might be small, but it's home to many a big-name musician -- not to mention the highest per capita ownership of pianos in China.\u000a\u000a"Western classical instruments, including pianos, barely existed in China before the end of the mid-1800s when this contact between East and West began," explains Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Kulangsu, as the home of many diplomats and former officials, became a place where Westerners lived and worked and thus they brought many elements of their culture from Europe."\u000a\u000a"As a result, Kulangsu became the first places in all of China where Western classical music could be played and heard."\u000a\u000aA haven for the arts and sciences, the little island practically bred prodigies, among them pianist Xu Feiping and violinist Jing Yang.\u000a\u000aAmbling around the winding tree-lined alleyways, travelers will discover the remnants of centuries-old music schools and a well-known piano museum.\u000a\u000aThe largest in the world -- and the only one in China -- the Gulangyu Piano Museum (45 Huang Yan Road, Kulangsu) is hard to miss, thanks to an eye-catching facade that resembles piano keys.\u000a\u000aInside, more than 100 gleaming pianos -- including a gold-plated number and an antique hand piano -- provide insight into the island's musical heritage.\u000a\u000aKulangsu is blessed with a scenic coastline dotted with white sandy beaches.\u000a\u000aSandy stretches\u000a\u000aXiamen stays relatively warm all year round, with a mild winter and 80-degree summers.\u000a\u000aThe beaches of Kulangsu might not quite rival the Philippines, but they're relatively clean -- with white sand and swaying palm trees.\u000a\u000aThanks to a walking trail that circles the island, you can easily reach the less frequented stretches on the northern coast, facing the Xiamen west port and a series of islets.\u000a\u000a"I love the secluded beach by Zhao He Shan Park in Nei Cuo Ao Village, on the northern edge of Kulangsu," says Goldstein. "Guanhai beach is another pretty spot on the southwest corner of the island next to a beautiful former ferry port, Guanhai Harbor."\u000a\u000a"Kulangsu is one of the most popular places in China for couples to take wedding pictures, and every day you'll see the island -- especially Guanhai beach -- full of brides and grooms in full romantic regalia for their photo shoots."\u000a\u000aThe best views\u000a\u000aThe hilly island seems to be all cobbled alleys and pretty gardens -- that is, until you climb up the 302-foot-tall Sunlight Rock.\u000a\u000aThe golden mound is the highest point on the island, offering views of the island's red rooftops and of Xiamen across the strait.\u000a\u000a"Climbing to its summit, past Sunlight Rock temple, is great in the evening because the crowds are thinner, and you can watch the sunset and skyline of Xiamen begin to twinkle," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Sunsets are also beautiful from beaches all over the island, but my favorite spot of all for sunsets is a quiet spot perched atop the northeast corner of Kulangsu, the site of the old Yanwei Hill Time Cannon -- now a newly landscaped public park that's well off the beaten tourist track."\u000a\u000aGreat views and thinner crowds: Evening is the best time to climb up Sunlight Rock.\u000a\u000aFresh seafood\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to local cuisine, the tropical seaside surrounds may give you a hint as to what's for dinner.\u000a\u000a"The island's signature foods all revolve around fresh seafood, fresh local produce, and fresh fruit," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"Preparations are simple, healthy, and usually have a bit of a spicy kick. The island is famous for its oyster omelets, which are made with eggs, scallions, sweet potato flour and fresh local oysters, cooked on a flat cast-iron griddle into a perfect ring and served with bright red Xiamen hot sauce."\u000a\u000aGoldstein points to a personal favorite, Blessed Paradise (95 Quanzhou Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000a"It's run by a Kulangsu native who's also a wine expert and one of the island's most cosmopolitan restaurateurs," says Goldstein.\u000a\u000a"His kitchen turns out a terrific Kulangsu-style spicy mixed seafood grill of fresh whole fish, clams, squid, abalone, mushrooms, and local vegetables -- all of which come swimming in a deeply flavored chili sauce."\u000a\u000aElsewhere on the island, you can usually recognize the most authentic spots, thanks to a line out the door.\u000a\u000aAt Fu Lin Chun Canting (109 Longtou Rd, Kulangsu), for example, travelers will find a no-frills dining room and menus depicting an ocean of fresh seafood.\u000a\u000aHave it deep-fried, steamed with garlic and shallots, or grilled with a sprinkle of salt -- but if you don't speak Chinese we recommend coming prepared with some key phrases or pictures to which you can point.\u000a\u000aHeroic heights\u000a\u000aThe towering statue of Zheng Chenggong -- a 17th-century Ming general and cultural hero -- is impossible to miss.\u000a\u000aThis figure, part of a larger sculpture park, rests, like a beacon in a storm, atop of the island's southeastern point.\u000a\u000aElsewhere in the park, you'll find an ancient well, the grounds of the former emperor's palace, and a series of bronze, steel and stone statues.\u000a\u000aWith dramatic Chinese-style gardens and the piano museum, Shuzhuang Garden is worth a visit.\u000a\u000aA walk in the garden\u000a\u000aThe piano museum is one of several sights inside the larger Shuzhuang Garden.\u000a\u000aDating back to 1913, the green oasis was once a private estate. Now it's a seaside park, featuring dramatic Chinese-style pavilions, over-water walkways and colorful painted columns.\u000a\u000aA long walkway meanders toward the ocean, while on the hillside, Twelve Grotto Heaven provides an eccentric little maze of sandstone formations -- not to mention a few carved monkey sculptures.\u000a\u000aQuiet nights\u000a\u000aThe most peaceful time on Kulangsu is early morning and late evening, after the crowds have been ferried back to the mainland.\u000a\u000aYou can take advantage of the empty streets by staying overnight in a boutique hotel, such the Lee Inn & Coffee House (38-40 Zhangzhou Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000aBuilt in a 100-year-old colonial building, the quaint guesthouse offers 17 rooms and a pretty garden.\u000a\u000aFor a slightly larger address, Goldstein recommends the 26-room Yang Tao Hotel (13 Fuxing Rd, Kulangsu).\u000a\u000aTucked inside Fuxing Castle, the hotel showcases arched doorways and quiet terraces, as well as a popular restaurant and two garden bars.\u000a\u000aGetting there\u000a\u000aRegular ferries ply the seven-minute route between Kulangsu and Xiamen 24 hours a day.\u000a\u000aIn an effort to curb crowds and protect the island's heritage, Kulangsu has recently capped the number of tourist ferries per day.

aV(CNN) A German hackers' collective has warned that software used to record and transmit voting tallies in many German states has "serious flaws" and is vulnerable to external attack just weeks before voters cast their ballots in federal elections.\u000a\u000aHackers from the Chaos Computer Club published an analysis of the PC-Wahl software package Thursday in which they reported finding a "host of problems and security holes" that even a moderately skilled hacker -- let alone a state-sponsored team -- could exploit.\u000a\u000a"The analysis showed a number of security problems and multiple practicable attack scenarios. Some of these scenarios allow for the changing of vote totals across electoral district and state boundaries," a CCC statement said.\u000a\u000aThe software in question has been used in Germany's national, state and municipal elections for decades, it added.\u000a\u000aLinus Neumann, a CCC spokesman who was involved in the analysis, told CNN that "elementary principles" of IT security were ignored. "The amount of vulnerabilities and their severity exceeded our worst expectations," he said.\u000a\u000a"A whole chain of serious flaws, from the update server, via the software itself through to the election results to be exported allows for us to demonstrate three practical attack scenarios in one."\u000a\u000aGermans head to the polls on September 24 to vote in a federal election. Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for her fourth term in office and polls show her Christian Democratic Union Party, or CDU, as the clear front-runner. Her chief rival is Martin Schulz, leader of the Social Democratic Party, or SPD.\u000a\u000aThe election is being closely watched after a series of upset results in votes last year.\u000a\u000aVote-IT, which provides the PC-Wahl software, hasn't yet responded to CNN's request for comment, but the government cybersecurity agency said the company is implementing some recommendations on improving the package.\u000a\u000aSoftware 'possibly the worst'\u000a\u000aGermany, a European powerhouse and one of America's staunchest allies, does not use voting machines, meaning all votes are cast on paper.\u000a\u000aBut PC-Wahl is one of a half-dozen software packages used countrywide to tally, aggregate and transmit the votes higher up the chain, another CCC spokesman, Frank Rieger, told CNN.\u000a\u000a"From what we've seen, none of them is really great but the one that we analyzed is possibly the worst," he said of PC-Wahl. Hackers from CCC were able to take over a machine using the PC-Wahl software while vote tallying was taking place, he said.\u000a\u000aAdding to the problem, Rieger said, is that Germany's localized electoral system means that it's almost impossible to know what software is used across each polling station, municipality, precinct and state.\u000a\u000aAllegations of Russian interference in the US presidential election last year have stoked concerns in Germany over election security and voting technology, Rieger added.\u000a\u000aThe CCC undertook its analysis -- carried out by a group of three hackers because they had limited time -- after it was contacted by a newspaper looking to verify claims by a security researcher about problems with PC-Wahl, Rieger said.\u000a\u000aOver the course of eight weeks, the CCC group found a series of flaws, reported them to the authorities and the manufacturer, and then were able to hack the software again after attempted patches by its maker failed, he said.\u000a\u000aThe CCC has called on the government to "promote and use software in the election process that has publicly readable source code," so that security flaws can be found and resolved more quickly, and to support the development of new, state-of-the-art election software.\u000a\u000aGovernment working on security\u000a\u000aGermany's cybersecurity agency, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), said Thursday that the maker of PC-Wahl was working with the authorities to improve security.\u000a\u000a"In close cooperation with the responsible federal and regional election managers and the PC-Wahl software producer, the BSI has issued recommendations for improving the security level in the transmission of preliminary election results with the software mentioned," it said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe manufacturer is putting the BSI's recommendations in place, the agency said.\u000a\u000aThe BSI has been carrying out its own tests to uncover potential weaknesses in election processes and has been advising the German Parliament and parties on cybersecurity, it added.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for the BSI told CNN that the affected software evaluates only a preliminary election result.\u000a\u000aThe official election results can always be double-checked since the election offices have them on paper, he said.\u000a\u000aThe BSI will do whatever is necessary to prevent any manipulation of preliminary results and the discussion and insecurity this could cause, he added.\u000a\u000aThe agency has been in contact with the software producer since the beginning of the year to work on securing the preliminary election result process, he said, including by talking to the heads of election offices.

aVCNN columnist John D. Sutter is spending the rest of the year reporting on a tiny number -- 2 degrees -- that may have a huge effect on the future of the planet. He'd like your help. Subscribe to the "2 degrees" newsletter or follow him on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . You can shape his coverage.\u000a\u000aSix degrees Celsius of warming may not sound like much -- probably because "temperatures can swing by 6 degrees within an hour if a warm front passes, and it doesn't mean the end of the world," said Mark Lynas, author of a book called "Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet."\u000a\u000aBut if we raise global average surface temperatures by just 6 degrees above pre-industrial levels, Lynas told me, we'll create "a scenario which is so extreme it's almost unimaginable."\u000a\u000a"Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable," he said. "Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and sub-polar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. It's difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. There's a certain level above which plants just can't survive.\u000a\u000a"There's a certain level where humans biologically can't survive outside as well ... The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen-deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well -- which would then release gases and affect land. So it's pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts."\u000a\u000aI chatted with Lynas, a science writer in the UK, about how to avoid a 6-degree world, the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees -- and how to talk to kids about climate change.\u000a\u000aThe following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\u000a\u000aMark Lynas\u000a\u000aSutter: I've gotten a lot of questions from readers about what 2 degrees of warming means. What does it mean for sea levels? What does it mean for hurricanes? Extinctions? Those sorts of things. Could I run through a couple of those and get your take on it, as someone who's read through just mountains of this research?\u000a\u000aLynas: Sure, sure. I'll do my best.\u000a\u000aSutter: OK. Could we start with extinctions? What will we see around the 2-degree mark?\u000a\u000aIn the marine environment, I think the most threatened ecosystems are coral reefs. (They're) threatened both by coral bleaching, due to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, plus the general degradation of everyday, general human activity. It's very tough to imagine that the world's coral reefs will continue to exist in their present day form in a 2-degree warmer world.\u000a\u000aThe other most-threatened environments probably are the mountain ecosystems -- where species will be left marooned in shrinking islands of habitat. As temperature rises, you can imagine biomes rising up the sides of the mountains, and species which are dependent on a certain level of temperature and humidity will get left with nowhere to go.\u000a\u000aSutter: What about hurricanes and severe weather?\u000a\u000aThere's really a lot of uncertainty about this. It's possible to imagine hurricanes will become less frequent but more intense, and possibly (form) over new areas.\u000a\u000aSutter: What about droughts? I get a lot of California questions.\u000a\u000aLynas: The overall global picture is kind of, 'unto them that have with be given more and unto them have not shall be taken away' -- if you want to get biblical. That maps out as the subtropics, which are already the drier parts of the globe, will become more water-deficient. The deep tropics will actually get more rainfall, as well as some of the mid-latitudes. But the subtropics -- which is the southwest of the U.S. -- would expect to see less rainfall, which indeed seems to be what's happening. That does call into question, really, the development model that large areas of the southwestern U.S. have adopted -- expecting a large amount of freshwater to be available to urban areas and agriculture, which are already in a pretty arid location.\u000a\u000aSo I do think it's going to be hard to adapt to that change.\u000a\u000aSutter: I've also gotten questions about the low-lying Pacific Island nations. At 2 degrees, what is their fate?\u000a\u000aLynas: I used to be adviser to president of the Maldives, who is, by the way, now in jail due to there having been a coup. But his challenge, and his main agenda, when he was president, was to bring to attention the fate of the small island states -- especially those that are coral atolls. For the Maldives, the entire country exists at a meter or less above sea level, and little more. It's difficult to imagine the survival of coral atoll nations at 2 degrees, it has to be said. Although the extinction process depends on the rate of sea level rise. It might take decades, it might take centuries, it's not clear at the moment. But I don't think they have a very long term future.\u000a\u000aSutter: Moving up the degree ladder, you describe a 6-degree world as a "sixth circle of hell." What do you mean by that -- and can you describe some of what we know about that world?\u000a\u000aLynas: It's a scenario which is so extreme it's almost unimaginable. Not many studies have addressed this because it's so far off the scale of what can be envisaged. I found myself looking back at the really serious traumatic events in the Earth's geological history, which have led to mass extinctions, such as the one at the end of the Permian period, 250 million years ago, which wiped out nearly 90% of life on Earth. Actually, a lot of the mass extinctions seem to have been associated with very rapid global warming events. Humans are releasing carbon more rapidly even than took place during mass extinctions. We haven't gotten there in terms of the overall amount, but we're certainly moving in that direction. So it's not a planet that I think any of us would want to live in, and it doesn't have to happen. While I think it's important to try to visualize what a 6-degree world would look like, it's also important to remember that we don't have to go there.\u000a\u000aSutter: What else do we know about a 6-degree world?\u000a\u000aLynas: Most of the planetary surface would be functionally uninhabitable. Agriculture would cease to exist everywhere, apart for the polar and subpolar regions, and perhaps the mid-latitudes for extremely heat-tolerant crops. It's difficult to see how crops could be grown elsewhere. There's a certain level above which plants just can't survive. There's a certain level where humans biologically can't survive outside, as well. We get close enough already in the Arabian Peninsula and some other parts of the world. Remember, 6 degrees is a global average. It would be probably twice that over land and somewhat less than that over the oceans. The oceans would probably stratify, so the oceans would become oxygen deficient, which would cause a mass extinction and a die off in the oceans, as well -- which would then release gases and affect land. So it's pretty much equivalent of a meteorite striking the planet, in terms of the overall impacts.\u000a\u000aSutter: I'm wondering why you took this approach -- looking at climate change by degrees?\u000a\u000aLynas: A lot of people want to know what warming we get with what emissions path, or what warming we might get by what date. That's pretty fundamentally uncertain because they depend on different factors which aren't very well quantified. I felt that looking at it degree by degree was much more robust. If the temperature rises by X amount then what will be Y impacts? There are three major sources of information about that. One is the observational changes we're already seeing in terms of impacts in temperature rise. The second is computer models showing different ecosystem changes or whatever. And the third is paleoclimate sources -- so looking at how the climate was different in earlier hotter periods in geologic time. So piecing those together and mapping them onto a degree by degree picture seemed to me to be a way to try to convey this in a visual and intuitive -- but also highly scientifically appropriate -- way.\u000a\u000aSutter: What do you think about the world's focus on the 2-degree mark? One activist said to me that 2 degrees is the only thing the international community agrees upon for climate change.\u000a\u000aLynas: I think it's important to have a target -- because it focuses policy and it focuses people's efforts. And it makes sense also to have a target based on the temperature. But it's not something we can meet, by definition. We don't have a simple thermostat where we can decide exactly how much carbon to emit and have an exact temperature result dependent on that. So, there's uncertainty, really, about what level of emissions will lead to what temperature outcomes, by when. However, I think that 2 degrees is really the absolute upper limit of what's tolerable in terms of ecosystems and, probably, adaptive capacities of human societies. A 2-degree world is a world without coral reefs, and with much less snow and ice and with fairly dramatic heatwaves -- and other impacts. So, I would like to see a global warming future in which warming actually is lower than that, personally.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you think that's possible?\u000a\u000aLynas: I think it's possible. It's not very likely. If our current understanding of climate sensitivity is broadly correct then we're probably going to come in between 2 and 3 degrees, somewhere, by the end of the century. I guess the good news is the absolutely calamitous 5 and 6 degree outcomes are particularly unlikely, too, although still possible. And certainly, the risk of them happening is higher than the risk of an airplane crashing when we get onto it.\u000a\u000aSutter: Wait, so you're saying the risk of 5 or 6 degrees of warming -- a doomsday scenario -- is higher than an airplane crashing?\u000a\u000aLynas: Well, the likelihood of an airplane crashing is, I don't know, one in 1 million -- or something on that order of magnitude. Whereas the likelihood of coming within 5 or 6 degrees of warming is probably more than 1 in 100. It's the sort of risk that one would not tolerate at a personal level. But, perhaps because we can diffuse responsibility, we feel that it's tolerable for our species to take that gamble with the whole planet. Maybe it's because we just think there's nothing we can do about it. And we have an in-built optimism bias, myself included, where we like to think that things will just turn out all right, because they often tend to. And meantime we'll go on with our lives as normal. It's a big ask, I guess, to make society as a whole forgo the main energy source we all enjoy, which is fossil fuels, in order to forestall uncertain impacts decades into the future.\u000a\u000aSutter: One of the things that struck me from your book is that you were surprised people are depressed by climate change. Isn't this a pretty depressing subject?\u000a\u000aIt doesn't really matter whether you find it depressing or not, it's the scientific reality. We have to deal with it. A thing like climate change is known as a 'wicked problem.' It's seen differently by different people, according to their psychological, political and cultural biases. You can frame it as just a technology challenge: Let's get off of fossil fuels and let's get onto renewables and nuclear -- easy. Or you can frame it as a moral challenge: We're trespassing on the rights of future generations and how dare we do that. Or you can see it as a political challenge -- that somehow these big fossil fuel corporations are transgressing democracy and forcing us to stay hooked on oil and coal and gas. Different people, according to their politics, will see climate change fundamentally in this way. It's not a simple problem to understand.\u000a\u000aSutter: So how do you look at it? Do you ever find climate change overwhelming or depressing, personally?\u000a\u000aWell, I'm a pragmatist. I think it's a solvable problem. I don't think we need to abandon capitalism or change our entire political system in order to tackle this challenge. Other people do, and I disagree with them on that. And we have debates late into the night. But I think with next-generation nuclear technologies, and particularly with the way solar power is developing so rapidly, and how rapidly it's coming down in cost, and how quickly the technology is improving, there are zero-carbon options now becoming much more widely available, which will bring down our emissions much more rapidly than people think -- or than people thought just a few years ago. I don't think there's any point being pessimistic about that. Pessimistic people don't achieve anything. It's important to do what's possible -- and to do it quickly.\u000a\u000aSutter: What do you make of the way the world's responding?\u000a\u000aLynas: We are now inhabiting a human-dominated planet. We are in a new epoch known as the Anthropocene. The Holocene is now considered to be over. And I don't think there's really been another species that has had that effect on the planet before -- maybe the first bacteria that emitted oxygen, or photosynthesizing microorganisms. But we really are into terra incognita looking forward. That gives our species a serious level of responsibility for planetary management that people just don't really appreciate at any kind of fundamental physiological or political level. We are in charge. It's up to us. We actually do have an overall effect on the earth's temp. It's not up to Mother Nature anymore to run the show.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you have children?\u000a\u000aLynas: Yeah. The reason I was distracted just a minute ago was my kids just came back from school.\u000a\u000aSutter: Do you talk to them about this? What do you say?\u000a\u000aLynas: I talk to them a bit. They know what I do. Younger generations have grown up with this specter. It's a bit like how those of us who are older grew up with the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation ... So they're not entirely in a different situation, I suppose, from previous generations. You could feel bad for future generations, but on the other hand I'm not sure their future is any worse than the future for somebody born in, say, 1900, who in all likelihood, in Europe, would have killed in one of the world wars. It's a manageable problem. We're beginning to get the grips of it. There are some positive signs already -- China and the U.S. agreeing to peak emissions, and things like that. So it's not a counsel of despair. And I think it's important to talk to kids at that level -- not to make them think that somehow they're fundamentally doomed.\u000a\u000aThat isn't the case and doesn't have to be the case.\u000a\u000aSutter: What needs to happen to ensure things do improve? What are the benchmarks you're looking to to say, 'OK, we're managing this problem. We're doing what's needed'?\u000a\u000aLynas: Well, I'm a Well, I'm a ecomodernist , which is a new label a lot of environmental thinkers are beginning to attach to themselves -- because it's a bit different from more traditional environmentalism, which thought we were somehow doomed or we were fundamentally a destructive species. We can turn this around -- this and other problems as well, if we have a more pragmatic approach to politics, economist -- and especially technology. We need to have a price on carbon, so that emitting carbon dioxide isn't cheaper than other energy sources. We need to invest heavily in research and development in zero-carbon sources, including next-generation nuclear renewable energies, especially solar. And we need to deploy them on an ever wider scale, with increased financing. We also need to have a political agreement -- so there's a sense the whole world is moving in the right direction. All of those things are not just possible, but I think they're fundamentally achievable, and likely. But we need to keep the pressure up on politicians and on everyone else.\u000a\u000aEmail questions to: climate [at] cnn.com.\u000a\u000aFollow the project on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram

We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way. You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience."\u000a\u000aZuckerberg's frank admission of his wife's three miscarriages led to a vast outpouring of stories from women and families who have faced a similar situation.\u000a\u000aMillennials have become accustomed to posting their lives online, and yet, as they are coupling and starting families they are discovering that few experiences are as isolating as losing a desired pregnancy.\u000a\u000aEugene Declercq\u000a\u000aJodi F.

aV(CNN) China may be home to both the longest and highest bridges in the world, but neither is as pioneering as the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.\u000a\u000aBuilt during China's tumultuous Cultural Revolution, the double-decked bridge was considered groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 1968. But more importantly to some, it was also the first modern bridge to be designed and built by China without help from foreign architects.\u000a\u000aAs major repairs get underway ahead of next year's 50th anniversary, the bridge remains a source of pride in Nanjing, China's former capital. A project commissioned by railway officials hopes to secure the bridge's legacy by documenting its history, according to the initiative's head Lu Andong, a professor at Nanjing University's School of Architecture and Urban Planning.\u000a\u000a"The bridge was so important, and it's undoubtedly a symbol of the city," he said. "It is being repaired for transportation and safety purposes, but I would relish the chance to transform the bridge's tower and the affiliated park into places of memory."\u000a\u000aMade in China\u000a\u000aChina had initially hoped to build Nanjing's bridge with its communist allies, the USSR. Having already helped construct a crossing at Wuhan (about 280 miles up the river), the Soviets once again offered technical assistance. But soon after construction began in 1960, relations between the two nations soured.\u000a\u000aWang Shiqing is pictured with railway tickets featuring illustrations of the bridge, part of his vast collection.\u000a\u000aSoviet experts withdrew from the project ahead of the Sino-Soviet split -- the breakdown of relations between the world's largest communist powers from 1960. The bridge was nonetheless completed eight years later. China considered the accomplishment to be a major feat of engineering -- and a propaganda victory.\u000a\u000aAt over 5,000 feet long, the bridge carries both cars and trains. Its upper deck is a four-lane highway with sidewalks, while the railway tracks are now part of the Beijing-Shanghai train route.\u000a\u000a"Everybody loves the bridge," said Wang Shiqing, a longtime Nanjing resident who has collected over 1,000 pieces of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge memorabilia. "It's a source of pride, especially for local Nanjing people," he says.\u000a\u000aNew beginnings\u000a\u000aAs with other notable bridges -- like San Francisco's Golden Gate -- the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge has become a popular suicide spot. However, for Nanjing's residents, it is best known for transforming life in the city.\u000a\u000aBefore the bridge was built, people and goods could only cross the river by ferry. Trains passing through the city would have to be disassembled and loaded onto boats in order to continue their journey.\u000a\u000aUpon its completion, the bridge changed the lives of the city's residents."In terms of the function, it made people's lives so much easier," said Wang, who was born the same year the bridge was opened. "It reduced the river crossing time and served as the main artery for north-south transportation."\u000a\u000aPhotos: The most spectacular bridges in the world Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge (Switzerland) \u2013 Measuring 1621 feet long, the newly opened Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge is the world's longest pedestrian suspension bridge, according to Zermatt Tourism.

Critics worry the new bridge, which is not yet under construction, will destroy Pimlico Gardens, one of few public green spaces in the area. Hide Caption 12 of 12\u000a\u000aThe bridge united visual expressions of technology and progress, according to Lu.\u000a\u000a"It is not just infrastructure but a piece of architecture," he said. "The bridge's form expressed speed, penetration and force-flow -- similar to what was seen in Italian futurism. The form of the bridge intends to express an inner flow of forces, as if the structure is merely a pipe of energy."\u000a\u000aBut on the ground, the spatial composition of the bridge's towers resorted to traditional architectural language: central access, a processional route and a podium.\u000a\u000a"This design became a canonical case of Chinese modern architecture and was extremely important. This formula had enduring impact."\u000a\u000aA 'pop icon of modernity'\u000a\u000aAs well as sculptures of peasants, workers and soldiers, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge also features Mao Zedong quotes and a 230-foot statue of the former leader.\u000a\u000a"The red flags and magnolia decorations are very Chinese," Wang said, referring to the three flag-shaped sculptures found at the top of the bridge's towers.\u000a\u000aThis particular design reflects the "Three Red Banners" -- a major propaganda campaign during the Cultural Revolution. The "banners" represented ideologies that called for the construction of a socialist state in China.\u000a\u000aThis poster was designed by the Nanjing Great Bridge Workers Creative Group and the Revolutionary Publishing Group of the Shanghai Publication System.\u000a\u000aThe bridge often appeared in propaganda posters, which were keen to imply that the structure represented a "great victory of Mao Zedong Thought" (the political theory known outside China as "Maoism"). One such poster featured a quote from Mao: "Chinese people have drive and strength -- we have to reach and overtake levels of advancement across the world."\u000a\u000aErected during a turbulent time in China's history, the bridge had far-reaching cultural impact, according to Lu.\u000a\u000a"This bridge is one of the most recognized achievements of the Cultural Revolution era," he said. "It is both a political monument and a symbol of technological and historical success. Its image appeared on cups, pencils, shoes, mirrors, cigarettes and bicycles nationwide -- the bridge became a pop icon of modernity."\u000a\u000aThe legacy of the bridge also lives on through the people who were named after it. According to Wang, many people in Nanjing named their firstborns Chang Jiang (Chinese for "Yangtze") and their second Da Qiao (which means "big bridge").\u000a\u000aRestoring former glories\u000a\u000aIn April 2016 the National Development and Reform Commission, China's state planning body, approved a 27-month program of repairs to the bridge. According to a government report, "safety and durability risks" were key factors in the decision.\u000a\u000aBut the structure will be getting a facelift too. A $160.7 million (RMB 1.09 billion) investment will be used to restore some of the iconic statues, including those found on nearby river banks. Sculptures on the bridge will be reinforced, with handrails and piers also undergoing renovations.\u000a\u000aWith younger generations less aware of the bridge's historical significance, Lu hopes that the renovations will restore not only the bridge, but the city's interest in it.\u000a\u000a"The older generation obviously takes more pride in the bridge," he said. "It is very important to re-access the memory of the bridge in a creative way, to allow people of all ages to experience and understand the memories of it.

aVGeneration X has a gripe with pulse takers, zeitgeist keepers and population counters. We keep squeezing them out of the frame.\u000a\u000aThis overlooked generation currently ranges in age from 34 to 49, which may be one reason they\u2019re so often missing from stories about demographic, social and political change. They\u2019re smack in the middle innings of life, which tend to be short on drama and scant of theme.\u000a\u000aBut there are other explanations that have nothing to do with their stage of the life cycle.\u000a\u000aGen Xers are bookended by two much larger generations \u2013 the Baby Boomers ahead and the Millennials behind \u2013 that are strikingly different from one another. And in most of the ways we take stock of generations \u2013 their racial and ethnic makeup; their political, social and religious values; their economic and educational circumstances; their technology usage \u2013 Gen Xers are a low-slung, straight-line bridge between two noisy behemoths.\u000a\u000aThe charts below tell the tale.\u000a\u000aTo be fair, there are a few metrics that don\u2019t fit this straightforward pattern of generational evolution. For example, over the course of their voting lives, older Gen Xers have tended to be more Republican than both older Boomers and younger Millennials. Also, Xers are more pessimistic than both of those larger generations that they\u2019ll have enough money for their retirement \u2013 though some of that negativity is doubtless tied to the economic stresses of middle age.\u000a\u000aGen Xers also stand out in another way. In 2010 when Pew Research asked adults of all ages if they thought their own generation was unique, about six-in-ten Boomers and Millennials said yes. But only about half of Gen Xers said the same. And even among those who did, there was very little consensus about why they are distinctive.\u000a\u000aOne reason Xers have trouble defining their own generational persona could be that they\u2019ve rarely been doted on by the media. By contrast, Baby Boomers have been a source of media fascination from the get-go (witness their name). And Millennials, the \u201ceverybody-gets-a-trophy\u201d generation, have been the subject of endless stories about their racial diversity, their political and social liberalism, their voracious technology use, and their grim economic circumstances.\u000a\u000aGen Xers have also gotten the short end of basic generational arithmetic. Due partly to their parents\u2019 relatively low fertility rates, there are fewer of them (65 million) than Boomers (77 million) or Millennials (an estimated 83 million assuming a roughly 20-year age span and including those who have yet to reach adulthood).\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s another reason that Xers are a small generation: They\u2019ve been deemed to span just 16 years, while most generations are credited with lasting for about 20 years. How come? No one really knows. Generational boundaries are fuzzy, arbitrary and culture-driven. Once fixed by the mysterious forces of the zeitgeist, they tend to firm up over time.\u000a\u000aOne final slight: Even their name is a retread. World War II photographer Robert Capa first coined the term Generation X in a photo essay about the young adults of the 1950s, but the label didn\u2019t stick the first time around. It was revived thirty years later by Canadian author Douglas Coupland, whose coming of age novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, was set in Southern California.\u000a\u000aFor Xers, there\u2019s one silver lining in all this. From everything we know about them, they\u2019re savvy, skeptical and self-reliant; they\u2019re not into preening or pampering, and they just might not give much of a hoot what others think of them. Or whether others think of them at all.\u000a\u000aPaul Taylor, executive vice president for special projects at the Pew Research Center, is the author of The Next America: Boomers, Millennials and the Looming Generational Showdown (Public Affairs, 2014). In other words, he\u2019s part of the problem.\u000a\u000aTopics: Demographics, Political Attitudes and Values, Generations and Age

aVSydney, Australia (CNN) When Kate Sommerville visited a pub in Melbourne, Australia, to research a report on the socioeconomic impact of five new slot machines in the area, she never thought she would become an addict herself.\u000a\u000a"I was almost instantaneously hooked," the 69-year-old confessed. "I was fascinated by the sensory stimulation: glittering lights, music, spinning of wheels. Everything about the machine is designed to draw you in."\u000a\u000aWithin months of starting to gamble in 2001, Sommerville, then a local government worker specializing in community support and health policies in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, was spending her entire salary on slot machines, known as pokies in Australia. She sold her car, remortgaged her flat and borrowed money at 40% interest.\u000a\u000aUnable to concentrate, she eventually lost her job, and her seven-year relationship broke down soon after.\u000a\u000a"The obsession overrules all your normal desires to look after yourself: You neglect diet; you can't sleep," recalled Sommerville. "I found myself in hotels gambling at two or three in the morning, sometimes all night."\u000a\u000aAt her age and with her extensive professional background, that was deeply shocking to her. She admitted, "I felt traumatized but couldn't stop."\u000a\u000aKate Sommerville, 69, became addicted to slot machines.\u000a\u000aAfter six years of being enslaved to a severe gambling habit, Sommerville sought help and stopped in 2007. Prior to her gambling addiction, Sommerville suffered from restless leg syndrome, and studies have shown that the medication prescribed for this, a dopamine agonist, can cause compulsive behavior in up to 20% of people who take them.\u000a\u000aBut Sommerville is adamant that her story "can happen to anyone," particularly in Australia.\u000a\u000aA national problem\u000a\u000aAustralians are the world's most prolific gamblers, based on per capita spending.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, Australians lost more money per person -- an average of US $990 -- than any other developed country, according to research by consultancy H2 Gambling Capital. In comparison, runner-up Singapore lost $650 per person, and Ireland, which came third, $500.\u000a\u000aOne disadvantaged working-class Sydney suburb, Fairfield, gambled away more than AUS $8 billion from 2015-16 -- or just under $40,000 per resident.\u000a\u000a, according to the latest edition of the Total gambling expenditure in Australia increased by 7.7% from $21.114 billion in 2013-14 to $22.734 billion in 2014-15according to the latest edition of the Australian Gambling Statistics, published last year. Meanwhile, per adult gambling expenditure increased from $1,171.09 to $1,241.86.\u000a\u000aThe most prevalent forms of gambling are lottery-type games (such as Powerball or Oz Lotto), with 30% reported use, but poker machines come second, with 8% of adults reporting they use pokies in a typical month, according to the 2017 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey.\u000a\u000aDriving this national addiction are the country's 196,000 electronic poker machines . With the exception of Western Australia, pokies are allowed not just in casinos but in pubs and social clubs, where they are plentiful.\u000a\u000aSlot machines, or pokies, are a common sight in Australian pubs and social clubs.\u000a\u000aIn Australia, "we have pokie machines on almost every street corner," said Charles Livingstone, a senior lecturer in the School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine at Melbourne's Monash University.\u000a\u000aPokies are "really good at getting people hooked: Each (bet) provides a dopamine release, similar to a drug like cocaine, in your brain," explains Livingstone. "They target people who are often under stress, offer a euphoric sensation, then take all their money off them."\u000a\u000aClubs NSW, a representative body for registered clubs in the state of New South Wales in Australia, declined to comment.\u000a\u000aEasy access\u000a\u000aLivingstone estimates that one-third of the people who play pokies once a week will develop a gambling problem.\u000a\u000aRelaxed rules means gamblers in New South Wales can insert a maximum of AUS $7,500 -- about US $5,900 US -- into machines in a single sitting, he said.\u000a\u000aWhile gambling on sports tends to be male-dominated and seen as a traditionally masculine activity, playing the pokies has more equal distribution across the sexes, said Christopher Hunt, a clinical psychologist at the University of Sydney Gambling Treatment Clinic.\u000a\u000aPart of the issue is both ease and access. At the horse races, "you have to think about what bet are you going to place. With a pokie, you just mindlessly sit there, pressing a button," added politician Andrew Wilkie, an independent MP who tried unsuccessfully to introduce reform to federal gambling regulation in 2012. "So we have a problem."\u000a\u000a"The vast majority (of pokies) are high-intensity machines: big jackpots, fast games," Wilkie said. "A game can be less than three seconds, yet you can be pursuing jackpots that are tens of thousands of dollars.\u000a\u000a"It is said that about four out of five gambling addicts in Australia experience their problem on pokie machines. They're prevalent in the community; they're high-intensity; they're highly addictive."\u000a\u000aAt the Star casino in Sydney, hundreds of brightly lit slot machines line a room decorated with neon lights and a drab patterned carpet. It might seem like a gambler's paradise, but ambulances are a regular sight here, with emergency services often answering calls for everything from psychiatric behavior to overdoses and attempted suicide.\u000a\u000a"Ambulances regularly attend casinos. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported in 2016 that Sydney's Star City had 173 ambulance attendances a year in the period since 2012," Livingstone said. "This is consistent with reports around suicidality, mental health and other issues arising in Australia's casinos."\u000a\u000aBut Alex Blaszczynski, a director at the University of Sydney Gambling Treatment Clinic, warns that this "does not necessarily link up the excessive gambling with suicidality. I don't think there is sufficient evidence to make that cause and connection. It may or may not be related to gambling behavior."\u000a\u000a"If someone is going to the casino and committing suicide, is this something compulsive or delivered over time?" he asked.\u000a\u000aBut when it comes to gambling, health problems are common.\u000a\u000aA toll on health\u000a\u000aStudies by researchers at the UCLA Gambling Studies Program found that pathological gamblers are at increased risk of developing stress-related conditions, such as hypertension, sleep deprivation, cardiovascular disease and peptic ulcer disease.\u000a\u000aThe social toll of gambling is also high. A paper published last year by researchers from the Australian National University found that there were 25% fewer reported incidents of family violence and 30% fewer domestic violence assaults in postcodes in Victoria with no pokie machines, compared with postcodes with the machines, between 2005 and 2014.\u000a\u000a"Crime, divorce, domestic violence, suicide -- that's the sharp end of the stick," Blaszczynski said. "The majority of people lose money, and therefore their quality of life is affected."\u000a\u000aLaurie Brown, 58, understands what that means.\u000a\u000aIn 2011, the University of Canberra professor lost $30,000 gambling in sport, social and community clubs in the Australian capital -- betting on pokies. After a period of rehabilitation, she relapsed in 2015, losing $230,000. Much of it was taken, without her partner's knowledge, from their retirement funds.\u000a\u000a"Every time I pushed (the button), I was expecting a win," she said. She now recognizes that it wasn't only money she was losing but her well-being, too.\u000a\u000aLaurie Brown, 58, with her partner, John Formby.\u000a\u000a"Your body is running on stress because you're lying," recalled Brown, who hid her problem from her partner, friends and family. "I wasn't getting enough sleep for a long period of time. At the end of the week, I was exhausted. I also have type 1 diabetes, so that run amok."\u000a\u000aBrown developed depression and anxiety. "I can easily understand why some addictive gamblers have contemplated suicide," she said.\u000a\u000aThe need for intervention\u000a\u000aBrown wants to see increased intervention from staff at pubs and clubs to prevent problem gamblers like herself from spending too much money, as well as stricter rules around self-exclusion lists: a voluntary process in which the gambler asks to be put on a list banning them from entry at certain venues.\u000a\u000aMachines too, she says, should be made to be less addictive.\u000a\u000aOther advocates for reform suggest an introduction of a maximum AUS $1 bet on pokies, accompanied by a lower jackpot and mandatory pre-commitment limit. Currently, the maximum bet in the state of Victoria is $5 per spin and $10 in New South Wales.\u000a\u000aPre-commitment would allow gamblers to choose a daily limit before they start playing, which is tracked electronically. Once they exceed that limit, they are shut out of the game.\u000a\u000aPreventing this change, according to Livingstone, is a powerful gambling industry -- and their cozy relations with the government.\u000a\u000aStates and territories in Australia are responsible for regulating gambling, but they also benefit from taxation: New South Wales and Victoria make about AUS $2 billion (US $1.58 billion) a year from gambling.\u000a\u000aIn order to keep the government sweet, the gambling industry donates to political parties and independent MPs, Livingstone said. "They have a bunch of target politicians who they will regularly fund and who they can rely upon to put their case forward," he said. "What we're looking at is an industry that is not so much influencing government but is embedded in government."\u000a\u000aIndependent MP Wilkie agreed that there is a conflict of interest. "On the one hand, government and politicians have a duty to safeguard the community. On the other hand, these machines are big sources of taxation revenue," he said.\u000a\u000aStill, he insists, this is a "false economy": The social cost of gambling in Australia is estimated to be at least $4.7 billion a year, negating the money earned.\u000a\u000aPaul Toole, minister for racing for the government of New South Wales -- whose remit also covers gaming in the state -- did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\u000a\u000aMerlene Kairouz, minister for consumer affairs, gaming and liquor regulation for the state of Victoria, also did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.\u000a\u000aTaking action\u000a\u000aThis year, the Government of Victoria announced a 25-year freeze on the number of poker machines in the state, seen by many anti-gaming advocates, includng Australian law firm Maurice Blackburn, as an important step toward making the gaming industry more responsible for the impact on communities\u000a\u000aNext month, Maurice Blackburn will be taking a landmark lawsuit against casino Crown Melbourne and poker machine manufacturer Aristocrat Technologies to the federal court.\u000a\u000aThe firm claims that pokie machines are deliberately designed to trick players into thinking they are winning.\u000a\u000a"This is a landmark pro-bono action that is seeking to highlight the deceptive, misleading and unconscionable conduct of poker machine manufacturers and venues," Jennifer Kanis, Maurice Blackburn's head of social justice, told CNN.\u000a\u000aSome argue that poker machines are designed to mislead and deceive users.\u000a\u000aThe case is not seeking damages but is instead about making sure that poker machines are designed fairly and that players are genuinely informed about their prospects of winning, Kanis said.\u000a\u000aKanis, and her firm, believe that the gambling industry is aware of the harmful effects of problem gambling on vulnerable people yet continues to exploit problem gamblers.\u000a\u000aThe firm explained that the case centers on the Dolphin Treasure machine, which Kanis said "is misleading and deceptive and therefore in breach of consumer laws." The deceptiveness stems from the design of the machine, which the firm says aids confusion and disguises losses as wins.

aV(CNN) Tina Fey shoveled sheet cake into her mouth on a "Saturday Night Live" skit while ranting about the politics surrounding violent rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia. She urged viewers to not attend the dangerous marches and to eat cake instead.\u000a\u000a"I know a lot of us are feeling anxious, and we're asking ourselves, like, what can I do? I'm just one person; what can I do?" Fey says.\u000a\u000aOK, so everyone has different ways of managing stress. Wouldn't it be nice if those coping mechanisms were always healthy? But most of us have, at some point, come home from a rough day at work and scarfed down a personal pizza, or a pint of ice cream, or maybe even a sheet cake.\u000a\u000aKatie Rosso, a junior at the University of Missouri, said her most intense stress-eating experiences came when she was the manager of her student newspaper. Every Tuesday, the staff would stay up until 4 a.m. getting the paper ready for production, giving her only a few hours to spare before a 9 a.m. class.\u000a\u000a"Just to take the edge off, I would eat so much. And then I'd go home at the end of the night and be like, 'OK, I had two sodas, a Propel, one package of Starbursts, chips,' " Rosso said. "Just because I needed something to do while doing the work, to kind of keep my brain occupied on something more positive."\u000a\u000aWhile Rosso was eating, she felt good and more relaxed, but afterward, she would lie in bed and "feel disgusting," she said.\u000a\u000aThis year, she's trying to eat healthier. She packs watermelon and popcorn to snack on at work, and she tries to have smaller portions.\u000a\u000a"I think I still definitely eat when I'm stressed. But now it's more controlled, so I control it more than it controls me," she said.\u000a\u000aGaining control\u000a\u000aThe type of impulsivity that prompts you to stuff yourself with sugary cereal after a stressful day is a result of emotional hunger, said Rachel Goldman, a psychologist specializing in health and disordered eating. We can experience emotional hunger when we're stressed, sad or angry, often leading to eating because of those emotions.\u000a\u000aGoldman conducted a study in which she showed photos of comfort foods to patients who had bariatric surgery. Those who were less successful with weight loss after surgery had parts of their brain light up when they looked at the food, while those who were more successful did not. This result shows that food could have potentially addictive qualities, she said.\u000a\u000aThere is a distinction between stress eating and binge eating, she said. Binge eating is when someone quickly eats an abnormally large amount of food in a short amount of time and feels out of control while doing it, such as downing an entire package of Oreos in a half-hour and then feeling guilty. Stress eating may be impulsive, but it's not always followed by guilt.\u000a\u000a"If you can go into eating ice cream and cookies with the conscious decision that 'I wanted this' and can accept that you're going to eat it, no big deal, no harm done, then the thought that happens after the behavior is most likely not going to be feeling guilty," Goldman said.\u000a\u000aThe issue is when someone acts impulsively and eats without thinking about whether they actually want it, she said. If stress eating gets out of control, it could lead to binge eating. The key to gaining control is taking a moment to think before you eat something that may be unnecessary.\u000a\u000a"They're going to feel guilty, feel bad about it," Goldman said. "Then that negative thought will turn into perhaps another negative behavior, perhaps a negative emotion. And our thoughts, emotions and behaviors are all linked. So that can turn into a downward spiral."\u000a\u000aBeware: Even thinking of food as a reward after doing something tough is considered to be emotional eating, she said. And any type of eating because of emotion, not because of physiological hunger, is an unhealthy coping mechanism.\u000a\u000a"It's not exactly solving the problem," she said. Someone trying to combat stress eating should be prepared with a handful of alternative options. Those who are tempted by junk food at work should pack a protein bar, an apple or another nutritious snack so that they know they have a healthy option if the office orders pizza.\u000a\u000aTo avoid eating in general, going for a walk, cleaning up or calling a friend are all good choices, Goldman said. If 10 minutes pass and you're not hungry anymore, it might be emotional hunger. If you're still hungry, your body probably does need food.\u000a\u000aCan stress eating ever be healthy?\u000a\u000aSo is there a healthy side to stress eating? Not quite, according to Goldman.\u000a\u000a"If we think of eating, we really should only be eating to survive," she said. "When it comes to eating out of a stress or comfort, really there are other ways to cope with those problems. So eating really shouldn't be those."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aBut cleaning your house probably doesn't sound as appealing as a bowl of hot mac and cheese after a fight with your partner. Lisa Drayer, a registered dietician who writes about nutrition for CNN, says that eating to quell your stress once in a while is fine.\u000a\u000a"I think there's a spectrum. It could start out as, you're enjoying a scoop of ice cream. Or you just really need a piece of chocolate. And you savor it and love it. That's fine," said Drayer. "But when the portions become out of hand, that's when it becomes a problem, because then it could really lead to weight gain."\u000a\u000aA reward pizza here and or stress candy bar there can add up. Eating 500 extra calories a day could lead to a pound of weight gain per week, she said. However, there's no need to be hard on yourself after one rough night.\u000a\u000a"Don't feel badly," Drayer said. "Just get back on track the next day."

It's lost half its value in a little more than a year.\u000a\u000aAmerican Outdoor Brands said it was suffering from comparisons to 2016, when gun and ammo sales boomed during the presidential campaign.

As Hurricane Sandy made landfall in 2012, those of us at FEMA knew that any failure on our part would be directed at the President. He had an election just weeks away, but his only message to us was to save lives.\u000a\u000aHe hugged survivors. He called local leaders every day. He made Hurricane Sandy about all of us and led us in how to help them begin the recovery process. Trump faces an even bigger disaster.\u000a\u000a(To get a sense of scale here, consider that in Sandy, the NYPD Special Operations division and FDNY water rescue teams rescued more than 2,200 people during and after the storm, though both departments estimate that hundreds more were likely rescued but not reported, according to the New York City Hurricane Sandy After-Action Report. This is dwarfed by Harvey: search and rescue teams have rescued more than 3,800 and the Coast Guard has rescued more than 6,000 -- so far -- according to FEMA estimates.)\u000a\u000aIt is easy to see why President Trump must show full engagement. He, too can lead by example, by making this -- not other issues -- his focus, and the nation's focus. He can set aside tax reform for the moment, and tell people how to get involved, where to donate money and volunteer. He has the most powerful bully pulpit in the world and he needs to use it to drive attention and aid to the region. He needs to show that he's pushing hard -- every day.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Trump surveys hurricane-ravaged Texas Replay More Videos ...

We've seen this over the past few days as the Coast Guard communicated clearly how to safely call upon them for rescue. Meteorologists clarified that even though the hurricane was downgraded, the worst flooding was yet to come. These messages are rehearsed and practiced because in a disaster, the right words can save lives.\u000a\u000aRecovery will not be "quick" as President Trump said. And his waving a Texas flag, as he did Tuesday in Corpus Christi, won't help the people standing in lines to register for FEMA assistance.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, floodwaters were still rising and people continued to be rescued by helicopter. Yet President Trump went to Missouri -- to talk about tax reform -- with a brief prelude to acknowledge the heroic work of first responders, and add that "recovery will be tough but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand all over this country."\u000a\u000aThis was an improvement on his tone-deaf remarks the previous day, but he needs to show he is focused enough on Harvey.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Conway spars with Cuomo over Harvey Replay More Videos ...

He must remind us that we're in it together, not change the subject.\u000a\u000aFrom my years at FEMA, this I know: Having a realistic perspective is as much a part of recovering from a crisis as the giant to-do list that face most families. Having a realistic understanding about how Hurricane Harvey will transform our country will force those of us not in harm's way to take a serious look at our own priorities and preparation.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump must get survivors ready for the long haul, convey a clear understanding of the immense challenges ahead, not use his time before the cameras to set timelines for self-congratulation for his administration's job well done, as the President alluded to in Corpus Christi, or spend Twitter time politicking about NAFTA and tax reform.\u000a\u000aRegardless of what the President tweets, the survivors of Harvey will rebuild their lives, but they will be different than before. Trump himself set the expectation that his way will be the best way. We should hold him to that.

Because both men represent an increasing abandonment of the current GOP by politicians in the ideological middle -- or, as Dent put it in a statement released Thursday night announcing his retirement , the "governing wing" of the Republican Party.\u000a\u000a(Note: Democrats don't have much of a "governing wing" left, either, after losses in 2010 and 2014.)\u000a\u000aIt's worth quoting from that Dent statement as some length. Here's the key part:\u000a\u000a"As a member of the governing wing of the Republican Party, I've worked to instill stability, certainty and predictability in Washington. I've fought to fulfill the basic functions of government, like keeping the lights on and preventing default.\u000a\u000aRegrettably, that has not been easy given the disruptive outside influences that profit from increased polarization and ideological rigidity that leads to dysfunction, disorder and chaos."\u000a\u000aIt's hard to imagine a Democrat writing a more frank indictment of the current state of the Republican Party than that.\u000a\u000aWhat Dent is making clear -- without exactly saying it -- is that he no longer thought it was worth fighting against the forces of rigid orthodoxy that had overrun his party. That he didn't leave the GOP -- it left him.\u000a\u000a"You know I expect a certain amount of dysfunction in government but those guys have taken the 'fun' out of dysfunction," Dent told CNN's Manu Raju in an interview Friday.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Dent on CNN before the 2016 election: I'm not voting for Trump or Clinton Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dent on CNN before the 2016 election: I'm not voting for Trump or Clinton 05:44\u000a\u000aThe twin retirements of Dent and Reichert matter far more than in some esoteric debate about the current ideological state of the Republican party under Donald Trump. They both represent districts -- one centered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the other in the Seattle suburbs -- that could well flip to Democrats in the pivotal 2018 election.\u000a\u000aReichert is one of 23 Republicans who represents a district Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential election. His 8th District was also won by Barack Obama in 2012. Dent's 15th District is slightly more friendly for Republicans; Trump won it by 7 points in 2016 but Mitt Romney carried it by less than 3 in 2012.\u000a\u000aDent and Reichert are the 13th and 14th House Republicans to announce their plans to leave office in 2018. Nearly half of them (six) are doing so without another obvious job in mind, according to The Washington Post's James Hohmann. Reichert is the second member to retire from a district Clinton won in 2016 ; Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, another outspoken moderate, announced she would leave Congress earlier this year.\u000a\u000aAs "Inside Elections" analyst Nathan Gonzales noted in Roll Call earlier this week , there's almost certainly more retirements to come. He calculated that, on average, 22 members have retired without another job in each election since 1976.\u000a\u000aThe danger for Republicans is that Dent and Reichert (and Ros-Lehtinen) are the leading edge of a stampede of Republican moderates out of Congress. The Republican majority -- one of its largest in the last 100 years -- is built on its gains not only in the South over the past two decades but also surprising strength in the northeast corridor -- New Jersey through Maine. The vast majority of those members identify far more with Dent or Reichert ideologically than, say, Steve King of Iowa.\u000a\u000aBut the Republican president has governed -- this week excepted -- in a way far more likely to please King than Dent. And, increasingly, calls for party purity are forcing moderate Republicans into contested primaries. It seems more than a coincidence, for example, that Dent's retirement comes hard on the heels of state Rep. Justin Simmons' decision to primary the GOP incumbent . Simmons blasted Dent as more closely aligned with Democrats than Republicans.\u000a\u000aAnd, as Dent noted in his retirement statement, an entire world of outside groups have grown up to foster and fuel and fund these ideological challengers, providing them with viability that they might not have had even a decade ago.\u000a\u000aHistory suggests that the 2018 election is going to be a tough one for Republicans in Congress. Since 1946, when presidents are above 50% approval, their party loses an average of 14 seats in House in midterms, according to Gallup calculations . But, if a president is below that 50% approval -- and Trump is way below that -- the average seat loss is 36 seats.\u000a\u000aThose are daunting numbers -- even without the possibility that Dent and Reichert are the leading edge of a series of retirement from members in swing districts due to increasing feelings of ideological isolation.\u000a\u000aDent, for his part, predicted a reckoning for his party\u000a\u000a"I do believe that this year -- 2018 -- will be similar analogous to 1994, 2006 and 2010 where each of those years, each of those cycles, one party controlled all three branches of government," Dent told Manu. "So I do think it's analogous. So the party of the President, the party in control, will run into a head wind, and probably a stiff head wind, just a matter of how stiff. Will it be a gentle breeze or gale force wind? I don't know. But I think a lot of members here are going to have to plan for the worst and then hope for best."

aV(CNN) No matter how grueling or physically demanding Formula One is on its drivers, Sebastian Vettel is sure the toughest test only comes once they hang up their helmets.\u000a\u000aNico Rosberg shocked the world of F1 when he announced his retirement from the sport less than a week after claiming his maiden world championship title in 2016.\u000a\u000aThe German spent most his life working towards reaching the pinnacle of his profession, deciding to quit once he'd reached it to spend more time with his young family.\u000a\u000aWith the stress, strain and intense pressure that the F1 calendar entails, would Vettel be tempted to copy his compatriot's decision and walk away from the sport for good?\u000a\u000a"I don't know," the 30-year-old German driver tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies in an exclusive interview. "I don't know much about his decision at the end of the day. I don't know if it was spontaneous or if it was an intention.\u000a\u000a"I guess it's a very difficult probably the most difficult decision you have to make in your racing career or life."\u000a\u000aVettel has achieved everything possible in F1 -- setting new, historic benchmarks in the process -- but the German is also conscious that there are few pastimes more thrilling than elite motorsport.\u000a\u000a"Whatever comes after, you need to be aware of the fact that the source of adrenaline of rush, excitement, the biggest income in that regard is gone," he says with trepidation.\u000a\u000a"It will never come back. That will be difficult to make friends with. I'd assume it's been hard for all the drivers to call it a day.\u000a\u000a"You want to make sure that you lined up your ducks for the afterlife. The biggest challenge one day will be to quit and find something else that gives you a different sort of pleasure.\u000a\u000a"You can drive other cars, but they're not as satisfying as driving a Formula One car."\u000a\u000aHeppenheim\u000a\u000aPerhaps, however, Vettel is better prepared for life after racing than many of his contemporaries.\u000a\u000a"Well, I'm happy with the small things in life," he says, a content smile creeping across his face.\u000a\u000aBorn in Heppenheim, a modest, slow-paced town of 25,000 residents in western Germany, the 30-year-old recalls a place where children can walk to school without parents, or play unsupervised in the Old Town square.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED 'One of the greatest drivers I've ever seen' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'One of the greatest drivers I've ever seen' 01:35\u000a\u000aSituated among vineyards and rolling, forested hills about an hour's drive south of Frankfurt, you would be hard pressed to find a starker contrast to the life Vettel leads now.\u000a\u000aHe might have become accustomed to a life of private jets and five-star hotels, but Vettel admits the change in lifestyle was abrupt.\u000a\u000a"I don't think I got any preparation for this," he laughs. "But then again, I got a lot because in many ways you can argue that all this (Formula One) is not the real world.\u000a\u000a"But I think I'm fortunate enough to look back and say I had a real and normal childhood just like any other child.\u000a\u000a"Maybe people always have the expectation of what our lives should look like, just because we have the opportunity. But then it's my choice and you know I'm happy with a normal life, with normal things that give me satisfaction."\u000a\u000aVettel openly admits that the superstar lifestyle that being a F1 driver affords him doesn't provide the same satisfaction as a quiet night in with friends and family.\u000a\u000a"I'm really happy when I'm at home, when I don't have a huge perfect menu or buffet," he says. "I have to do breakfast myself. In the end, you always want the things that you don't have.\u000a\u000a"I'm traveling a lot, so of course I appreciate sleeping in my own bed."\u000a\u000aMaking history\u000a\u000aWhenever Vettel has driven an F1 car, history seems to have followed in his slipstream. In 2010, aged just 23, the German became the sport's youngest-ever world champion.\u000a\u000aHe would go on to win four successive world titles, making him the youngest double, triple and quadruple champion of all time.\u000a\u000aHis first crown came down to a four-way final race decider against Red Bull teammate Mark Webber, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Hungarian Grand Prix and Alonso: The Circuit Replay More Videos ...

"I think it's normal that if you really care for what you do and love what you do, you become very passionate about it.\u000a\u000a"And that means also that, you know, being human you react from time to time.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes good, people like it. Sometimes bad, people don't like it. So, I've been on both sides but, as I said, I think it's also a reminder that I still care."\u000a\u000a'Best moment is still to come'\u000a\u000aVettel's 2015 switch from Red Bull to Ferrari saw him wear for the first time the famous red that his idol wore in the photos that adorned his childhood bedroom wall.\u000a\u000aVettel comes across as a pragmatist. Even as a child, he recalls, his thought was always focused on winning his next kart race -- rarely did he let images of himself standing atop the podium as F1 world champion cloud his mind.\u000a\u000aBut he readily admits emulating seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher -- five of them with Ferrari -- would top his long list of previous achievements.\u000a\u000aVettel leads the current drivers' championship by seven points heading into this weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Vettel: It was a 'close to perfect night' Replay More Videos ...

"And at the moment the best moment that I can picture is winning in red.\u000a\u000a"Winning with Ferrari -- because it's what we set out to do when I joined -- is what my hero has done for so many years. Everybody inside the team is dying to get back to the top.\u000a\u000a"And yeah, that I would imagine would be a great, great moment and I want to witness it. I want to make it happen. It's great I had a huge inspiration in my childhood."\u000a\u000aVettel, though, scoffs at the notion a driver can only truly be considered great if he reaps success with two different teams.\u000a\u000a"Usually the people that came come out saying that are the ones that didn't do it," he says dismissively. "But no, I'm not bothered.\u000a\u000a"I think you have great drivers in Formula One and a lot of things need to go right for you, personally, to be able to be in a position to win.\u000a\u000a"There are drivers that had the potential in the past and because of their decisions, the team's performances it didn't come together.\u000a\u000a"I'm quite happy with what I got now -- but not satisfied yet because equally I want more."

aVMark Lynas is a writer on climate change, and visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science at Cornell University . The opinions in this article belong to the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) This is what climate change looks like. Entire metropolitan areas -- Houston in the United States and Mumbai in India -- submerged in catastrophic floods.\u000a\u000aThey used to make Hollywood disaster movies about this sort of thing. Now it's just the news.\u000a\u000aWatching Trump tour the flooded areas, I was reminded of his Rose Garden press conference less than three months ago announcing the US withdrawal from the Paris climate treaty. In that act of wanton international vandalism, Trump was helping condemn millions more people to the threat of intensified extreme events in future decades.\u000a\u000aIt is not politically opportunistic to raise this issue now. Instead we have a moral duty not to accept the attempted conspiracy of silence imposed by powerful political and business interests opposed to any reduction in the use of fossil fuels. We owe this to the people of Texas as much to those of Bangladesh and India, and Niger -- which was also struck by disastrous flooding this week.\u000a\u000aClimate disasters demonstrate our collective humanity and interdependence. We have to help each other out -- in the short term by saving lives and in the longer term by cutting greenhouse gases and enhancing resilience, especially in developing countries.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Conway spars with Cuomo over Harvey Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Conway spars with Cuomo over Harvey 01:57\u000a\u000aNo, of course climate change did not "cause" Harvey in any singular sense. Nor does smoking definitively "cause" any individual case of lung cancer. Smoking increases the risk of cancer, just as increased global warming increases the risk of extreme rainfall events.\u000a\u000aThis is not scientifically controversial. There is a straightforward physical relationship between a warming atmosphere and extreme rainfall potential.\u000a\u000aHotter air can hold more water vapor. And hotter water can provide the fuel for more intense tropical storms.\u000a\u000aYes, the vagaries of the weather played a part. Harvey stalled close enough to the Texas coast to continue drawing in tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico that was supercharged with moisture.\u000a\u000aBut the climate change fingerprint is undeniable, too. Sea surface temperatures across the Gulf on August 23, just before Harvey made landfall in Texas, were ominously warm , 1.5 to 4 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 7.2 F) hotter than the average of a few decades ago. These warm waters helped Harvey develop from a mere tropical depression to a Category 4 hurricane in just 48 hours.\u000a\u000aIf disasters ever have a silver lining, it is that they bring us together. Witness how ordinary people risked their lives to save others as the floodwaters rose around Houston. These were not unusual heroes; they were just normal people doing what they knew was right.\u000a\u000apeople in direst need of food and shelter. In life-threatening situations our human empathy swamps our day-to-day divisions of politics, nationality or religion. In South Asia, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is already supporting 200,000people in direst need of food and shelter.\u000a\u000aSomehow, we need to find a way to extend our capacity to empathize and support each other across political and social divides in the long term. If climate change remains as politically toxic as it is today in America, we will never be able to address it properly.\u000a\u000aWe all have a duty to confront denial and speak out. If we fail, the Harveys, Katrinas and Sandys of the future will be even worse than the storms we experience today. And in the future, as now, each subsequent climate disaster will just be "news." Surely we can do better than that.

aV(CNN) Elisabeth Moss caps a busy year with "Top of the Lake: China Girl," a less-impressive sequel to her 2013 SundanceTV miniseries. Coming on the heels of "The Handmaid's Tale," it nonetheless helps cement the "Mad Men" star's status as reigning queen of the limited series, while signaling how a shift in the TV landscape is creating richer roles, for women in particular.\u000a\u000aIn the 1980s and '90s, actresses like Meredith Baxter achieved a kind of royalty in the realm of TV movies. But those projects often weren't especially ambitious, reveling in true crime and melodrama, like "A Woman Scorned: The Betty Broderick Story" and "Darkness Before Dawn."\u000a\u000aMore recently, networks have sought a bigger return on their programming investment by funneling resources into series and limited series, providing opportunities for more fleshed-out characters and portrayals.\u000a\u000aMoss is only one of the beneficiaries of this dynamic. Carrie Coon followed HBO's critically lauded "The Leftovers" by starring in the latest edition of FX's "Fargo." Nicole Kidman also has a small but significant supporting role in "Top of the Lake," after being part of the female-led ensemble in HBO's "Big Little Lies." Ditto for "Game of Thrones'" Gwendoline Christie, who plays Moss' unlikely sidekick.\u000a\u000aMore are on the way. Sarah Paulson again heads producer Ryan Murphy's repertory company in the latest edition of "American Horror Story." Edie Falco will play attorney Leslie Abramson in "Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders," an eight-part NBC production (previously fodder for a 1994 miniseries). And "Downton Abbey's" Joanne Froggatt stars in "Liar," a provocative SundanceTV drama about a teacher who accuses a doctor of sexually assaulting her.\u000a\u000aRead More

The city has so many of them that in 2017, authorities mooted a ban on opening any more within the center of town.\u000a\u000aBut not all Venice hotels are created equal -- especially since the traditional (read: outré) Venetian style can be rather OTT for modern tastes.\u000a\u000aFrom celeb retreats to budget digs, the center of town to the islands, here are the hotels doing things differently.\u000a\u000aEXTREMELY HIGH-END\u000a\u000aVilla F attracts the A-list.\u000a\u000aVilla F\u000a\u000aThere are fancy hotels, and then there's Villa F. A super-luxury and equally discreet retreat on Giudecca island, you'd never guess from the crumbling façade that inside is a resort so private that Angelina Jolie picked it while she was filming "The Tourist."\u000a\u000aWhat was once a guesthouse for artists and aesthetes -- Italian bard Gabriele D'Annunzio was among the regulars -- has been transformed by Francesca Bortolotto Possati, owner of the iconic Bauer Hotel (see below), into a bucolic haven with 11played-down, rustic suites set around meadow-style gardens, complete with meditation pool.\u000a\u000aThose in the main building have spectacular views of St Mark's Square and Dorsoduro, and the service is equally flamboyant, with butlers and a free shuttle to San Marco every half hour. But it has a conscience, too: Full-size bathroom amenities are made especially for Possati by the organic lab at the Giudecca women's prison.\u000a\u000aVilla F , Giudecca, 50, 30133 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 520 7022\u000a\u000aJW Marriott Resort & Spa\u000a\u000aPrivate islands were made for this: A sprawling, top-notch resort balancing on the lagoon behind Giudecca, and a 15-minute boat ride from St Mark's Square.\u000a\u000aMarriott bought the 16-hectare site -- a former sanatorium -- and quickly turned it into the city's most peaceful resort, opening in 2015 with grounds filled with trees, olive groves and vegetable gardens (serving the restaurant), and even a chapel repurposed as a wedding venue.\u000a\u000aThe 266 rooms are designed by Matteo Thun, the spa's the largest in Venice, the rooftop pool overlooks the city's distant spires, and restaurant Dopolavoro is Michelin-starred.\u000a\u000aWith all that on offer, you may not be so keen to take the free shuttle into town. Understandable.\u000a\u000aJW Marriott , Isola delle Rose Laguna di San Marco, 30133 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 852 1300\u000a\u000aHotel Danieli\u000a\u000aFew hotels can match the Danieli -- an icon for all the right reasons. Composed of three buildings, the hotel is centered around the 14th -century palace of Doge Dandolo-- who built his home next to his office, the Palazzo Ducale.\u000a\u000aWith columns, coffered roof and monumental fireplace intact, there's no fancier lobby or bar area in town; and the guestrooms in the main building are equally impressive.\u000a\u000aThe two modern buildings are nothing to be sniffed at, however, having undergone refurbishments by Jacques Garcia and Pierre Yves Rochon.\u000a\u000aSince it's a Luxury Collection hotel, if you're a points person, staying here lets you earn with Marriott (or Starwood, until the schemes are merged). But there are better reasons to stay at the Danieli -- from the glorious old-school concierge desk to the rooftop restaurant with 270-degree views from the prisons of the Doge's Palace to the lagoon and Riva degli Schiavoni all the way to Sant'Elena and the Lido.\u000a\u000aDanieli Hotel Venice , Castello, 4196, 30122 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 522 6480\u000a\u000aHIGH-END\u000a\u000aCa' Sagredo: Salmon pink splendor.\u000a\u000aCenturion Palace\u000a\u000aUnlike the other luxury hotels on the Grand Canal, the Centurion Palace has ditched the traditional frou-frou Venetian style and opted for thoroughly modern bling.\u000a\u000aBathrooms are clad in real gold leaf (right down to the flooring), bedrooms are given bright palettes, from rusty orange to scarlet, and ceilings in the main wing can be enormous -- nearly 22 feet high, with vast windows overlooking the canal.\u000a\u000aIt's been done out of necessity rather than sacrilege, says General Manager Paolo Morra; the 19th-century neo-gothic building had few period features left, so rather than invent what wasn't there, they decided to create something that hasn't yet been seen on the Grand Canal.\u000a\u000aAnd they've done so spectacularly. But some things remain the same, like the bar and restaurant pontoons cantilevered over the water, offering views from the Accademia Bridge to the lagoon.\u000a\u000aThere's also a calm courtyard, often patrolled by the house cat.\u000a\u000aCenturion Palace , Dorsoduro, 173, 30123 Venezia VE, Italy, +39 041 34281\u000a\u000aBauer\u000a\u000aThe Bauer used to be two hotels, joined by a communal lobby: the 1940s brutalist (read: love-it- or-hate- it) Bauer L'Hotel, and the more classical 18th-century Il Palazzo, right on the Grand Canal. 2017 saw them come together to form a single property -- and with 200 rooms at its disposal, it's a winning combination.\u000a\u000aRooms still divide roughly down the lines of the old properties -- entry-level ones are more likely to be in the modern building, while the top suites are those overlooking the Grand Canal -- but there's a good range through both buildings, and the décor is flouncy-Venetian- at-its- best throughout.\u000a\u000aTop level suites get access to Il Settimo Cielo, or Seventh Heaven -- a spectacular rooftop bar and breakfast room (other guests can book meals there) -- but the ground-floor "civilian" eating areas are hardly bad: Breakfast is served on a terrace cantilevered over the Grand Canal, with gondolas parked up next door.\u000a\u000aBauer Hotel , S. Marco, 1459, 30124 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 520 7022\u000a\u000aCa' Sagredo\u000a\u000aOne of the grandest dames of the Grand Canal, this salmon-pink 14th-century palazzo near the Ca' d'Oro and Casino was built by the Sagredo family ("Ca" means "house") and only became a hotel in 2007 -- and even then it was designated a national monument.\u000a\u000aYou'll see why as soon as you walk in, taking the monumental staircase up from the grand lobby to the main "piano nobile" floor, complete with stucco, gilding, frescoes and gargantuan paintings on the walls.\u000a\u000aIn comparison, rooms are fairly tame (apart from the top-level suites, of course, which are opulence incarnate), but they're comfortable and relatively spacious by Venice standards. But it's worth staying in a box room just to get access to the opulent breakfast room, bar and public areas -- especially since staff enforce the guests-only rule with hawk-like precision.\u000a\u000aCa' Segredo , Campo Santa Sofia, 4198/99, 30121 Venezia VE; Italy, +39 041 241 3111\u000a\u000aExcelsior\u000a\u000aCome here in September and you'll be shoulder-to- shoulder with A-listers. The grand dame of the Lido island, built in 1908, the Excelsior is the single focus for the glamorous Venice Film Festival -- little wonder, when it has a swish private beach, restaurant with sweeping views of the Adriatic, and decadent Moorish design in the guestrooms to match the turreted, tumbling façade.\u000a\u000aOnsite is a pool (a rarity in Venice) and six restaurants; offsite, for those wanting to stay on the Lido -- a hive of active and eco-friendly tourism -- there are tennis courts, bicycles for rent, and even a golf course and equestrian center nearby. A free water- shuttle whisks you to St Mark's Square, 15 minutes away.\u000a\u000aThe only downside? It's open seasonally, from April to October. On the plus side, during the 2017 closure, it's down for a renovation.\u000a\u000aHotel Excelsior , Lungomare Guglielmo Marconi, 41, 30126 Lido VE, Italy; +39 041 5260201\u000a\u000aCa' Maria Adele\u000a\u000aMost Venetian hotels take opulence to the max, but few amp up the romance as much as Ca' Maria Adele, a 12-room bolthole on Dorsoduro, next to the iconic Salute church. Low-lit, rabbit-warren corridors lead you to the rooms -- all different, but equally dramatic, and loaded with antiques, damask wall coverings, Murano glass chandeliers and rich floor-to- ceiling drapes.\u000a\u000aOutside the rooms, there's a sumptuously furnished communal lounge and a wildly romantic breakfast room, but the real draw is the "altana" or rooftop terrace, overlooking Giudecca across the water.\u000a\u000aCa' Maria Adele , Sestiere Dorsoduro, 111, 30123 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 520 3078\u000a\u000aMODERATE\u000a\u000aLocanda Cipriani is a food lover's dream.\u000a\u000aPalazzo Barbarigo\u000a\u000aThis fantastic little hotel on the Grand Canal, Palazzo Barbarigo occupies a small, unassuming building reached via the alleyways of San Polo.\u000a\u000aOnce inside, however, everything changes: From the mirror on the ceiling of the lobby, reflecting the sparkling water outside, to the chic bar upstairs, complete with balcony- for-two cantilevered over the Grand Canal, you know you're in for something special.\u000a\u000aRoom décor strikes out boldly from Venetian norms, with a sultry art deco feel -- all low-lighting, feather-fringed lights and velvet furnishings -- but the feeling's refined, rather than OTT. What's more every single room has a view of the water -- whether that's the side canal or the Grand one slapping against the ground-floor walls.\u000a\u000aPalazzo Barbarigo , San Polo, 2765, 30125 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 740 172\u000a\u000aLocanda Vivaldi\u000a\u000aWith crowded waterbuses and taxis that squeeze even generous budgets, getting to and from your hotel is often the only drawback to a stay in Venice.\u000a\u000aNot so with Locanda Vivaldi; make your reservation direct with the hotel, and it'll throw in a free one-way transfer in its vintage boat from Piazzale Roma, the main terminus.\u000a\u000aThere are other reasons to stay at the Vivaldi, however; its lagoon-front location on the Riva degli Schiavoni, for starters. Most of the 27 rooms have views -- either of the side canal or the lagoon itself -- and summer sees the restaurant move to the rooftop terrace.\u000a\u000aThe look is traditional -- heavy drapes and deep colors -- and for those wanting a more home-from- home experience, the hotel also has a hot tub-equipped apartment, Ca' Bollani, in an adjacent building.\u000a\u000aLocando Vivaldi , Riva degli Schiavoni, 4150-52, 30122 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 277 0477\u000a\u000aHilton Molino Stucky\u000a\u000aHilton upended the Venice hotel scene in 2007 when it converted the derelict Molino Stucky flour mill on Giudecca island into a behemoth 379-room hotel and convention center.\u000a\u000aDon't underestimate it as a boring chain property, however; the 13-building complex (of which eight are open to guests) is full of original features, from steel columns and beamed ceilings in the lobby and guestrooms to a statue of the mill's founder by the spa -- which used to serve as his office.\u000a\u000aThe spa, by the way, uses Elemis products, and was the largest in Venice until the JW Marriott pipped it to the post.\u000a\u000aThe hotel's out-of- the-way location -- it sits on the far end of Giudecca, a 10-minute boat ride from St Mark's Square (there's a house shuttle, for which a \u20ac6/$7 charge is levied per guest, per stay) -- comes into its own in summer, when the rooftop pool opens and the restaurant sets up tables outside on the waterfront.\u000a\u000aThe rooftop bar -- on the eighth floor -- is open year-round, however, and offers possibly the best view of the city skyline. It's the place to be at sunset -- though note that, as it opens at 5 p.m., during the winter it's already dark by the time it opens.\u000a\u000aHilton Molino Stucky , Giudecca, 810, 30133 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 272 3311\u000a\u000aLocanda Cipriani\u000a\u000aAll the cachet but none of the crowds is what's on offer at this gloriously relaxed island retreat, far out in the lagoon on semi-deserted Torcello. Harry's Bar founder Giuseppe Cipriani opened his restaurant-with-rooms in the 1930s, and its tranquil surroundings have attracted the likes of the British royal family, Elton John and Winston Churchill.\u000a\u000aMost visitors come for a meal -- served on the veranda outside in summer, and made with local ingredients throughout (they call it "Cipriani cuisine") -- but to really soak up the atmosphere which allowed regular Ernest Hemingway to write two books here, you'll need to stay over.\u000a\u000aUpstairs are six bedrooms -- two singles, one double, two junior suites and a suite. The décor is, as you might expect, a throwback to simpler times -- you'll find stacked bookcases rather than fancy sound-systems -- and the inn has conserved artwork by some of its most famous clients.\u000a\u000aIt's a stay unlike any other in Venice -- and because of its distance, it's more suited to regular visitors who want to experience lagoon life, rather than those wanting to sightsee in town.\u000a\u000aLocanda Cipriani , Piazza Santa Fosca, 29, 30142 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 730150\u000a\u000aLagare Murano\u000a\u000aA stunning conversion of an old glassworks factory on Murano, the Lagare's 118 bright rooms, located around a central courtyard, have hardwood floors and floor-to-ceiling windows, while works of art by local glass-blowers Venini are dotted around the premises.\u000a\u000aIts island location isn't ideal for first-timers, but for those wanting a different take on Venice -- and after a taste of island life once the furnaces die down and the tourists retreat -- it's a stylish winner.\u000a\u000aLagare Murano , Riva Longa, 49, 30141 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 736250\u000a\u000aCa' Pisani\u000a\u000aAs befits its status in the Design Hotels fold, this is a bold modernization of a 500-year-old merchant's house on Dorsoduro, near the Accademia.\u000a\u000aNot too modern, mind you; it's been entirely redone in Art Deco style, with furniture from the 1930s and 1940s, and futurist art on the walls by Fortunato Depero. It's such a thorough theming that even the doors to the 29 rooms have geometric patterns engraved on the wood.\u000a\u000aThe accoutrements, however, are thoroughly 21 st -century, with a hammam, free non-alcoholic minibar and trendy, Futurist-themed restaurant, La Rivista.\u000a\u000aCa' Pisani , Rio Terrà Foscarini, 979A, 30123 Dorsoduro, Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 240 1411\u000a\u000aBUDGET\u000a\u000aGio & Gio is all about the undone luxury.\u000a\u000aHotel Flora\u000a\u000aThere's little to dislike about the Flora. It's locally owned -- the Romanelli family took on this simple 40-room property in the 1960s -- and furnished with care.\u000a\u000aRooms may be a little small -- this is a three-star hotel within a couple of minutes' walk from St. Mark's Square, after all -- but they've been thoughtfully put together, with comfortable mattresses on the antique beds, original terrazzo flooring, and Ortigia amenities in the bathroom.\u000a\u000aThe Romanelli family own two other properties -- the fin de siècle-style Novecento and Casa Flora, a designer apartment in an adjacent building -- but nothing comes between repeat guests and the Flora.\u000a\u000aYou'll find old hands propping up the bar in the evening, sitting in the tranquil courtyard in good weather, and scouring the family's blog, insidevenice.it , for ideas of what to do -- they're big proponents of sustainable tourism.\u000a\u000aHotel Flora , S. Marco, 2283A, 30124 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 520 5844\u000a\u000aGio & Gio\u000a\u000aCast aside all your aspersions about B&Bs, because this delightful place is more of a super-stylish home that just so happens to have three rooms for rent.\u000a\u000aOwner Gianni has walked the line between traditional and outré pretty perfectly -- in the communal lounge, an understated cream couch sits beside a florid gilt mirror, while a lush rug is slung over sober parquet flooring.\u000a\u000aRooms nod to Venice's past, with Fortuny fabrics and antique furniture; but again they're sharpened up with modern drapes, lamps and bedside tables.\u000a\u000aOne of the rooms (the junior suite) has a tiny balcony overlooking the canal outside, but since you're a five-minute walk from St. Mark's Square (the apartment is right beside the Giglio church) you're in the middle of the action anyway.\u000a\u000aAnd don't be alarmed about the intimacy -- this may be a small B&B, and Gianni lives on site, but there's no sense of claustrophobia; guests are pleasantly left to their own devices.\u000a\u000aGio & Gio , 30100 Venice, Metropolitan City of Venice, Italy; no phone\u000a\u000aAvogaria\u000a\u000aWhat started out as a restaurant has turned into a design-led, five-room residence on a quiet side street on the far end of Dorsoduro, near the San Basilio vaporetto stop.\u000a\u000aOwner Francesco Pugliese has opted for a modern take on traditional Venetian flounce, with ornate rugs, Rubelli fabrics and and gilt-framed mirrors teamed with contemporary furniture and modern mosaicked bathrooms.\u000a\u000aThree of the junior suites have private walled gardens -- where you can get dinner from the restaurant delivered on room service -- while the others overlook the courtyard and gardens. It's a different, more local take on Venice than a standard hotel -- in a deliciously tranquil area of the city.\u000a\u000aAvogaria , Calle Avogaria, 1629, 30100 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 296 0491\u000a\u000aCasa Burano\u000a\u000aSomething completely new for Venice, Casa Burano is an "albergo diffuso" -- or "scattered hotel", an initiative sweeping Italy which takes unoccupied houses in a village and creates a "hotel" around them -- turning each apartment into a room, and ditching the public areas.\u000a\u000aThis one -- the first for Venice -- was the idea of the local Bisol family, who run Venissa, a vineyard and restaurant with rooms on Mazzorbo island, linked to Burano via a footbridge. Casa Burano offers something different: the chance to live like a local on an island that, during the daytime, is wall-to-wall Instagrammers.\u000a\u000aBurano has a strong local community, says Matteo Bisol, that changes vastly in the morning and evening when there are no tourists around. Rooms are bright and modern, with great views of the famous colored island houses.\u000a\u000aCasa Burano ,Via Guidecca, 139, 30142 Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 527 2281\u000a\u000aHotel Fenice et des Artistes\u000a\u000aNowadays the Fenice et des Artistes is a budget hotel; back in the day, however, this was a glam hangout for the artistic set, sitting behind the world-famous opera house -- and, in fact, linked by a secret passage so divas like Maria Callas could slip to bed without being menaced by fans.\u000a\u000aThe rooms today won't win any style awards -- they're simple three-star affairs -- and the views are largely of the hotel's pleasant courtyard or the alley leading to the Fenice (though some overlook the dark canal at the back of the hotel), but this is still a great choice for a budget break, with a huge amount of history packed between the walls.\u000a\u000aRestaurant Taverna La Fenice, is an extraordinary place that again has seen everything; it specializes in meat dishes, so if you've had enough of Venetian fish specialties, here's where to come.\u000a\u000aHotel Fenice et Des Artistes , Campiello Fenice, 1936, 30100 San Marco, Venezia VE, Italy; +39 041 523 2333\u000a\u000aGenerator\u000a\u000aFew hotels can top the views from this hostel. Plum in the middle of Giudecca island, overlooking the city center, from Dorsoduro and the Salute church to St. Mark's Square, its iconic bell tower and the gothic Doge's Palace.\u000a\u000aThere's no need to share a dorm to enjoy them, though; there are five private, ensuite rooms -- at a fraction of the price of a hotel.\u000a\u000aOriginally a grain warehouse, the building has been converted into industrial design-led digs, and touches like exposed brick walls, beamed ceilings and Chesterfield-style armchairs will wipe any bad memories of past dormitory stays.\u000a\u000aOn the plus side, there's the friendliness of a hostel -- especially during the warmer months, when the waterfront outside turns into an unofficial extension of the lobby. There are regular events, including movie screenings, karaoke nights and DJ sets.

aV(CNN) The crisis in Venezuela is a threat to the region and beyond, but military intervention is not a good option, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said Tuesday.\u000a\u000aColombia, which borders Venezuela and has been flooded by people fleeing the economic and political strife there, has refused to recognize the new legislature of President Nicolas Maduro but still hopes there will be a peaceful resolution.\u000a\u000a"The Maduro regime has been shifting towards a dictatorship. I would consider that regime, today, a dictatorship," Santos told CNN's Christiane Amanpour\u000a\u000a"A dictatorship in the middle of Latin America, in a country which is as important as Venezuela, is something very bad for everybody," he said.\u000a\u000a"A military intervention will not be accepted by Colombia or by any other country in Latin America. This is not the way to go about this crisis."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAdvice: Stay away from Twitter\u000a\u000aSantos, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his pact with the FARC guerrillas in Colombia, said behind-the-scenes talks were the best route to success, even in a situation as difficult as dealing with North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un.\u000a\u000a"We think that Twitter is the worst way to manage a good diplomacy and I think that through diplomacy, through dialogue, almost any problem can be solved," he said on "Amanpour."\u000a\u000a"If you start escalating in words then the possibility of escalating in real terms, in military terms, will become a closer possibility and that would be a terrible thing for the world," he said of the current US-North Korean tensions.\u000a\u000a"My advice, and I think the advice of most of the world, is please insist through diplomatic channels, through dialogue. Because insulting each other from one side to the other and escalating the aggressiveness will only have a bad result."\u000a\u000aPope's visit\u000a\u000aSantos will welcome Pope Francis to Colombia this week to celebrate the peace with FARC and a new truce with ELN guerrillas.\u000a\u000a"He comes in the perfect moment to push us, in his own words, for the Colombian society to reconcile, to leave aside 53 years of war, of death, of violence and start working together to construct that peace. He comes in the perfect moment," Santos said of the pope's visit.\u000a\u000aAnd he hoped war is truly over for his nation.\u000a\u000a"The guns are silent now. The guns of the FARC, by far the biggest group, are in the hands of the United Nations. They're going to be converted into three monuments of peace."

aV(CNN) Police in Thailand are investigating the alleged gang rape of a 14-year-old student last year.\u000a\u000aThe victim from Koh Raed, a small island in Thailand's Phang Nga province, first reported the sexual assaults in March, the province's deputy governor Eggarat Leesen told CNN on Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe girl told authorities she was attacked multiple times between May and December of 2016, leading the attorney general of Phang Nga province to indict three suspects, who have since been released on bail.\u000a\u000aLeesen said that in subsequent interviews since her initial report, the victim claimed that up to 40 men were involved in the series of rapes. He added that not all suspected attackers were believed to be from Koh Raed, making it harder for authorities to investigate.\u000a\u000aPolice Maj. Gen. Boonthawee Torraksa told CNN that Phang Nga's provincial police force is overseeing the investigation. He declined to comment on the number of additional suspects the probe is pursuing, citing the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation, but said he did not think there would be 40.\u000a\u000aRead More

aV(CNN) What happens when you ask a group of elementary-school kids how they would teach their children manners if they were the parents? Based on the group of kids we brought together in Atlanta, you get a number of really good ideas. So, parents, listen up!\u000a\u000aKaterina Hoysa, 8, said she would take her kids to a really nice restaurant so they could watch how the other diners behaved. "And they'll see how everyone else is doing it, and they'll start doing it too," Katerina said as part of CNN's video series called "If I Were a Parent," featuring conversations with children.\u000a\u000aFelipe Ramirez-Abrahamsson, 10, said he would teach his kids himself by sitting at a table and showing them how they should put napkins on their laps and keep their mouths closed while eating. And if that didn't work? "I would probably get them a private tutor if I had to do that," he said.\u000a\u000aIf he were looking for someone to work privately with his kids, he might turn to Faye de Muyshondt, founder of socialsklz:-) , which offers private and group programs to teach children and young adults the social skills they need for the playground and the classroom.\u000a\u000aDe Muyshondt came up with the idea for her business, now nearly eight years old, while teaching in the Department of Media, Culture and Communication at New York University.\u000a\u000a"Social interaction and communication skills were just crumbling," said de Muyshondt, a mother of two and author of "Socialsklz:-) for Success: How to Give Children the Skills They Need to Thrive in the Modern World." When she started teaching, she would look at students during lectures. Five years later, she got used to looking at the backs of computer screens. "So, I mean, we have to teach these skills. It's more important than ever to teach these skills. We've got to start with the basics."\u000a\u000aToo many parents either don't teach their kids the basics of manners or try to teach their children at the wrong time, she said. "The big problem is that when parents go about 'teaching' these skills, they're usually in a corrective mode, which is not a teaching moment," de Muyshondt said.\u000a\u000aAdmonishing a child for not looking someone in the eye while shaking their hand or not saying "please" or "thank you" isn't effective, she said. What parents need to do is teach their kids about good manners, help their children practice and then apply the manners to real-world settings.\u000a\u000a"The cool thing about teaching these skills is that every day there's the opportunity to practice," she said. For instance, a parent can teach a child what goes into a greeting and how they need to remember "eyes, smile, body language," and then have them practice it and do it for real.\u000a\u000aDe Muyshondt likes to role-play with students: She'll do one greeting with her head down, no smile and bad body language, and the kids react by saying she seems angry, mad and unhappy. Then she does a version in which she makes eye contact, smiles and uses good body language, and the kids right away view her as happy and nice.\u000a\u000a"It's like this crazy moment of 'I didn't even say anything, and I made an impression on you,' but that has to be taught, and there's no place where kids are learning these skills, which is why I started socialslkz:-) and why this business, this little random idea, turned into a business."\u000a\u000aDe Muyshondt encourages parents to teach kids why good manners, such as saying "please" and "thank you," are important. In some programs, she'll ask students how they would feel if they got her a really thoughtful present that they spent time both finding and wrapping but she didn't say anything when she opened it.\u000a\u000aBy focusing on empathy, thoughtfulness and gratitude, they can see why this is important, she said. As opposed to "you should do this" and "you should do that," it's getting kids to understand why it doesn't feel great to serve someone a meal and not receive a "thank you," for instance.\u000a\u000a"It's just rude," said Ava Lambert, 7, one of the kids we interviewed in Atlanta, when I asked her why it's better to have good manners than to say something such as "Mom, get me this; get me that."\u000a\u000aParents have been complaining about their kids' poor manners for decades, but the lack of manners and etiquette seems to be a bigger concern in an age of helicopter parenting, when parents get overly involved in their children's lives and happiness, de Muyshondt said.\u000a\u000a"There was this wave of parenting ... it being so much about the child that there was an oversight on (the part of) the people around the child and the fact that we don't all operate independently, that we live in a village," she said.\u000a\u000aBy trying to secure our kids' happiness and provide them with the best and most enriched lives, we sort of forgot about the other half of it: that there are other people in the village, she said. "I think that that's had an impact on the way that kids socialize and interact also."\u000a\u000aThough de Muyshondt says that year after year, the problem of kids lacking strong social and communication skills has only gotten worse, she has noticed a recent shift on the part of parents.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Parents are starting to get more on board with, 'Hey ... let's start putting limitations. Let's start bringing good old-fashioned, they call it, manners and etiquette, but bringing that back into the picture,' " she said.\u000a\u000a"Especially with modern technology, it's the skills that you and I maybe picked up by the time we were 10 or 12 years old, are taking longer and longer because there is less face-to-face interaction."

aVJames C. Moore is a business consultant and principal at Big Bend Strategies, a business development firm. He has authored four books on Texas politics and has written and reported on the state's government and history for four decades. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\u000a\u000a(CNN) When the great-named storms surge against the Texas coast, the rising water might stir up a few ghosts. Harvey's landfall , not far from Matagorda Bay, will be an historical reminder of how the state has been shaped by hurricanes and meteorological tragedy.\u000a\u000aAbout midway between Galveston and Corpus Christi, Matagorda Bay became the site of a thriving settlement during America's westward expansion. A port named Indianola , founded in 1846, grew quickly to 5,000 residents, and was a destination point for the Morgan steamer lines of New York City. The town site felt protected from the Gulf of Mexico by barrier islands and its location a few miles inland, and it began to grow and prosper.\u000a\u000aDocks were built to carry a train out to meet ship passengers; four newspapers were publishing the year before the town was incorporated in 1852; German immigrants by the thousands landed at Indianola and moved inland to settle farms; fine places of dining and hotels did bustling business; and in 1869 the world's first mechanically refrigerated shipment of beef went from Indianola to New Orleans.\u000a\u000aAnd then the first hurricane arrived.\u000a\u000aOn September 16, 1875, a storm described by a Kansas paper as "the most severe flood since the days of Noah," destroyed Indianola. The loss of life was never accurately calculated, but the community once described as "The Queen City of the West," was devastated by wind and water.\u000a\u000a"We are destitute, and our town is gone," District Attorney D.W. Curin said in a message pleading for help. "One tenth of the people are gone. Dead bodies are strewn for twenty miles along the bay. Nine tenths of the houses are destroyed. Send us help, for God's sake."\u000a\u000aIndianola rebuilt. But it was doomed to become a victim of its geography . Eleven years later, on August 19, 1886, another hurricane moved into the bay and pushed water with wind and made meaningless all the dreams born on that low, sandy spot. The loss was turned even more profound by a fire caused by a windblown lantern.\u000a\u000aIndianola might have become a great American city had it built a seawall, a lesson which Galveston had not learned when the island was inundated by a 1900 storm. " The Great Galveston Hurricane " killed between 6,000 and 12,000 people and remains the worst natural disaster in American history. The tidal surge was estimated at 15 feet on the back of 145 mph winds, which destroyed 3,600 homes.\u000a\u000aGalveston's weather bureau director at the time, Isaac Cline, had written an 1891 article for the island's daily newspaper to make an argument no seawall was needed because a hurricane of significant strength would never strike the island. Cline has been immortalized in ignominy by Erik Larson's book on the Galveston hurricane, which names the tragedy "Isaac's Storm.\u000a\u000aGiant hurricanes appear attracted by our outsized state. The worst storm ever recorded in the US on the Hurricane Severity Index was Carla, which made landfall in September 1961 at Port O'Connor with a recorded, constant wind speed of 180 mph. Carla made another kind of history when young TV journalist Dan Rather had a camera pointed at a radar screen over his improvised map of the Gulf of Mexico. He showed the cyclone reaching almost from Florida to Texas, and launched his career as a CBS News correspondent with his ingenuity.\u000a\u000aTexans live with these storms and their superlative descriptions and we remember their power. We know Ike and Celia and Allison and Bonnie and Beulah and all the others with their benign and unforgettable names, and we won't forget what they have done to our lives. Our collective sense of helplessness has become more instructive through the years. We tend now toward readiness.\u000a\u000aFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\u000a\u000aIn 1977, I hid out on South Padre Island after it had been ordered evacuated and called in network radio reports from a phone booth as Hurricane Anita made landfall. The exposure led to a TV news career, and a few decades later, I was broadcasting the story of Indianola.\u000a\u000aOur camera showed an historic plaque at the town site, an old cistern, once a source of fresh water, and a concrete piling that had helped hold up the great docks that reached out to meet arriving ships.\u000a\u000aBut what we could not record, or ever communicate, was what might have been.

aVThe federal hearing in the case continues Thursday with a legal showdown that pits the state against the EMW Women's Surgical Clinic. Both sides are trying to determine what does and does not limit a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion.\u000a\u000aThe high-stakes case could determine whether Kentucky becomes the first state in the US without an abortion clinic.\u000a\u000aAfter receiving a notice from the state government last March that the clinic's abortion license was deficient, EMW Women's Surgical Center sued Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and state officials. The hearing began Wednesday.\u000a\u000aWhen EMW Women's Surgical Center initially sued the governor, a federal judge granted the clinic a temporary restraining order so that it could stay open until a judge ruled in the case. If the judge rules to uphold the government's regulations of the clinic, Kentucky will become the first state in the country without an open abortion clinic.\u000a\u000aAccess to abortion is already tenuous in the state. In January, the state legislature passed two new laws regulating abortions: The first made it illegal for women to get abortions at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The second requires women to obtain and view an ultrasound before having an abortion.\u000a\u000aWhile EMW Women's Surgical Center in Louisville is now the sole abortion provider for the state, the other major clinic in neighboring Lexington closed in January after it was also denied an abortion license from the state government.\u000a\u000aAn undue burden\u000a\u000aAttorneys representing the surgical center, including lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood, argued that the state's regulations "impose an undue burden" on a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. These regulations are what the Kentucky government cites as the reason for revoking the clinic's abortion license.\u000a\u000aKentucky requires that abortion clinics have both a transfer agreement with a hospital at a reasonable distance from the clinic and a transport agreement with an ambulance provider in order to obtain a license to provide abortions. This policy has been in place since 1998. EMW Women's Surgical Center has complied with this policy in the past. Its license was initially approved through June 2017. Then, in March, the clinic received a notice from the Kentucky office of the Inspector General informing it that its agreements were "deficient." The letter said the signature on the agreement with the hospital was "not authorized" and did not offer "certainty" that a patient would receive a medically appropriate transfer in case of an emergency.\u000a\u000aAttorney Don Cox, representing EMW Women's Surgical Center, relied heavily on the Supreme Court's 2016 decision in Whole Women's Health vs. Hellerstedt in his argument that the regulations are unconstitutional. In that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that in order for a medical regulation of abortions to be enforced, there needed to be proof that the burden of imposing the regulation outweighed the burden it would impose on a woman's right to have an abortion.\u000a\u000aCox argued that, in this case, the burden of imposing the state's transfer and transport agreements statute far outweighs the benefit to women's health. Cox and other attorneys representing EMW stated there is no evidence, medical or otherwise, that these agreements improve women's health. The agreements, Cox argued, are redundant because federal law requires that emergency rooms and ambulances care for any patient in need.\u000a\u000a"A transfer agreement is something made up out of old cloth in order to try to stop abortions in the state," Cox said after the first day of court adjourned. "It's not a regular kind of medical protocol that is normally used."\u000a\u000aFor women's health\u000a\u000aBevin's attorney, Steve Pitt, argued that the case is not about whether women in Kentucky have the right to an abortion, but whether and to what extent Kentucky has the right to regulate abortion. He claimed the transfer and transport agreements were put in place to keep women safe in the event that complications arise while a woman is being treated at an abortion clinic.\u000a\u000aPitt referenced a district court decision, WMPC vs. Baird, from Ohio in which a federal judge ruled that traveling to another city, including one outside of a woman's home state, in order to have an abortion does not infringe on a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.\u000a\u000aHe used a series of large maps to show that even if EMW Women's Surgical Center closed, women in Kentucky would still have access to abortions in cities in neighboring states. He said the maps showed that there is nowhere in Kentucky where women are not within 200 miles of an abortion facility in another state.\u000a\u000a"In this day and age, even underprivileged people, most of them have iPhones and cars and can get where they need to go," Pitt said in his opening statement.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aLawyers for the clinic countered that for many women, especially underprivileged women or women of a lower socio-economic standing, 200 miles is much too far. For some women, traveling outside of the state or even to a neighboring city adds extra costs of time off from work, childcare and travel expenses, on top of the abortion procedure fee.\u000a\u000a"No court has allowed a state to shirk its constitutional responsibilities by pointing to a neighboring state," ACLU Attorney Brigitte Amiri said after court adjourned Wednesday. "We think it's completely improper for the state of Kentucky to rely on another state to provide care to patients when it's the constitutional duty of this Commonwealth to ensure that abortion facilities are not shut down for medically unjustified reasons."

aV(CNN) Could this slimy, brightly colored orange goo be a real-life version of the "Flubber" from the 1997 film starring Robin Williams?\u000a\u000aNot quite...

aV(CNN) Todd Vance was serving in the US Army when the September 11 attacks occurred.\u000a\u000a"I decided to re-enlist for another three years," he said. "And I asked to be part of the first deployed unit to Iraq."\u000a\u000aVance served as a squad leader and ran more than 250 combat missions before returning to San Diego in 2005.\u000a\u000a"At first, it was all elation. I was just happy to be alive and happy to be out of the military," he said. "Slowly but surely, reality was setting in about what I had seen and what I had done."\u000a\u000aFacing his own battle\u000a\u000aAbout six months after returning home, Vance began encountering his own personal issues.\u000a\u000aTodd Vance joined the Army his junior year of high school and served as a squad leader in Iraq.\u000a\u000a"I turned into a recluse. I was drinking too much. Basically anything that would either produce an extreme adrenaline rush or numb my adrenaline rush and the hypervigilance and anxiety I was having," he said.\u000a\u000aVance went to the Veterans Affairs center for counseling. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and sent home with a shopping bag of medications, including mood enhancers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety meds.\u000a\u000aAlong with drinking, he started abusing the prescriptions he had been given.\u000a\u000a"I'm glad my family ended up telling me I needed to seek professional help," Vance said.\u000a\u000aHe went to therapy and decided to go back to school. But it wasn't until he got involved with mixed martial arts that his life began to change.\u000a\u000a"Martial arts 100% saved my life," he said.\u000a\u000aFighting for veterans at home\u000a\u000aVance, who had been a professional Muay Thai fighter in high school, started training at the local MMA gym.\u000a\u000a"It gave me the structure, the discipline, the camaraderie, the routine that I needed to have in my life that I was missing so much from the military," he said. "Before training, I had no reason not to drink until 3 in the morning. I was training six days a week, often two times a day, and eating clean."\u000a\u000aVance, bottom right, re-enlisted in the Army after the attacks on 9/11.\u000a\u000aVance finished community college and enrolled at Point Loma Nazarene University, where he earned a degree in social work.\u000a\u000a"I realized I had a passion for working with and for military veterans," he said.\u000a\u000aHe decided to pay it forward and start an organization that uses mixed martial arts to help veterans overcome PTSD and other challenges adapting back to civilian life.\u000a\u000a"If a veteran is happy and content with their daily life, they may or may not be drawn to a program like this. But somebody who is facing anxiety and post-traumatic stress and all those different issues, they'll probably be here," he said.\u000a\u000a'Focused on technique and fitness'\u000a\u000aThe program started off as a veteran competition team and became a nonprofit in 2012. Vance called it P.O.W. , short for Pugilistic Offensive Warrior Tactics.\u000a\u000a"It plays on (the term) prisoner of war because when you come home from combat, you're a prisoner of your own personal war," he said.\u000a\u000aIt may seem counterintuitive that a "violent" sport like MMA is helping people cope from the violence of war. Vance disagrees.\u000a\u000a"Martial arts is focused on technique and fitness. ... We have served more than 275 veterans, and all the success stories we have is a testament to the effectiveness of the program," he said. "We see people get right out of the military, they're young, they're a mess, they don't have any employment or social skills. Two or three years later, they are working on their master's degree."\u000a\u000aThe program offers free mixed martial arts classes for veterans three times a week at the Undisputed Downtown gym in San Diego. But it's also group therapy disguised as MMA.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"We offer peer-to-peer coaching, support and counseling," he said. "We're doing a lot of exposure and vulnerability sharing to where they can start to feel normal around a group of people."\u000a\u000aMMA helps veterans stay calm, think critically in stressful situations and move on, Vance said.\u000a\u000a"It helps people that have anxiety and depression and who are dealing with trauma to be present in the moment," he said.\u000a\u000aAt the end of each class, he also incorporates yoga to help the veterans clear their mind and leave with a clean slate.\u000a\u000aVance recently conducted a study of 30 participants over a one-year period. The results showed a 90% improvement in physical health; 80% improvement in coping with stress and symptoms of PTSD; and a 100% improvement in reducing the feelings of isolation.\u000a\u000a'They want to help you do better'\u000a\u000aJoshua Tanida, who takes the martial arts classes, served as an engineer in the US Navy for four years. About six months before he was discharged, he began suffering from depression, low self-esteem and low self-worth.\u000a\u000a"I started losing a lot of drive to do anything," he said. "I just felt distant from everyone. Like nothing really mattered."\u000a\u000aTanida went to the VA for counseling in 2014 and joined the program a year later.\u000a\u000a"They help build you up as a person and build your self-esteem," he said. "They know how you feel firsthand, and they want to help you do better. ... I'm a whole different person than I used to be."\u000a\u000aVance said it's the best feeling to know that he's helping others.\u000a\u000a"It's so therapeutic for me to be able to revisit things that bothered me in the past and to help a younger veteran process that stuff and to get them on track."

aV(CNN) Today's American dad is slightly older -- roughly 3½ years -- than his counterpart from four decades ago, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Human Reproduction. The average age of a father of a newborn in the United States increased from 27.4 years old to 30.9 years old between 1972 and 2015, found Stanford University School of Medicine researchers led by Dr. Michael Eisenberg.\u000a\u000aMen who want to become fathers might want to think about the implications of their choices, Eisenberg suggests.\u000a\u000a"There is data that a man's fertility declines with age," Eisenberg, an assistant professor of urology, wrote in an email. "As such, it may make sense to not wait too long as it may be more difficult to conceive. In addition, there are some potential risks to children."\u000a\u000aMore dads over 40\u000a\u000aEisenberg and his colleagues analyzed 168,867,480 births -- all the live births reported in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System from 1972 to 2015.\u000a\u000aThe system records births and deaths reported by all 50 states and includes parents' self-reported ages, education levels, races and ethnicities.\u000a\u000a"Most data on rising parental ages in the US has been restricted to mothers," Eisenberg wrote, which makes sense because birth certificate data are generally collected from mothers. "We wanted to examine trends in paternal demographics based on the data available on birth certificates since the 1970s."\u000a\u000aOver the study period, the portion of newborns' fathers who are 40 or older doubled from 4.1% to 8.9%. Meanwhile, the proportion of dads who were 50 or older rose from half a percent to nearly one in every 100.\u000a\u000aThe youngest dad for the period studied was just 11 years old, while the oldest was 88.\u000a\u000aAsian-American dads -- in particular, men of Japanese and Vietnamese descent -- were the oldest fathers, the study found. Their ages ranged upward of 36 years old, on average. More years of education also correlated with fatherhood happening at an older age during the 44-year study period. Typically, fathers with college degrees are just over 33 years old.\u000a\u000a"Take home points" noted by Eisenberg included the fact that paternal age in the United States has risen "across all race/ethnicities, educational attainment levels, and regions of the country." That said, some regional differences existed. Northeastern and Western states showed the highest paternal ages on average, the study found.\u000a\u000a"A surprise to me was that more than 10% of birth certificates in the US lack paternal data," Eisenberg said, although the reasons for that aren't clear.\u000a\u000aThough mothers tend to be younger than fathers, "the difference between paternal and maternal age has decreased over time," Eisenberg noted. This suggests that both mothers and fathers of newborns are older today, but the average age of mothers is increasing slightly faster than that of fathers.\u000a\u000a"These demographic trends reflect our society so if men are delaying fatherhood there are likely many implications such as smaller family sizes," he wrote. "Another possible implication is a higher risk of certain diseases which are more prevalent among older fathers."\u000a\u000aOne 2012 study estimated that the male germline -- the genes a father will pass on to his children -- develops two mutations every year; with an advancing average paternal age, inherited mutations in the general population will also rise, noted Eisenberg and his co-authors. Numerous reports have linked older fatherhood with an increased risk of autism, psychiatric illness, neurologic disease such as neurofibromatosis, pediatric cancer and chromosomal abnormalities in children.\u000a\u000a"As such, these trends may suggest that we should be seeing more of these occur in children over time," he said.\u000a\u000aHowever, there are positives when older men become fathers, Eisenberg noted. Generally, they are more likely to be stable, with better jobs and more resources, and perhaps most important, they are more likely to live with their children and help with child-rearing.\u000a\u000aNo need to worry -- yet\u000a\u000aMagdalena Janecka, postdoctoral fellow at the Seaver Autism Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, referred to the new study as "huge" in an email and said it offers "interesting insights into reproductive trends among different ethnicities and across the states." Janecka, who was not involved in the research, published her own study of older dads this year and found that the sons of older dads had, on average, better educational and career prospects.\u000a\u000aOverall, the new study's findings "are in line with the trends observed in other Western countries," Janecka wrote in an email, citing data from the United Kingdom indicating that average paternal age has risen from 30.6 years in 1991 to 33.2 in 2015.\u000a\u000aHowever, the authors' explanation for this upward trend in the ages of fathers, "including increased use of contraception, increased entry of women into the labor force, and longer life expectancy, may not represent an exhaustive list of possible causes for older parental age," Janecka added.\u000a\u000a"Such increase is not just a recent phenomenon," she explained. One historical study found that the average paternal age in 18th- and 19th-century Sweden was 34.37 years, she wrote. "Similarly, in the UK, women's age at motherhood in 1938 was only a year lower than in 2013," with a dip occurring between those years, she said.\u000a\u000aSpeculating about underlying causes for the older ages of dads is difficult, she added, given that the new study does not include information about whether these older average ages resulted from delaying fatherhood or extending it.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to this upward trend in the age of fathers, Janecka does not believe worry is necessary -- at least not yet.\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aAs she sees it, a number of negative outcomes have been reported -- including disorders like achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, and autism -- but there are possible positive results, including higher IQ for the baby, which may occur when men become fathers at older ages, she wrote. "We still do not know to what extent those associations are due to the effects of age itself and to what extent due to age-independent traits of men who decide to delay fatherhood."\u000a\u000aThe role of maternal age with respect to these disorders is also unclear.\u000a\u000a"One clear message" still emerges from the studies to date, Janecka said: "Contribution of paternal age to those disorders/traits is overall negligible and should not influence individuals' decisions about the timing of parenthood."

aVLizzie Porter, CNN \u2022 Updated 25th August 2017\u000a\u000aTyre, Lebanon (CNN) \u2014 On a hot Friday afternoon, the Cloud 59 bar on Tyre's long white sand beach is heaving.\u000a\u000aGroups of friends chink glasses of arak, an aniseed liqueur, and pore over the mezze menu. Waiters -- one sporting trousers printed with Bob Marley's face -- deliver orders to sun-seekers, who lounge on plastic chairs propped in the sand. Offshore, lucky snorkelers spot the sea turtles that swim here.\u000a\u000aThis picturesque summer scene could easily be mistaken for popular holiday hotspots such as Greece or western Turkey. But this is Tyre, in Lebanon, 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital, Beirut, and 16 miles straight up the coast from the closed border with Israel.\u000a\u000aThe city has a long history -- and in 2017 it breaks stereotypes that paint Lebanon as a chaotic nation constantly on the brink of conflict.\u000a\u000aBeach goers crowd a public beach in the southern Lebanese coastal city of Tyre.\u000a\u000a"There is no one that comes to Tyre and doesn't like it, or its atmosphere, or the people who live here," Ahmed Fundi, a city resident, tells CNN. "In the summer, there are lots of parties and the atmosphere is great. Every summer is better than previous ones."\u000a\u000aQueen of the Seas\u000a\u000aTyre is Lebanon's fourth largest city and is sometimes referred to as "Queen of the Seas."\u000a\u000aBehind the city's port, narrow streets are lined with houses painted violet purple and periwinkle blue. Shops are full of fishing paraphernalia -- ropes, replacement hooks, and the like.\u000a\u000aIn the Al-Fanar bar and restaurant, on a wooden platform overhanging the sea, customers in beach cover-ups and swimming shorts drink the local beer, Almaza, and dine on fish and chips, Lebanese-style -- grilled with tartare sauce, lemon and slices of tomato.\u000a\u000aThe Triumphal Arch and palm trees at the Al Bass site in Tyre, Lebanon.\u000a\u000aFounded more than 4,000 years ago, Tyre prospered as one of the main cities of Phoenicia, an ancient Semitic civilization.\u000a\u000aIt grew rich through trade of a vibrant purple dye made from locally harvested murex shells, and formed colonies that remain as cities today: Cadiz in Spain and Carthage in Tunisia.\u000a\u000aWhen the Romans took Tyre -- also known as Sur -- in 64 BC, they built a splendid triumphal arch and one of the world's largest hippodromes.\u000a\u000aScratch marks on the stone, supposedly where chariot riders took a bend too closely, are still visible.\u000a\u000aThese ruins, along with another complex , Al Mina, a kilometer or so away, comprise one of Lebanon's five UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\u000a\u000aThe Al-Mina archaeological site in Tyre, Lebanon.\u000a\u000a"Here we have some of the world's largest and most important Roman ruins in the world," Jalal, one of the site keepers who only wants to give his first name, tells CNN proudly.\u000a\u000aPointing to a large map of Tyre, he gestures to show that there are more ancient ruins lying underneath areas of the city covered by modern construction.\u000a\u000a"We get visitors from France, Belgium, Holland, the UK -- everywhere," says Jalal (as he speaks, some Scandinavians leave the site). "They say: 'If only there could be more archeological excavations here.' We would make the two sites one, and it would be an enormous site."\u000a\u000aAn emerging hotspot\u000a\u000aUp-to-date visitor numbers for Tyre are hard to come by, but Philippe Tabet, owner of two boutique hotels in the city, says business is robust.\u000a\u000aHe opened Dar Alma in March 2015, and Dar Camelia two months ago.\u000a\u000a"Dar Alma is fully booked from April through to the end of September," he tells CNN. "Dar Carmelia is new, but occupancy is already very good."\u000a\u000aFour-fifths of his customers are Lebanese, while the others mostly hail from European countries such as France, Italy and Norway.\u000a\u000a"I have many repeat bookings: some people have already booked now for next summer," Tabet adds.\u000a\u000aLebanese girls ride a jet ski at the beach in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre.\u000a\u000aIn spite of Tabet's buoyant business, Tyre remains a well-kept secret to many outside of Lebanon. Its far from tranquil past may have something to do with this.\u000a\u000aAfter several previous episodes of violence, including the 1975-1990 Lebanese Civil War, the city suffered heavily during the July 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese political party and militia whose members mostly follow the Shi'ite branch of Islam.\u000a\u000aIn 2006, UNESCO issued an urgent appeal to both sides to spare Tyre's Roman ruins from damage, warning that they faced "serious threat" due to the conflict.\u000a\u000aSome foreign ministries, including the US State Department , still advise against travel to Tyre and Lebanon as a whole, citing, "threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping."\u000a\u000aThe British Foreign Office told CNN there are no travel restrictions for Tyre but it recommends citizens closely follow its frequently updated travel advice regarding Lebanon. Similarly, France recommends vigilance but does not advise against travel.\u000a\u000aA statue of the Virgin Mary sits in the fishing port in the Lebanese costal city of Tyre.\u000a\u000aYet Tyre has come a long way since the violence of the latter part of the 20th century and the beginning of this century.\u000a\u000a"I have friends from Beirut who used to be scared of Tyre," says Tabet, the hotel owner, himself from the southern city. "But they discovered it through coming to Dar Alma and they broke the fear."\u000a\u000aHezbollah -- whose name means "Party of God" -- is very much still present in Tyre, where it commands widespread support. Yet this is not always the case elsewhere in Lebanon, especially amongst the country's Christian and Sunni populations.\u000a\u000aTwo of the four city MPs for Tyre are from Hezbollah while the other two are from the Amal party, another Shia political movement and frequent ally in parliament.\u000a\u000aAccording to Tony Badran, a research fellow with expertise in Lebanon and Hezbollah at Washington DC-based think tank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Hezbollah is popular in Tyre as the city is majority Shi'ite.\u000a\u000aTyre also "carries much symbolism for the party in relation to its resistance lore," Badran tells CNN, referring to what Hezbollah sees as its role defending Lebanon against Israel.\u000a\u000aMany outside the city, however, see Hezbollah in more menacing terms.\u000a\u000aIn 2006, militant group Hezbollah fought a war with neighboring Israel, resulting in the deployment of UN forces. Here, a boy lies on the beach in Tyre as Spanish UN troops arrive in the city.\u000a\u000aHezbollah souvenirs\u000a\u000aOn roads into the city, the party's distinctive budgerigar yellow and green flags fly from every lamp post. Beside them are posters emblazoned with the faces of men killed fighting Israel and in Syria . But there is little hostility to visitors in Tyre. For a start, Hezbollah wants you to buy its souvenirs.\u000a\u000aSouk vendors sell snap-band bracelets and keyrings adorned with the face of Hezbollah's bearded Secretary-General, Hassan Nasrallah.\u000a\u000aThe organization's flags are available to purchase alongside those of FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, the popular Spanish soccer teams beloved across the Middle East.\u000a\u000aOne seller shows off his CD collection: Religious anthems, Nasrallah speeches, and one new album of songs devoted to Hezbollah's latest military action on the Syria-Lebanon border.\u000a\u000aMixing and mingling\u000a\u000aIt might seem odd that a city where the Islamist Hezbollah has widespread public support and political power also serves as a summer beach party hotspot. Alcohol is freely available, and women walk on the public beach in skimpy bikinis.\u000a\u000a"There are Christians, Sunnis, and Shi'ites in Tyre and there aren't problems between them," insists Jalal, the archeological site keeper.\u000a\u000aThe yellow and green flag of political party and militant group Hezbollah (right) for sale at a stall in Tyre alongside those of soccer clubs FC Barcelona and Real Madrid.\u000a\u000aZouheir Halawi opened Tavolino pub in the winding streets behind Tyre's port four years ago. It resembles a Spanish taverna: chairs sit beneath a low stone arched roof, and jars of olives line the bar.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to do a proper pub, not a restaurant-bar or similar. I don't have problems selling alcohol here," he tells CNN, citing the city's mixed population, made up of Christians, Shia and Sunni Muslims.\u000a\u000aTestimony to that is the crowd in his pub one Thursday night -- a group of friends of different sects all of whom are drinking and smoking.\u000a\u000a"Everyone comes here, even the snobs I ran away from in Beirut," continues Zouheir. "You have the easy life in Tyre, and it is as calm as you make it."\u000a\u000aThat is not to say that there haven't been tensions. In 2012 -- before Tavolino's launch -- a series of bomb attacks in the city appeared to target shops selling alcohol, according to Reuters reports from the time.\u000a\u000aLenbanese Army soldiers secure the entrance of the restaurant which was rocked by an explosion early December 28, 2011 in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre.\u000a\u000aTyre on the rise\u000a\u000aToday, however, Zouheir is more concerned about an influx of wealthy Lebanese and foreigners driving up prices and gentrifying Tyre.\u000a\u000a"From a business point of view, it is good, but from a personal point of view, it isn't. This is a Mediterranean city and it needs to be authentic."\u000a\u000aTyre's boutique hotels already do not come cheap: a suite at Dar Alma costs $330 a night.\u000a\u000aA quiet residential area of Tyre, Lebanon.\u000a\u000aTabet responds to fears about gentrification with the belief that wealthy visitors bring money into Tyre.\u000a\u000a"The hotels are expensive on purpose, to bring in a high-end clientele, who spend money in the city -- I didn't want a mass market hotel," he says.\u000a\u000aWith accommodation dear, Tyre's 4-kilometer-long free, public beach becomes all the more precious. Beaches without entrance fees are a rarity in Lebanon. Families from all walks of life jump in the warm waves and shelter from the heat under parasols.

aVMumbai, India (CNN) Hidden in the back alleys of a bustling Mumbai neighborhood lies an Art Deco masterpiece with a colorful history.\u000a\u000aThe Liberty Cinema symbolizes a unique architectural amalgamation known as "Bombay Deco." Dating back to the year of Indian independence, 1947, the building also represents the rising aspirations of a nation.\u000a\u000a"It's a statement to the Indian people that no theater can be too good for them and no screen too good for Indian pictures," reads a Liberty brochure from 1949, a time when most elite cinemas in Bombay only showed Hollywood movies.\u000a\u000aThe 1,200-seat, single-screen movie theater was one of the last buildings to be constructed in the Art Deco architectural style. Mumbai is widely believed to have the second largest collection of Art Deco buildings in the world\u000a\u000aBut the city's Art Deco heritage is under threat, according to Atul Kumar, founder of the not-for-profit conservation organization Art Deco Mumbai.\u000a\u000a"In the face of rising real estate prices, the Art Deco legacy of Mumbai is at a real risk of being lost forever," he said in a phone interview.\u000a\u000aA cosmopolitan collection\u000a\u000aThe origins of Art Deco in Mumbai (which was officially known as Bombay before 1995) can be traced back to the period between the two world wars.\u000a\u000aDuring an era of relative prosperity and cosmopolitanism in India, a rising middle class found that it had the means to commission its own architecture.\u000a\u000aTaking influence from Paris, Miami, New York and Los Angeles, Bombay Deco put an Indian twist on a well-known style. And it was all made possible by new construction materials, according to Mustansir Dalvi, professor of architecture at the Sir JJ School of Art.\u000a\u000aBack of the Oval\u000a\u000a"You get an expression that is possible only with concrete," he said in a phone interview. "Wood horizontals, flat roofs, cantilevered balconies, smooth corners -- it is the materials that allows you to develop architecture that is quite unique."\u000a\u000aMost Bombay Deco architects were Indian, though they had often traveled to Europe and America. While many of their buildings were created in a classic Art Deco style, some incorporated traditional Indian motifs that made them distinct.\u000a\u000a"The Lakshmi Insurance Building is emblematic of Indian-ness in Art Deco," Dalvi said. "It has a statue of (Indian goddess) Lakshmi on top, and elephants on the facade. You also see murals showing Indian life, (while) depictions of labor can be seen in several places in Mumbai."\u000a\u000aConservation efforts\u000a\u000aIn Mumbai, conservation efforts often overlook Bombay Deco in favor of Victorian-era buildings, which are usually larger and grander in stature.\u000a\u000a"People are filled with regret when we tell them of the incredible histories behind these buildings," said Kumar, whose organization offers architectural walking tours. "They wish they'd known of the buildings' value earlier, so they could have better protected them."\u000a\u000aLotus Court\u000a\u000aHaving been involved in conservation advocacy for over a decade, Kumar contributed to a recently approved proposal to include Bombay Deco among India's nominations for UNESCO world heritage status. Kumar has also launched an online inventory that he claims is the first attempt to comprehensively catalog the city's Art Deco buildings.\u000a\u000aIn one Mumbai neighborhood, 53 examples were recorded in an area smaller than one square mile. And this is "just the tip of the iceberg," Kumar claimed.\u000a\u000a"There are even areas outside the proposed World Heritage Site that have a large number of vintage Art Deco buildings," he added.\u000a\u000aPreserving the city's essence\u000a\u000aMany of Mumbai's remaining Art Deco masterpieces have survived against the odds. Having become obsolete in the multiplex era, the Liberty Cinema was at the brink of shutting before extensive renovations were carried out in 2012.\u000a\u000aIt is now a cultural space hosting a range of events, from theater performances to one of South Asia's largest LGBT film festivals. But the future of the cinema remains uncertain, according its owner Nazir Hoosein.\u000a\u000a"In the eyes of the government, we might as well be an auditorium with bare walls," he said in a phone interview. "They don't see the magnificent heritage of this cinema."\u000a\u000aAmid lax conservation laws and growing demand for land in India's most populous city, conserving Mumbai's architectural heritage may seem like a futile enterprise. But for Bombay Deco enthusiasts like Dalvi, it is the only way to preserve the city's essence.\u000a\u000a"Art Deco is, in many ways, a depiction of cosmopolitan Bombay," he said.\u000a\u000a"These buildings collectively form the urban fabric of the city. Transforming them into multi-story towers would be a destruction of that fabric -- and a destruction of that Bombay."

aVExactly two weeks after Harvey made landfall on the Texas coast, most of downtown Houston is dry and life is starting to return to normal. But the damage there and in surrounding cities is still being assessed.\u000a\u000aHarvey came ashore August 25 as a Category 4 hurricane with high winds and a destructive storm surge. After it moved slightly inland, it swirled in place over southeast Texas for a few days, dropping record-shattering rain and flooding several areas.\u000a\u000aThe storm and subsequent flooding left more than 70 people dead and ravaged nearly 300 miles of the Texas coast and parts of Louisiana, flooding homes and displacing more than a million people. More than 21,000 people remain in shelters Friday, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety's situation report.\u000a\u000aAll told, the storm caused an estimated $75 billion in damage, officials said, making it one of the most expensive natural disasters on record.\u000a\u000aSome homes and buildings still sit underwater. In Harris and Fort Bend Counties, the US Army Corps of Engineers has begun releasing water from the Addicks and Barker dams to help the swollen Buffalo Bayou recede within its banks. If it rains again before the dams are empty, the Corps warns there's still a threat of more flooding downstream.\u000a\u000aIn Beaumont, southeast of Houston, many residents wait in lines to get water, food and supplies such as diapers and baby wipes. The trail of cars stretches out for a couple of miles each day from several places distributing resources.\u000a\u000aStill in 'rescue, recovery' mode\u000a\u000a"We are still in a rescue/recovery. Probably a 25% rescue; 75% recovery," said Maj. Roy Williams, the incident commander for the Salvation Army's response team in Texas' Golden Triangle -- made up of hard-hit Beaumont, Port Arthur and Orange. "There's still people who -- the water has not come down and they have either not gotten back to their house or they are still in their house."\u000a\u000aThe Department of Public Safety reported that, as of Friday, 122,331 people were rescued or evacuated after Harvey, along with 5,234 pets.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Widow determined to stay in hurricane-hit home Replay More Videos ...

While the plants are being fixed, officials await new tests to make sure the water is safe to drink.\u000a\u000aInterstate 10 is open in East Texas, but the evidence of Harvey's passage can be seen from the highway just east of Beaumont. In Rose City at an RV park, several recreational vehicles appear to be parked in a lake at random angles, and one is tossed on its side. The water is still up to the roofs of some cars.\u000a\u000aTrailers in an RV park sit in floodwaters from Tiger Creek in Rose City on September 6.\u000a\u000aNo place to stay, no work\u000a\u000aChris Jones and his wife drove his large pickup truck through the water to recover what they could from his RV. The vehicle is a total loss and while he has insurance, his hopes aren't high. "I'll never get what I paid for it," Jones said, noting that over time he'd filled it with plenty of things that can't be replaced.\u000a\u000aThe RV serves as his home away from his Dallas-area home while he works as a foreman at a refinery. Without any affordable hotels for two hours in either direction, he says he'll have to buy another RV. But after rescuing his boat and kayaks from the floodwaters, he and his wife began the drive home. No RV means he can't work -- just one example of the economic impact of Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Harvey photographer: Victims were in disbelief Replay More Videos ...

The hope is to get in front of the mildew and mold already blooming and acrid in the humid Texas heat. Across the region, driveways, front lawns and curbs are covered with what was once inside homes. In Houston, the city has brought in large trucks and other equipment to begin clearing the streets of residential debris.\u000a\u000aDebris from flooded homes is piled outside in Lakewood near the home of Daniela Alvarado and Leonardo Aguirre.\u000a\u000aDaniela Alvarado and Leonardo Aguirre live in one of these hard-hit Houston areas. For them, the flooding was a family affair. Nine of their family members' homes are also in their Lakewood neighborhood in northeast Houston and all had some level of flooding. The damage to their home is much worse than they expected. Aguirre has lived here since 1991. He remembers Hurricane Allison in 2001 but says Harvey was much worse. Still, the couple and their two children plan to stay put.\u000a\u000a"We are buying the house. I mean we are practically almost done paying it. We can't just go somewhere else and start all over. I mean there's something here, I think, to rebuild. So we are going to try again," Aguirre said. This, after the family just finished remodeling about 90% of their house within the last three months.\u000a\u000aIf another hurricane heads their way, the couple says they would make some different choices. "I think I would just try to evacuate because putting my kids at risk and all of the things that we had to do just to get out of here, I wouldn't want to go through that again. I mean it was a scary sight," Aguirre said.\u000a\u000aAnother threat: mosquitoes\u000a\u000aMosquitoes pose another threat, with all the standing water providing the perfect breeding ground for the bugs that can carry Zika or the West Nile virus.

aV(CNN) If anyone has suggested adding a little water to your whiskey, you may want to give it a try. Rather than watering it down, the addition may act as a flavor enhancement, and we now know the science behind it , thanks to a new study .\u000a\u000aThe combination is a bit counterintuitive, which is part of the reason researchers wanted to look at the molecular chemistry behind what's happening in your whiskey glass.\u000a\u000aOn the surface, whiskey seems simple: It's mostly grain and water that goes through a specific process. But from a chemistry standpoint, whiskey includes a complex variety of molecules that contribute to its unique taste. One of those is the compound guaiacol, which lends itself to the smokiness associated with some whiskeys.\u000a\u000aGuaiacol is the molecule that two researchers from the Linnaeus University Center for Biomaterials Chemistry in Sweden focused on for their study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.\u000a\u000aThe researchers looked at both bottled and cask-strength whiskey. Bottled whiskey has been diluted to about 40% alcohol by volume, down from 70% after distilling. Cask whiskey is stronger, at about 55% to 65% alcohol by volume, even if some alcohol evaporates as it matures in barrels for at least three years.\u000a\u000aWhat they discovered is that guaiacol is most present at the surface of diluted whiskey, which is why whiskey with added water tastes better: The taste molecules are at the top of your glass.\u000a\u000a"From a molecular perspective, water and alcohol don't completely mix," co-author Ran Friedman wrote in an email. "Instead, we have clusters of water molecules and clusters of alcohol molecules. When whisky is diluted, the alcohol is driven to the surface, and many of the taste molecules follow it because they like to be in a slightly less aqueous environment. The taste that we experience is therefore enhanced -- but there's a limit. If we dilute the whisky too much the concentration of the taste compounds is reduced and the drink will be meager."\u000a\u000aIn higher-alcohol whiskey, the flavor is different because the taste molecules aren't reacting to the presence of water.\u000a\u000a"The most interesting finding was that at high alcohol by volume concentrations -- 59% and up, cask-strength whisky -- the taste compound was surrounded by ethanol molecules in the solution," Friedman wrote.\u000a\u000aFriedman and colleague Bjorn Karlsson didn't discover this through taste, although both like whiskey, but by using computer simulations of the molecules.\u000a\u000a"They enable us to follow on chemical processes as if we're watching a molecular movie. We usually work on problems that have something to do with biology or human health, but at some point got interested in understanding why dilution affects the taste of whisky," Friedman said.\u000a\u000aThe researchers believe their findings can be applied to other aged spirits, like brandy, rum and tequila, because they have similar solutions, taste compounds and alcohol by volume.\u000a\u000aThough they didn't drink any whiskey during the study, the two researchers enjoy traditional Swedish snaps (what we might call schnapps), ice-cold and undiluted.\u000a\u000a"We believe that the principles we describe are true for a long list of taste compounds," Friedman said. "In that case, one can find an optimal alcohol content for a spirit to taste best for many drinkers. The conclusions may also apply for the food industry, as some extracts that are used in the industry are stored in diluted alcohol solutions."\u000a\u000aWhiskey expert: 'Feel the Kentucky hug'\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to whiskey and how best to enjoy it, it can be a very personal choice.\u000a\u000aAs a mixologist, Rod Weaver likes to offer a pour of bourbon or rye whiskey in two ways: neat and over ice.\u000a\u000a"This approach allows the drinker to compare the two; one room temp, and the other throughout the natural dilution as the ice melts over time," Weaver wrote in an email. "There will be considerable change as it 'opens up.' This can also happen with oxidation."\u000a\u000aBut as a whiskey lover, he recommends becoming acquainted with the type of whiskey "just the way the maker intended" before changing it in any way, whether it's "a 10-year plus, non-chill filtered, barrel-proof 'Haz-Mat' (over 140 proof) face-melting monster, or a 6-month-young local and grainy infant" whiskey.\u000a\u000aHe believes that Scots were most likely the first to dilute their whiskey in the glass, while blenders and distillers of whiskey decide how much to dilute their products individually.\u000a\u000a"But the best way to taste bourbon is hot, straight out the bottle," Weaver said. "Chew it around your mouth, swallow, and feel the Kentucky hug."\u000a\u000aLeNell Camacho Santa Ana, owner of LeNell's Beverage Boutique in Alabama, tells people to drink whiskey however they like it best. She isn't one to say there's a "proper" way to drink.\u000a\u000aShe used to sell her own brand of whiskey called Red Hook Rye, and included a formula for how to add water to reduce proof in the packaging of her barrels. The formula comes from Chuck Cowdery's book "Bourbon, Straight."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Divide the proof you have by the proof you want and subtract one," she wrote in an email. "Multiply that number by the amount of whiskey you want to dilute and the result will be the amount of water to add. For example, to reduce 2 ounces of 135 proof whiskey to 100 proof, divide 135 by 100 and subtract one. Multiply that number by 2 ounces. You add 0.7 ounces water to 2 ounces Red Hook Rye to make it 100 proof.\u000a\u000a"The only time I do highly recommend adding water is when drinking a cask-strength whiskey, a whiskey that has been bottled straight from the barrel to the bottle without addition of water," she said. "Those high proofs are fine for a sip to taste the power of the spirit; however, if you drink barrel-proof whiskeys, the strength could damage the lining of your esophagus, besides the fact you may end up with a nasty hangover."

aVYet picking your next plastic surgeon on Instagram can bring some serious health risks if that surgeon is not board-certified, according to a pilot study published Wednesday in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal\u000a\u000aOnly 17.8% of plastic surgery-related Instagram posts in the United States and Canada might come from board-certified plastic surgeons, according to the study, which analyzed posts uploaded on a single day in January.\u000a\u000aThe majority of the posts were from physicians not trained in plastic surgery or professionals who were not even licensed physicians, such as dentists or spa aestheticians, said senior study author Dr. Clark Schierle, a board-certified Northwestern Medicine plastic surgeon and faculty member at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\u000a\u000a"Finding your surgeon on Instagram isn't necessarily a problem," Schierle said, adding that his own practice has accounts on Instagram and other social media sites.\u000a\u000aRather, a public health problem can arise when non-certified professionals market invasive procedures on the social media app and prospective patients may not ensure that the person behind the marketing is board-certified for that surgery, he said.\u000a\u000aTo be certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, a physician must have at least five years of approved surgical training, including a residency in plastic surgery, and must pass comprehensive written and oral exams in plastic surgery, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery\u000a\u000aCertification is a voluntary credential, but by choosing a board-certified plastic surgeon, patients can be assured that the surgeon completed at least five years of additional training as a resident surgeon and graduated from an accredited medical school, according to the board\u000a\u000aThe Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada also follows a similar process for certification\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED When plastic surgery goes wrong Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH When plastic surgery goes wrong 04:40\u000a\u000a"We've all heard these headlines in recent years of some terrible things that have happened in association with surgery that was not being done in the safest possible manner," Schierle said.\u000a\u000aAs for those on Instagram, "some of these are doctors practicing outside of their scope of practice. Some of these are non-physicians just doing crazy stuff, like injecting silicone building material from Home Depot into people's bodies without a medical license," Schierle said. "These days, with the Internet and social media, these people have more of a voice and more opportunity for horizontal information transmission than ever before."\u000a\u000a'Social media takes it to yet another level'\u000a\u000aThe new study involved more than 1 million Instagram posts that were uploaded January 9. Each included at least one of 21 plastic surgery-related hashtags such as #plasticsurgery, #plasticsurgeon, #breastlift or #nosejob.\u000a\u000aOn Instagram, hashtags help aggregate and categorize uploaded photos or videos that fall within similar categories of content. Additionally, a consumer might search for a hashtag -- such as #facelift -- to find a surgeon.\u000a\u000aAmong the hashtags in the study, "the use of colloquial or layperson terminology for cosmetic surgical procedures seems to be much more popular than the use of technical terminology," Schierle said, such as #tummytuck over #abdominoplasty.\u000a\u000aThe researchers analyzed the Instagram posts to find the top nine associated with each of the 21 hashtags, and they recorded data on who did the posting, referring to the Instagram profile associated with each post.\u000a\u000a"The Instagram app itself automatically categorizes the top nine posts. Whenever you do a given search, the first nine results that show up are identified as top posts," Schierle said. "The top nine are based on how many followers the person has and how many likes the particular post has."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Surgeon: 'Pumping parties' major gamble Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Surgeon: 'Pumping parties' major gamble 04:03\u000a\u000aThe researchers wrote that the online presence of surgeons who are not board-certified in plastic and reconstructive surgery in the US and Canada often comes at the expense of patient safety and dangerous outcomes.\u000a\u000aGlobally, the majority of the top posts for each hashtag came from surgeons outside the United States, including Turkey, Russia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and the United Arab Emirates, the researchers found. However, those posts were not analyzed to determine the poster's board certification status.\u000a\u000aPlastic surgeons have long warned against traveling internationally for unsafe plastic surgeries, and Schierle said he has corrected some botched procedures from overseas among his own patients. Now, however, consumers should be warned of unsafe procedures being promoted on social media, he said.\u000a\u000a"Social media takes it to yet another level in terms of the impact that people can have and how rapidly they're able to kind of establish themselves as something that they may or may not actually be," Schierle said.\u000a\u000aStill, the new study comes with limitations, including that it involved only one day's worth of Instagram data -- all the posts were from January 9 -- and that the data were pulled from a single social media platform.\u000a\u000a"The study was well-designed but serves only as a snapshot of an ever-expanding problem in the field," said Dr. Wright Jones, a board-certified surgeon in Atlanta and founder of Muse Plastic Surgery, who was not involved in the study.\u000a\u000aThe researchers plan to conduct followup studies over a longer time period and across an array of social media platforms, including Snapchat, Schierle said.\u000a\u000a"More data need to be collected in terms of seasonality, how cyclical the data are, as well as the overall trend," he said. All in all, the study reveals that the underrepresentation of board-certified plastic surgeons among the top posts on Instagram should be something for potential patients to be aware of, he said.\u000a\u000aTips for finding a plastic surgeon, and questions to ask\u000a\u000a"Instagram has become a convenient way for patients to see a surgeon's work and get a sense of the types of procedures being performed," Jones said.\u000a\u000a"It is quickly becoming a go-to source for millennials," he added. "In today's society, patients want to get to know the surgeon before ever stepping foot into the office."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Are selfies causing people to go under the knife?

He added that he routinely lectures plastic surgeons at national and regional meetings about the usefulness and advantages of social media.\u000a\u000a"Some physicians have specific information in his or her bio. However, many non-board-certified plastic surgeons are not forthcoming about specific training," Schulman said.\u000a\u000a"Some may be outright deceitful, but most deceive by omission. Being a board-certified plastic surgeon takes many years of training, examinations, certifications, and is something to be proud of," he said.

aV(CNN) It could be one of the feel-good stories of Rio 2016 -- a tiny island nation triumphs on the world's biggest sporting stage to win its first Olympic medal.\u000a\u000aFiji is favorite to claim gold in the men's rugby sevens tournament, which starts Tuesday, having overcome financial problems and the loss of leading players to win back-to-back world titles.\u000a\u000aSuch a result would, according to Brett Gosper, the head of World Rugby, be "the fairytale result -- a story that transcends the sport."\u000a\u000aBut not everything is rosy with rugby in the Pacific Islands. Neither Samoa, a one-time powerhouse of the sevens format, nor Tonga have qualified teams for Rio.\u000a\u000aAnd the three rugby-proud nations are losing top talent to an increasing number of tier-one teams -- an age-old problem -- with many stories of players then being blocked from playing for their countries by their club employers.\u000a\u000aThe body representing the players has heard stories of players being left stranded without visas in their new countries, or else left with sizable tax bills, unaware of the contracts they had signed.\u000a\u000aThe great rugby rip-off?\u000a\u000aEnglish clubs sign many Samoan players such as Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu.\u000a\u000aEliota Fuimaono-Sapolu represented Samao on 23 occasions and had a lengthy professional career in England with Bath and Gloucester. Having returned to Samoa, he is increasingly concerned about the plight of Pacific Island players.\u000a\u000a"Everyone comes here to take players but they don't give back," he explains. "When they take players, they don't then get to play for their countries. It's take, take, take. Everyone is trying to rip everyone off.\u000a\u000a"You hear stories of dudes just stranded in France with no money to get home. It's hard because a lot of these boys have never left the island, so to grasp the concept of money and contracts is difficult. These are complex 30-page documents for guys that barely speak English, so people can rip them off and dump them."\u000a\u000aWorld Rugby rules stipulate the players at clubs across the globe must be released to play for their countries in the international window, but Fuimaono-Sapolu says he knows of a litany of instances where players have effectively been blocked from doing that by their clubs.\u000a\u000aPacific Island teams also suffer when players from countries such as Samoa or Fiji acquire dual citizenship and represent their adopted nations -- meaning they are no longer eligible for their homeland.\u000a\u000a"There are players that can't play for the country of their birth as they've played one minute for New Zealand Sevens," Fuimaono-Sapolu says.\u000a\u000a"These rules are contrary to simple UN human rights. I've seen contracts where locals only get a contract if they agree not to play for Samoa. We're just cannon fodder."\u000a\u000a'Regulation nine'\u000a\u000aWorld Rugby invested £26.8 million ($35 million) into the three unions in the four years leading up to the 2015 World Cup and held its first committee meeting of Bill Beaumont's current presidency in Fiji this year. In addition, the ruling body is looking at introducing a Fijian team in Australia's National Rugby Championship.\u000a\u000aWhile CEO Gosper admits there are "challenges," he is confident World Rugby is moving in the right direction in the region.\u000a\u000aSpeaking in Rio de Janeiro on the eve of sevens making its Olympic debut, he said: "You want to make sure you're optimizing that region as best you can, that your high-performance programs are as they should do, that you keep players in the country the best way you can and for as long as you can, and ensure that those players come back to play for their country.\u000a\u000a"We police that as strongly as you can, and some things happen that we can't control in ensuing that regulation nine (the rule that stipulates clubs must release players to represent their country) is respected. We're continuing to think about and invest in the region."\u000a\u000aMinimum wage\u000a\u000aSamoa won May's Paris Sevens title but lost in the final of the Olympic repechage qualifier.\u000a\u000aThe exodus of players has had a direct impact on Samoa's sevens program, in particular. Census figures show that nearly as many Samoans now live in New Zealand than on their home island.\u000a\u000aThe team's English coach Damian McGrath built up a squad of 16 players last season, but will be forced to start from scratch for the 2016-17 Sevens World Series.\u000a\u000a"We'll start the season with just three guys from last year's squad," he says, "and that's because the others have gone overseas and some not necessarily to play professional rugby.\u000a\u000a"Five of our players have moved to New Zealand just to work and play for local clubs. It's not about professional rugby for them, it's something that gives them a lifestyle."\u000a\u000aThe lure of moving abroad is obvious. In Fiji, the minimum wage is just FJD $2.32 ($1.12) per hour whereas in Australia and New Zealand the earning potential is infinitely higher.\u000a\u000a'Every man for himself'\u000a\u000aAkapusi Qera in action for Fiji at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\u000a\u000aThe club-versus-country row is arguably the biggest issue, though, facing the Pacific Islands.\u000a\u000aAkapusi Qera has twice turned down the opportunity to represent his country for the good of his club career -- the second time was at the expense of the Fijian captaincy.\u000a\u000a"I decided not to play for my country and that didn't go down well back at home," he says from his home in the south of France. "People talk crap about it but, at the end of the day, it's every man for himself.\u000a\u000a"You're so proud to play for your country and you have to take tough decisions along the way because of family. It's a very difficult decision, one of the most difficult decisions you will ever have to do."\u000a\u000aQera first withdrew from Fiji's northern hemisphere tour in November 2012 in order to focus on playing for Gloucester in what he described as "a series of important games coming up." He was captain for the 2015 World Cup but made himself unavailable for June's home internationals.\u000a\u000aPlayers will often have to pay their own way to fly back home to represent their countries, with no funds from the national unions. When coach Ben Ryan took over Fiji's sevens team in 2013, he was not paid for four months due to his employer's financial problems.\u000a\u000aRepresenting the players\u000a\u000aFormer NZ Sevens star Josh Blackie now works for the International Rugby Players' Association.\u000a\u000aQera's other gripe is that Pacific Island players get treated differently by clubs.\u000a\u000a"Take the England or France boys," he says. "When they come back from their Tests, they get days off but the island boys always go straight back in. There's never any time off. That's just bad for player welfare.\u000a\u000a"As professional rugby players, we deserve to be treated the same. These are the things World Rugby needs to hear. They need to know about the difficulties going on. I'm just grateful for Josh Blackie and his team for helping and now there are players' associations set up in the islands. That's a big plus moving forward. I hope this will change things."\u000a\u000aFormer NZ Sevens representative Blackie works for the International Rugby Players' Association (IRPA), which also incorporates the Pacific Islands Players' Association (PIPA).\u000a\u000aAccording to the IRPA calculations, 16% of all professional rugby players on the planet are of Pacific Island descent. His organization represents 350 players from the region, and in the past few months has put a player development officer in Fiji.\u000a\u000aFiji's sevens team trains during its Olympic selection camp.\u000a\u000a"It might be if a player hasn't sought independent advice or a club is exploiting a player for whatever reason, or they've been sold a good story," Blackie says. "For us, the key is to get the key messages across early on in terms of tax, budget, how to handle themselves publicly, on social media.\u000a\u000a"Sure, there are horror stories but we're working hard and taking a positive approach from the start rather than dealing with the train wreck at the end. And sometimes we're like an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff if players make an error or something else goes wrong.\u000a\u000a"We have examples of players going to a club and doing everything for it, sometimes to the detriment of playing for their national union. World Rugby have relations in place to protect the smaller islands and nations for player release.\u000a\u000a"There's certainly a lot of work to be done to ensure that the Pacific Islands have access to the players to use them when they need them. No one has a magic bullet at the moment, that's the reality and it's a challenge."\u000a\u000aFuture solutions?\u000a\u000aSeilala Mapusua was Samoa's vice-captain at the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\u000a\u000aMany Pacific Island players either in the twilight of their career or now retired have been working with Blackie and PIPA in a bid to help improve the game in the region and also relieve the plight of the players.\u000a\u000aThe visit of the world champion All Blacks to Samoa in 2015 gave the sport a massive boost, while New Zealand provincial teams the Chiefs and Crusaders contested a Super Rugby competition match in Fiji.\u000a\u000aFormer Samoa international Seilala Mapusua is one of those liaising with Blackie, looking for answers to the problem.\u000a\u000a"I've asked myself the same questions throughout my career -- how to solve it. What can be done to improve it?" he says.\u000a\u000a"I really don't know what the answers are, maybe some form of shared revenue when Samoa plays to a sell-out crowd at Twickenham, almost as an act of good faith. I know the home nation isn't obliged to. Getting the All Blacks to Samoa last year was absolutely huge. Hopefully that can encourage other top tier nations to come over.\u000a\u000aAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen was made an honorary High Chief Of Vaiala on the 2015 visit to Samoa.\u000a\u000a"It feels like things are slowly heading in the right direction. The buzz from the All Blacks was huge, likewise the Super Rugby game, and Samoa made the game competitive. It shows if given the chance we're not too far behind.\u000a\u000a"But there are still issues. You get boys withdraw from tours all the time and you never hear them say 'the club wanted me to stay' as clubs have to release them for international duty -- but everyone knows it's happening.\u000a\u000a"Players are caught between a rock and a hard place. Everyone wants to represent their country, that's the pinnacle for a professional rugby player."\u000a\u000aClub vs. country\u000a\u000aHale T-Pole (left) in action for Tonga against Namibia at the 2015 World Cup.\u000a\u000aThe recurring theme appears to be the difficulty in getting players released to play for their country and thereby give the Pacific Island nations the best chance possible to shine on the global stage.\u000a\u000aFormer Tonga international Hale T. Pole wants players to stand up more strongly on the issue.\u000a\u000a"I didn't care if the club were going to sack me to not," he says. "So I never had a problem on playing for my country as I stayed firm.\u000a\u000a"That's supposed to be law that they have to release you, but some clubs beat players down on that. It didn't happen to me but I've seen it firsthand, players not getting released from their clubs. The clubs would try to bend the rules without saying 'you have to stay.'"\u000a\u000aTonga has not played a home international since 2009, something that Pole describes as "unheard of" -- but he believes rugby authorities are addressing the issue.\u000a\u000a"I know Tongans are quick to judge World Rugby," he adds. "But World Rugby have done their best. We're all trying to do our best but, right now, I feel a bit lost."\u000a\u000aThe sense is that things are slowly changing. If Fiji wins gold in Rio on Thursday, the ripple effect could provide benefits for the wider region.

aVKelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter @kellywallacetv.\u000a\u000a(CNN) What happens when you bring a group of sixth-graders together to meet -- for the first time -- someone who is transgender? You get an easy and honest conversation that speaks volumes about how we can talk to our kids about gender and how much we can learn from their openness.\u000a\u000a"What gender do you think I am?" Hennessy asked 11 sixth-graders in New York Citywho are members of SheKnows' unique Hatch program , which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation. The program is in its fourth year.\u000a\u000aThere is silence for a second, and then one girl says "male" and another says, "I heard earlier that you were transgender."\u000a\u000aHennessy, an actor in New York City and co-host of the podcast " Kill Me Now" with comedian Judy Gold, says they are both right.\u000a\u000a"I'm a transgender male," he says.\u000a\u000aAnd then the questions begin. "When did you first realize you were transgender?" a boy asks before the conversation turns to terms the kids may or may not have heard before: transgender, agender (when you don't identify as male or female), gender fluid (you feel more masculine one day, more feminine the next) and sexual orientation.\u000a\u000a'Don't treat it like a gross, icky ... thing'\u000a\u000aHennessy hopes the new video of the Hatch workshop, released Thursday, will be seen by children and parents across the country and lead to more understanding about people like himself who are born with reproductive organs that do not match their gender identity.\u000a\u000a"If you don't treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing, they don't treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing," Hennessy said in an interview. When kids as young as 4 or 5 years old use female pronouns when they meet him, he tells them, "Oh, no, I'm a boy," at which point they often ask, "What, you're a boy?"\u000a\u000aHe then explains to them what being transgender is. "And boom, they get it right away," he said.\u000a\u000aMaverick, 12, knew what transgender was before taking part in the Hatch workshop. His mom is a sexuality educator who has been talking to him about sexuality and gender since birth. But he had never met anyone who was transgender until Hennessy.\u000a\u000a"I thought it was a very powerful experience for me," Maverick said. "I'm not sure about other kids, but I think meeting a transgender male for the first time was a very impactful thing in my life."\u000a\u000aThe experience gives him a better understanding of how other people think, he said. "I think it just tells me more about others and how to act with them and respect them in different ways."\u000a\u000aReed, who's also 12 and participated in the workshop, said it's very helpful to meet and talk with someone who is transgender or watch them in a video.\u000a\u000a"It's not just like learning from maybe people who don't know that much about that," she said. "You're learning from people who have experienced it."\u000a\u000a'Just Google it'\u000a\u000aLogan Levkoff is a sexuality educator who has taught and designed many of the sex education programs used in private schools throughout New York City and the surrounding areas. She is also the mother of Maverick and an 8-year-old daughter. Gender is a constant conversation in their household.\u000a\u000a"We've always spent a lot of time talking about what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl and maybe more importantly, the fact that there is not one definition of boy and girl and anything in between," said Levkoff, author of "Got Teens? The Doctor Moms' Guide to Sexuality, Social Media and Other Adolescent Realities."\u000a\u000aShe has told her kids that every person has the right to experience life the way they see fit, in a way that best reflects who they are. "And sometimes that means not feeling like a boy or not feeling like a girl or feeling like something else entirely," she said.\u000a\u000aHer advice for parents, when it comes to how and when to start talking to kids about what it means to be transgender and gender in general, is to first figure out what exactly they want their kids to know and then recognize what their own limitations are and the gaps in their own knowledge.\u000a\u000a"The likelihood is that for a lot of parents, they may not have any personal experience, which means that you have to get some information and education and also be willing to tell your child, if they have a question for you, to say, 'You know what, I don't know what the answer is, but I'm going to find it out for you,' " said Levkoff.\u000a\u000aHennessy, who grew up in Maui, Hawaii, at a time when there was no dialogue about being transgender, said parents should absolutely take time to learn more about it.\u000a\u000a"Just Google it. Google transgender. Google transsexual. Google tranny, and it won't take that long," he said. "Just learn a little bit. All you've got to do is start. You don't have to learn everything all at once ... It's a lot simpler than people try to make it, so we have all these definitions and words to define things, but it's really super simple. ... We overthink it."\u000a\u000aHennessy didn't hear the term transgender until roughly five years ago. Before that, he always felt "off," he said. "I felt totally born wrong since day one." Ashamed about being in a woman's body, he had bound his breasts ever since he started developing. "I would wear two sports bras and one of my dad's extra-large shirts ... and any time the wind blew up against me, I would pull my shirt up off of my chest."\u000a\u000aHow parents can learn from their kids\u000a\u000aLike Levkoff, Hennessy can't emphasize enough how the more honest and open you are with your child about sexuality and gender, the better.\u000a\u000a"I say, as soon as they start asking you, answer the questions, no matter how old they are, as soon as they start asking you, because if you don't answer them, someone else will, and you can choose what they hear first," he said. "It takes the mysticism out of sex. It takes the pervertedness out of sex."\u000a\u000a"There are some young kids who are really capable of some really sophisticated thought about gender and sexuality, and there are some adults who are completely incapable of having a mature conversation, so age doesn't determine whether or not someone can handle this, but I think it's important for parents to remember that from the time our kids are born, how we dress them, how we allow them to express themselves, how we allow other people to talk to them or the assumptions they make about them, are all little doses of education about gender and expression," she said.\u000a\u000aWhat is clear, at least from the video featuring Hennessy and the Hatch participants, is that there's a lot parents can learn from kids, especially about topics such as gender.\u000a\u000a"I think parents should learn from kids, because kids are more exposed to all this stuff now ... and parents, their generation wasn't as exposed," said Reed, one of the young participants. "It shouldn't just be kids learning from parents. It should go all ways."\u000a\u000aLevkoff said she is "constantly amazed" at how "color- and gender-blind" today's kids are. "And by the way, not all of them, because they are a product of us," she said. "But their default setting isn't to be intolerant. Their default setting is to just be open, and that's really an incredible thing to watch."\u000a\u000aJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\u000a\u000aHennessy said most parents teach their kids to love equally and to eschew racism. He hopes they will also find ways to teach them to be open and accepting of another person's gender.\u000a\u000a"When someone is coming to you with something that is different from your experience, just give them a chance to tell their side and believe them and don't try to change them, because by trying to change them, you're telling them that their existence isn't good enough," Hennessy said.
